   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Suspended Anaheim Mighty Ducks defenseman
Ruslan Salei said he tried to contact Dallas' Mike Modano through
the National Hockey Players Association, but said he didn't get a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad when it happened, I felt sorry for him,'' said
Salei, who was suspended 10 games for pushing Modano into the
boards in last Saturday's game in Dallas. ``I just wanted him to
hear it from my mouth. I wasn't trying to hurt anybody, I felt real
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Salei explained he probably could get Modano's number on his
own, but doesn't want to force the issue if the Dallas center
doesn't want to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Salei's character has taken a lot of hits this week. Dallas
coach Ken Hitchcock has called him ``a stupid player'' and Brett
Hull said his passport should be taken away. But the Anaheim
defenseman said it's nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already got this bad reputation,'' he said when asked if
was concerned about his image. ``But I can't be concerned about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salei, however, did admit he is concerned about losing his
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'll be all right,'' he said. ``The first couple of
practices (after the suspension) I was afraid to touch anybody . .
. I was backing off.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the talk of revenge it was Modano who had a press
release posted in the Dallas dressing room Thursday asking his
teammates to keep their cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling on my teammates to set an example for all
players,'' Modano said. ``I'm looking forward to getting back on
the ice and playing as soon as possible, but not to getting even.
More importantly, I don't want anyone getting even on my behalf.
Somewhere along the road, players have lost respect for one another
and the sport, and that is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the message was dramatically different than the
anger the Stars displayed after Modano and Darryl Sydor were
injured last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two wrongs don't make a right and we know that,'' Dallas
defenseman Richard Matvichuk told a Dallas newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But the bad feelings certainly aren't going to go away as Stars
defenseman Shawn Chambers made perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be this game,'' Chambers said. ``We're
going to play them four more times. You never forget things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Speaking of things teams and fans never forget, Gary Suter
will likely face Paul Kariya on Monday for the first time since he
cross-checked the Mighty Ducks' captain in February 1998 while a
member of the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya missed the remainder of the '97-98 season with
post-concussion syndrome. Suter, now with San Jose, missed the
entire '98-99 season due to a shoulder injury and staph infection.

M'SHOOGY'S EMERGENCY ANIMAL RESCUE IS A TWO-PERSON LABOR OF LOVE _
AND ENDLESS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ Every dog at M'Shoogy's Emergency Animal
Rescue has a name. All 583 of them. And Lisa Silverglat knows
almost every one.
</P>
<P>
   She hurries down the gravel path to the feed barn. It's after 4
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know when I'm late,'' she says, walking quickly past the
cacophony. ``I try to be on time for them. After what they've been
through, it's the least I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   She hoists a 50-pound bag of dog food from the mountain of bags
towering to the ceiling. With her right hand, she slices one bag
with a knife. Her left hand tilts the bag. Brown nuggets rain into
a 5-gallon bucket.
</P>
<P>
   One filled. Twenty-three more to go.
</P>
<P>
   M'Shoogy's, which is just outside St. Joseph, is a no-kill haven
where animals live out their lives, without a time limit, even if
no one adopts them.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglat, 42, and her husband, Gary Silverglat, 58, the
owners, discovered years ago that a rescued animal that got a home
became a friend for life.
</P>
<P>
   So they gave the animals theirs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 they opened their home, their land and their wallets to
helping thousands of animals society had thrown away or cast off.
Here are pets that humans discarded as easily as dumped trash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their work in adopting out more than 26,000 animals in
13 years, and making sure that all adopted animals are spayed or
neutered, new animals keep arriving.
</P>
<P>
   And more work needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa and I can't do any more by ourselves,'' said Gary. ``We
need help. We have ideas, ideas that could work, but we need people
to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's exhausting work. The Silverglats begin feeding animals at 8
a.m., break near noon, start again at 4 p.m. and finish four hours
later. They do this seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 13 years since they have taken a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a job few people would choose to do. Not even avowed
animal-loving volunteers stay with them long. Feeding, watering,
deworming and disinfecting is too hard. Too demanding.
</P>
<P>
   At times, even dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to pet Scarface. He tried to get Gary once,'' warned
Lisa, who knows these animals' temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Scarface is kept in a pen with 26 other dogs. A 50-pound black
chow with curly fur, he stands aloof. He's the dominant dog of this
pack. When he eyes visitors, his face seems to beg for an
``atta-boy'' pat.
</P>
<P>
   Until he turns his head.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an eye on the other side, there's an angry red gash.
Underneath his furry cheek, his bone is concaved, pock-marked. He
has no floppy left ear, just a round nub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone tried to blow him away with a shot gun,'' said Lisa
swishing water into his bowl. ``He was a bloody pulp when we got
him. I didn't think he was going to make it. He's one of the only
dogs here who hasn't forgiven humans.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the animals at M'Shoogy's Emergency Animal Rescue do
turn the other cheek and often become great pets, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about how many animals are walking around now because
of us, and it makes me happy,'' Lisa said. ``There are literally
thousands. I have a whole file cabinet full of dogs and cats
adopted out. But some days, all this seems too much.''
A spiritual occupation
</P>
<P>
   M'Shoogy's is a 20-acre haven with 150 dog runs, several barns,
a two-story stone building, another building for adoptions, several
pastures, ponds and an atrium housing 40 cats.
</P>
<P>
   The Silverglats named their no-kill shelter M'Shoogy's because
the word is a Yiddish variation meaning ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the daily feedings and waterings don't make you crazy,
listening to 600 dogs bark at once will,'' Lisa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Silverglats' no-kill facility was a cutting-edge idea 13
years ago. Today no-kill operations are sweeping the country, said
Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People in Clinton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``M'Shoogy's is well-known among animal people,'' he said. ``I
know people who have traveled there to see how they do it. The
Silverglats set their shelter up without any help from anyone. It's
a model for how a no-kill operation should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the largest no-kill facility outside of Utah and
Texas. No one else compares to what they're doing. It's also
extraordinary that they're doing it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other no-kill shelters in the United States include the late
Cleveland Amory's Black Beauty Ranch in Texas and a shelter called
Best Friends in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``But neither one of those places rescues animals themselves.
Gary and Lisa do,'' Clifton said. ``Their kind of lifestyle
commitment is very much like monks and nuns, bordering on a
spiritual occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnessing the traumas of animals has made the Silverglats
intolerant of lukewarm help from others. They acknowledge that they
are zealots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain why we do this,'' Lisa said. ``Even the
meanest, rottenest, whatever dog that no one else can get near will
still come over to me. I don't know why or how, but we connect with
them. We just love animals, and they love us back. I guess we're
obsessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ``spiritual occupation'' includes donning yellow plastic
gloves in the morning and picking up by hand all dog feces,
checking it for worms and blood.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just providing animals the basics _ a clean living
area, healthy food and fresh water _ are chores that cannot be done
mindlessly. The Silverglats have only one employee.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of running M'Shoogy's is also a never-ceasing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rescues often mean hundreds of dollars in veterinarian bills,
adding to the thousands of dollars in bills for spaying and
neutering. And the monthly food bill is about $5,100.
</P>
<P>
   The money to run the shelter comes from their own pockets, with
neither Silverglat taking a salary.
</P>
<P>
   Gary said he had made a fortune from retail stores in the 1960s,
``but our money is not unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry we'll run out. It's tough. We need people. Helping
hands from people who care about animals, too.''
Beyond words
</P>
<P>
   Every animal at the shelter represents an instance of the
Silverglats' devotion. Devotion that bewilders even the
Silverglats.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gary cares so much because of an illness he had at age
16. After he almost died that year, he said, all of life became
sacred to him.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps he cares so much about animals because he knows what
it's like to be persecuted, he said. Silverglat is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm sure about is that I can't stand for anything to
needlessly suffer,'' he said. ``When you're an ethnic person and
you're raised in a hostile environment, you get a second sense for
these things. Whether it's kids or animals I can't stand to see
injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa shares Gary's love of animals but not his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Some days the endless chores of feeding, watering, deworming,
disinfecting and caring get to her. Sometimes, it's too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I started sobbing, because, well, I have to do it
all over again,'' she said. ``It shouldn't be this hard to do
something so good. But it is.''
</P>
<P>
   On those days when she dreams of never filling another dog dish,
she makes a point to visit some of her furry friends.
</P>
<P>
   There's Scarface, wagging his tail and watching her with his one
good eye.
</P>
<P>
   There's Duke, a golden retriever mix who once had three broken
legs but now walks well.
</P>
<P>
   One-Eyed Willy squints out from his cage and purrs at Lisa. A
gray tabby, he lost his eye and his tail when a car ran over him
and he was left for dead.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Wee-Wee. Lisa always cuddles him a little extra.
</P>
<P>
   As a 1-year-old, he was thrown from a car on Interstate 29. His
beagle body caught on the car's side, tumbled beneath its wheels
and was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't die.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous truckdriver witnessed the horror. He stopped and
scooped up the quivering puppy, delivering his broken body to
M'Shoogy's.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa stayed up with the dog all night, making sure he had water.
Giving him medicine. Things she does often with injured animals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, although Wee-Wee walks oddly, and urinates with every
step, he's one of M'Shoogy's extra special dogs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how he grins,'' she said, scratching his ears.
</P>
<P>
   His muzzle curls around his teeth, he begins to pant and, sure
enough, it flits slowly into...a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at them, I know this is worth it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are quiet now, all 583 of them. Lisa smiles, looking
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about animals that goes beyond words into a
deeper level of understanding. They've taught that to me.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like migraine sufferers scrambling for aspirin, the
Mets needed some soothing on Friday night, and fast. They had spent
the hours preceding game three of the division series trying to
function with simultaneous headaches from Mike Piazza's
inflammatory reaction to a cortisone injection and Bobby
Valentine's inflammatory words in a magazine profile.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was out of the game because his left thumb was stiff and
swollen from an adverse reaction to a cortisone shot he received
Thursday to alleviate pain from a sprained joint at the top of his
thumb. And Valentine was sharing a dugout with players he had said
were not professional and not really intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The New York Mets, behind some clutch hitting by John
Olerud and a six-run sixth-inning splurge, calmed their on- and
off-field nerves with a 9-2 pasting of the Arizona Diamondbacks
that put the Mets one victory from the National League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   With Al Leiter on the mound, the Mets could close out the
division series on Saturday, just eight days after their improbable
resurgence from an earlier, now nearly forgotten headache, began.
</P>
<P>
   After a somnolent loss to the Diamondbacks in Arizona in Game 2,
in which the Mets managed one paltry run, the Mets could smile
again _ at least until they opened a copy of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who Valentine said was only 50-50 for Friday, is usually
at the core of the Mets' powerful offense, but he has been slowed
in this series, perhaps by the ailing thumb, which has bothered him
for at least a week, Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   After game two, Piazza had mentioned how banged up he was _ he
had planned to spend the day with ice all over him _ although he
did not specifically mention the thumb and, indeed, his impact on
this series had been negligible, since he is only 2 for 9 with four
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Benny Agbayani, who usually plays when a left-hander
starts against the Mets, went to bat as the cleanup hitter in
Piazza's absence Friday night, the Mets might have been giving up
plenty in intimidation, but not much in postseason numbers.
Agbayani led off the third inning and slapped a single to right
field off Arizona left-hander Omar Daal. Robin Ventura walked, but
he was taken out on a double-play ball by Shawon Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   With Agbayani on third, Todd Pratt _ Piazza's rarely used backup
_ drew a walk. Then Rey Ordonez got his third hit of the series, a
single to right that scored Agbayani to give the Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added to the lead in the third inning when, with one
out, Edgardo Alfonzo hit a full-count pitch for a double that
curled toward the left field line. Olerud's single to left scored
him and Olerud went to second on the throw from Luis Gonzalez,
which had no chance of getting Alfonzo at home.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani singled to put runners on first and third _ at that
point he had as many hits in this game as Piazza has in the series
_ and Ventura's roller to first base scored Olerud to give the Mets
a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Rick Reed, who pitched a complete game three-hitter
in his start against the Pittsburgh Pirates last Saturday as part
of the Mets' winning streak that got them into the playoffs, rolled
through the first four innings, but Arizona got to him in the fifth
when he threw two bad pitches. Kelly Stinnett led off with a double
that Dunston, playing center field, broke badly on. Turner Ward,
pinch-hitting for Daal, smacked a curveball for a home run into the
right field bullpen to close the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with what the Mets were dealing with, two runs was
pretty harmless. What's a narrow lead when your superstar is
sitting on the bench with the thumb on his catching hand in a
splint and your manager has called five of your teammates losers?
</P>
<P>
   A loss to Arizona, a second-year expansion team that won 100
games this season, would have been understandable under the
circumstances. But it also would have provoked questions about how
critical Piazza's health was to the team's chances to advance and
how much the firestorm surrounding Valentine had distracted his
players.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made all such concerns moot with a six-run sixth
inning, which, appropriately began with a Pratt walk. Bobby Bonilla
was mentioned by name in the Valentine story _ it said Valentine
was worried about the influence Bonilla had on the team _ and
before the game, Bonilla said he was ``disappointed'' that his
manager would say such things. Presumably neither Bonilla nor
Valentine was disappointed when Bonilla drew a walk in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, who had three hits, hit a bloop single to
right field that scored Pratt and a misplay by right fielder Tony
Womack allowed Bonilla to go to third. After Alfonzo walked to load
the bases, and Arizona brought in reliever Dan Plesac, Olerud
smashed a grounder past first base that scored Bonilla and
Henderson. Roger Cedeno, who had pinch-hit for Agbayani in the
fifth inning, singled to score Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored two more runs in that inning. It was padding for
their lead, but it served as a bandage for the throbbing in
Piazza's hand and the nasty sting of Valentine's words.

KANSAS TOWN STRUGGLES WITH DEATHS OF THREE CHILDREN AND MURDER
CHARGES AGAINST THEIR FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINDSBORG, Kan. _ Three stuffed animals, surrounded by small
bouquets of fresh flowers, rest peacefully on the front steps of
the bungalow at the corner of South Main and Union streets.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no one to play with Owl, Piglet and Winnie the
Pooh, and no one to enjoy the colorful flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The three children who lived in the bright teal home with the
white trim are dead, and their father, Christopher E. Jones, is
accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to first-degree murder charges in the deaths of the
children _ Sarah, 2, Joshua, 5, and Christopher, 7 _ he also faces
an aggravated battery charge involving injuries to his wife, Cathy
Jones. She was hurt Wednesday night about 10:30 p.m., shortly
before she ran to a neighbor's home, screaming, ``He is after me.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon she was in fair condition in Lindsborg
Community Hospital, her parents at her bedside.
</P>
<P>
   Her 47-year-old husband was locked in the nearby McPherson
County Jail. Bond was set at $3.5 million. Arraignment will be
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals for the children will be Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. at
Trinity United Methodist Church, across the street from the family
home.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity is the same church where Christopher and Cathy Jones
were married 10 years ago, and where the family that everyone
thought was ``perfect'' attended Sunday services.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Christopher Jones had stood in a church service
and told the congregation that he was thankful Cathy was his wife
and that he thought he was the luckiest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   They joined the neighborhood church only two weeks ago,
transferring their membership from the United Methodist Church in
Waterville, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community is in shock, because they can't understand how
a family that looked so good together, how this could happen,''
said David Smith, pastor at Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came as a complete surprise to Cathy,'' said Smith, who
visited her at the hospital earlier Friday. ``It came out of
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The family had moved back to Lindsborg about six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Jones had once lived here, earning a degree in music
education at Bethany College, the Lutheran-affiliated liberal arts
school at the north end of the town of 3,372.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year the family lived in Winslow, Maine, where
Christopher Jones, who holds a doctorate in forensic science, was
director of Young Laboratories, a private lab, according to
published reports. The parent company later was acquired by
Binax//NEL, and the laboratory in Winslow no longer operates.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Marcoux, an assistant librarian at the Winslow Public
Library, remembers helping Christopher Jones with research journals
for his work, and she remembers him helping the children with
books. All the family members were regular visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Marcoux said Friday. ``They were lovely
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcoux said ``rumors are a dime a dozen'' in town since the
homicides were reported, and she sharply criticized an anonymous
description in the local newspaper that characterized Jones as
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have called him lazy at all,'' she said. ``He was
a very brainy man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had no police record in Winslow, according to a police
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after Jones lost his job in Maine, the family moved
to Lindsborg, where he hoped to start his own business. They moved
into the former home of Cathy Jones' grandmother, Ruby Mayden, who
died in December.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago Cathy Jones got a job as an office assistant for
the Lindsborg Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not going so well with Christopher's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a dream of going into some kind of private
business in Lindsborg,'' Smith said. ``As he pursued avenues of
approach, he felt like doors were not opening and he was a little
despondent about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were problems, however, neighbors did not know about
them.
</P>
<P>
   They saw Christopher as a stay-at-home husband who doted on his
children, often taking them for walks along the tree-lined streets.
He worked hard to keep his lawn in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, 91-year-old Martin Ringstrom, a retired
Lutheran pastor, was watching TV in his living room Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he heard a siren. ``The thought crossed my mind: I
hope it's nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not know how serious it was until the next morning when
he saw the house surrounded by police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ringstrom also said Christopher Jones had been unable to find
employment and that could have weighed on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had probably been building up for some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings left Lindsborg residents in disbelief, particularly
since children were the victims.
</P>
<P>
   At Soderstrom Elementary School, where Christopher was in the
second grade and Joshua in kindergarten, students and faculty were
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of shock and sadness about the kids. They were
characterized by the teachers and principal as `friendly kids,
happy kids,' '' said the school district's superintendent, Marlin
Berry.

``She's lost her children, and she's lost her husband, too.''

   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine was a championship ballroom dancer as
a teen-ager, but his sense of timing could not have been worse this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was the subject of a profile in Sports Illustrated in
which, among other things, he was quoted as saying that his
pitching coach, Dave Wallace, then a member of the front office,
was involved in the decision to dismiss Valentine's hitting coach
and close friend Tom Robson.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the players on the expanded September roster, he
was quoted as saying, ``You're not dealing with real professionals
in the clubhouse'' and ``you're not dealing with real intelligent
guys for the most part'' in explaining why he was concerned about
``five guys in there right now who basically are losers, who are
seeing if they can recruit'' malcontents.
</P>
<P>
   The article also said that Valentine's wife, Mary, had
encouraged him to resign and that those closest to him would be
surprised if he returned as Mets manager next season.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said Friday that there were several inaccuracies in
the article. Among others, he said that his wife had never wanted
him to quit and that he didn't know who would be surprised if he
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has always been the push behind me to continue to do
my best,'' Valentine said. ``I've always said I'd be back unless we
didn't win the wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also said the statements attributed to him about
Wallace were inaccurate. ``He didn't have anything to do with the
firing of the hitting coach and I never said he did. Either I said
it inaccurately or he reported it inaccurately. I think he reported
it inaccurately.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he say it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' Valentine responded.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine did not deny his remarks about his players, which he
made while they held a players-only meeting in Philadelphia during
the team's recent seven-game losing streak. The article said
Valentine was particularly concerned about the influence of Bobby
Bonilla on the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an overall comment I made,'' Valentine said, referring
to his remarks about the players' intelligence. ``I said, `We're
not rocket scientists.' I think I was talking in general. The
question was, `Are you worried about someone having undue
influence?' Of course. That was an expanded roster. That wasn't the
team with us all year. It was people I didn't know very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who did not seem upset about the article, said he
spoke to general manager Steve Phillips about it. Phillips seemed
irritated by it, although he said he would not try to smooth things
over between the manager and his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of timing issues this year,'' Phillips said.
``The timing is not good. It's something Bobby will have to handle
within the confines of the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the players, most of them had either not heard about the
article or had not read it. ``I don't care,'' Rickey Henderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla had a different opinion about the man he has feuded with
throughout the season. ``I'm extremely disappointed,'' he said.
``It's not so much the timing, I'm just disappointed he would say
some things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, asked about the statement that the players aren't
intelligent, responded, ``I knew I should have finished that
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Excitable Fans
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets warmed up before their first postseason game at Shea
Stadium in 11 years, the fans seemed more excited than the players
did, at least on the outside. Even if Mike Piazza would not be in
the lineup, there were dozens of fans clad in his jersey, shouting
encouragement to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be one of the few guys in the locker room to know what
this atmosphere is going to be like,'' said John Franco, who grew
up a Mets fan and was sitting in the stands during the Mets' last
playoff series, against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who played for the Reds at the time, went to the game
with a friend but did not stick around for the outcome. They
departed when Mike Scioscia hit a two-run home run in the ninth
inning off Dwight Gooden to send the game into extra innings. The
Mets lost in 12, creating a 2-2 tie in the series, which the Mets
lost in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Cincinnati in 1988, I came to the playoff game
against the Dodgers, the game Scioscia hit the homer off of Doc,''
Franco recalled. ``When he hit it, we got up and left. My buddy was
sick to his stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night the crowd was loud, beginning with the pregame
introductions, and loyal nearly to a fault, but still booing a
hometown target, Bobby Bonilla, and cheering the former Met Bernard
Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, Saturday's scheduled starting pitcher, who also grew
up nearby as a Mets fan, added: ``I expect it to be crazy and
obviously very supportive for us. We felt it even during the Braves
series in the regular season.''

POLICE OFFICIAL BLAMES NEWS COVERAGE FOR MURDER INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's deputy police commissioner who oversees
crime-fighting strategies contends that negative news coverage has
so intimidated police officers that they are reluctant to patrol
aggressively, and that their reluctance is why murders are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   While Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said in the past year
that negative coverage has hurt the effectiveness of police, none
of his statements has been as strong as the ones made on Thursday
by Edward Norris, the deputy commissioner for operations, who
blamed news coverage for the murder increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not stopping people and being as assertive as we
were,'' Norris said. He blamed news coverage that questions the
official version of events for intimidating and demoralizing police
officers. ``That is why we are seeing the street shootings we had
not seen for years,'' Norris said, speaking at a seminar at the
John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides are up 10 percent so far this year, compared with the
same period last year. Other police officials have said in recent
months, however, that murders linked to domestic violence are
pushing the crime increase, and that is something that police
officers, demoralized or not, can do little to prevent. Those
officials are now saying that street crimes are contributing to the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney,
Charles Hynes, whose office has established a task force to study
the homicide rise in that borough, said the increase in murders
appears to be caused by a rise in both domestic violence and street
shootings. ``We feel that people who may have hesitated to carry a
gun in prior years seem to have lost that hesitation,'' Davitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, the police official in charge of the office that advises
Safir on anti-crime strategies and coordinates the program that
holds commanders responsible for crime in their precincts and
boroughs, was specifically critical of coverage in The New York
Times. He did not cite specific articles.
</P>
<P>
   He said that coverage ``particularly in The Times, has led
people to believe that we are a brutal, horrible agency that is
stopping crime by stomping on people's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that anyone skeptical of his conclusion ask police
officers ``if they want to be the next guy to get involved in one
of these incidents where the shooting is questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, Norris said, is that ``instead of doing what we
should do, and see how the facts weigh out in court, as we used to
do, and we should do in this society _ and everyone else gets that
privilege _ every time a police officer gets involved in something
he is convicted in the media the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris' comments came four days after Safir attacked The Times
for an article that found sharp differences between the
commissioner's initial account of the September shooting by police
of a hammer-wielding mentally ill man in Brooklyn, and the findings
of investigators preparing the case for a Brooklyn grand jury. The
investigators believe the man was not striking a sergeant with his
hammer or even in physical contact with police when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The Times, said Friday
that it was unfair for Norris to blame news coverage for the rise
in murders. ``We weren't given credit for lowering the murder rate
when we were writing about the Giuliani administration's
innovations,'' Lelyveld said. ``I don't think that it is fair to
blame us when we begin writing about some of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the deputy commissioner got carried away with
himself,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, including Safir, have complained for months
about news coverage that they say is causing officers to become
more timid. Safir has said that the criticism of police has
intensified since the killing in February of Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed West African immigrant, who was shot 19 times by four
Street Crime Unit officers in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Norris said that arrests that would take guns off
the street were down because of news coverage. He said arrests have
dropped to 286,651 so far this year, compared with 311,578 at this
point last year, an 8 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming feeling on patrol, and you know this as well
as anybody else, stop-and-frisk arrests are down,'' Norris added.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit, which makes up about one percent of the
force, in previous years made 20 percent of the gun-possession
arrests. Norris said those numbers were down, although specific
numbers were not available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's stop-and-frisk policies have been a source of
contention among leaders in predominantly minority communities who
say officers would stop people for no reason. After the Diallo
killing, Safir placed the Street Crime Unit officers in uniform. He
is now allowing some to return to plain clothes.

EDITORIAL: THE VIEW FROM CITY HALL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   New York's City Hall Park sparkled on its opening day with new
plantings and the old Jacob Wrey Mould fountain dragged back from
Crotona Park in the Bronx and restored. The renovation paid
attention to historical details, returning the public space south
of City Hall to its original geometry, with fixtures such as the
fountain lights and the park's new fence modeled on the originals.
But the restoration does not change the fact that the new park is
utterly cut off from City Hall by chains and guards.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has imposed tight
restrictions on the use of the steps and plaza in front of City
Hall for public rallies and demonstrations. Now the public is
prevented from walking from the park to those areas in front of
City Hall. City Council Speaker Peter Vallone boycotted the park
dedication ceremony because, he says, Giuliani should have
increased public access to City Hall after the park construction
was finished.
</P>
<P>
   For years the City Hall steps and plaza have provided public
spaces for those who wished to address city policies. Giuliani
argues that security requires him to tightly control use of those
public areas.
</P>
<P>
   His policies, however, seem designed to control some groups but
not others. The rules restrict groups seeking to hold rallies in
front of City Hall to 50 people. Yet the policy allows
city-approved or -sponsored events to be exempt from that rule,
thus giving the government the final say over who must abide by the
numerical limits.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor allowed more than 5,000 people to gather to celebrate
the Yankees' 1998 World Series victory in the same spot where other
groups that do not have the mayor's support are limited to 50
participants.
</P>
<P>
   A case challenging the constitutionality of this policy is now
in federal district court before Judge Harold Baer. The court has
already rejected an earlier policy that limited demonstrations to
25 people. No one would argue with measures that are carefully
designed to meet real security threats. But the First Amendment
grants the highest level of protection to political speech in
public places. It puts the burden on government to show that any
limits placed on such speech are narrowly tailored to address
significant government concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will have to show in court how greatly
restricting the use of the space around City Hall meets those
criteria. It must also demonstrate that exemptions are applied
fairly to all groups. City Hall Park does not now feel as if it is
part of City Hall. But it does give the public a nice place to view
their seat of government from afar.

CONSTRUCTION SEES RIVETING SURGE IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An uptick in highway and heavy construction plus
a surge of projects in Southern California helped boost
construction activity across California 13.4 percent during the
first eight months of this year, an industry tracker said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The growth to $33 billion in construction is being driven in
part by a 21.7 percent increase in residential activity, a pace
that will likely result in about 144,000 new units being built this
year, said Burbank-based Construction Industry Research Board. The
residential construction includes single-family homes, condominiums
and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the residential growth came in the seven county Southern
California region, with San Diego leading the way in total units,
said Ben Bartolotto, the research board's director.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County also turned in a robust performance as
builders pulled permits for 8,875 units, up 27.9 percent on an
annual basis, during the year's first eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita Valley led the way in Los Angeles County with
1,145 units, an annual increase of 57 percent, Bartolotto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a lot of work going on right now, though
I'm not sure how long it will last,'' he said. ``It's an old story.
This region took longer to recover, and in recent months there are
indications that (activity) is slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Southern California is leading the surge in residential
construction across the state, the pace is still not brisk enough
to satisfy demand for new housing.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Finance housing forecast for 1999
matches that of the research boards. Bottom line: Construction
increases are good news but not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, to be honest with you,'' said Ted Gibson,
the finance department's chief economist. ``The state was building
a quarter of a million units a year in the second half of the 1980s
and we are just a long way from there now.''
</P>
<P>
   The local numbers reflect Gibson's dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita is expected to finish the year with about 2,600
new housing units. But that is far below the 6,750 units built
there in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That means homes are going to be more expensive in the future.
For example, the median price in some Northern California
communities is now about $400,000, he noted, because of a tight
market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nonresidential building is up 7.4 percent and highway
and heavy construction is up 2 percent during the first eight
months of the year on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report marked only the second time this year that this
sector has been in the plus column for month-to-month and
year-to-date comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason is the influx of new federal funding due to a new
federal act that is expected to generate $800 million for a variety
of projects during the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The research board is forecasting the heavy construction sector
to bring in $7.6 billion in 1999, up 2.3 percent from 1998. This
will be the first positive gain in this sector since 1995.

MANAGED CARE MISHMASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bill that passed the US House this week to protect patients
in managed care plans contained so much junk that it must have been
designed by the House leadership not to become law. Still, hidden
in the bill are provisions that, if stripped out and passed
separately, would provide sound protection for patients without
disrupting the tax code or providing disguised subsidies for
medical activities Congress should not regulate.
</P>
<P>
   A managed care bill ought to feature:
</P>
<P>
   --Requirements for internal and external review of health plan
decisions that patients or physicians consider unwise. Doctors must
be free to advise their patients honestly without fear of
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   --A provision that a patient can be treated in any hospital
emergency room in a medical crisis, even if the hospital is not
part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   --A provision that a patient should have access to specialist
care if he or she has a serious medical condition that warrants
such treatment and a mandate that if a plan drops a physician from
its network, an ill patient would not be forced to seek a new
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are in the House bill _ and, unfortunately, much
more, including the most controversial provision, which would allow
patients to sue plans for malpractice. The House bill would bar a
patient from seeking punitive damages if the plan could prove it
relied on an independent review board in making a decision on
coverage. This is a sensible exception that ought to encourage
plans to arrange for impartial and quick-acting external reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the bill, however, made a mistake when they mandated
that managed care plans pay the ``routine costs'' of clinical
trials for critically ill patients. These costs are far from
routine if they involve expensive hospitalization. Also, this bill
is no place to impose federal regulation on an extremely complex
subject. The matter of how much society ought to pay _ through
direct government subsidy or insurance premiums _ for what is
essentially scientific experimentation is one that deserves lengthy
scrutiny and a separate piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the bill dip their toes into another complex issue
as well: the extent to which plans should use ``formularies,'' or
preferred lists of drugs, instead of allowing doctors to prescribe
whatever they believe is necessary. The bill mandates that health
plans make exceptions to the formularies when medically necessary,
an elusive standard that would mean more work for the independent
review board.
</P>
<P>
   By itself this section, though unnecessary, would do no harm.
Its great weakness is that it does not address the urgent issue of
how plans can be expected to pay the high costs of drugs when
pharmaceutical firms are free to advertise their latest inventions
to consumers and when companies refuse to accept any government
role in setting prices.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care bill could easily have been trimmed into a
sound piece of legislation if not for a gambit by members of the
the House Republican leadership. Under the guise of reducing the
number of people without medical insurance, they added several
changes in the tax code that would benefit wealthier individuals
and companies with medical interests. They know that President
Clinton will veto the bill if it ever reaches his desk. The
House-Senate conference committee should spare him the task by
excising the tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The most costly of them is a tax reduction for health insurance
premiums paid by people who do not have company-subsidized health
insurance. This makes some sense, since companies are allowed to
deduct their enormous premium costs from their tax bills. But the
proposal has nothing to do with managed care improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the uninsured do not make much money and cannot
afford insurance premiums even with a tax reduction, the proposal
would do little to provide them with health coverage. Most of the
people taking the deduction would be affluent enough to afford
insurance without the need of a tax break. A plan proposed by
presidential candidate Bill Bradley to offer direct premium
subsidies to low-income workers would do much more to reduce the
number of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Republicans' add-ons, the bill will probably not
pass this year. But managed care remains a vexing issue for many
Americans. The elements of a sound bill are within reach if
Congress has the will to pass one.

AN IMPOVERISHED FOREIGN AID BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the furor that surrounds the debate on foreign aid each
year, it is easy to forget that it represents just 1 percent of all
federal spending. The Republican-controlled Congress, wanting to
slash foreign aid even further, sent President Clinton a shamefully
inadequate spending plan this week that mocks US claims to be a
power for good in the world. The president would be well justified
in vetoing the plan and sending Congress back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   An isolationist strain is running strong through Congress and
much of the public. But an examination of the programs cut by
Congress in the foreign operations budget highlights their
importance. For example, the proposed budget would eliminate 100
percent of the funds to implement the Wye River accords, which are
still the best hope for peace in the Middle East. It would slash
funding nearly in half for peacekeeping commitments in Kosovo,
Bosnia, and Croatia. Itwould cut by 21 percent funding for
counterterrorism programs and efforts to curb the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   This does not even begin to count the ``humanitarian'' side of
foreign spending. The proposal sent to Clinton would slash
international disaster aid, the Peace Corps, AIDS prevention,
family planning programs, and environmental initiatives on matters
ranging from global warming to safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   With this budget Congress also dismisses out of hand the debt
forgiveness plan agreed upon at a June meeting of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations in Cologne. The budget would underfund
by over 90 percent the effort to relieve the international debt
that is crippling poor nations and destabilizing their governments.
The G7 relief plan is a historic opportunity to restructure foreign
aid to poor countries, specifying that funds be used for health,
education, and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is not just about the niceties of protocol. It is
essential to the national interest and the national defense. In an
interdependent world, such efforts must be advanced, not strangled.

RANGERS MIGHT HAVE PROFITED FROM LOSING CLEMENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The debate continues over ``The Big Picture
vs. The Big Pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' failure to acquire right-hander Roger Clemens in
February might be the best trade general manager Doug Melvin never
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's best in the long run that we didn't make it,''
Melvin said. ``It might have been OK in the short run, but you can
get into a lot of trouble making short-term decisions. Who knows,
though? He might have performed better down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending World Series champion New York Yankees will send
the five-time Cy Young Award recipient to the mound tonight at The
Ballpark in Arlington for Game 3 of the best-of-five Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens could be the person who paints the finishing touches on
the Yankees' second consecutive three-game postseason sweep of the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario drips with irony considering the Rangers came
within a bang-bang play at first of acquiring Clemens from the
Toronto Blue Jays for center fielder Ruben Mateo and right-handers
Esteban Loaiza and Jonathan Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers turned their attention toward Clemens after failing
to lure left-hander Randy Johnson to Arlington, despite offering a
four-year contract worth $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he was certainly one of the two premier starting
pitchers that Doug and I talked at length about trying to interest
in coming here,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be best for the Rangers that their bid failed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   The slide. Clemens went 41-13 with a 2.33 earned-run average en
route to Cy Young Awards Nos. 4 and 5 during his final two seasons
with the Blue Jays, but the former University of Texas standout
slipped to 14-10 with a 4.60 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   The top two members of the Rangers' rotation _ right-handers
Aaron Sele (18-9, 4.79) and Rick Helling (13-11, 4.84) _ had
similar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more surprised than anybody else when he doesn't do
well,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``The reason I feel he will
do well _ and I've always felt that way _ is what he's brought to
the table all these years. You win five Cy Youngs. Understand you
don't forget that. You don't fall off the end of the earth that
quickly after winning one last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palmeiro Factor. The Rangers ``might not be in the
postseason today'' without designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro,
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit .324 with 47 home runs and 148 runs batted in and
likely will merit serious consideration for the AL Most Valuable
Player Award. It would have been difficult for the Rangers' payroll
to support the salaries of Palmeiro, who signed a five-year
contract worth $45 million, and the remaining $16.1 million owed
Clemens for the 1999 and 2000 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether that would have happened,'' Melvin said.
``I might have had to do something else to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Money plus talent: The Rangers also would have been forced to
part with Mateo, whom the organization views as a future All-Star
waiting to blossom, for a 37-year-old pitcher who can demand a
trade this winter after being dealt during the midst of a multiyear
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Melvin favored acquiring Clemens at the time
``even though it might not have been the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say, `No,' to it,'' Melvin said. ``Toronto said,
`No,' to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays accepted the Yankees' offer of left-handers David
Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about being the GM is that you've got to look at
the big picture,'' Melvin said. ``You've got to look at the long
term and the short term and balance one against the other.''

HURRICANES CAN'T STOP FLUTIE'S MAGICAL PASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 36-year-old Gerard Phelan is introduced to people the
introductions usually conclude this way, ``That's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, 1984, ``the guy'' was a rain-soaked Boston College
receiver standing on a tattered Miami 48-yard line with six seconds
remaining as BC trailed the defending national champion Miami
Hurricanes, 45-41.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hurricanes celebrated their apparent victory, Phelan's
roommate, quarterback Doug Flutie, called flood-tip for the game's
final play. Eight-point-three seconds later, Phelan would attain
college football immortality and become ``the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Flutie passed for 472 yards and three touchdowns
and virtually assured himself of the Heisman Trophy, this game _
and arguably his career _ is defined by these final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Against a Hurricanes defense that included future NFL stars
Jerome Brown, Daniel Stubbs, Kevin Fagan, Winston Moss and Bennie
Blades, Flutie was flushed from the pocket by Brown as time ran out
and uncorked a pass from his own 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think they thought Doug could throw the ball
that far,'' BC coach Jack Bicknell said.
</P>
<P>
   All the while Phelan and Miami defensive backs Darrel
Fullington, Tolbert Bain and Ken Calhoun back-peddled near the goal
line before the Miami trio jumped simultaneously for the ball at
the 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brown ball against a black night, it's raining, there's
a sea of bodies in front of me and for a second I couldn't see
it,'' said Phelan, who caught 11 passes for 226 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   They shielded Phelan from the ball until it came down into his
body. Suddenly, Phelan _ and the ball _ were in the end zone with
no time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't tip it which made it harder because that ball was
really coming hard,'' Phelan said. ``It hit me below the face mask
and I grabbed it as it rolled down my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   His catch gave No. 10 BC a that-didn't-just-happen 47-45 victory
over the No. 12 Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Phelan is a sales representative living in Boston with
three children of his own, including 8-year-old and 6-year-old sons
who know their dad's famous catch and have friends who run that
play in backyard games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special memory for me,'' Phelan said. ``It would have
been awful had I dropped it and I turned into a Buckner-esque
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Phelan was immediately mobbed by BC teammates while the
Hurricanes were surrounded by disbelieving stares and broken
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it doesn't take away that sick feeling, but they have
nothing to be ashamed of because they gave it all they had,''
first-year coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``It's just a shame that the
final score wasn't a few seconds earlier.''

UNSOUND SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People want to believe in magic, and they often find it in
misinterpreted science. The supposed ``Mozart effect'' has pregnant
women standing close to stereo speakers so their babies can hear
music that will make them smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the original research made no claims about
general intelligence or about infants, in the womb or in the crib.
The 1993 University of Wisconsin study merely found that adults
answering spatial relationship questions on an IQ test had a
temporary boost in their scores after listening to 10 minutes of a
Mozart piano concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting, yes, and worth further exploration, but not a
prelude for the baby music madness that has spawned an industry of
CD and videotape sales and even prompted some states to send new
mothers home from the hospital with free samples of classical
music.
</P>
<P>
   Like all science, the University of Wisconsin report was the
beginning of a journey that more research will advance, either by
disproving or corroborating all or part of the original findings.
Harvard psychologist Christopher Chabris has done studies showing
that Mozart has a minimal impact on test scores, while physicist
Gordon Shaw at the University of California-Irvine has data that
support the Wisconsin paper.
</P>
<P>
   For now they're both right. But an impatient public, eager for
absolutes, does not take the time to digest complexities. People
want quick fixes and believe that the miracles of science _ which
can replace human organs, change genetic destiny, and make babies
in test tubes _ must surely have the formula to enhance brain
power.
</P>
<P>
   Well-meaning parents treat their children like pots of stew,
dropping in what the experts have supposedly shown to be the
ingredients for greatness. People tinker with themselves on the
basis of such informational fragments, gulping down vitamins,
embracing the latest herb craze, or overexercising because of a new
study with ``the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no one answer, and there is no magic. In science,
as in daily living, success depends on an open mind and common
sense.

EDITORIAL: FIRST AUTUMN FIRE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   One day last spring, the fire in the kitchen woodstove went out
and was never relit. I didn't record the date, because some endings
are lost in a crowd of beginnings, passing unnoticed until months
later, when the oversight seems almost melancholy. So I note here
the first fire of the new season: Monday, October 4, thermometer
lodged in the mid-40s, a chill in the bones of the house, rain
falling hard through dwindling yellow hickory leaves.
</P>
<P>
   When the kindling caught the first dry log _ a length of honey
locust _ in its flames, the stove called all the dogs. They
sprawled across the warm tiles, mouths agape. Not a half-hour had
ticked away, and there we were, back on the night before the fire
went out for the last time last spring.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of accounting has been going on here for the past few
weeks, how many pounds of honey gathered, how many bales of hay
laid up in the barn-loft, how many cords of wood stacked and under
cover. This is such an ancestral satisfaction _ the antithesis of
the city's constant abundance _ that it feels almost embarrassing
to acknowledge it, the sign of the hayseed. But even here, where
farms are few now, a sense of harvest clings to the rural landscape
like the sudden mist that forms in the mornings when the mercury
first rises. The manure pile, steaming in the cool drizzle, looks
like simple wealth, and so do the hickory nuts that crack beneath
my feet as I walk to the barn and the milkweed pods that crowd
against the fenceline, ready to burst. There is a fine crop of
horsehair coming in on the mares and the gelding. It will go to
make bird nests in spring.
</P>
<P>
   In April, what you see are your own intentions. In October you
see their unexpected wreck and fulfillment. All summer, potato
vines spread across a corner of the garden. But when I lifted a
plant, hoping to rob new potatoes, I saw that the vines, every one,
had rotted right at the soil. Meanwhile, two peach trees _ planted
vainly, I thought, by previous owners _ blossomed heavily and set
fruit. When September came, the peaches turned as red as the
Virginia creeper is turning now. I finally picked one, just to
savor my doubts. But it was the very promise of a peach. A garden
is so full of cheap sermons.

UNWELCOME STUDENTS IN VERMONT

<P>
   Norwich University, a private military college in Vermont,
should end its training program for students from the Indonesian
Army and its infamous special forces unit known as Kopassus.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, after a UN-supervised referendum in which the East
Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence, the world watched
in horror as so-called militias formed and directed by the
Indonesian Army, in particular by officers from Kopassus, murdered
defenseless civilians, among them priests and nuns. They put whole
villages to the torch and displaced almost the entire population of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reacted by suspending all military cooperation
with Indonesia. This was the least Washington could do to
dissociate Americans from the murders, rapes, and arson supervised
by an Indonesian officer class that had benefited from joint
training and exercises with the US military.
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwich program, which amounts to an evasion of the
administration's ban on military cooperation with Indonesia, has
not been curtailed. In a letter last week to Defense Secretary
William Cohen, two Democratic members of Congress, Representative
James McGovern of Massachusetts and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa,
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were deeply disturbed to read in the Oct. 4, 1999, Boston
Globe about Indonesian Army recruits being trained at Norwich
University in Vermont at a time when President Clinton has declared
all US relations with the Indonesian military have been effectively
suspended. . . . We believe this training of Indonesian military
recruits who openly identify themselves as part of Kopassus is in
direct violation of congressional prohitions on US military
assistance and training of military committing human rights
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, McGovern and Harkin asked Cohen to ``investigate and
identify all members of the Indonesian military, including
recruits, who are studying in the United States'' and have them
returned to Indonesia. The presence of such students at Norwich
University defiles that institution, Vermont, and the cause of
human rights.

SYSTEM WORKS FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The Kings arrived here during rush hour
Friday afternoon, which was fine because they were in no hurry.
Practice was canceled. The Washington Capitals, tonight's opponent,
were in Buffalo playing the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   And after four games in six days, they were able to savor all
the elements of Thursday night's 5-2 victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings scored four power-play goals, three by Luc Robitaille,
who leads the league with six goals. Last season their power-play
efficiency was 13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Their record is 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, they were able to put the new system of
coach Andy Murray back in place after Wednesday's brutal loss to
the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings came out flat in the first 10 minutes against
Tampa Bay, a few players started to wonder about the carryover
effect of Wednesday's game. The Kings had a 2-1 lead with less than
two minutes to play before allowing three goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have lost this game (vs. Tampa Bay) last year,''
captain Rob Blake said. ``It would have taken awhile to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray has a plan to break with the past. In a lengthy
meeting before Thursday's game, he stressed the players' need to
remain accountable to the team. He also singled out several
players, including Blake, for their poor play against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned it over to his assistants, Dave Tippett and Mark
Hardy, to put the pieces back together.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who runs the club's power-play drills in practice, had
success earlier in the week working on faceoffs with first-line
center Jozef Stumpel. Stumpel is not a strong defensive player, but
he won three faceoffs in the final 20.3 seconds during Monday's
victory over St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good-cop, bad-cop thing and I have no problem with
that,'' Murray said. ``I think our meeting was very constructive. I
am a demanding coach but not a demeaning coach. I expect a lot, but
I am not going to tear into a player just to do it. You have to
bring the positives out of a negative situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said part of Thursday's power-play success was timing. In
the first few games, the Kings often went on the man advantage when
their top line was well into its shift and unable to return right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we couldn't get them on the ice until 30
seconds had passed,'' Murray said. ``In this game, we had them
fresh at the start.''

TALKS CONTINUE ON FORD MOTOR CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers
union and Ford Motor Co. continued their talks over a new labor
contract past a midnight Friday deadline .
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the union told Ford that it would end the
current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Friday and would call a strike if
no agreement had been reached by then on a contract covering
101,000 unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the union are struggling to reconcile Ford's
plans to spin off its giant auto parts unit, Visteon Automotive
Systems, to shareholders. After all, nearly a quarter of Ford's
unionized workers toil in Visteon factories, and they fear that
their jobs and pensions will be less secure in the long run if
Visteon becomes an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   The continuation of the talks suggested that both sides were
eager to reach an agreement without a strike. Local union officials
at Ford's factories waited to hear from the union whether to
strike. Wall Street analysts said that any long shutdown would
quickly result in big losses, particularly because Ford is already
having trouble meeting demand for its high-profit pickup trucks and
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't build them fast enough,'' said Scott F. Merlis, a
managing director and head of the automotive practice at
Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Both DaimlerChrysler AG and General Motors Corp. have already
reached agreements with the union on new, four-year labor contracts
that call for annual raises of 3 percent on top of increases that
nearly compensate for inflation. In addition, workers get a $1,350
signing bonus and sweetened pension benefits.

FAITHFUL JAM CHURCH TO SEE ICON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly 2,000 people came to Our Lady of the Valley
Catholic Church on Friday night, jamming the pews, the choir loft,
the aisles and even the altar to get close to a traveling image of
Our Lady of Guadalupe that has been blessed by the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   They wept and shuddered, and prayed fervently to the beloved
Mexican icon, whose digital image has been drawing large crowds at
Los Angeles churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Eduardo Chavez, the 23-year-old driver
who has been transporting the framed image from church to church in
the back of his Chevy pickup truck. ``One, it's the only one in the
United States; two, we have the largest population of Mexicans
outside of Mexico City in Los Angeles; and three, it's been blessed
by the Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Macias and her mother Graciela held each other and cried
as several men unloaded the image from the truck. Graciela said she
prayed to the image when her 19-year-old daughter was a baby
needing surgery. After Graciela's promise to visit Our Lady of
Guadalupe, doctors told her Nancy no longer needed surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard she was coming here, I said now is the time to
bring her,'' said Graciela Macias, 53, gesturing to Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Our Lady of Guadalupe, who Catholics believe appeared to a
Mexican man and left behind her image on his cloak as a sign, has
come to take on not only religious significance but is also an
emblem of Mexican culture, many said. Victor Villalba, vice
president of public relations for the Pueblo Corporation sponsoring
the tour, said the icon has elicited veneration from more than just
Mexican-Americans on its tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been very eye-opening to me personally is that she
means a lot to a lot of people from a lot of ethnicities,''
Villalba said.
</P>
<P>
   At Our Lady of the Valley, the image was carried into the
church, preceded by a Mexican flag, accompanied by dancers in Aztec
dress and serenaded by mariachis. But Manny Singson, wearing the
traditional Filipino dress shirt known as a barong, said Our Lady
of Guadalupe has appeal beyond Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their culture is the same as our culture,'' Singson said.
</P>
<P>
   The original icon is a poncho worn by a Mexican campesino to
whom the Virgin Mary appeared in 1531, believers say. The woman in
Juan Diego's vision asked him to pick roses to convince a skeptical
bishop to erect a cathedral at Tepeyac in Mexico City. He did and
wrapped them in the poncho. He took the roses back to the bishop,
but underneath the poncho, they had been transformed into the
image.
</P>
<P>
   The original cloak remains visible at the Basilica of Tepeyac,
but even a reproduction draws crowds at every church it's been
taken to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same image,'' said Singson. ``It's the faith here
that we're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The image will remain at Our Lady of the Valley until Sunday,
when it moves to St. Patrick's Church in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said that as he drives the image to its display sites, he
has seen other drivers on the freeway keep pace with him to look at
it in the back of his truck before speeding off.
</P>
<P>
   In his rear-view mirror, he has seen them cross themselves in
prayer.

DESPITE LOSS, D-BACK FANS
 STILL HOPEFUL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By LES POLK 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  NEW YORK _ The Diamond-back ers'
section behind home plate was lost for a while in the din as the
Mets broke open Game 3.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the few, the proud, the Arizona fans who came to Shea
Stadium for Friday (Oct. 8) night's playoff game plan to be back in
force, with Diamondbacks rattles in tow, today (Oct. 9) for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, they said they're proud of their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a great job,'' said Jeanne Miller, catcher Damian
Mill er's wife.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first playoff game in 11 years at the crusty old ball
yard, and a raucous crowd saw the Mets run away with it, 9-2, to
take a 2-1 lead in the National League division series.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the rough outing, the Arizona fans were having a nice
time in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more tame than we thought it would be,'' said Erica
Mantei, wife of reliever Matt Mantei. ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband had never let her come to New York before
because he hates the place.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' group was cau tioned against wearing flashy
Dia mondbacks gear and even told to keep the noisemakers at home,
Jeanne Miller said. Yet they encoun tered little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been very easy here,'' Miller said. ``It's my
first time in New York, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One brave soul in the Diamondbacks cheering section wore his
D-Backs black visiting road cap.
</P>
<P>
   Most were incognito in your basic New York black leather.
</P>
<P>
   Others included an 83-year-old grandmother, two New York cops
from Queens, a Brooklyn man and his son, and three busloads with
the Diamondbacks' official traveling party.
</P>
<P>
   They gave Turner Ward a standing ovation after his pinch-hit
two-run brought the Diamondbacks within one run of the Mets, 3-2,
in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't even give up after the Mets put up six runs in the
sixth inning on four hits and two walks, setting off a jubilant
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK; we're going to take it home and win,'' said Donna
Riley, whose husband, Roger, is in charge of travel for the team.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, even some of the cops keeping an eye on the
Diamondbacks section were high-fiving and celebrat ing an apparent
Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   The official party had a police escort to Shea from their
midtown Manhat tan hotel and praised their treatment everywhere in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been so nice and considerate,'' said Dee
Robbins, who works on team travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more afraid of people jumping in front of the bus on
the street'' than of Mets fans, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Davis, 83, traveled all the way from New Mexico for the
game. Her grandson, Dave, is the team's assist ant trainer.
</P>
<P>
   She flew from El Paso to Baltimore, where she met her daughter,
Punkie Garretson, from Johnstown, Pa. The two of them then rode an
Amtrak train to New York.
</P>
<P>
   They took the subway to the ball park, and were having blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said they couldn't lose if I would come all this way,''
Davis said. ``They better win.''
</P>
<P>
   Garretson went to Opening Day at Bank One Ballpark last year and
travels to see the team when they're on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' she said. ``They've come so far.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Ryan and Eddie Trentin, the New York cops, got their
tickets because Pete's dad chauffeurs Dia mondbacks boss Jerry
Colangelo around New York.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like to see an Arizona-New York Yankees World Series, not
a Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the Mets with a passion,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled: ``I hope nobody tries to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cardinale proudly wore his Diamondbacks cap outside the
park on Casey Stengel Plaza, waiting to pick up his tickets with
his son, Billy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinale, whose father, Phil, played for the Brooklyn Dodgers,
has friends affiliated with the Diamond backs and he's a fan.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a Yankees fan, and can't stand the Mets, adding that
he figured the Diamondbacks would clobber the Mets.

STILL-ACHING KNEE HAS PALMEIRO CONCERNED
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rafael Palmeiro is concerned about his
injured right knee to the point that he is planning to seek an
additional medical opinion after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said he doesn't believe more surgery will be needed,
but he is concerned because the knee hurt worse than expected in
the cold weather of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to get on a rehabilitation program and rebuild my
leg muscles,'' Palmeiro said. ``It definitely bothered me much more
than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro originally injured the knee while working out in the
off-season and underwent arthoscopic surgery on Feb. 10 to repair
torn cartilage. He re-injured the knee in spring training and had a
second operation on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I worried about the long-term effects?'' Palmeiro said.
``You have to be when you have a surgery like that. But I'll tell
you what, if I was told my knee wasn't going to get any better, I
could still go out and play defense. I'll be out there playing for
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more worried about after I get done. Will I be
limping? But I don't think it will be a problem playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro started 129 games at designated hitter and 28 games at
first base this season. Despite the problems, he has had his best
season offensively, hitting .324 with 47 home runs and 148 runs
batted in. Manager Johnny Oates was hoping to use Palmeiro at first
base in New York, but the pain in his knee prevented that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't let that get in the way of what I was trying to do,''
Palmeiro said. ``I played with some pain, but I still played every
day. I just need to build up the leg muscles. For some reason, I
just wasn't able to do that this year.''

RANGERS STILL IN SEARCH OF `BIG BREAK' (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ They're on baseball's version of Death Row,
their last meal is in the microwave but instead of gloom and doom
the Rangers seem downright giddy just to have someone else picking
up the dinner check.
</P>
<P>
   They may be taking this lemons into lemonade theory a little too
far.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't act like players about to play their last
baseball game of the century as they gathered yesterday at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed and chattered around the batting cage, like
baseball players always do. They swung the bat, took groundballs,
stopped for interviews when asked.
</P>
<P>
   For a team just one game away from extinction in the first round
of the American League Division Series _ and perhaps a complete
makeover as an organization _ the Rangers were remarkably at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything to hide from,'' hitting coach Rudy
Jaramillo said, shivering from a fever brought on by the flu-bug
that just won't loosen its grip on the team. ``I still have a lot
of confidence in these guys. They can turn it around like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo snapped his fingers for emphasis. If only it was that
easy. If only the Rangers could snap their fingers and start over,
make those two games in New York disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has come down to this: Roger Clemens vs. Esteban
Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   In Vegas, the oddsmakers are laughing their heads off.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, once upon a time the Rangers regularly did more than hold
their own against Clemens. But it wasn't October and he wasn't
wearing a Yankees uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of failure this time could be wide-reaching
and painful.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, before the Rangers lost 3-1 in Game 2, owner Tom
Hicks said that another early exit from the playoffs would of
necessity bring about an off-season evaluation of the franchise's
overall baseball philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that would include personnel,'' said second
baseman Mark McLemore, who is in the last year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   I would guess so, too.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, third baseman Todd Zeile, center fielder Tom Goodwin
and pitcher Aaron Sele are the Rangers' most prominent potential
free agents. Another collapse against the Yankees almost certainly
will make Hicks and general manager Doug Melvin more inclined to
shake up the team with off-season changes.
</P>
<P>
   Long term, it could even have an effect on how they approach
negotiations with Juan Gonzalez on a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be happy just going to the playoffs every
year,'' Hicks stressed. ``Our goal is to win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   That road, the Rangers have discovered to their dismay, almost
always runs through New York, where the Big Apple seems to be
permanently lodged in their throats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressing,'' said Rafael Palmeiro, going through this with the
Rangers for the first time. ``I see guys pressing a lot and
thinking too much about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can overcome this. We just need one big break.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything has blanketed the Rangers' clubhouse even more
thoroughly than the flu bug, it's The Big Break Theory.
</P>
<P>
   One break, one big hit, one time. Just something to get them
started.
</P>
<P>
   It smacks perilously of a team grasping for straws.
</P>
<P>
   ``One big hit to get us going,'' first baseman Lee Stevens said.
``That's what we need. I've still got a good feeling about this. I
think we can make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they can make a run, they have to score more than one. In
this October or last, they have yet to prove they can do that.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge ahead is daunting. First, beat Clemens, no easy
challenge in and of itself. Then beat David Cone here tomorrow in
Game 4. Then go back to New York and win Game 5 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   If you say it all fast enough, it's like bad-tasting medicine.
You might actually be able to choke most of it down before the
gag-reflex kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' best glimmer of hope yesterday may have actually
come from Yankees manager Joe Torre, who keeps insisting his team
will be taking nothing for granted tonight in Game 3, though why
they wouldn't is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that in a short series, it takes very little to
turn it around for the other team,'' Torre said. ``If takes just
one game and the momentum shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   One game tonight. That's all the Rangers can think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't win three at once,'' manager Johnny Oates cautioned.
``We have to take it one step, one day, at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, McLemore paused a moment to think about tomorrow.
Would there be another game to play?
</P>

WOODSON, MCIVER HURTING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the decisions on
whether injured strong safety Darren Woodson (sprained ankle) and
right guard Everett McIver (strained hamstring) will play against
the Philadelphia Eagles tomorrow won't be made until right around
game time.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, who was injured in Thursday's practice, did not
practice yesterday. While Gailey remained cautious about his
status, Woodson maintained that he would be ready for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play,'' said Woodson, the team's leading tackler
with 26 stops, including 18 unassisted. ``It's not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woodson can't go, backup free safety Izell Reese will start
at strong safety alongside free safety George Teague. Reserve
safety Singor Mobley would play in the nickel defense.
</P>
<P>
   McIver, who missed Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals,
practiced yesterday and looks to be ready to play. Gailey said the
Cowboys will play it safe and evaluate McIver's situation in
pre-game warmups. Gailey said McIver will likely be in uniform, but
the decision will be whether he's ready to start.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Myslinski will start at right guard if McIver can't go.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that cornerback Kevin Smith, who has been
sidelined since training camp with a bulging disk, and right tackle
Erik Williams, who missed the Cardinals game with a strained
quadriceps, will start against the Eagles. nn

PACK'S INJURY NOT TROUBLING NELSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mavericks point guard Robert Pack strained his right
hamstring in last night's scrimmage, but Mavericks trainer Roger
Hinds and coach/general manager Don Nelson said the injury was
``nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury sent Pack to the sidelines, where he received some
ice treatment. The eight-year veteran had subsequent treatments in
the locker room near the end of practice while teammates finished
free-throw drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fatigue than anything else,'' Hinds said. ``They've
been going at it pretty hard lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack has missed portions of the past six seasons with various
injuries. He was sidelined for half of last season's
strike-shortened 50 games with a torn right hamstring and surgery
to repair a dislocated left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash also left the evening practice early for
the second consecutive day with recurring pain in his right ankle.

STADIUM WILL BRING IN NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's NFL-loathing edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   If anyone out there still cares about bringing a NFL team to Los
Angeles, and I'm not sure anyone does, I know how to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Just build a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That is a daunting task under normal conditions, of course.
Carolina funded the construction of its NFL stadium through PSL
(private seat license) sales, and PSLs are part of virtually every
modern stadium blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ed Roski, Eli Broad and the Coliseum Commission were to
proceed on renovation of the Coliseum on their own, an idea they've
said they're willing to do, I believe a line of transient NFL
owners would show up at their door.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage would be the huge upfront financial stake Roski
and Broad would have to make. But with a good working relationship
with the commission and a stadium design that made it more than
just a football stadium, it might be a better deal than owning a
team outright.
</P>
<P>
   The clout Roski and Broad have in the business community could
probably secure commitments for luxury suites and select club seats
before a team even lands here.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than envisioning a stadium with frosted glass touches, as
included in one of Michael Ovitz's plans, envision a stadium that
would be adaptable for soccer, concerts and Olympic track and
field. (We're due to bid on one of those again, and I can't think
of a better person, other than Peter Ueberroth, to run it than
Roski.)
</P>
<P>
   As part of their investment, Roski and Broad would receive a
share of PSL revenue, naming rights, Super Bowl income and minority
ownership in the team once an NFL owner lands here.
</P>
<P>
   They would be hailed as heroes who put the interests of the city
before their own.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they could possibly pick the owner and team they
want. Imagine how wonderful it would be to see Roski and Broad tell
Al Davis and Bill Bidwill that they need not apply, that they
prefer to be partners with the (49ers') DeBartolo family. ...
</P>
<P>
   Count me among those who believe the league's statement that it
has no plans to expand beyond 32 is written in pencil. They'll
continue to expand as long as it makes financial sense and they can
use it as a wedge in TV negotiations. ...
</P>
<P>
   NFL inflation at work: It was just ten years ago that Jerry
Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys for $180 million and business
people said he was out of mind to pay so much. ...
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot in the NFL's decision to go to Houston is that
St. Louis won't share in the $23 million-a-team booty. As part of
its agreement to move, the Rams forfeit all expansion revenue for
ten years unless a team returns to L.A. ...
</P>
<P>
   The entire state of California has sort of become the NFL's
messy cesspool. There's no team in L.A., Al Davis is trying to get
out of his lease in Oakland, San Francisco's deal for a new stadium
is on the rocks and has already cost it a Super Bowl, and the city
of San Diego has to buy unused tickets as part of its very bad deal
with the Chargers. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words, by new NFL owner Robert McNair: ``I'm just a
sportsman.'' Well, he was until Wednesday. I don't know what he is
today, but the last time I saw someone get taken down this hard, I
was watching ``Oz'' on HBO. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words Part II, laughingly uttered by Paul Tagliabue
on Wednesday after taking Houston's $700 million: ``The one thing
that was clear, we were not just making a decision based upon a
price.'' The man is funnier than a Friar's Roast. ...
</P>
<P>
   Realignment into two conferences of four divisions is coming in
the NFL once Houston kicks off. NFC changes would be minimal, like
Arizona moving to the West and Seattle likely moving over from the
AFC. But there will be some in-fighting among AFC teams. It would
be logical to have a AFC South featuring Houston, Tennessee,
Jacksonville and Miami, but the Dolphins would fight to stay in the
NFC East with their longtime rivals (Jets, Pats, Bills).
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at the most sensible realignment, with geography
important but many rivalries kept intact:
</P>
<P>
   NFC: East - Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington;
Central - Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota; West - Arizona,
St. Louis, San Francisco, Seattle; South - Atlanta, Carolina, New
Orleans, Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   AFC: East - Baltimore, Buffalo, New England, New York Jets;
Central - Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh; West -
Denver, Kansas City, Oakland, San Diego; South - Houston,
Jacksonville, Miami, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Is Denver dead? Well, the Broncos are 0-4, and their next four
games are against Oakland, Green Bay, New England and Minnesota.
This would make the Broncos the Florida Marlins of football. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words, baseball division, made in April from
just-exiled Dodgers president Bob Graziano: ``The year of turmoil

</P>
<P>
   I would love to see Ramon Martinez pitch back to his pre-injury
form with the Dodgers against the Indians today, and give his
brother a chance to come back and win Game 4. I'd love it even more
if I could sit with Tommy Lasorda and Fred Claire while it happens.
...
</P>

   I'd love to see the Indians win the World Series, but I can't
support any team unable to play a game in less than four hours.

STADIUM WILL BRING IN NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's NFL-loathing edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   If anyone out there still cares about bringing a NFL team to Los
Angeles, and I'm not sure anyone does, I know how to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Just build a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That is a daunting task under normal conditions, of course.
Carolina funded the construction of its NFL stadium through PSL
(private seat license) sales, and PSLs are part of virtually every
modern stadium blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ed Roski, Eli Broad and the Coliseum Commission were to
proceed on renovation of the Coliseum on their own, an idea they've
said they're willing to do, I believe a line of transient NFL
owners would show up at their door.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage would be the huge upfront financial stake Roski
and Broad would have to make. But with a good working relationship
with the commission and a stadium design that made it more than
just a football stadium, it might be a better deal than owning a
team outright.
</P>
<P>
   The clout Roski and Broad have in the business community could
probably secure commitments for luxury suites and select club seats
before a team even lands here.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than envisioning a stadium with frosted glass touches, as
included in one of Michael Ovitz's plans, envision a stadium that
would be adaptable for soccer, concerts and Olympic track and
field. (We're due to bid on one of those again, and I can't think
of a better person, other than Peter Ueberroth, to run it than
Roski.)
</P>
<P>
   As part of their investment, Roski and Broad would receive a
share of PSL revenue, naming rights, Super Bowl income and minority
ownership in the team once an NFL owner lands here.
</P>
<P>
   They would be hailed as heroes who put the interests of the city
before their own.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they could possibly pick the owner and team they
want. Imagine how wonderful it would be to see Roski and Broad tell
Al Davis and Bill Bidwill that they need not apply, that they
prefer to be partners with the (49ers') DeBartolo family. ...
</P>
<P>
   Count me among those who believe the league's statement that it
has no plans to expand beyond 32 is written in pencil. They'll
continue to expand as long as it makes financial sense and they can
use it as a wedge in TV negotiations. ...
</P>
<P>
   NFL inflation at work: It was just ten years ago that Jerry
Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys for $180 million and business
people said he was out of mind to pay so much. ...
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot in the NFL's decision to go to Houston is that
St. Louis won't share in the $23 million-a-team booty. As part of
its agreement to move, the Rams forfeit all expansion revenue for
ten years unless a team returns to L.A. ...
</P>
<P>
   The entire state of California has sort of become the NFL's
messy cesspool. There's no team in L.A., Al Davis is trying to get
out of his lease in Oakland, San Francisco's deal for a new stadium
is on the rocks and has already cost it a Super Bowl, and the city
of San Diego has to buy unused tickets as part of its very bad deal
with the Chargers. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words, by new NFL owner Robert McNair: ``I'm just a
sportsman.'' Well, he was until Wednesday. I don't know what he is
today, but the last time I saw someone get taken down this hard, I
was watching ``Oz'' on HBO. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words Part II, laughingly uttered by Paul Tagliabue
on Wednesday after taking Houston's $700 million: ``The one thing
that was clear, we were not just making a decision based upon a
price.'' The man is funnier than a Friar's Roast. ...
</P>
<P>
   Realignment into two conferences of four divisions is coming in
the NFL once Houston kicks off. NFC changes would be minimal, like
Arizona moving to the West and Seattle likely moving over from the
AFC. But there will be some in-fighting among AFC teams. It would
be logical to have a AFC South featuring Houston, Tennessee,
Jacksonville and Miami, but the Dolphins would fight to stay in the
NFC East with their longtime rivals (Jets, Pats, Bills).
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at the most sensible realignment, with geography
important but many rivalries kept intact:
</P>
<P>
   NFC: East - Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington;
Central - Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota; West - Arizona,
St. Louis, San Francisco, Seattle; South - Atlanta, Carolina, New
Orleans, Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   AFC: East - Baltimore, Buffalo, New England, New York Jets;
Central - Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh; West -
Denver, Kansas City, Oakland, San Diego; South - Houston,
Jacksonville, Miami, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Is Denver dead? Well, the Broncos are 0-4, and their next four
games are against Oakland, Green Bay, New England and Minnesota.
This would make the Broncos the Florida Marlins of football. ...
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words, baseball division, made in April from
just-exiled Dodgers president Bob Graziano: ``The year of turmoil
(in 1998) was necessary to get where we are today. I think we're
through with all of the changes.'' Obviously, someone wasn't. ...
</P>
<P>
   I would love to see Ramon Martinez pitch back to his pre-injury
form with the Dodgers against the Indians today, and give his
brother a chance to come back and win Game 4. I'd love it even more
if I could sit with Tommy Lasorda and Fred Claire while it happens.
...
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to see the Indians win the World Series, but I can't
support any team unable to play a game in less than four hours.

TALKS CONTINUE ON FORD MOTOR CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS third graf with some workers walking off the job) 
(ATTN: Mo., Kan., Minn)  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Negotiators for the United Automobile Workers
union and Ford Motor Co. continued their talks over a new labor
contract past a midnight Friday deadline .
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the union told Ford that it would end the
current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Friday and would call a strike if
no agreement had been reached by then on a contract covering
101,000 unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, about 1,100 workers who build Ford Explorers at
a St. Louis factory walked off the job along with about 2,300 in
Kansas City who build pickups and sedans, about 900 workers in St.
Paul, Minn., who build Ranger pickups and about 1,400 in Flat Rock,
Mich., who build Mercury Cougars, said Jim Vella, a Ford spokesman.
At a handful of other plants, he said, workers left their jobs but
were urged to return to work by the national union.
 &UR;  &LR; The company and the union are struggling to reconcile Ford's plans
to spin off its giant auto parts unit, Visteon Automotive Systems,
to shareholders. After all, nearly a quarter of Ford's unionized
workers toil in Visteon factories, and they fear that their jobs
and pensions will be less secure in the long run if Visteon becomes
an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   The continuation of the talks suggested that both sides were
eager to reach an agreement without a strike. Local union officials
at Ford's factories waited to hear from the union whether to
strike. Wall Street analysts said that any long shutdown would
quickly result in big losses, particularly because Ford is already
having trouble meeting demand for its high-profit pickup trucks and
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't build them fast enough,'' said Scott F. Merlis, a
managing director and head of the automotive practice at
Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Both DaimlerChrysler AG and General Motors Corp. have already
reached agreements with the union on new, four-year labor contracts
that call for annual raises of 3 percent on top of increases that
nearly compensate for inflation. In addition, workers get a $1,350
signing bonus and sweetened pension benefits.

DUCKS EARN PEACEFUL VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was a rare victory for the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks over the Dallas Stars, but perhaps the biggest winner Friday
night was the NHL, which is trying to promote the skills of its
players, not grudge matches.
</P>
<P>
   With all the elements in place for a war on ice, it was instead
the skill of Ducks goalie Guy Hebert that was the highlight in
Anaheim's 3-0 victory over Dallas in front of 17,174 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert stopped 37 shots en route to his 23rd career shutout and
the first in franchise history over the Stars as the Ducks (1-2)
finally got into the win column. It was just Anaheim's fifth
victory in the team's past 26 games against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge win for us,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg,
``with all we've gone through this week. We took a lot of criticism
and we took it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said he was relieved to have the game completed and
said, ``It was a hockey game and I think the league should be proud
of the two teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to an incident came in the second period when
Dallas defenseman Richard Mativchuk cross-checked Paul Kariya into
the Stars' net. No penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas winger Mike Keane said he wasn't surprised the game was
played the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard and physical,'' he said. ``Sometimes, the hype
is bigger than the game. It (revenge) was something we weren't
going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hurt Paul Kariya or Teemu Selanne . . . that's not what
the NHL is all about. I think an eye-for-an-eye is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were outshot 37-21, but Hebert was difference. Hebert
was much different than he was when he was pulled in Tuesday's 4-0
loss at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows why we think he's one of the best goalies in the
league,'' Hartsburg said. ``He rebounded and gave us the chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   After going 133 minutes, 18 seconds without scoring, the Ducks
got their first goal in a most unlikely manner.
</P>
<P>
   The normally disciplined Stars gave up an outnumbered attack
when Hebert shoved a long rebound toward Ted Drury. Anaheim's
fourth-line winger carried the puck down the left wing and left a
drop pass for Kevin Haller who, with the help of a screen by
newcomer Ladislav Kohn, beat Ed Belfour on the glove side at 13:18
of of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Haller, who missed all of training camp because of knee surgery,
had only one goal last season. Hebert picked up his fourth career
assist on the play.

 COMMENTARY: ARMS CONTROL IN 30 SECONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt 9 ) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a column about why the Senate should ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But first, a word about cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Cuba last week and watching the news on CNN
International. Suddenly, the announcer cut in and said they were
breaking away for a ``Live Event.'' I braced myself. An earthquake?
A nuclear leak? No. It was a speech by President Jiang &UR; 10 &LR; 
Zemin &UR; 11 &LR;  of China at a Fortune magazine business conference in
Shanghai (sponsored by CNN's owner, Time Warner). I listened to the
speech and it was utter pablum. That was confirmed when an hour
later CNN led its next news broadcast with a report on the
Jiang &UR; 10 &LR;  speech, saying that he said nothing new. In other words,
this ``Live Event'' was just a stunt by CNN to hype its own
conference. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week I turned on ``Larry King Live'' and saw the
wrestler Hulk Hogan being interviewed, live from a wrestling match,
where he was commenting on the suitability for president of his
former wrestling competitor and now Minnesota governor, Jesse
Ventura &UR; 12 &LR; . So we have one wrestler commenting on another wrestler
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about the Cold War is that it was a serious time
because we faced a serious moral threat, Communism, and a serious
strategic threat, the Soviet Union. Networks didn't play around
with phony news; wrestlers didn't do foreign policy. What strikes
you these days is what an unserious &UR; 13 &LR;  time this is without a
serious enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this has to do with the lulling &UR; 14 &LR;  effect of rising
stock markets. I believe economic integration influences
geopolitics and reduces the risk of war. Look at India. Its
nationalist party, the BJP &UR; 15 &LR; , came to office two years ago vowing
to test India's nukes &UR; 16 &LR; . It suffered a serious loss of foreign
investment as a result. Upon his re-election last week, the
BJP's &UR; 15 &LR;  leader, Prime Minister Atal &UR; 17 &LR;  Behari &UR; 18 &LR;  Vajpayee &UR; 19 &LR; ,
bluntly declared that nuclear testing was not his priority anymore,
saying: ``The priority is to build a national consensus on the
acceptance of global capital, market norms and whatever goes with
it. You have to go out and compete for investments.''
</P>
<P>
   But while globalization &UR; 20 &LR;  clearly affects geopolitics, it
doesn't end it. India can still get crazy, which is why arms
control still matters. For the hidden hand of the market to work,
you always need a hidden fist. And this brings us back to the test
ban treaty. I don't expect the average Joe to be out campaigning
for the CTBT &UR; 21 &LR; . He has his own job to worry about. Framing
important issues is the job of leadership, of presidential
candidates and of the responsible media.
</P>
<P>
   But what we have today is either pandering to this lack of
seriousness, or a reduction of every issue to
political-point-scoring. One day the Republicans shoot down the
Democrats' nominee for a federal judgeship, on partisan grounds,
and the next day they want to shoot down a nuclear test ban treaty
on the same grounds. Hey, why not? What the heck? But where have
the Democrats been? This treaty was ready two years ago! Why hasn't
the Administration mounted a real education campaign?
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate verification issues raised by those serious
Republicans who oppose the CTBT &UR; 21 &LR; . But they shouldn't be
deal-breakers. This is a good treaty. Under it, 320 seismic
monitors will be installed around the world to detect tests, we
will have an important political lever to pressure India and
Pakistan not to test anymore, and we will make it much harder for
China to develop miniaturized warheads for a multi-warhead &UR; 22 &LR; 
missile, because to do that China would need live testing and this
treaty bans that. And if someone cheats, the United States retains
the right to pull out. How can we maintain pressure on India,
Pakistan and China not to test anymore if we insist on the right to
test forever? The Republicans, rightly, howled over China's theft
of our nuclear weapons designs, but now they want to set China free
to test them!
</P>
<P>
   We're talking nukes &UR; 16 &LR; , folks. This deserves serious
consideration, not a cheap, quick-draw debate and vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, since the public seems to have decided that our
national interest is not threatened today, politicians can behave
as if they don't have to make policy on the basis of the national
interest,'' says Council on Foreign Relations policy expert Michael
Mandelbaum &UR; 23 &LR; . ``The public just doesn't check that box anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, we will regret that.

PENOBSCOT MAY HAVE BEEN MAN BEHIND CLEVELAND NICKNAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's the stuff of legend: how Louis Francis Sockalexis,
Penobscot Indian, mighty outfield warrior, might have inspired the
Cleveland baseball club to call its team ``the Indians'' in his
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball buffs say the Maine native had an arm like a cannon,
ran so fast he was dubbed ``deerfoot of the diamond,'' and belted
the ball farther than anyone could fathom. New York Giants manager
John McGraw described Sockalexis as ``the greatest natural talent I
have even seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as his Boston-area descendants watched the Indians take on
the Red Sox, they recall a man who was far more complex than the
cartoon mascot of myth, who led a painful life and suffered an
early death. He drank heavily after arriving in the major leagues
in the 1890s and played parts of only three seasons before fading
from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never had a drink before, and then one night after a
victory some team members carried him into a bar and gave him his
first taste of alcohol,'' said Ann Padovano, a Sockalexis
descendant who lives in Stoughton, Mass. ``He was never the same
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the Sockalexis legend are colored with doubt.
Indeed, despite the Indians' claim that Sockalexis was the
inspiration for the team name, some historians aren't sure. Recent
research shows the club also was called the Indians to encourage
team members to follow the example of the Boston Braves, who had
come from behind to win the World Series in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Cleveland's team had been dubbed ``The Forest
Cities,'' ``The Spiders,'' ``The Blues,'' ``The Broncos'' and,
beginning in 1903, ``The Naps'' _ in honor of their stellar second
baseman, Nap Lajoie. But after Lajoie was traded to Philadelphia in
1914, the Napless Naps needed a new name.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of local sportswriters suggested calling the team
``the Indians,'' club officials adopted the idea ``to remind the
players of the record of the Boston Braves,'' says Ellen
Staurowsky, associate professor of sport sciences at Ithaca
College, who spent months researching the topic.
</P>
<P>
   She cites a drawing that appeared on the front of the sports
section of the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Jan. 16, 1915, the day the
new name was announced. Over the caption, ``They're Indians,''
stands a tall Indian with a long bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nature of the name has anything to do with pennant
chances,'' the cartoonist writes, ``they should cop the flag _ for
instance, look at the Boston `Braves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, a similar notice appeared on the newspaper's
front page. It said team members would wear an Indian head on their
uniforms to remind them ``of what the Braves did last year, jumping
from last place to first.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Cleveland team was at the bottom of the
American League standings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence in Cleveland newspapers of the time that
the team was called Indians in tribute to Sockalexis, Staurowsky
says. The name was ``just a marketing ploy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the Native American slugger surely must have been
on the minds of the team's management.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis died in 1913, and in his brief career he fascinated
fans from Cleveland and beyond, who thronged to ballfields wherever
he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the name wasn't picked to honor him exactly, but it
was in his memory,'' says Luke Salisbury, a Chelsea, Mass. author
who has written extensively about Sockalexis.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that, for a time, Sockalexis was one of the most
extraordinary athletes anybody had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1871 on the Penobscot reservation on Indian Island,
Maine, he was well-known in local baseball leagues even as a boy.
At Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., where he attended college in
1895 and '96, he batted .436 and .444 during his two seasons, stole
6 bases in one game, and stunned audiences with his arm. Two
Harvard professors, who measured Sockalexis's throwing ability,
said he could toss a ball more than 400 feet, accurately.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, he transferred to Notre Dame but left after just 30
days to join the Cleveland ballclub, then called ``The Spiders''
because many of the players were unusually skinny. But at 6 feet
tall, 190 pounds, Sockalexis had a powerful physique.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first Native American to play major league ball;
that distinction belonged to James Madison Toy, who played for the
Cleveland Forest Cities in 1886. But Toy never received much
national attention. Sockalexis created a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   On his first time at bat in New York's Polo Grounds, Sockalexis
socked a home run off Amos Rusie, the ``Hoosier Thunderbolt.'' On
another occasion, he made a game-winning play when, standing deep
in right field, he threw out a runner at home plate. Fans were
fascinated by him.
</P>
<P>
   But after just three months with the Spiders, the supernova that
was Sockalexis all but vanished. Accounts differ about the cause of
his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Padovano, whose mother was Sockalexis's great-great niece, says
it happened after teammates introduced him to alcohol by serving
him whiskey to celebrate a big win.
</P>
<P>
   But Salisbury argues that Sockalexis had been drinking long
before then. He was suspended from Notre Dame for a barroom
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis broke an ankle while jumping from the second-floor
window of a Pittsburgh brothel in July 1897, Salisbury says. The
combination of his drinking and his injury did him in. The ankle
improved, but Sockalexis never bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   He played in 66 of about 150 games in 1897. In 1898, he appeared
in just 20 games, and in only 11 in 1899. Team manager Pat Tebeau
offered him $10,000 to stop drinking, but he could not do it.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Sockalexis's abilities fade was ``like seeing smoke
waft away from a Maine campfire,'' Tebeau reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis drifted off, living on the streets and in the woods.
He tried unsuccessfully to play for minor league teams, and worked
briefly for a ferry company and as a lumberjack. But the glory was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis died on Christmas Eve in 1913, at a logging camp in
Maine. He was just 42. News accounts reported that, crumpled in a
pocket of his shirt, colleagues found clippings of his heroics in
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Today a flat stone with two crossed baseball bats marks
Sockalexis's grave in a small cemetery on Indian Island.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fall, his descendants are still proud of him and
pleased that, for whatever reason, the Cleveland Indians may have
named the team to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel excited about that part of my heritage,''
said Angelo Quieto, 53, another Sockalexis relative, who lives in
Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just think of what might have been.''

PENOBSCOT MAY HAVE BEEN MAN BEHIND CLEVELAND NICKNAME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's the stuff of legend: how Louis Francis Sockalexis,
Penobscot Indian, mighty outfield warrior, might have inspired the
Cleveland baseball club to call its team ``the Indians'' in his
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball buffs say the Maine native had an arm like a cannon,
ran so fast he was dubbed ``deerfoot of the diamond,'' and belted
the ball farther than anyone could fathom. New York Giants manager
John McGraw described Sockalexis as ``the greatest natural talent I
have even seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as his Boston-area descendants watched the Indians take on
the Red Sox, they recall a man who was far more complex than the
cartoon mascot of myth, who led a painful life and suffered an
early death. He drank heavily after arriving in the major leagues
in the 1890s and played parts of only three seasons before fading
from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never had a drink before, and then one night after a
victory some team members carried him into a bar and gave him his
first taste of alcohol,'' said Ann Padovano, a Sockalexis
descendant who lives in Stoughton, Mass. ``He was never the same
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the Sockalexis legend are colored with doubt.
Indeed, despite the Indians' claim that Sockalexis was the
inspiration for the team name, some historians aren't sure. Recent
research shows the club also was called the Indians to encourage
team members to follow the example of the Boston Braves, who had
come from behind to win the World Series in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Cleveland's team had been dubbed ``The Forest
Cities,'' ``The Spiders,'' ``The Blues,'' ``The Broncos'' and,
beginning in 1903, ``The Naps'' _ in honor of their stellar second
baseman, Nap Lajoie. But after Lajoie was traded to Philadelphia in
1914, the Napless Naps needed a new name.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of local sportswriters suggested calling the team
``the Indians,'' club officials adopted the idea ``to remind the
players of the record of the Boston Braves,'' says Ellen
Staurowsky, associate professor of sport sciences at Ithaca
College, who spent months researching the topic.
</P>
<P>
   She cites a drawing that appeared on the front of the sports
section of the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Jan. 16, 1915, the day the
new name was announced. Over the caption, ``They're Indians,''
stands a tall Indian with a long bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nature of the name has anything to do with pennant
chances,'' the cartoonist writes, ``they should cop the flag _ for
instance, look at the Boston `Braves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, a similar notice appeared on the newspaper's
front page. It said team members would wear an Indian head on their
uniforms to remind them ``of what the Braves did last year, jumping
from last place to first.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Cleveland team was at the bottom of the
American League standings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence in Cleveland newspapers of the time that
the team was called Indians in tribute to Sockalexis, Staurowsky
says. The name was ``just a marketing ploy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the Native American slugger surely must have been
on the minds of the team's management.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis died in 1913, and in his brief career he fascinated
fans from Cleveland and beyond, who thronged to ballfields wherever
he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the name wasn't picked to honor him exactly, but it
was in his memory,'' says Luke Salisbury, a Chelsea, Mass. author
who has written extensively about Sockalexis.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that, for a time, Sockalexis was one of the most
extraordinary athletes anybody had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1871 on the Penobscot reservation on Indian Island,
Maine, he was well-known in local baseball leagues even as a boy.
At Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., where he attended college in
1895 and '96, he batted .436 and .444 during his two seasons, stole
6 bases in one game, and stunned audiences with his arm. Two
Harvard professors, who measured Sockalexis's throwing ability,
said he could toss a ball more than 400 feet, accurately.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, he transferred to Notre Dame but left after just 30
days to join the Cleveland ballclub, then called ``The Spiders''
because many of the players were unusually skinny. But at 6 feet
tall, 190 pounds, Sockalexis had a powerful physique.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first Native American to play major league ball;
that distinction belonged to James Madison Toy, who played for the
Cleveland Forest Cities in 1886. But Toy never received much
national attention. Sockalexis created a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   On his first time at bat in New York's Polo Grounds, Sockalexis
socked a home run off Amos Rusie, the ``Hoosier Thunderbolt.'' On
another occasion, he made a game-winning play when, standing deep
in right field, he threw out a runner at home plate. Fans were
fascinated by him.
</P>
<P>
   But after just three months with the Spiders, the supernova that
was Sockalexis all but vanished. Accounts differ about the cause of
his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Padovano, whose mother was Sockalexis's great-great niece, says
it happened after teammates introduced him to alcohol by serving
him whiskey to celebrate a big win.
</P>
<P>
   But Salisbury argues that Sockalexis had been drinking long
before then. He was suspended from Notre Dame for a barroom
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis broke an ankle while jumping from the second-floor
window of a Pittsburgh brothel in July 1897, Salisbury says. The
combination of his drinking and his injury did him in. The ankle
improved, but Sockalexis never bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   He played in 66 of about 150 games in 1897. In 1898, he appeared
in just 20 games, and in only 11 in 1899. Team manager Pat Tebeau
offered him $10,000 to stop drinking, but he could not do it.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Sockalexis's abilities fade was ``like seeing smoke
waft away from a Maine campfire,'' Tebeau reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis drifted off, living on the streets and in the woods.
He tried unsuccessfully to play for minor league teams, and worked
briefly for a ferry company and as a lumberjack. But the glory was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sockalexis died on Christmas Eve in 1913, at a logging camp in
Maine. He was just 42. News accounts reported that, crumpled in a
pocket of his shirt, colleagues found clippings of his heroics in
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Today a flat stone with two crossed baseball bats marks
Sockalexis's grave in a small cemetery on Indian Island.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fall, his descendants are still proud of him and
pleased that, for whatever reason, the Cleveland Indians may have
named the team to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel excited about that part of my heritage,''
said Angelo Quieto, 53, another Sockalexis relative, who lives in
Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just think of what might have been.''

COMMENTARY: SLOUCHING TOWARD NASHVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Al Gore began stressing his Tennessee roots,
running for president in the South in 1987, a top official for a
rival campaign was dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore just hasn't captured their imagination,'' said Donna
Brazile, then the national field director for Richard Gephardt.
``You don't hear Southern party chairmen going around saying,
`Gore, Gore, Gore!'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Gore is back stressing his Tennessee roots, with a new
campaign headquarters in Nashville and a new campaign manager:
Donna Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   The cautious Gore's choice of the incautious Brazile is strange,
and like so many of the vice president's moves, it has caused a lot
of people to shake their heads and say, ``Why is he doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1988, after Michael Dukakis had run a campaign that
broke creative new ground in flatlining, his deputy field director,
Ms. Brazile, got desperate. She goaded reporters to check out
unsubstantiated rumors about George Bush's personal life, noting
that ``the American people have every right to know if Barbara Bush
will share that bed with him in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   She was forced to resign, and had to apologize for her loose
talk. Perhaps it seems quaint now, but at the time, her remarks
were seen as taking politics to a new tabloid low.
</P>
<P>
   So it's an odd twist that she will be directing the campaign
against George W. Bush, who vividly defended his father against the
same gossip Ms. Brazile was peddling with the line: ``The answer to
the big A question is N-O.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Brazile is not widely viewed as a dazzling
strategist, her appointment has struck some as pandering to women,
a constituency Gore is losing to Bush, and to African-Americans, a
constituency he fears he's losing to Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   With an accentuated twang, Gore rhapsodizes about starting
fresh, far from the Gucci Gulch of lobbyists on K Street: ``Home is
not only a place, it's an idea ... Home is where we learn our
values.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't trading ``K Street for the aisles of K Mart,'' as
he so clunkily puts it. He's simply packing up all those same old
Washington Democratic insiders and the mercenary values of K Street
and moving them South. Instead of ``Nashville,'' this movie should
be entitled ``Hackville.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is smart. He's been in politics his whole life. He's
skilled at policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he can't seem to get it right. He's behaving in a
weirdly incompetent manner. At this early stage in the game, his
campaign is already a matter of damage control. Even his friends
find the tinniness of his electoral ear mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   He has just reshuffled the high command of his campaign, and
people have grown so dismayed with his decision-making that they
are now saying the candidate himself is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   He does not seem to inspire extreme loyalty in his troops, some
of whom are already protecting their own legacies by leaking memos
purporting to show that the candidate neglected the repeated
counsel of his pollster and other advisers to engage Bradley months
ago, before he gained so much ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cherishes his reputation for decency. But as he scrambles
away from Bill Clinton's baggage, he adds new advisers with
baggage, and his old advisers pile on more baggage. This campaign
needs nothing so much as a porter.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman, helped usher in the modern
era of fund-raising as ideology. He had to resign his seat as a
House Democratic leader in 1989, under the cloud of scandal
involving a $100,000 junk bond investment. Now he's embroiled in a
new mini-scandal.
</P>
<P>
   State Department auditors criticized his management skills at a
World Exposition in Portugal last year. In a job where he had
ambassadorial status, Coelho had trouble raising money for the U.S.
pavilion, though he spent lavishly on an $18,000-a-month furnished
apartment and hired his niece at a fat salary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's clumsiness has been so startling that even those close to
him are beginning to psychoanalyze his ambition. Does he really
want it, they wonder, or is he in the race just because daddy
always wanted it?
</P>
<P>
   It's a bad sign when a man who is already in the White House
runs for president and people ask: Why is he doing that?

COMMENTARY: ARMS CONTROL IN 30 SECONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a column about why the Senate should ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But first, a word about cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Cuba last week and watching the news on CNN
International. Suddenly, the announcer cut in and said they were
breaking away for a ``Live Event.'' I braced myself. An earthquake?
A nuclear leak? No. It was a speech by President Jiang Zemin of
China at a Fortune magazine business conference in Shanghai
(sponsored by CNN's owner, Time Warner). I listened to the speech
and it was utter pablum. That was confirmed when an hour later CNN
led its next news broadcast with a report on the Jiang speech,
saying that he said nothing new. In other words, this ``Live
Event'' was just a stunt by CNN to hype its own conference. Not
good.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week I turned on ``Larry King Live'' and saw the
wrestler Hulk Hogan being interviewed, live from a wrestling match,
where he was commenting on the suitability for president of his
former wrestling competitor and now Minnesota governor, Jesse
Ventura. So we have one wrestler commenting on another wrestler
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about the Cold War is that it was a serious time
because we faced a serious moral threat, Communism, and a serious
strategic threat, the Soviet Union. Networks didn't play around
with phony news; wrestlers didn't do foreign policy. What strikes
you these days is what an unserious time this is without a serious
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this has to do with the lulling effect of rising stock
markets. I believe economic integration influences geopolitics and
reduces the risk of war. Look at India. Its nationalist party, the
BJP, came to office two years ago vowing to test India's nukes. It
suffered a serious loss of foreign investment as a result. Upon his
re-election last week, the BJP's leader, Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee, bluntly declared that nuclear testing was not his
priority anymore, saying: ``The priority is to build a national
consensus on the acceptance of global capital, market norms and
whatever goes with it. You have to go out and compete for
investments.''
</P>
<P>
   But while globalization clearly affects geopolitics, it doesn't
end it. India can still get crazy, which is why arms control still
matters. For the hidden hand of the market to work, you always need
a hidden fist. And this brings us back to the test ban treaty. I
don't expect the average Joe to be out campaigning for the CTBT. He
has his own job to worry about. Framing important issues is the job
of leadership, of presidential candidates and of the responsible
media.
</P>
<P>
   But what we have today is either pandering to this lack of
seriousness, or a reduction of every issue to
political-point-scoring. One day the Republicans shoot down the
Democrats' nominee for a federal judgeship, on partisan grounds,
and the next day they want to shoot down a nuclear test ban treaty
on the same grounds. Hey, why not? What the heck? But where have
the Democrats been? This treaty was ready two years ago! Why hasn't
the Administration mounted a real education campaign?
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate verification issues raised by those serious
Republicans who oppose the CTBT. But they shouldn't be
deal-breakers. This is a good treaty. Under it, 320 seismic
monitors will be installed around the world to detect tests, we
will have an important political lever to pressure India and
Pakistan not to test anymore, and we will make it much harder for
China to develop miniaturized warheads for a multi-warhead missile,
because to do that China would need live testing and this treaty
bans that. And if someone cheats, the United States retains the
right to pull out. How can we maintain pressure on India, Pakistan
and China not to test anymore if we insist on the right to test
forever? The Republicans, rightly, howled over China's theft of our
nuclear weapons designs, but now they want to set China free to
test them!
</P>
<P>
   We're talking nukes, folks. This deserves serious consideration,
not a cheap, quick-draw debate and vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, since the public seems to have decided that our
national interest is not threatened today, politicians can behave
as if they don't have to make policy on the basis of the national
interest,'' says Council on Foreign Relations policy expert Michael
Mandelbaum. ``The public just doesn't check that box anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, we will regret that.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS SET A TONE AMONG THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Yankee welcome wagon is not always as
overt as Chuck Knoblauch's and Derek Jeter's donning full catcher's
regalia to greet Roger Clemens in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   That was their jovial way of telling the Rocket, ``Hey, bud, no
hard feelings'' for the way he had sent them sprawling a time or
two when he was a member of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the salutation is more subtle. The Yankees go about
their business, and the new players pick up on it. The result is an
almost seamless sense of entitlement evident on this ball club in
the first two victories in Yankee Stadium. Saturday night Clemens,
the new boy in the rotation, tries to sweep the Rangers in the
division series.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to maintain dynasties in these days of free agencies,
but the Yankees currently have a dynasty of attitude, a dynasty of
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is a salty old dog who has been battling the Yankees
since he came to the majors. They have been even more impressive
since he walked in the door and was twitted by Jeter and Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I have been around so many guys that just beat
themselves up and are hard on themselves as far as their game is
concerned,'' Clemens said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see guys giving away too many at-bats,'' he added.
``When they do, you don't have to look any further than the dugout
or water cooler and listen. Something is being torn up. They're
getting it out so they can maybe concentrate on their next
at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is just the owner. No, just kidding. George
Steinbrenner has not been the constant goading presence he once
was, but newcomers notice that he does set a certain tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are never satisfied,'' said Jason Grimsley, the
pitcher who had a good season but is not on the roster for this
series. ``It starts at the top with an owner who wants to win and a
manager who wants to win. I mean, every owner wants to win, but
ours shows everybody he wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone also comes from Joe Torre, who does not deliver
lectures to new Yankees, or hand them organizational notebooks on
any Yankee Way of Playing Winning Baseball. Torre just keeps track
of everybody with a nod or a glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe works out every day,'' said Allen Watson, who played for
Torre in St. Louis and was thrilled to be reunited this summer.
``He had cancer this spring, and he runs and lifts weights and
everybody sees him. He doesn't yell or deprecate his players. He's
the same as he was in St. Louis, but he just didn't have the
firepower there.''
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to win is not quite as primal as the Yankee
mentality back in the late '50s when a Hank Bauer or a Moose
Skowron would sidle up to a rookie on opening day and growl,
``Don't mess with my World Series check, kid.'' The Series checks
are proportionately smaller these days. It's more about getting it
right, really right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rah-rah,'' Watson said. ``They expect to win. It's
a real quiet team. They have great fundamentals. The bunting. Not
making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, who has also been around, said: ``You notice it the
second you walk into the clubhouse in spring training. These guys
are not thinking about playing .500 or winning the division or
winning the American League. All they're thinking about is winning
the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley expected to go to Columbus out of spring training, but
found that the Yankees, with their two World Series rings, treated
him as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you do the job, you've got the same look they do,''
Grimsley said. ``Everybody's professional. You watch Coney go to
the mound. You watch Jeter go to the plate. Their attitude is, `OK,
guys, this is it.'''
</P>
<P>
   With all the stars in the clubhouse, Grimsley said, it is normal
to see David Cone enjoy being teased by a rookie like D'Angelo
Jimenez, as he was in the last weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't see that on other teams,'' Grimsley said.
</P>
<P>
   As a new Yankee, Grimsley was asked who impressed him most. He
started to name names: ``Watching Jeter and Bernie, the way Mariano
goes about his business. The consistency. Roger works harder than
anybody I've ever seen. Pettitte's right with him. Girardi. Nobody
studies the game more than he does. Nobody here is a follower.
There are 25 leaders here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz has watched this attitude develop. As a yappy
part-time starter, he made gigantic contributions to big victories
in 1995 and 1996, and then was sent away _ ``but everybody felt I
was still part of the ball club,'' he said. He came back this
season, and discovered the Yankees had matured to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the major leagues has ability,'' Leyritz said.
``It's the mentality that makes a difference. When I was here the
first time, if you lost a game, guys worried maybe you'd lose three
or four. Now they get upset if they lose one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz watched the team play badly on the last weekend of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laughed,'' Leyritz said. ``I'm not saying you can just
flick a switch, but these guys knew how to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there is one thing different about the Yankees that he
did not understand from a distance, Leyritz said, ``I think of what
Derek Jeter was when I left,'' meaning a poised and talented rookie
in 1996. ``Now Derek has superstar status but he never changed. It
hasn't gotten to him. He works as hard as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz stops short of calling Jeter a leader of the team. On
the Yankees, that is a communal job.

Service for AMs of Sunday, Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-JEWISH-PRIEST (Lublin, Poland) _ Past the ditches where
thousands were executed by the Nazis, the crematory described as
having ``a daily yield of about 1,000 bodies,'' and the gas chamber
being visited by a group of Israeli schoolchildren, the priest
walks in silence. His name is Romuald-Jakub Weksler-Waszkinel. He
is a priest and a teacher at Lublin's Catholic University. He is
also _ as he discovered late in life _ a Jew. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-BAN-TREATY (Washington) _ In debating the historic treaty
that would ban all underground nuclear testing, the Senate is
reliving one of the most divisive arguments of the Cold War: Do
international arms control treaties enhance or imperil America's
nuclear deterrent? By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-BAN-ASSESS _ A mystery unfolded last year when India, on
May 13, announced that it had set off a pair of nuclear blasts. The
global network of seismometers recorded no faint rumbles emanating
from India's underground test site in its northwestern desert. Had
India faked the explosive tests? Were they flops? Or had small
blasts eluded the eavesdroppers? These questions have a strong
bearing on the bruising battle in Washington over whether the
Senate should ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. By William
J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-MASKHADOV (Grozny, Russia) _ The Chechen leader, Aslan
Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet Army, is a restrained,
gray-haired man. A profile. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-NEWSPAPER (Tehran, Iran) _ Undaunted by the closure of its
three preceding newspapers, all of which rocketed to the highest
circulation in Iran, a group pressing for a more democratic and
tolerant form of Islamic rule has opened a fourth daily. By John F.
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-GOLD (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ For days, the miners
listened to the crackle of good news from their battered radios and
prayed that the soaring price of gold would save them. But the
banner headlines that have thrilled government officials,
economists and mining executives were not enough to stop the
layoffs. By Rachel L. Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ Vicente Fox Quesada, a
brash-talking National Action Party presidential candidate with a
bold swagger, thinks he can build the frustration among Mexican
voters into a runaway victory for the opposition next year. But
Fox's campaign for the top job faces a debilitating problem: He
does not have the unqualified support of his own party. By Julia
Preston.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-YELTSIN-HEALTH (Moscow) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was taken to the Central Clinical Hospital on Saturday morning
suffering from what his press secretary described as the flu
accompanied by a high fever. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   EAST-TIMOR-U.S. (Dili, East Timor) _ The Americans are in East
Timor. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Indonesia, which invaded East
Timor in 1975 and yielded the shattered territory to foreign troops
three weeks ago, is organizing a commission to investigate reports
of atrocities committed by militia groups and the Indonesian army.
The question hanging in the air is: How can a country that annexed
and brutally subjugated its neighbor for nearly a quarter-century
investigate its own behavior and bring those responsible to
justice? By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS-CREATIONISM _ Scientific lessons about the origins of
life have long been challenged in public schools, but some Bible
literalists are now adding the reigning theory about the origin of
the universe to their list of targets. Nearly overlooked in the
furor over the Kansas Board of Education's decision in August to
remove evolution from its education standards was a decision to
delete from its standards a description of the Big Bang theory of
cosmic origins. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   WIS-WELFARE _ Wisconsin, of all places, suddenly has the jitters
about cutting families off welfare. Since 1996, the state's
famously tough work rules have swept more than 57,000 families from
the rolls and turned a war on welfare into a social experiment
commanding international attention. But Wisconsin is now grappling
with the ultimate symbol of the new welfare age: time limits. By
Jason DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   IRS-TAX-DELINQUENTS _ Understaffed and caught in a set of mixed
signals from Congress, the Internal Revenue Service for more than a
year has been letting many big tax delinquents go without paying
huge tax bills. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   ELVIS-AUCTION (Las Vegas) _ The mystery train that carried
Andrea Bauer to the MGM Grand Hotel this weekend started in her
family's living room when she was just a girl, back in the 1950s.
Sometimes when her father, a devoted Perry Como fan, left the
house, her mother would quickly switch to a record by that new
singer, the twitchy kid from Tupelo. ``Elvis Presley would sing and
my mother and I would dance and dance and dance,'' Ms. Bauer said.
So, four decades later, she came to Las Vegas to get herself a
little piece of Graceland. By Rick Lyman.
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: THE METS' GOOFY TRADITION AT SHEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the Mets at Shea Stadium in October, it's never
just baseball. It's been shoe polish and pine tar, a brawl at
second base, a box of scuffed balls. It was all those fans ripping
up chunks of grass in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's an ``inflammatory response'' to Mike Piazza's
sprained left thumb that benched their cleanup hitter and catcher
Friday night against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Mets won anyway,
9-2, for a 2-1 lead in their National League Divisional Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known as gatekeeper's sprain,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in October in the House That Truth Built _ the
awful truth that New York needed a NL team to replace the departure
of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants after the 1957
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' tradition in October is being anywhere but Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 40 years since the Mets were organized, they have
qualified for the post-season only five times. But when the Mets
are at Shea in October, things happen. Goofy things that never seem
to happen anywhere else. Such as Piazza's inflammatory response. Or
the pitch in the fifth game of the 1969 World Series that Mets
leftfielder Cleon Jones claimed hit him on the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Lou DiMuro disagreed, but when the ball bounced into the
Mets' dugout, Gil Hodges inspected it, walked up to DiMuro and
showed him the black smudge on the ball from the shoe polish on
Jones' spikes.
</P>
<P>
   DiMuro waved Jones to first base, then Donn Clendenon hit a
two-run homer. When the Mets won, 5-3, they were World Series
champions and thousands of fans suddenly decided to study agronomy.
Thanks in part to the smudge of shoe polish on a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1973 NL Championship Series with the Cincinnati Reds,
Pete Rose objected to shortstop Buddy Harrelson's hard tag and soon
they were rolling in the dirt at second base.
</P>
<P>
   In the brawl that emptied both dugouts and both bullpens, Pedro
Borbon, a Reds' reliever, slugged Buzz Capra, a Mets' righthander.
Duffy Dyer, a Mets' catcher, then slugged Borbon who, in the
confusion, grabbed a cap he thought was his. When he realized it
was a Mets' cap, he chewed it apart with his teeth as he stormed to
the Reds' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose later trotted to left field, he was pelted with
garbage. So much so that Sparky Anderson, the Reds' manager, took
his team off the field and the umpires threatened a forfeit until
Yogi Berra (then the Mets' manager), Tom Seaver, Willie Mays and
Rusty Staub hurried to left field, pleaded with the fans and
restored the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Those Mets went on to upset the mighty Big Red Machine in that
NLCS before losing the World Series to the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1986 NLCS with the Houston Astros, Mike Scott, once a
Met, struck out 14 in the 1-0 opener. When the Astros evened the
series at 2-2 with a 3-1 victory, he induced 14 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets believed that Scott's success was due more to
scuffing the ball than to skill. During that fourth game, Davey
Johnson, the Mets' manager, had the batboy collect foul balls and
any other discarded balls whenever Scott was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fifth game, the Mets displayed a box of the allegedly
scuffed balls to Chub Feeney, the NL president, but Feeney judged
Scott to be not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Mets are such big fans of Mike Scott that they save his
used baseballs,'' said Hal Lanier, the Astros manager, ``they ought
to bring `em over to our clubhouse so he can autograph `em.''
</P>
<P>
   To avert another confrontation with Scott in the seventh game,
the Mets had to win both that fifth game at Shea and a memorable
16-inning sixth game in the Astrodome. Which they did.
</P>
<P>
   Those Mets went on to win the World Series remembered for Mookie
Wilson's grounder that bounced through Red Sox first baseman Bill
Buckner's legs in the sixth game at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In the third game of the 1988 NL Championship Series that the
Mets eventually lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, the
Dodgers' reliever, Jay Howell, was ejected for using pine tar to
help grip the ball in the raw chill as the Mets took a 2-1 series
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth game Dwight Gooden took a 4-2 lead into the ninth,
but Mike Scioscia hit a tying two-run homer, then Kirk Gibson hit a
homer in the 12th. The next day Gibson's homer triggered a 7-4
victory, the last post-season game at Shea until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows that whenever something goofy happens at Shea
in October, the Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   They won the World Series with shoe polish, they won the
pine-tar game, they won after collecting the allegedly scuffed
baseballs, they won the NLCS with the Rose-Harrelson brawl. And on
Friday night they won with Mike Piazza nursing an inflammatory
response.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   IT'S TIME FOR THE STEELERS TO ACT ON STEWART'S FUNK
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Giants did with Dave Brown, and the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers did with Trent Dilfer, and the Oakland Raiders did with
Jeff George, it is time for the Pittsburgh Steelers to stop fooling
themselves, and take a long, hard look at their quarterback,
Kordell Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   It is time because after three years as a starter, Stewart has
not shown the instincts, or the accuracy, to be at least an average
quarterback in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is perhaps one of the nicest people in the game, it
is hard not to root for Stewart. And despite his troubles, the
Steelers have stuck by their man, mainly because this past off
season they invested $27 million in him. But he has been a disaster
at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the team was stunned after Stewart threw three
interceptions in a 17-3 loss at home to the Jacksonville Jaguars.
As usual, Stewart displayed poor mechanics, and at times he was
fooled by schemes the Seahawks used to confuse him.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has thrown only one touchdown pass in his last eight
games. His quarterback rating is 57.6. Pittsburgh's offense is
ranked 18th over all and 24th in passing. The team is in a funk
that it has not seen in years. Still, Coach Bill Cowher said the
problems were not all about Stewart, and became angry at any such
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought it was just one person, I'd make a change,''
Cowher said. ``It has nothing to do with what a guy makes, it has
nothing to do with who a guy is. The fact I haven't made a change
ought to indicate it's not just one person.''
</P>
<P>
   There is definitely some truth to that. The starting running
back, Jerome Bettis, has been hobbled with injuries, and the
Steelers have lost a number of key offensive players to free
agency. But Stewart still does not grasp the position.
</P>
<P>
   When Pittsburgh plays host to the Buffalo Bills Sunday, Stewart
should look across the field and watch Doug Flutie, who is 10-4 as
a Bills starter over the last two seasons. The two are basically
the same, in that both are good athletes. But they differ in that
Flutie has been able to absorb the intricacies of the NFL football
since arriving from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's quarterback guru, Kevin Gilbride, the team's
offensive coordinator, is working on Stewart's mechanics and mental
well-being. Against Seattle, Stewart was benched for the third time
in his last seven starts. Stewart is young, at 26, and has plenty
of time to turn his career around. He can take solace in that the
Jets' Vinny Testaverde was once considered a mistake-prone player
but took his team to the conference title last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart had better change things quickly because it is only
a matter of time before Cowher, despite his affinity for Stewart,
turns to Mike Tomczak, the backup quarterback. Maybe for the rest
of the season.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DEVALUING WARRICK
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Warrick, the Florida State star, was charged last
week with grand theft in a clothing scheme at a Tallahassee, Fla.,
department store, his mistake may have cost him more than the
Heisman Trophy. It may have cost him millions of dollars when he
turns professional.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL general managers and scouts salivate when they think of
Warrick, an explosive offensive player who comes along once every
five years or so. He has the capability of changing a game the way
Randy Moss does.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel men from six teams said before the arrest that Warrick
would be drafted from as high as first over all to a low of fifth.
But after the arrest, they said, Warrick could go as low as 10th.
There is a major monetary difference in a player being drafted in
the top 5 or being picked 10th.
</P>
<P>
   How big a difference? Last year, Ricky Williams, the 1998
Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, was chosen fifth in the first
round by the New Orleans Saints and earned $8.8 million in signing
bonus money. At the 10th spot, the Baltimore Ravens selected Chris
McAlister, the Arizona defensive back. His signing bonus was $3.75
million.
</P>
<P>
   If the initial feelings of a small group of team executives are
true, and Warrick's shopping spree causes him to drop from fifth to
10th, that will be a difference of at least $5.05 million. And that
drop in value does not include the possible loss of off-the-field
endorsements once Warrick turns professional.
</P>
<P>
   Those same general managers said it was not Warrick's alleged
crime itself that bothered them. After all, teams have drafted in
the first round woman-beaters, car thieves and drug abusers. But
what NFL teams hate is a player who knows so much is at risk _ in
Warrick's case, the Heisman, a national championship and his future
_ and tosses those things away over something so petty.
</P>
<P>
   What also bothers general managers is Warrick's lack of at least
public remorse. They want to hear him say, ``I'm sorry, I made a
mistake, and it won't happen again.'' Instead, Warrick was quoted
as saying, ``It's not like I killed the president.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE YEAR OF RECEIVERS
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, there has been a quiet offensive explosion
the NFL has not seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   While the quarterback play may be down, there is a great crop of
young wide receivers such as Terry Glenn of the New England
Patriots, Marvin Harrison of the Indianapolis Colts, Keyshawn
Johnson of the Jets, Kevin Dyson of the Tennessee Titans, Michael
Westbrook of the Washington Redskins, and, of course, Randy Moss of
the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first four weeks of the season, there have been 43
games in which a receiver caught passes for 100 yards or more,
tying 1989 for the highest total for a season's first four weeks
since the 1970 merger between the American Football league and the
National Football League. And there have been 17 games in which
quarterbacks threw for 300 yards or more in the first weeks, the
most since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While the quarterback play has been average at best, a number of
receivers are having career years. One is Harrison, who is tall,
bulky, and quick, and who like Moss last season has constantly beat
double-team coverage. In three games (the Colts have had a bye),
Harrison has 28 receptions for 422 yards and 6 touchdowns. Those 6
touchdown catches in 3 games are the best since Seattle's Daryl
Turner had 6 in his first 3 games in 1985. And Harrison's 422
receiving yards are the most since Jerry Rice opened with 449 in 3
games in the 1989 season.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   One of the best defensive minds in the league is someone few
have heard: Ted Cottrell of the Buffalo Bills. The Bills' defense
allows just 261 yards a game, third best in the American Football
Conference. Soon Cottrell's name will be talked about as a
head-coaching candidate. ... Charley Casserly, the former
Washington Redskins' general manager, who is still a consultant for
the team, is attempting to become the general manager for the
expansion franchise awarded to Houston last week. ... Jake Plummer,
the Arizona Cardinals' quarterback, has told teammates that the
loss to free agency of Lomas Brown, the veteran tackle, has hurt
the offense more than people realize. Plummer rarely worried about
protection on Brown's side when he was there. That may account for
why Plummer immediately starts scrambling when he gets to his
second read, and it is not open.

   KNICKS SEEK TO RETAIN UNITY DESPITE SPREWELL ABSENCE
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston went to Charleston, S.C., last week to ready
himself for the coming season. But he also allowed himself some
time to remember the surreal events of last season, how the
fractured Knicks came together when it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it taught us a lesson,'' Houston said as he
finished a training camp practice at the College of Charleston.
``It just goes to show you, after all the other things that
happened, in this league you should just care about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates you is winning. Honestly, there have been a lot
of players in this league who weren't necessarily great players.
But because they won, they were considered great. I hope we take
that from last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston and some of his healthy and committed teammates
excluded, the Knicks are not off to a rousing start. As they exited
their one-week training camp Saturday, they had important injuries,
were in desperate need of a legitimate center and were dealing with
the irresponsibility of Latrell Sprewell, who was AWOL for the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, while he was with the Utah Jazz, Scott Layden
vetoed a trade for Rony Seikaly because the enigmatic center would
not show up in Salt Lake City for his physical. Layden's attitude
and that of the franchise was: if you don't want us, we don't want
you.
</P>
<P>
   Now Layden, who was hired as the Knicks' general manager in
August, has to negotiate a contract extension for a player who
failed to call his bosses to tell them where he was for the past
week. Noted for his firm, no-nonsense approach, Layden must be
seething.
</P>
<P>
   The new general manager also has to negotiate through the
executive suite politics of Madison Square Garden, which are far
from stable. Months after Ernie Grunfeld and Jeff Van Gundy could
not get along, ending in Grunfeld's being sacrificed, a residue of
bitterness remains.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Ed Tapscott, the Knicks' assistant general
manager, placed a call to the SuperSonics. He casually inquired
about the All-Star point guard Gary Payton, who at one juncture
last season had expressed unhappiness about being in Seattle. Van
Gundy also made a call on the Knicks' behalf, to the Sonics
assistant Dwayne Casey _ a call that greatly concerned Tapscott.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott was less worried about Van Gundy's going over his head
than about the Knicks' tipping their hand by showing too much
interest to make any kind of deal for Payton. The Sonics were not
genuinely interested in moving Payton, so all discussions ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Tapscott approached Dave Checketts, the Garden's
president, and essentially told him that people have to be on the
same page in the Knicks organization, so that the front office will
not splinter as it did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts felt it already had, especially in view of Tapscott's
close ties to the departed Grunfeld. It was one of the main reasons
he did not elevate Tapscott to the general manager's job, though
Tapscott had been acting as the g.m. for much of the summer.
Tapscott is still under contract with the Knicks, but it won't be
long until they buy him out or he finds a more permanent situation
to employ his talents.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Layden, who must be wondering why he left Utah for this
mess. Losing Salt Lake City's quality of life _ not to mention the
pleasure of dealing with All-Stars who are also professional and
committed to the cause _ can't be worth $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all the board-room intrigue that comes with working for a
multinational conglomerate instead of one, maverick owner, this is
what Layden surveyed last week during Knicks training camp:
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrick Ewing on a running machine, his 37-year-old body
trying to overcome tendinitis in his left Achilles, no real
timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   _ The utter lack of a bona fide center; Chris Dudley is still
rehabilitating a knee injury and 7-foot-2 Frederic Weis, the
Knicks' first-round draft pick, is a slow-moving, European project
who may not play in the N.B.A. for another two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ And finally, a barrage of questions about Sprewell's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Injury. Calamity. And the unpredictability of Sprewell. The
Knicks keep going like this and they'll be back in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   SHAQ BIGGER ... BUT IS HE BETTER?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds unfathomable, but there is actually more of Shaquille
O'Neal to go around. The Diesel _ the Daddy or Shaq Fu, if you
prefer _ came into training camp weighing 340 pounds, up 10 pounds
from his playing weight of last season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal does not look flabby, and in fact the Superman tattoo on
his biceps actually stretched from all the weight-lifting. But
coming into camp that heavy was not a good way to endear himself to
Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal paid a visit to Jackson at his home in Montana after
Jackson accepted the Lakers coaching job; O'Neal was giving a rap
concert in Montana at the time. After initial pleasantries, Jackson
essentially told O'Neal he wanted him to come to camp lighter, that
he felt O'Neal was not getting up and down the court as quickly as
he once did.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gave O'Neal an ideal weight for reporting to training
camp, a number Jackson would not disclose but believed to be near
300 pounds. O'Neal was listed as 303 pounds his rookie year in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if O'Neal met his goal, Jackson said, ``No, he didn't. But
I'm not unhappy about it. I think he's in condition, that's the
major goal. The guy is in condition, so he can get up and down the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal: ``The more I lift weights, the higher the number is
going to be. I'm not really concerned about numbers. I'll bust any
big man's butt, no matter what I weigh. And you can underline it,
put two periods behind it and tell them I said it.'' He added that
he wants to increase his strength to ward off brutes in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to disagree with Shaq about those types of
things, because he gets fouled harder than anyone in the game,''
Jackson said. ``People take him down. But all the other parameters
going into it - getting up and down the court, the idea that he's
had a knee that was injured, he's had the stomach injury, all those
things - are better served if there is less weight.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   NOT THE SPREE P.J. KNEW
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell's failure to report to training camp last week
stunned P.J. Carlesimo, of all people. The Golden State coach, who
was choked by Sprewell nearly two years ago during a practice,
said, ``I don't ever remember him being late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely never missed a practice,'' Carlesimo added. ``I
remember the first training camp, he hadn't been around all summer
and the first time I saw him was five minutes before the first
meeting, but that was fine. I don't ever remember him missing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he finally got in touch with the Knicks, Sprewell was
said to be driving cross country _ from Oakland, Calif., to his
hometown of Milwaukee, and finally to New York. The Knicks should
not have counted on him for training camp, given some of Sprewell's
misadventures on the road.
</P>

   DON'T BLAME (OR CREDIT) THE BALL, SAYS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists won't buy it, but Major League Baseball has
conducted tests that show the baseball was not the reason baseballs
flew out of and all over ball parks in record numbers again this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Major league players, led once again by Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa, hit a record 5,528 home runs, and teams, led by Cleveland's
awesome Indians, scored a record 24,691 runs. The National League
set so many hitting records its computer may have to run overtime
to compile them all before next season.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result of, as well as being a major contributor to,
the NL's enhanced offense, the Colorado Rockies became only the
third NL team in this century to have an earned run average
starting with a 6.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame it on the ball, said Sandy Alderson, executive
vice president for baseball operations in the commissioner's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the documentation I have and studies that have been
done as recently as the last few months, there doesn't appear to be
any difference in the ball with the ball of 10-15 years ago,''
Alderson said. ``I know people like to point to the baseball as one
of the reasons for these changes, but as far as we can tell,
there's been no change in the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing, Alderson related, was done in conjunction with the
decision to use professionals in the Pan Am games and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure the Mizuno ball had similar
characteristics to the Rawlings ball,'' he explained. ``We did
another set of tests on Rawlings balls and those were the
conclusions. Other than the test data being faulty or the tests
themselves not being appropriate, there's no apparent change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suspicious souls have suggested that the balls have been
wound tighter, but Alderson rejected that contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's wound tighter, it would be smaller or heavier and
those things aren't happening,'' he said. ``The size of the ball,
the weight of the ball, the basic construction materials of the
ball _ taking all those things into account and doing tests for
coefficient restitution, the liveliness of the ball is essentially
the same. There's no statistical difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers associated with the ball are different, though. In
virtually the same number of games as the 1998 seasons, the two
leagues hit a total of 5,528 home runs, a 9.2 percent increase over
the previous record of 5,064 that were hit last year. Runs rose 6
percent, from a record 23,297 last year (9.58 a game) to 24,691
this season (10.17).
</P>
<P>
   The American League, for some reason, fell short of its record
totals in various hitting categories, but the NL went wild. Its
teams and players broke league records not only for most home runs
and runs but also for hits, total bases, extra-base hits, singles
and doubles. (Why not triples? Probably because Lance Johnson was
hurt much of the season.)
</P>
<P>
   The league also had its highest ERA, 4.56, while its pitchers
threw its fewest shutouts (93, down from a record 98 in 1987) for a
162-game schedule. Its pitchers would have tied the record for
fewest complete games (127 in 1996) had Al Leiter not pitched nine
innings for the Mets last Monday in their wild-card playoff victory
over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to understand,'' Alderson said, ``is
nobody is directing the game in the direction of offense. But at
the same time, we do have to keep our eye on it and make sure
regardless of what factors have led to more offense that the fans
and the players and the clubs are comfortable with where the game
is and the direction it's taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said the subject is one that officials will discuss in
the next few weeks, though not because individuals or groups have
complained about the increase in offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably needs to be looked at objectively,'' Alderson
said. ``Once we get the post-season behind us, there's an
opportunity to do that. I don't want to suggest there's anyone in
baseball who has raised it as a serious concern. Obviously it's a
fact and the important thing to understand is where we are and make
objective decisions as to what that means for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing perception in baseball is that fans like high
scoring and tons of home runs. The only group that would dispute
that stance is pitchers, but the players union would be hard
pressed to take up their cause because a majority of union members
are hitters.
</P>
<P>
   If officials should decide some greater balance, for pitchers'
sake, is needed _ and that's highly unlikely to happen this
off-season _ the most likely change would be in the strike zone, as
in going back to the rule book strike zone, basically from the
hollow of the knee to basically the uniform shirt letters.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with that idea is that Alderson tried this
season to get umpires to raise their strike zone to a top level of
two inches above the waist, and they didn't really comply. The
drastically shrunken strike zone is considered one of the major
culprits in the proliferation of home runs and runs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   HOMER-HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, with an increase in the number of home runs
that were hit came an increase in the number of players who reached
the higher echelons of home-run hitting. The National League went
from 26 to 34 in the number of players who hit 25 or more, the
American from 27 to 30. The AL had the biggest increase in any one
level, with 14 players slugging 30 to 40 compared with 6 last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, four of those 14 players finished in that group because
they tumbled from the next one up, having hit 40 or more last year.
Albert Belle plunged from 49 to 37, Jose Canseco 46 to 34, Mo
Vaughn 40 to 33 and Juan Gonzalez 45 to 39. Maintaining their
status on the 40 plus plateau were Rafael Palmiero, Manny Ramirez,
Alex Rodriguez and the ALleader, Ken Griffey Jr., though he fell
from 56 to 48.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa retained their
membership in the over 60 club, and no one joined them. But just as
remarkably, Jay Bell of Arizona hit a home run on the last day of
the regular season, enabling him to finish one ahead of Albert
Belle, 38 to 37.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   THE DIAMONDBACKS' POOR RELATIVES
</P>
<P>
   In their first season, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays finished in last place in their respective
divisions. Arizona won two more games than Tampa Bay. One year
later, the Devil Rays again finished last, gaining four more
victories than last year, but the Diamondbacks finished first with
35 more victories than they had in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question, Larry Rothschild, the Tampa Bay
manager, said, ``No, I don't have time to be envious. I'm
concentrating on what we're doing here. Would I like to be in the
playoff hunt? Yes. But that makes me envious of every team that's
in that situation, so it's not just Arizona. That's where we want
to get to. That's what the game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams, Rothschild said, have taken different routes. ``I
think it would bother me if I were a team that had been in
existence a long time and they were able to do that,'' he said.
``We started at the same time, but obviously the plans were
completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild, who served as pitching coach of the expansion
Florida Marlins when they won the 1997 World Series, applauded the
Diamondbacks for what they've achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks because you spent the money you're going to
win,'' he said. ``That's not the case and it's been proven over and
over. It gives you a chance, but you still have to assimilate those
players together. You have to make sure you got the right players.
That's not an easy thing to do. I give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Diamondbacks' poor relatives, the Marlins' manager
said he could never gain a true sense of how good they could be
because they suffered a string of devastating injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it tough to evaluate where we really are because we
didn't see this team together virtually the whole year,'' he said.
``By the same token we've seen a lot of guys play here so we can
evaluate where we are a lot easier. I think that's going to be
important for us. It's time for us to start weeding out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild estimated that if the players he had expected to be
the regulars had all remained healthy, the Devil Rays could have
won between 75 and 81 games. ``All year we'd get something going,''
he said, ``then we'd lose two or three guys. There'd be a setback
and then we'd have to regroup and come back.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BOBBY VALENTINE'S TUTOR
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine recently recalled an educational experience he
enjoyed in his early days of managing with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Texas, we had Paul Richards there,'' the Mets
manager related, referring to a legendary baseball figure. ``He was
a back room advisor. About every couple or three weeks, I'd invite
him to lunch. I'd go to his office and say what do you think, we
had first and second, the eighth and ninth hitters coming up and I
went to the bunt. What do you think. We pitched out on 1-1, the
count went to 2-1, the pitcher got behind in the count and wound up
walking him. What do you think. They were just wonderful walls to
bounce off. It wasn't so much second-guessing as education because
I had never managed before. It was a refreshing thing to do with
someone who knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not, Richards is second on the list (1,837 games)
and Valentine third (1,704) of managers who have managed the most
games without finishing first. True, Valentine has reached the
playoffs this year, but his didn't finish first. In the days of
Richards and Jimmy Dykes (2,962 games), they didn't have the
benefit of the wild card.

SENATE WEIGHS WHETHER NUCLEAR TEST BAN WOULD ERODE U.S. DETERRENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEST-BAN-ASSESS) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In debating the historic treaty that would ban all
underground nuclear testing, the Senate is reliving one of the most
divisive arguments of the Cold War: Do international arms control
treaties enhance or imperil America's nuclear deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   To its supporters, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as it is
formally known, would lock in American superiority achieved from
more than 1,000 nuclear tests since 1945, and curb the spread of
advanced atomic arms.
</P>
<P>
   But to its critics, the ban would freeze an accord-abiding
United States dangerously in place while states like North Korea
and Iran, or even China or Russia, cheated and conducted
clandestine tests that eroded America's advantage and set off a new
global arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago, the U.S.
atomic arsenal has been a hedge against not only a resurgent Russia
or hegemonic China but also a growing number of nuclear nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deterrent has never been as important to the security of
Americans as it is today with rogue states developing the capacity
to attack our cities and our population,'' said Jeane Kirkpatrick,
the U.S. delegate to the United Nations under President Reagan.
Kirkpatrick opposes the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives express fears that the test ban treaty is a
dangerous first step toward weakening America's nuclear deterrent
and preventing the United States from building newer and deadlier
weapons in the future. These critics note with alarm that the
treaty's preamble says the cessation of all nuclear weapons tests
``constitutes an effective means of nuclear disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he thinks that ``in the White
House they honestly believe that if we all stand in a circle and we
all hold hands and we all disarm, everyone is going to be happy.
I'm not at all satisfied with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters dismiss such concerns as unfounded hyperbole,
saying the United States has no intention of giving up its nuclear
shield. While the pact cannot prevent countries from building crude
nuclear devices or from conducting militarily insignificant nuclear
explosions, supporters say the pact can restrict a nation's ability
to develop and field the most advanced atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is potential proliferators who need to test. We do not,''
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the Senate Armed
Services Committee last week. ``The treaty will make it more
difficult and dangerous for countries to develop and modernize
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this debate over deterrence is the safety and
reliability of a national nuclear weapons inventory that has
steadily shrunk from 12,000 strategic warheads in the late 1980s to
about 6,000 warheads now. Under the Start 2 treaty, now pending
approval by the Russian Parliament, the American arsenal would
decline to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads _ a marked reduction that would
nonetheless leave the United States with by far the world's most
formidable nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed a moratorium on underground nuclear
tests in 1992, complementing a treaty banning atmospheric tests
adopted in 1963. The underground tests were used to try out new
designs and check for safety flaws in existing bombs. To maintain
the safety of the aging arsenal now, the government employs a
series of sophisticated computer models and non-nuclear explosive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, physicists at the nation's three nuclear weapons
laboratories _ Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore _ must
certify that the stockpile is safe and reliable. If problems are
detected in a weapon, the whole weapons class could be recalled,
effectively drawing down the nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Under a condition President Clinton attached to the test ban
treaty, the laboratory directors' failure to certify the stockpile
would be grounds for the United States to pull out of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   The government spends $4.5 billion a year on the sophisticated
test program, but in testimony last week, the laboratory directors
said it would not be fully operational for at least five to 10
years. In giving the treaty a highly conditional endorsement, the
scientists said the arsenal is safe and reliable now, but they
warned about inadequate financing, shortages of trained experts and
aging weapons in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program
will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent
without nuclear testing,'' said John C. Browne, director of Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. ``However, I am concerned
about several trends that are reducing my confidence level each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even staunch arms control advocates like Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., express reservations about the science-based substitute for
actual testing. ``The bottom line is that the Senate is being asked
to trust the security of our country to a program that is unproven
and unlikely to be fully operational until perhaps 2010,'' said
Lugar, who opposes the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were to lose its nuclear edge, critics
contend, allies now under the American umbrella might feel
compelled to develop their own atomic weapons, a scenario that
treaty supporters say is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican Policy Committee, chaired by Sen. Larry
Craig of Idaho, last week issued an analysis of the pact saying,
``Today's nuclear arsenal is adequate for current threats, but this
may not always be the case. The CTBT will limit our ability to
tailor a nuclear defense to meet unexpected threats or new
missions.''
</P>
<P>
   But under the accord, most of the 4,000 components in a nuclear
weapon can be modified, including the casings, detonators,
batteries and arming systems, nuclear physicists say. Parts that
wear out can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, the weapons laboratories modified the
B61-7 nuclear bomb into the B61-Mod 11 earth-penetrating weapon by
hardening the outer casing, improving the bomb's ability to destroy
deeply buried targets.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Pentagon has determined that it is not always
cost-efficient to incorporate the latest safety devices in all
weapons. In 1992, the Navy opted not to replace its W88 Trident
missile warhead with a new version that had a less sensitive
explosive, said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher at the
Natural Resources Defense Council's nuclear program. Instead, the
Navy devised a cheaper way to improve safety by changing the way it
loaded the warhead onto the missile, Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   Actual nuclear tests have been more important for perfecting new
types of weapons than correcting flaws in existing arms, nuclear
weapons experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the three weapons laboratories that reviewed
problems detected in the arsenal determined that of 830 specific
defects found from 1958 to 1993, fewer than 1 percent were
discovered through nuclear tests. And virtually all of the
problematic weapons have been phased out of the stockpile.

   LUBLIN, Poland _ Past the ditches where thousands were executed
by the Nazis, the crematory described as having ``a daily yield of
about 1,000 bodies,'' the gas chamber being visited by a group of
Israeli schoolchildren, the priest walks in silence.
</P>
<P>
   He is a figure of medium height, dark-haired, swarthy. The
Israeli children, some wrapped in the national flag, watch the
priest closely. Some look defiant, even angry. Others seem
intrigued, as if this Roman Catholic churchman was somehow
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish priest is not quite at ease, here in the former Nazi
concentration camp of Majdanek, surrounded by Israelis. It is
tempting to speak. But his story is complicated, and perhaps they
would not believe him. ``Seeing these young Israelis,'' he said at
last, ``I would like to go up to them and say, `I suffer in the
same way that you are suffering.'''
</P>
<P>
   His name is Romuald-Jakub Weksler-Waszkinel. He is a priest and
a teacher at Lublin's Catholic University. He is also _ as he
discovered late in life _ a Jew. He now believes that his mother,
whom he never knew, was murdered at Majdanek in 1943. He calls the
ashes near the crematory ``the tomb of my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   It took decades to reach this point, years of intermittent doubt
and confrontation. Like many born to central Europe's doomed
generations, Weksler-Waszkinel was caught in the long, unyielding
vise of two dictatorships: Nazism and communism. He was left with
fragments and lies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the priest
is satisfied that he has pieced the fragments into a semblance of
the truth. His life _ like the lost Jewish presence in many Polish
towns _ has crept out from the shadows of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism hid many things,'' said Henryk Lewandowski, a member
of Children of the Holocaust, a group founded in Warsaw in 1990
after communist rule had ended and the anti-Semitism that it
sometimes promoted had eased. ``We know of dozens of people who
have discovered in recent years they were really Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But the priest's position is scarcely comfortable. The Jews are
all but gone from Poland, 3 million of them murdered by the Nazis
during World War II. But 3 million Catholic Poles were also killed.
</P>
<P>
   This terrible equation has helped spawn seemingly unresolvable
issues: of competitive victimhood, of the degree of Polish
complicity in the Nazis' killing, of whether Poland's true identity
is that of a Catholic or a multiethnic state.
</P>
<P>
   So Weksler-Waszkinel sometimes finds himself trying to bridge
the unbridgeable. ``We are now a free country, and we have to clear
out all the garbage,'' he said. ``Too many people still believe a
reference to a Jewish stereotype as an enemy of Poland pays
politically. Too few find any place for Polish war guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear is that the priest's life amounts to a modern
Polish parable, one that speaks of the mottled truths of Poland,
truths that belie the polarizing slogans.
</P>
<P>
   He was the son of good Polish Catholics. Their name was
Waszkinel. His father, Piotr, was a metalworker; his mother,
Emilia, doted on him. These were the long unquestioned facts of his
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived, after the war, in Paslek, a town in eastern
Poland. True, a couple of drunks did yell ``Jewish orphan'' at him
once. True, he would search in the mirror sometimes for some
resemblance to his parents. But these were mere ripples on a
generally untroubled sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I asked my Polish mother, `What is a Jew?'''
Weksler-Waszkinel said. ``She replied: `Good and wise people will
not call you that. And there is no need for you to listen to bad
people.'''
</P>
<P>
   The boy liked parties, girls, the accordion; so when, at age 17,
he told Piotr and Emilia of his desire to become a priest, they
were incredulous. His Polish father implored him to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   At the seminary, the first weeks were a time of doubt. Piotr
came to visit him, took him into the chapel, and wept profusely, in
a way Weksler-Waszkinel had never seen. A few weeks later, Piotr
was dead from a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The future priest's faith wavered; he felt guilt and intense
grief at the death of the man he had always known as his father.
But then a redoubled conviction took hold: ``If my father was
afraid I would be a bad priest, it was up to me to prove I could be
a good one. My decision became irrevocable.''
</P>
<P>
   But other difficulties arose. When, in 1966, Weksler-Waszkinel
was about to be ordained, the rector told him there were serious
suspicions that he had not been baptized. He was outraged, calling
the questioning ``an insult to my parents,'' and in the end, the
objections were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was increasingly torn,'' the priest said. ``The church
always used to teach that the Jews murdered Jesus. I did not want
to be one of the murderers. It was terrible to think I could be a
Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he read more, and came to see these teachings as a
perversion, the fears ebbed. He told Emilia _ the woman he now
calls ``my Polish mother'' _ that he sensed a secret. He noted that
when he read to her about the Jews _ Emilia was illiterate _ she
often had tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you crying? Am I a Jew?'' the priest asked her in
1968, shortly after he moved to Lublin and began studying at the
Catholic University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't I love you enough?'' Emilia replied.
</P>
<P>
   Though not really an answer, this said enough. And so
Weksler-Waszkinel understood without knowing. As he relates this,
he has tears in his eyes, still shaken, it seems, by the long
deception that was also his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1978, when Emilia was briefly hospitalized because
of what was suspected to be cancer, the priest confronted her. ``I
kissed her hands,'' he said. ``I told her that the time had come
for her to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilia, at last, did not hesitate. She told the priest that his
true parents had been wonderful people who loved him. She told him
they had been Jews and they had been murdered. She said she had
only wanted to save him from a similar death.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the story then emerged. He had been born in 1943 _ the
exact date is unknown _ to a Jewish couple in the town of Stare
Swieciany, then Polish, but now known as Svencionys in Lithuania.
He had an older brother. His father was a well-known tailor. His
mother, trapped in the ghetto, made contact with Emilia and begged
her to take the infant and save him.
</P>
<P>
   Emilia hesitated. But then the priest's Jewish mother said
something decisive and eerily prescient that his Polish mother
would never forget:
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a devout Catholic. You believe in Jesus, who was a
Jew. So try to save this Jewish baby for the Jew in whom you
believe. And one day he will grow up to be a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Weksler-Waszkinel was tremulous, for he had
fulfilled the prophecy of his mother, a woman he had never known.
``You must love your mother for she was very wise,'' Emilia told
him. ``Those words she spoke were the words that saved your life
because they convinced us to take you in.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But what were his true parents' names? How were they killed?
What of his older brother? Emila said she knew nothing. She had
deliberately forgotten the names because she was afraid that, under
torture, she might reveal them.
</P>
<P>
   The priest decided to tell nobody _ except Pope John Paul II. An
enormously supportive letter came back from the recently elected
Polish pontiff, addressed to ``My Beloved Brother.'' It said the
priest's pain was part of the pain of the cross, a sign of love. It
urged him to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing he was a Jew, did Weksler-Waszkinel consider
abandoning the priesthood? ``No, I never had a doubt,'' he said.
``I knew that Jesus saved me. He found me in the ghetto. He was my
most wonderful Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining details of his family came out many years later,
through the help of a nun named Sister Klara Jaroszynksa. The
priest had heard her confession and urged her to be afraid of
nothing for he had ``been saved at five minutes to midnight and
nothing can happen to somebody who has God.''
</P>
<P>
   The nun, it turned out, had saved many Jews during the war, and
hearing the reference to salvation at ``five minutes to midnight,''
she understood. She confronted him a day later and said simply,
``You are a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters followed to people the nun knew in Israel. But it was
only in 1992, three years after the fall of communism, that she was
able to travel there and organize a meeting of survivors from Stare
Swieciany.
</P>
<P>
   When a tailor was mentioned, survivors immediately recognized
him as Jakub Weksler, who had been known to everyone as ``Jankel.''
His wife _ the priest's mother _ was called Batia.
</P>
<P>
   Weksler-Waszkinel immediately traveled to Israel. ``All my
life,'' he said with a laugh, ``I had been looking for people who
looked like me, and suddenly everybody did.'' At the airport, he
was met by Svi Weksler, his father's brother, who had lost his wife
and two daughters in World War II but escaped to Russia and
survived Soviet camps.
</P>
<P>
   It was an overwhelming reunion. The priest learned how his
father had almost certainly been shot in 1943 when the ghetto was
liquidated, and his mother and older brother, Samuel, taken to
Vilnius. From there, they were probably transported to Majdanek in
the fall of 1943, where they were killed by the Nazis. Samuel was 4
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle, who died recently, could not understand that I
remained a priest,'' Weksler-Waszkinel said. ``It angered him. He
told me I had made myself the representative of 2,000 years of
hatred toward Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest paused, before adding: ``But I know that while there
are people calling themselves Christians capable of putting a
mother and a child in a gas chamber, there is also a Polish
Catholic woman who could risk her life to save me.''
</P>
<P>
   From inside his shirt, the priest abruptly drew out an emblem on
a chain that has become the symbol of his life: a Star of David
with a cross in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the Star of David with the cross inserted,'' he said.
``That is my life as I see it. The cross is love. Without love, it
is the Roman gallows. Jesus is not responsible for the wrongs
perpetrated in his name, and I would like to resemble him, if only
a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has embraced this extraordinary identity. When the
priest wrote a second letter after finding out the story about his
true parents, the pope's reply came backed addressed to
``Romuald-Jakub Weksler-Waszkinel.'' A long name for a double life.
</P>
<P>
   In his small Lublin apartment, the priest has a photograph of
his Jewish mother _ given to him in Israel _ next to one of his
Polish mother, who died in 1989. Beside a crucifix is a prayer in
Hebrew. His predicament makes him laugh. ``You know, I can be a Jew
in Poland, but as a priest, I cannot be a Jew in Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the mirth, pain lingers. He wonders still about a
brother of his mother who left for America early in the century. He
worries because he recently found a pamphlet called ``The Myth of
the Holocaust'' at a Lublin newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to see all the Israeli students at Majdanek,'' he
said. ``But I wish they went around in the company of Polish kids.
In Israel, wrong things are said about Poland. And here, the
stupidities about Jews persist. I am in the middle, and I know that
what is needed is contact, understanding and love.''

SCIENCE VS. THE BIBLE. DEBATE MOVES TO THE COSMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientific lessons about the origins of life have long been
challenged in public schools, but some Bible literalists are now
adding the reigning theory about the origin of the universe to
their list of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly overlooked in the furor over the Kansas Board of
Education's decision in August to remove evolution from its
education standards was a decision on the much wider realm governed
by the science of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by a handful of scientists whose literal faith in the
Bible has helped persuade them that the universe is only a few
thousand years old, the board deleted from its standards a
description of the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins, the central
organizing principle of modern astronomy and cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bang theory, based on decades of astronomical
observations and physics research, suggests that the universe
originated in a colossal explosion of matter and radiation some 15
billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But ``young Earth creationists,'' as they are generally known,
have come up with their own theories to explain how cosmic history
could be condensed into mere thousands of years. They are making
this case in books, pamphlets and lectures, as well as on a number
of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists consider their theories to be wildly out
of line with reality, even though books describing them are often
liberally sprinkled with references to authorities like Albert
Einstein and Stephen Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, physical scientists now find themselves in a fight
in which they have seldom played a public role. They have responded
with a mixture of disdain, disbelief and consternation, and the
reactions have not been limited to physicists and cosmologists in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of
the universe in terms of modern science,'' said Jerome Friedman, a
physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was
awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990 for collaborating in the discovery of
the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the
American Physical Society. ``That's a terrible loss,'' Friedman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hume A. Feldman, a cosmologist at the University of Kansas in
Lawrence who has worked at Princeton University and the Canadian
Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, called the matter
``frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into cosmology, I never thought I would get
involved in anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said that developments in his state bore a distant
resemblance to the difficulties of political scientists under
communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and that he feared that such
pressures could impair the educational system.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the creationist view say alarm over their
theories is overblown. Steve Abrams, a member of the Kansas board
and veterinarian in Arkansas City who was among the leaders of the
push to make the changes, said there are legitimate scientific
doubts about whether the universe is more than several thousand
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sufficient data to lend credibility to the idea that
we do not have all the answers for teaching the origin of our
universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by John W. Bacon, a board member from
Olathe who also voted with a narrow 6-4 majority for the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand what they're squealing about,'' Bacon said
of scientists who oppose the board's action. Millions or billions
of years ago, Bacon said, ``I wasn't here, and neither were they.
Based on that, whatever explanation they may arrive at is a theory
and it should be taught that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Those objections closely mirror criticisms leveled at evolution
by its opponents. Alabama biology textbooks, for example, must
carry a warning that reads in part: ``No one was present when life
first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life's
origins should be considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas challenge to the teaching of the Big Bang is not the
first public objection to the theory on religious or political
grounds. Three years ago, the school superintendent of a
conservative county in western Kentucky ordered two pages that
explained the Big Bang in grade-school textbooks to be glued
together. The superintendent said that the Big Bang should not have
been explained without including the Biblical version of creation
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the Kansas standards does not preclude the
teaching of mainstream biology, physics or cosmology, allowing
teachers to present alternative viewpoints if they choose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But because the standards are used as the basis for state tests,
the changes will probably have a practical effect on what is
taught, said Dr. Bill Wagnon, a professor of history at Washburn
University in Topeka and a board member who voted in the minority.
Students' scores on those tests help determine whether a school
receives accreditation from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curriculum standards describe that process of what needs
to be covered,'' Wagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   So radical were the Kansas board's recommendations that it has
been unable to publish its own standards, or even to display them
on its Web site. That is because the standards include long
extracts from a book on education standards that was published by
the National Research Council. Because of its disapproval of the
board's revised standards, the council has refused permission for
them to be reprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the expunging of evolution, the board also took out
references to the hundreds of millions of years of Earth's geologic
ages and modified sections on using the slow decay of radioactive
elements to measure the ages of fossils and other rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most striking changes, however, was the removal of
passages in the original standards dealing with the Big Bang.
Cosmologists see ample evidence for that explosion in the present
expansion of the universe, in a diffuse afterglow in space called
the cosmic background radiation, and in the precise abundances of
light elements like hydrogen and helium that were left over from
the cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists have also calculated the way in which stars,
galaxies and clusters of galaxies coalesced from slight ripples in
the primordial soup that emerged from the Big Bang. To date, the
results of those calculations match the increasingly precise
observations of such structures in the heavens. Of course, for all
its success in accounting for observations, the Big Bang is indeed
just a theory, although it is one with few scientific dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for the Young Earth Creationists is
explaining the time that has apparently passed since the light we
see from distant galaxies was emitted. Given the constancy of the
speed of light and estimates of the distance between Earth and
faraway galaxies it is difficult to explain how Earth and the
cosmos could be young.
</P>
<P>
   But D. Russell Humphreys, a nuclear weapons engineer at Sandia
National Laboratory who is also an adjunct professor at the
Institute for Creation Research near San Diego, thinks he has an
answer. In an interview, he said that Einstein's equations of
relativity, the basis of the Big Bang theory, could be used to
construct a universe in which the Earth is only a few thousand
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said that in thinking about the Kansas standards he had
been struck by Humphreys' book, ``Starlight and Time: Solving the
Puzzle of Distant Starlight in a Young Universe'' (Master Books,
fifth printing in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys' ideas ``seem to be right there on the cutting edge,
so to speak,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   But most cosmologists say they are simply out of left field.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The theory relies on a peculiar feature of Einstein's equations,
which predict that powerful gravitational fields can speed the
progress of time and, in effect, make clocks run at different rates
in different places. So Humphreys assumes that the Earth is close
to the center of a structure related to a black hole, in which
gravity is especially intense, that billions of years could pass in
deep space while only a few thousand years went by on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Such a universe ``has clocks clicking at drastically different
rates in different parts,'' Humphreys said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward L. Wright, vice chairman for astronomy at UCLA, said
that there is no evidence the Earth is at the center of the
universe, nor that such tremendous gravitational fields exist
outside of ordinary black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Wright, the acceleration of time would alter the
vibrations of waves of light, shortening its wave length and
turning it into deadly gamma rays. Bombarded by such radiation, he
said, ``the Earth would be sterilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys, whose research in cosmology is unrelated to his work
at the lab, said other features of his model would prevent the
frequency increase.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams also appealed to a theory that the speed of light was
almost infinitely fast in the past, meaning that the light from
extremely distant galaxies could have reached Earth quickly and
would not be billions of years old.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to writings on this subject by Dr. Danny Faulkner, a
professor of astronomy on the University of South Carolina's
Lancaster campus and an adjunct professor at the Institute for
Creation Science. In a telephone interview, Faulkner cautioned that
he had merely been describing ideas put forth by other scientists
in the creationist movement and was not certain that the changing
speed of light was correct. Indeed, high-precision measurements of
the speed of light and other crucial physical constants have
revealed no detectable change in their values over recent time.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the age of the universe has exposed intense
disagreements not just in schools but also among evangelical
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often young-universe and old-universe creationists focus more
energy on defending their respective positions than on reaching out
to nonbelievers,'' wrote Dr. Hugh Ross, a former radioastronomer
who is an evangelical Christian, in ``Creation and Time: A Biblical
and Scientific Perspective on the Creation-Date Controversy''
(NavPress, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Ross thinks that a literal reading of the Bible can be
reconciled with the Big Bang, but says that his views are
distinctly in the minority among evangelical Christians. The six
days of Genesis could stand for ``six consecutive long periods of
time,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the issue for many Bible literalists means
that cosmologists could face the pressures that biologists have
dealt with since John Scopes was convicted of violating a Tennessee
law against the teaching of evolution in 1925, said Dr. Eugenie C.
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science
Education, Inc., in El Cerrito, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think physical scientists are going to be immune to
this,'' Dr. Scott said. ``It would be very unwise for them to brush
this off.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wisconsin, of all places, suddenly has the jitters about cutting
families off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the state's famously tough work rules have swept
more than 57,000 families from the rolls and turned a war on
welfare into a social experiment commanding international
attention. Almost 90 percent of the families that were getting
welfare checks three years ago no longer receive them, and envious
bureaucrats from around the globe visit the state to hear officials
boast of the disappearing dole.
</P>
<P>
   But Wisconsin is now grappling with the ultimate symbol of the
new welfare age: time limits. Virtually everyone on welfare in the
state is required to join a work program, and there are two-year
limits on those jobs. This month, for the first time, a handful of
Wisconsin families have hit the deadline. As a result, They could
lose their checks not for refusing to work for their aid, but
simply for staying in the program too long.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what to do with these families has everyone
involved in the welfare system on edge, with the revealing
exception of the poor themselves. In theory, time limits are
supposed to push the needy down the path to self-reliance. In
practice, most poor people are too tangled in the chaos of daily
life to give it much thought. Instead, the limits have had an
impact far more complex and indirect than the political slogans
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   What they have set into motion are waves of worry along
bureaucratic fronts. Competing approaches to enforcement are in
play as requests for extensions arrive. The state officials who
oversee the program are quarreling with the private agencies that
run it. And all are looking to avoid blame when families stay mired
in problems that are sometimes decades in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the proliferating subplots, the deadlines have had at least
one clearly positive effect: Afraid of being called to task or even
fined for their clients' slow progress, welfare agencies are
revisiting old cases with new intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear how much even the best social work can
accomplish, especially as troubled lives collide with expiring
clocks. And the heightened concern about these few families
implicitly raises questions about the tens of thousands dropped
from welfare before them without nearly as much thought.
</P>
<P>
   Though the program, Wisconsin Works, or W-2, prides itself on
being tough, so far the forces of caution have prevailed.
Forty-eight recipients have sought extensions to the two-year limit
and all have received them, putting off the day of reckoning by
three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the worry over Robin Edwards, a 38-year-old mother of
six who works as a janitor at a Milwaukee parochial school in
exchange for a monthly welfare check of $673. A painfully shy woman
who stares at the ground when she talks, she reads at the
third-grade level and is unclear about such basics as what year her
deadline expires. ``I'm really not too sure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her time expired this month. As it did, it added to the
concern up the bureaucratic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   At Y-W Works, a private agency in Milwaukee that handles her
case, social workers redoubled a two-year effort to help Ms.
Edwards find a regular wage-paying job. Sabrina Lee returned to Ms.
Edwards' problems with child care. Pepita Johnson gave weekly
lessons on talking to employers. Mark Miller lined up interviews at
a hospital and a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges before them were considerable. In the past 10
years, Ms. Edwards had held just one private job, for a few weeks.
Among the skills she is trying to acquire are the rudiments of
workplace grooming. ``They tell me, `Don't go in there with body
odor on you,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the social workers attended to Ms. Edwards, the head of Y-W
Works, Julia Taylor, asked the state for more time.
</P>
<P>
   J. Jean Rogers, the state official who oversees W-2 and is a
strict critic of welfare, personally sifted through two years of
case notes to review the agency's work with Ms. Edwards. Ms. Rogers
gave Ms. Edwards three more months, but only after urging Y-W Works
to follow a seven-point action plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact employers with whom she has interviewed to determine
for certain why she is not being hired,'' she wrote. ``Engage her
in family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers' decisions, in turn, are reviewed by aides to her
boss, Linda Stewart, the secretary of the Department of Workforce
Development, who is considered more of a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The entire process is buffeted by competing political concerns.
Saying many families have not received enough help, critics of W-2
have threatened to sue on behalf of the first recipients who lose
their aid. ``The state should extend the deadline for everyone,
given the disarray the program was in,'' said Pat DeLessio, a
welfare rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But conservative supporters of welfare time limits are warning
against retreat. ``We have to make sure that time limits have
teeth,'' said state Rep. John Gard, a Republican who sponsored the
legislation creating W-2. ``If we get into the second month of
this, and people are still waiving every case, we'll need to
scrutinize this closely.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Edwards, though she is getting a remarkable amount of
attention, her circumstances are not particularly remarkable.
Officials often describe the last cases as the hardest, but work
programs like W-2 sometimes affect the most troubled families
first: addicted, depressed or disturbed clients often just
disappear. For every client now getting a second look, there may
well be two or three others with similar problems who vanished into
the post-welfare world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards had a spotty history in the program, sometimes
missing weeks work at a stretch. But Y-W Works continued to pursue
her. And its efforts just produced a result that took her by
surprise: She got a job. On Oct. 1 she began working three days a
week as a janitor at a Toys 'R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   No one pretends her problems are solved. With only a part-time
job, Ms. Edwards is still on welfare _ she now sweeps the school
two days a week _ and her clock is still ticking. Supporters of
time limits would call her breakthrough a testament to the power of
deadlines. Critics would describe her as a vulnerable woman whose
safety net is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Her supervisor at the school, Venus McMurry, sounds a
pessimistic note. ``I don't care what anybody says, the girl's not
ready to work,'' Ms. McMurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards offers no predictions about where this experiment is
heading. ``Hopefully, I'll have some luck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though they swept the country appearing inevitable, time limits
on welfare were anything but. Until Bill Clinton ran for president
in 1992, few welfare experts had pondered them and no states had
tried them.
</P>
<P>
   While time limits are now hailed by conservatives, they were
first proposed by a liberal, Professor David Ellwood, an economist
at Harvard. He wanted to give the poor two or three years of
training and then require those still on the rolls to work for
their checks. But they would remain eligible for aid, with the
government, if necessary, providing the jobs, along with other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used that plan as a template for his 1992 pledge to
``end welfare as we know it.'' Like Ellwood, Clinton merely
proposed sending the poor to a work site after a few years. He
never suggested dropping them from the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives seized on his bold rhetoric and called for
doing just that. ``Ending welfare,'' they argued, meant enforcing
finite periods of eligibility, period. Otherwise, they said, the
poor would lack the motivation to leave the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, this new definition prevailed: not time limits followed by
work assignments, but time limits followed by nothing. Under attack
for failing to keep his ``end welfare'' pledge, Clinton accepted a
Republican plan in 1996, signing a law that placed a five-year
lifetime limit on eligibility for federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The law permits states to set shorter limits, and Wisconsin is
one of 20 that have. It also allows states to exempt 20 percent of
their welfare families from the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   At first, time limits appeared to be one of the most
consequential features of the new welfare law. The Urban Institute,
a Washington research group, predicted that of the 5 million
families then on welfare, 1.4 million would suddenly be dropped in
2001 when their five-year limit expired. But a good economy and
tough work rules have already cut the country's welfare rolls
nearly in half, and as a result, the impact time limits will come
to have is now less clear. Many of the 2.7 million families still
receiving aid are expected to leave the rolls before their
deadlines expire. And after such precipitous reductions, states may
treat those who reach the deadlines permissively.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state evidence is mixed. Some of the largest have
rejected the strict limits envisioned by federal law. California
and New York, which account for a third of the nation's recipients,
have said that after five years they will reduce, but not
eliminate, a family's cash aid. If necessary, they will finance the
continued payments themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, by contrast, is rigorously enforcing a two-year
limit. Of the first 5,000 families to reach the limit, about 70
percent lost their cash assistance. (Time limits do not affect food
stamps or Medicaid.) Similarly, Louisiana dropped 4,200 families
this year, about 10 percent of its caseload, after they reached a
two-year limit. Time limits in Connecticut have cut the most
families, about 19,000, but the vast majority were working families
who would have been ineligible for welfare in most states.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence about how the limits work, most analysts turn to
Pensacola, Fla., which began experimenting with them in 1994. As in
Wisconsin, the poor seemed to pay the deadlines little mind.
Families given limits of two or three years left the rolls no
quicker than a control group of other families.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers found that the Pensacola program, like
Wisconsin's, did motivate caseworkers. ``They felt like they really
had to pay attention to people as they approached the time limit,''
said Dan Bloom of Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a New York
City group that evaluated the program. Likening time limits to
shock therapy, Bloom said creative managers might be able to find
other ways to motivate caseworkers. But, he added, ``it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin would seem the last place to fret about families
losing welfare. When Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, took office
in 1987 after an anti-welfare campaign, there were nearly 100,000
families on the rolls. Now there are 7,700.
</P>
<P>
   But as a few dozen families now seek extensions, tensions are
running high. Consider the jousting around Simona Alva, a Mexican
immigrant who went on welfare seven years ago after her husband
fell ill with epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   An outgoing woman with 11 children and 10 cockateels, Ms. Alva
insists her ability to work is limited. She speaks no English. She
gets lost on city buses. Though seven of her children are grown,
she worries that a mentally ill son, who is 24, will burn down the
house without her supervision. And like many Hispanic women, who
are leaving welfare more slowly than blacks or whites, she feels
her place is in her home, watching over her troubled family. ``The
woman is supposed to take care of the man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining W-2, Ms. Alva has held the least demanding of two
major types of jobs in the program, called a ``transitions'' job.
She spends four hours a day, under close supervision, at a plant,
packing books and calendars. But with eligibility at each job level
limited to two years, she is now expected to move up to a more
demanding ``community service'' job. The combined eligibility for
all work levels is five years. Since clients are generally required
to move up the ladder, those in community service are expected to
leave the program for regular jobs after two years. They are the
ones most affected by the current deadline.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Alva's Y-W Works, the private agency requested an
extension, arguing that her ability to work is ``complicated by her
husband's and her son's disabilities.'' State officials were
skeptical. ``This seems to be a person who is ready to move up,''
they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The agency resisted. (``Her illiteracy renders her vulnerable in
the workplace.'') The state pushed back. (``She can communicate
functionally.'') In the end, the state gave Ms. Alva six more
months to study English and to find care for her husband and son.
</P>
<P>
   These first decisions have been shaped by at least three layers
of bureaucratic politics. One involves tensions between the private
welfare agencies and advocacy groups for the poor. Eager to avoid a
lawsuit, some agencies are seeking extensions for any client who
wants one, shifting the burden to the state. ``It's a game of
chicken to see who's going to be the first to make a denial,'' said
an official at one agency.
</P>
<P>
   To circumvent the time limits, some agencies are also quietly
shifting clients to an easier level of work _ buying them two more
years of eligibility. Between May and July, as the deadlines
approached, the number of Milwaukee clients placed in the
least-taxing ``transitions'' jobs grew 11 percent as overall rolls
declined.
</P>
<P>
   A second level of tension pits the agencies against the state.
Under state contract, agencies can be fined $5,000 for any
``failure to serve'' a client. So far, no fines have been issued,
but Ms. Rogers, the presiding state official, has sometimes
criticized the Milwaukee agencies. With Ms. Rogers examining every
request for an extension herself, the flurry of social work is
sometimes designed as a defense.
</P>
<P>
   A third level of tension exists among state officials
themselves, as suggested by the contrasting tenor of their remarks
in recent interviews. Ms. Rogers is a firm believer in time limits
who has longtime ties to the governor. ``If time limits are
serious, you have to treat them seriously,'' she said. ``You don't
just look for some external reason'' to grant an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss, Ms. Stewart, sounded a less serious note. ``I don't
think our legislators expect us to be punitive toward people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tensions, families that might have been left to
languish are getting a second look. At Y-W Works, a weekly
brainstorming session shows the personalized attention that the
system can muster at its best. Client by client, a roomful of
social workers revisited the struggles of people approaching the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one: ``She's a schizophrenic who refuses to take her
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``She finds it hard to stop using marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   And another: ``She just plain flat out doesn't have the
emotional energy to do anything about where she is in life.''
</P>
<P>
   While such personal attention was virtually unknown under the
old welfare system, in a race against a deadline its achievements
remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of workers were sent to the homes of the schizophrenic
woman and the woman on marijuana. But that was just a start. The
depressed woman had the group stumped. Her Medicaid plan will pay
for only six visits with a therapist. ``We've got to find something
better than that,'' her caseworker said.
</P>
<P>
   If the meeting shows the system at its most conscientious, it
also shows that clients can _ indeed, often do _ still fall through
the cracks. After all, these are families who have made little
progress in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes caseworkers miss problems. Often clients hide their
problems. Turnover among caseworkers is high. And families that
move must often start over at a new agency, since cases are
apportioned geographically. The schizophrenic woman had just been
transferred to Y-W Works after passing through three other private
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. DeLessio, the welfare rights lawyer, called Y-W Works
one of the more attentive agencies, she said the system as a whole
had failed to live up to the promises behind time limits. ``The
whole idea is we were going to do these individualized assessments
and get people the services they need,'' she said. ``That did not
happen on any consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor, the agency head, says the issue is less the casework
than the difficulty of the cases. Of the first 10 Y-W Works clients
to reach their limit, five were physically disabled or caring for
disabled relatives. Five spoke little or no English. On average,
they had a fifth-grade reading level and had been on welfare for
the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ambivalent about time limits,'' Ms. Taylor said. ``They do
help create a sense of urgency, and sometimes that's helpful. But
we're dealing with really difficult problems. It's not something
that's going to necessarily get solved in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   In mulling extensions, sometimes the hardest cases are easiest,
because the need for more time seems most obvious. Such is the case
with Elise Moore, another schizophrenic woman. She often refuses
medication and will attend her work assignment only if her
housemate comes with her. Even then, she often flees. ``If I hear
voices, I'm gone,'' she says. ``I don't want to be around people
when I start to scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Her case generated no dissent: State officials quickly agreed to
an additional six months. Y-W Works plans to use the time to help
Ms. Moore reapply for federal disability benefits. A more difficult
challenge, in Wisconsin and beyond, involves people with less
obvious, but perhaps no less disabling, problems. On the surface,
Loretta Triplett, 48, seems, if anything, overdue to leave welfare
for work. She has a high school degree. Three of her four children
are grown.
</P>
<P>
   And she insists she could find work if she had to. ``It needs to
be a position I'm going to enjoy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a program that promotes entry-level work, statements like
that, if taken alone, could disqualify her from an extension.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface, Ms. Triplett is stalked by more than
finicky standards. She has battled depression for 35 years and
tried medication without success. Tensions at home add to her
worries. She said her son drinks heavily and sometimes turns
violent. With her daughter susceptible to depression as well, Ms.
Triplett often finds herself caring for three young grandchildren.
She is self-conscious about her missing front teeth, and she
conducts job-interviews _ indeed, most conversations _ through
clenched lips. ``I don't like to smile,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tight-lipped about her problems as well, Ms. Triplett began
opening up to a counselor at Y-W Works only recently, shortly
before her benefits were scheduled to expire.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, she will join legions of Wisconsin women in the
post-welfare world, many with similar problems. About two-thirds
find at least sporadic work, according to most surveys. Others turn
to families or boyfriends. Relatively few have wound up on the
streets. But relatively few have escaped poverty. Most simply find
new ways to get by.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ms. Triplett began a new work assignment, at the
electric company. Arguing she could gain new clerical skills, Y-W
Works asked for another six months. The state gave her three. ``I
don't know what the additional time is going to do,'' said Anne
Paczesny, her counselor. ``We don't want to cut her off. We see her
as making progress. It's just not as fast as W-2 wants.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's welfare rolls down 47 percent, Clinton, as
well as his Republican critics, count the 1996 welfare law as the
cornerstone of their respective legacies. The law replaced a
60-year-old cash safety net with time limits and work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of ''ending
welfare.'' A decade ago, 100,000 families relied on public aid. Now
7,700 do. The changes taking place in the state, particularly in
Milwaukee, its largest city, continue to reverberate in broad and
unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times is
returning to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.

WASHINGTON WAR OF WORDS ON POLICING NUCLEAR TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also BC-TEST-BAN-TREATY) 
jt) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mystery unfolded last year when India, on May 13, announced
that it had set off a pair of nuclear blasts. The global network of
seismometers _ sensitive devices buried deep in the earth to
monitor shock waves from distant earthquakes and blasts _ recorded
no faint rumbles emanating from India's underground test site in
its northwestern desert. There was no blip, no twitch of pen or
meter suggesting the awesome power of the atom had just been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Had India faked the explosive tests? Were they flops? Or had
small blasts eluded the eavesdroppers? And if they had, what did
that mean for a global ban on nuclear blasts in which compliance
was to be assiduously verified?
</P>
<P>
   These questions have a strong bearing on the bruising battle in
Washington over whether the Senate should bless Washington's
participation in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which more than
150 nations have signed.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and foes have engaged in a war of words, with arms
control experts from the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Department of Energy warning Congress that the United States would
have a hard time knowing if foreign states were secretly setting
off small blasts. But two of the world's top groups of earth
scientists weighed in heavily on the side of treaty backers, saying
technology could easily police the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban supporters say that even current sensors are up to
the job and that the network called for by the treaty will be even
better. Moreover, this official network will be augmented by the
rapid global spread of all kinds of private sensors, including
seismometers and spy satellites. All this, treaty advocates say,
will make it hard to hide all but the smallest blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Though opponents of the treaty point to the Indian claim as a
test-ban embarrassment, the emerging consensus among nuclear
experts is that what failed that day was not global monitoring gear
but the pair of explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian claims were exaggerated,'' said George Perkovich,
author of ``India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California), to
be published this week. The problems were so great, he added, that
India had another nuclear device in the ground that it left
undetonated.
</P>
<P>
   To police the globe for clandestine blasts, the nuclear test ban
treaty calls for 321 monitoring stations _ 170 to detect
underground shock waves, 80 to sniff the air for telltale
radioactivity, 60 to listen for revealing sounds and 11 to track
undersea booms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a suspicious occurrence cannot be resolved through
consultation and clarification,'' says a treaty document, ``each
state party has the right to request an on-site inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   This array of monitoring devices should be be able to detect
nuclear blasts as small as a kiloton, or equal to 1,000 tons of
high explosives. On recording gear for earthquakes, experts say,
such a blast would measure about magnitude 4, like a minor tremor.
</P>
<P>
   In the bomb business, 1,000 tons is indisputably small. The
weapon that leveled Hiroshima had a power of about 15,000 tons, and
the first hydrogen bomb was about 700 times as powerful, enough to
cause the Pacific isle of Elugelab, one mile in diameter, to
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   The American Geophysical Union and the Seismological Society of
America, in a joint statement released last week in Washington,
said that when arrays of sensors called for by the treaty are all
switched on worldwide, ``no nation could rely upon successfully
concealing a program of nuclear testing, even at low yields'' in
which blasts are very small.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory E. van der Vink, an earth scientist at Princeton
University who helped draft the statement, said existing
instruments already exceed the treaty's monitoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for such places as the underground test sites in China
and Russia, Dr. van der Vink added, the sensitivity of existing
seismic detectors is already up to hundreds of times better than
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the treaty's own 170 seismic stations will
be augmented and strengthened by thousands of private ones run by
universities and research institutions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most private seismic sensors track earthquakes. But for decades
such detectors have also been used for monitoring arms control
treaties and nuclear blasts, whose characteristic signatures in
most cases are easy to distinguish. ``We've had 40 years to work on
this and we've done quite well,'' Jeffrey Park, a Yale geologist
who helped draft the scientists' statement, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists cautioned that no verification system can be
perfect. But they added that treaty monitoring would be good enough
to detect all but the most egregious cheating, which would require
not only great cost and skill but would probably be exposed anyway
by satellite photographs or atmospheric sampling
</P>
<P>
   Some of the trickiest spots to monitor are old underground
nuclear test areas _ like Novaya Zemlya in Russia's northern
archipelago, Lop Nor in China's northwestern desert and the Nevada
Test Site in the American West _ where the treaty allows
non-nuclear tests, including the detonation of conventional
explosives to compress nuclear fuels short of firing.
</P>
<P>
   Such tests are considered vital for checking weapon safety and
reliability. Although it can be hard to distinguish their seismic
effects from those of very small nuclear blasts, nuclear blasts
emit certain radioactive isotopes of xenon, a colorless, odorless,
highly unreactive gas _ gas that invariably percolates up through
the ground. Sniffing for such gas is to be a main job of
atmospheric surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Turnbull, a top CIA seismologist, has long warned of
clever ways to evade detection of nuclear explosions. In 1995, he
briefed industry executives on how foes could use large mines or
caves for small clandestine blasts. The surrounding air would
soften the bomb's shock waves, in theory making them so diminutive
as to be undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn R. Sykes, a seismologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University and an authority on detecting
nuclear blasts, dismissed the CIA's fears as groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing in a cavity is portrayed as easy, when in fact it is
exceedingly difficult,'' he said. And experts say even deft
clandestine tests would still emit telltale xenon gas, in theory
allowing the cheats to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   What of small blasts that somehow managed to escape detection?
After the Cold War, official disclosures made clear that the
superpowers had occasionally done very small tests underground.
Most of these small explosions _ all below 1,000 tons _ were done
after the superpowers had mastered the art of producing big blasts.
The intentional making of tiny nuclear explosions can be difficult
for a novice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of a beginner doing anything under a kiloton is
zilch,'' said Dr. Ray E. Kidder, a scientist at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California and a former bomb
designer. Besides, he noted, there would be strong incentive to
progress to larger blasts more useful for bomb design.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., a former Pentagon official in the
Reagan administration who now directs the Center for Security
Policy, a private Washington group that opposes the test ban, said
tests below 1,000 tons were sufficient to investigate some aspects
of the atomic triggers used to ignite hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be very valuable militarily,'' he said in an
interview. ``And from such a successful test you can extrapolate.''
Small blasts, he added, echoing the view of some intelligence
officials, ``can escape detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney concluded that the treaty is a bad thing. ``Our hands
are tied,'' he said. ``And everybody else does what they want.''

INDONESIA PLANS TO INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF ATROCITIES IN EAST
TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975
and yielded the shattered territory to foreign troops three weeks
ago, is organizing a commission to investigate reports of
atrocities committed by militia groups and the Indonesian army.
</P>
<P>
   The question hanging in the air is: how can a country that
annexed and brutally subjugated its neighbor for nearly a
quarter-century investigate its own behavior and bring those
responsible to justice?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic that we can do it,'' said Marzuki Darusman,
the chairman of the National Human Rights Commission. ``What we
lack in initial credibility or trust will be balanced out by tults of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But many human rights experts say Indonesia's effort is doomed
from the start. They say that only an inquiry led by the United
Nations can document the killing and burning that erupted after a
majority of East Timorese voted for independence on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some say the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, which
voted last week to undertake its own inquiry, should steer clear of
the Indonesian investigation to avoid being tainted by association
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought justice would actually be done, I would be fully
supportive of an in-country investigation,'' said Sidney Jones, the
Asia director of Human Rights Watch. ``I don't think there is any
possibility of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Indonesia is plowing ahead. On Friday, President B.J.
Habibie signed a law enabling the National Human Rights Commission
to set up a tribunal to prosecute civilians and soldiers for crimes
against humanity in East Timor and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a landmark decision,'' Darusman said. ``Under present
circumstances, if a general is identified as being responsible for
crimes, it's almost impossible to have that person tried. But now
we're able to bypass that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Such powers could be critical in giving legitimacy to a
home-grown investigation. Human rights experts have accused
Indonesia's army of arming anti-independence militias and allowing
them to go on a rampage after the independence vote.

   Indonesia's military leaders deny that they sanctioned the
brutality in East Timor. But military analysts said it was unlikely
that the militias would have been allowed to carry out a sustained
and methodical campaign of destruction without the consent of
high-level officers in Jakarta. Previous investigations in
Indonesia have tended to focus on soldiers rather than their
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of military impunity is one of the major problems
facing Indonesia,'' said Tessa Piper, a senior program officer at
the Asia Foundation here, ``and it will continue to be a major
problem until they address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said that under the decree signed by Habibie, the
Indonesian commission could indict the army's top commanders if it
believed that they were responsible for the bloodshed in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Darusman said he did not want to prejudge the
situation. He said the inquiry could disprove the perception abroad
that East Timor is a ``war zone'' where thousands of people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said Indonesia's investigation would seek to answer
five questions: Was there genocide? Were Indonesian armed forces
involved in militia actions? Was there a policy of arson? Were
people forcibly deported from East Timor? And were there other
crimes, like rape or torture?
</P>
<P>
   He said it would also look into reports of violations committed
by soldiers in the Australian-led military force. He declined to be
specific, except to say that the reported violations affected both
militia members and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Australian troops killed two militiamen after the
men ambushed a military convoy in the East Timorese town of Suai.
They were the first fatalities in what has been a generally
peaceful operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the Indonesian government has shown few signs it will
cooperate with a U.N. investigation, Darusman said he hoped that
the United Nations would help Indonesia's inquiry. He said the
Indonesians could use expertise in areas such as forensic
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptics acknowledge that if Indonesia's investigation were
successful, it could set a valuable precedent. Indonesia's
commission has had a poor record in East Timor, in part because it
was identified as being opposed to independence.
</P>
<P>
   By conducting an aggressive investigation of the atrocities
committed there, it could compensate for these weaknesses and build
up the credibility to pursue abuses in other troubled parts of this
restive country.

   NEW YORK _ As public health threats go, they could not have been
more different. The West Nile-like encephalitis virus, which broke
out in New York City in August, travels by mosquitoes that feed on
infected birds and then bite humans. It tends to sicken elderly
people the worst. The E. coli epidemic, which happened
simultaneously in upstate New York, was food-borne. E. coli strikes
the elderly too, but more often makes children the most ill. One
disease, never before been seen in the Western Hemisphere, is in
fact generally quite benign. The other is somewhat common, with the
potential to greatly sicken many people under the right
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ask around pediatricians' offices and the New York City
Department of Health, and what do people fear the most? Hands down,
West Nile. In recent weeks, the region seemed close to hysteria
over the virus: Phones lit up in record numbers at the health
department, parents in areas where there was not a single case kept
their children indoors, TV reporters talked in stern tones about
the plague among us. The E. coli outbreak, one of the worst the
nation has ever seen, got scant media coverage and provoked little
public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, this seems understandable. West Nile is exotic to
the New York region, and therefore stirs fear of the unknown. E.
coli is generally perceived to be the result of human error or
oversight _ undercooked meat or negligence with the water supply _
and thus preventable. Perhaps more important, the E. coli outbreak
occurred upstate, off the radar screen of city media, in a rural
area that may be perceived to have lower public health standards
than the city. (Untreated well water at a county fair was tainted
with cow manure from a nearby farm.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the West Nile virus is the lesser peril, especially to
children, the focus of so much parental worry lately. It generally
produces very mild symptoms, especially in healthy, younger people.
Six older people have died _ the youngest was in her 60s _ but more
typical are the dozens of people suspected of having contracted
mild to semi-serious cases of the illness, including one child. In
contrast, infection with E. coli bacteria can escalate quickly from
diarrhea to dementia to death, and the outbreak upstate sickened
hundreds and sent 10 children to the hospital, killing one. At
least eight were on kidney dialysis early on, fighting for their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The two outbreaks affirm that what arouses fear and loathing in
the disease world often defies epidemiological logic. In fact,
hair-raising though little-publicized epidemics happen all the
time, hurting far more people, including children, than the West
Nile virus has. Last week, officials in upstate Chautauqua County
announced a whooping cough epidemic, with over 250 confirmed cases.
Unlike West Nile, that disease does not depend on mosquitoes to
carry it south to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But herald an illness that has never before passed American
shores and watch the panic ensue. ``We know from past experiences
that people get frightened by things that are new and different,''
said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the acting deputy director for science
and public health at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Ebola, bird virus, hantavirus _ all have
caused great fear in recent years. But worldwide what kills more
people, especially children, than all of these? Respiratory
illnesses, Ostroff said. ``You don't hear anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health policy often unwittingly accompanies panic. For
instance, New York will almost certainly devote huge efforts to
mosquito control next year (critics say they're long overdue) even
as vaccination programs for seemingly outdated diseases are
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know why there is a single case of whooping cough
in New York state,'' said Dr. Charles Calisher, a professor of
microbiology at Colorado State University. ``That means to me that
that vaccine hasn't been given to everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that if someone comes into New York with West Nile
fever, they are a huge danger to the rest of the population,''
Calisher added. ``But the same thing is true about whooping cough
upstate. That illness is a threat to New York City unless vaccine
coverage is 100 percent, which it never is.''
</P>
<P>
   Government and the media often unwittingly conspire to keep the
focus on certain illnesses. While New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
took pains to present West Nile as largely benign, he and the
health department also held frequent, urgent press conferences on
the matter. One such event was called hastily at 6 p.m. on a
Friday. The agenda? To announce a few new confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough,'' admitted Maria Mitchell, a former city health
commissioner who is now president of AMDEC, a biomedical research
consortium. ``You have to have an appropriate level of concern
without creating panic and hysteria. AIDS was a perfect example.
There were all sorts of worries about forms of transmission that
simply didn't exist. We worked hard on that. But now, in some
populations, there isn't enough fear again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes government officials find themselves in the
uncomfortable position of having to play epidemiologists, a hat
they do not wear as well as, say, that of politicians. Members of
the media often do the public a disservice with errors in reporting
about who is most vulnerable, how the illness manifests itself, and
even how many cases are reported. At one point, television
newscasters insisted that there were two totally different
outbreaks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile has also caused fear because its carrier, mosquitoes,
can be found anywhere, causing people to fear that they can get
sick just walking out the door. ``But if you look at nine people
dying compared to the amount of mosquito bites we have all
gotten,'' said Ms. Mitchell, ``it doesn't seem like the plague.''

   When Amazon.com declared two weeks ago that it was beginning a
bold campaign to become an Internet shopping bazaar, Wall Street
applauded. And why not? Amazon, a corporate poster child of the New
Economy and pioneer of online retailing, would be collecting money
from any business, large or small, that wanted to set up shop under
its cyber-tent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Amazon really needs the cash. Its losses are mounting,
as they are for most Internet merchants. But, Amazon explains, the
red ink merely underlines the scale of its ambitious investment for
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   And what is Amazon spending so lavishly on these days? Building
a high-tech bunker of supercomputers or hiring battalions of
software wizards? No, Amazon is spending much of its money on a
half-dozen huge warehouses across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The New Economy is increasingly coming face-to-face with the
old: Net code hackers and money hustlers meet the members of
Bricklayers Local 247. The hot, new fields of the Internet economy
suddenly include distribution and logistics, the humdrum backstage
of business. Indeed, as electronic commerce moves into the
mainstream _ an estimated 17 million American households will
purchase online this year _ it has prompted a new appreciation for
the business skills of the old bricks-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, it seems, still have decidedly offline standards of
service. They demand timely delivery of goods and the ability to
easily return merchandise that proves disappointing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The online retailers who come up short on those fronts, industry
analysts predict, will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin
during this year's Christmas shopping season as winners are sorted
from losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the dot-com retailers are going to fold after their
venture capital money runs out,'' observed David Pecaut, a senior
vice president of the Boston Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the biggest winners in online retailing could well be
today's department stores, discount chains and specialty stores. In
fact, 62 percent of e-commerce sales are accounted for by
bricks-and-mortar and catalog companies that also have begun online
ventures. Within five years, Pecaut expects that share to rise to
85 percent as companies like Wal-Mart, Nordstrom and Sears improve
their performance on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he says, is that their assets from the ``legacy
world'' _ well-known brands, distribution networks, stores and
purchasing power _ will prove to be advantages, and increasingly so
in electronic commerce. The leading online brands like Amazon and
Ebay, for example, came onto the marketplace a few years ago as
innovative newcomers, when cyberspace was far less crowded and
Internet brand-building was far less costly. The chance of an
Internet start-up gaining that kind of brand recognition today,
Pecaut says, is slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``For marketers, the superior economics in the future are going
to come from the old standards of business _ and not just being
online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new catch phrases of modern retailing have embraced that
notion: multi-channel retailers, integrated shopping and 360-degree
marketing. All are meant to convey the concept of servicing _ or
assaulting _ the consumer on many fronts, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies are even using their high-priced shares
as currency to buy bricks-and-mortar counterparts. For example, the
online auctioneer Ebay purchased Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a San
Francisco-based auction house founded in 1865, for $260 million in
stock earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics for online retail sales, and projections of
future revenue, show meteoric growth. Yet a closer look at the
numbers suggests how much traditional retailing retains its hold,
despite the rapid, up-from-zero growth of e-commerce. Online sales
in the United States will rise sharply this year to $20 billion and
jump to $185 billion by 2004, according to Forrester Research Inc.,
a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. Still, the $185
billion figure, even if it proves accurate, would represent only 7
percent of the nation's retail sales in 2004, the firm maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has clearly created not only new wealth
but a new sense of economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the new Internet economy is its ferocious
speed, the faith that this is a big deal and the uncertainty that
it will pay off,'' said Thomas Eisenmann, an e-commerce expert at
the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from Internet technology will almost surely
come first in an area that gets the least attention: its use as a
low-cost communications technology to automate all kinds of
business transactions. ``The Amazons of the world get all the
press, but the real growth in electronic commerce in the next five
years is going to be in the business-to-business market,'' said
Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that growth will be companies using the Web instead of
faxes, telephones and face-to-face meetings to handle the ``back
office'' tasks involved in trading with their corporate customers
and suppliers. Forrester Research projects that the
business-to-business market could reach $1.5 trillion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Internet-assisted overhaul of dealings among
businesses in the next few years represents an evolutionary instead
of a revolutionary step. Much of the anticipated transformation
amounts to doing the same chores more efficiently because of new
technology _ as was true with the telephone and, before that, the
telegraph, which has been called ``The Victorian Internet,'' in a
book published last year (Walker &AMP; Co.) by Tom Standage.
</P>
<P>
   And if the past is any guide, the surest corporate winners in
the e-commerce business may be the suppliers of basic tools and
services for the Internet: computers, software and technical
know-how. That, at least, seemed to be the lesson of the last great
gold rush in California. It was the general stores and saloons, not
the miners, that pocketed the steady money.

future revenue, show meteoric growth. Yet a closer look at the
numbers suggests how much traditional retailing retains its hold,
despite the rapid, up-from-zero growth of e-commerce. Online sales
in the United States will rise sharply this year to $20 billion and
jump to $185 billion by 2004, according to Forrester Research Inc.,
a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. Still, the $185
billion figure, even if it proves accurate, would represent only 7
percent of the nation's retail sales in 2004, the firm maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has clearly created not only new wealth
but a new sense of economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the new Internet economy is its ferocious
speed, the faith that this is a big deal and the uncertainty that
it will pay off,'' said Thomas Eisenmann, an e-commerce expert at
the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from Internet technology will almost surely
come first in an area that gets the least attention: its use as a
low-cost communications technology to automate all kinds of
business transactions. ``The Amazons of the world get all the
press, but the real growth in electronic commerce in the next five
years is going to be in the business-to-business market,'' said
Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that growth will be companies using the Web instead of
faxes, telephones and face-to-face meetings to handle the ``back
office'' tasks involved in trading with their corporate customers
and suppliers. Forrester Research projects that the
business-to-business market could reach $1.5 trillion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Internet-assisted overhaul of dealings among
businesses in the next few years represents an evolutionary instead
of a revolutionary step. Much of the anticipated transformation
amounts to doing the same chores more efficiently because of new
technology _ as was true with the telephone and, before that, the
telegraph, which has been called ``The Victorian Internet,'' in a
book published last year (Walker &AMP; Co.) by Tom Standage.
</P>
<P>
   And if the past is any guide, the surest corporate winners in
the e-commerce business may be the suppliers of basic tools and
services for the Internet: computers, software and technical
know-how. That, at least, seemed to be the lesson of the last great
gold rush in California. It was the general stores and saloons, not
the miners, that pocketed the steady money.

   WASHINGTON _ The signs are unmistakable: Washington is
rediscovering the health care crisis. It did not, after all, go
away with the failure of the Clinton administration's attempt at
universal coverage in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   New Census data show the number of uninsured Americans is
climbing, in the face of an extraordinary economic boom. The cost
of health insurance, after a few years of stability, is rising as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives spent last week in angry, anguished
debate over the state of the nation's health care, then passed a
sweeping new bill to rein in the managed care industry and protect
patients' rights. And out on the presidential campaign trail,
candidates are beginning to offer their solutions _ with much
political forethought _ to the increasingly apparent problems of
access, cost and coverage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton all but snapped an ``I told you so'' when
confronted with the Census numbers last week. ``We told you in 1994
that if this were voted down, the insurance companies would
continue to drop people, or employers would, because of the system
we had,'' he said, clearly stung by the notion that 44.3 million
uninsured Americans would be part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The new politics of health care is, not surprisingly, framed by
the failure of the Clinton plan. Even as the uninsured return to
the political agenda, nobody is out campaigning for a plan on the
scale of Clinton's _ or, for that matter, for anything like what
was routinely discussed by several Democratic presidential
candidates in 1992 with what now seems breathtaking naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Even as some experts bemoan the shortcomings of piecemeal,
incremental steps to expand health care coverage, much of the
political class seems committed to the approach; witness the
package of tax breaks intended to encourage coverage that
Republicans in the House passed with much fanfare last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the past seven years have in some ways profoundly changed
the lay of the land: Managed care is no longer a theory but a
reality for most Americans. The Clinton administration did not
restructure the health care system, but the private sector did. As
Bob Blendon, a Harvard expert on public opinion and health, put it,
it was a ``top-down'' revolution that people never got to vote on.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the backlash: The most popular enemy on Capitol Hill last
week was not the bureaucrats in ``big government,'' as it was
during the struggle over Clinton's 1,342-page health plan, but the
bureaucrats in health maintenance organizations and other forms of
managed care. Government regulation, in fact, was presented as a
necessary check on out-of-control HMOs; Rep. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., a dentist and conservative who was elected to Congress in
1994 as a fierce opponent of the Clinton plan, was now standing
shoulder to shoulder with the Democrats and Clinton, leading the
charge against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press, said this concern about the power of HMOs has made
health care more of an issue for middle-class working people with
coverage. The percentage of people polled by the Pew Center who say
``reforming health care'' should be a top priority rose from 56
percent in January 1997 to 69 percent in January 1999. A
particularly big jump occurred among men aged 30 to 49, Kohut said.
This helps explain why a Republican-controlled House, much of whose
leadership is deeply uncomfortable with government regulation,
passed the managed care reform bill by such a lopsided vote last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care backlash is only one piece of the health care
puzzle, although perhaps the easiest piece politically. To many
health care planners and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the primary
concern is the steady rise in the uninsured, many of whom are low-
and moderate-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry what will happen when there's a recession,'' said Dr.
Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at Georgetown University and a
former top health adviser to the Clinton administration. ``If
low-wage workers are in trouble in good times, where will they be
in bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says voters raise similar
concerns in focus groups, something she calls the Jack Nicholson
effect: ``What if this is as good as it gets?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians have only recently begun to venture near the
issue again; there are no easy fixes for the uninsured, big
solutions carry big price tags and the cost, complexity and
political ham-handedness of the Clinton plan are painful, lingering
memories.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley are leading the way; concern about the uninsured tends
to be higher among Democratic primary voters, according to Ms.
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Steelman, who is advising Texas Gov. George W. Bush on
health care, said the issue is ``really on his radar screen,''
particularly the plight of low-income workers who lack insurance,
but she also indicated that his health care proposal was not
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while concern may be rising, even many voters who worry
about the uninsured are wary of big solutions, some analysts say.
``I just don't think there's a mood out there for some big
government program that involves big intervention,'' Blendon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan, which won praise for its boldness because it set
a goal of universal ``access'' to health insurance, was a careful
political document that avoided the new governmental structures and
mandates of the Clinton plan. (Even so, its estimated $65 billion a
year cost may eventually prove a tempting target.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the constituency for ``health care reform'' is divided
and complicated, several experts said. Some voters are insured but
angry at their HMOs. Some voters are motivated by the plight of the
uninsured, and others are mostly concerned about Medicare and
coverage for prescription drugs. ``I just don't think this health
care issue is a cohesive issue the way it was in 1992,'' said
Blendon.

</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what some experts see as the most worrisome trend in
health care _ rising costs _ is the most difficult to discuss
politically. Managed care leaders have tried hard to make the case
that putting new mandates on the industry _ particularly opening it
up to lawsuits _ would raise costs that would ultimately be passed
on to employers and consumers. And industry officials seem stunned
at times at how little credit they get for making care more
efficient and, at least for a while, for controlling costs.
</P>
<P>
   But cost-control in health care is a risky business: the
cost-containment provisions in the Clinton plan led to fears of
rationing. And the gatekeepers and referral requirements of managed
care led to one horrific anecdote after another on the floor of the
House last week about dying children and heedless bureaucrats on
the other end of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry that the managed care revolution has already
squeezed out the easy savings. ``I've thought for many years that
there was an underlying upward trend in medical spending because of
the increase in new capabilities in medicine, which we're now
seeing fairly dramatically in pharmaceuticals,'' said Joseph
Newhouse, a professor of health policy and management at Harvard.
He suggested that after ``some one-time gains from the managed care
revolution'' that upward trend may be reasserting itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rising health care costs, of course, can have a direct effect on
the number of uninsured. And higher costs can raise profound
questions of equity; for example, Congress is currently struggling
with the fairness of a Medicare program that lacks prescription
drug coverage, just when the pharmaceutical revolution offers
immense promise for many of the ills of old age.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, interlocking nature of these issues pushed the
Clinton administration _ and many other health planners, for that
matter _ to go for a grand, comprehensive plan. Working on these
problems with incremental measures, step by step, is harder, some
health planners say, but is probably all the political system can
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA, a consumer group, and the Health Insurance
Association of America plan to convene a conference of past
combatants to try to seek common ground on the uninsured. Ms.
Steelman, a lobbyist and longtime Republican adviser, said of thelarger struggle: ``This isn't about one big-bang theory. This is
about trying to balance costs and needs and rights. It's the
crucible of U.S. politics. It's where it all comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the uninsured take heart from the fact that, at
the very least, the eerie political silence around 44.3 million
Americans is breaking.

IRS IS ALLOWING MORE DELINQUENTS TO AVOID TAX BILLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Calif., Del., Texas, Conn.)   (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Understaffed and caught in a set of mixed signals from Congress,
the Internal Revenue Service for more than a year has let many tax
delinquents go without paying tax bills that may total billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Those owing back taxes include wealthy individuals, as well as
employers that have withheld payroll taxes but not turned the money
over to the federal government, according to IRS tax collectors who
spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, collectors, whose numbers are dwindling, have
been in training on complex new rules imposed by Congress instead
of pursuing cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IRS interprets the new rules as requiring an
all-or-nothing stance on back taxes. Rather than reach negotiated
settlements and work out payment schedules, as was customary in the
past, the IRS is demanding full payment.
</P>
<P>
   If the taxpayer is unable or unwilling to comply, the agency is
setting the cases aside as temporarily uncollectible. Then,
calculating that the agency is unlikely to act before the 10-year
statute of limitations runs out, many big tax delinquents are
opting to take their chances and pay nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have clients who owe taxes in six figures and could pay 60
percent, 70 percent, and the IRS is collecting nothing,'' said
Steve Kassel, a tax preparer in Daly City, Calif., who specializes
in tax collection cases. ``The IRS is leaving a ton of money on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no updated official tally of the money going
uncollected, but tax collectors say that it is in the billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, the tax commissioner, confirmed in an
interview that the number of collection cases languishing in IRS
files is growing, particularly cases involving taxes withheld from
paychecks and then not turned over to the Treasury by small
businesses. ``Our case inventory is building up because we are not
working as many cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tax consultants say some wealthy taxpayers are also shielding
assets from the IRS by putting them into homes, fully aware that
the government _ which used to seize as many as 1,000 houses in a
year for nonpayment of taxes _ has not seized one in more than 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   Though some tax advisers say it remains risky to dodge tax
debts, even some high-level IRS officials acknowledge that the
latest ploys may be successful. They blame antiquated computer
systems, the shortage of collectors and complex new regulations
that taxpayers can manipulate to delay collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the resources anymore to do hand-to-hand
combat'' with recalcitrant taxpayers, said Harry Manaka, the IRS
chief of collection practices.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of tax returns filed has increased 13
percent, to 226 million this year, but Congress has cut the number
of tax collectors 19 percent, to about 6,800. Meanwhile,
restrictions imposed by Congress to protect people from overzealous
IRS officials mean tax collectors handle far fewer cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new rules were imposed after descriptions of armed
raids, bullying tactics and other abuses of taxpayers by the IRS
were given at Senate Finance Committee hearings in 1997 and 1998.
While some of the testimony has since been discredited, Sen.
William Roth Jr., R-Del., who was chairman of the hearings, said
that they nonetheless showed that the IRS was out of control and
needed to change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that the problems in collections ``are like growing
pains'' and that the new protections for taxpayers ``were never
intended to allow tax cheats to escape the consequences of their
lawless behavior.'' Once the new policies are fully in place, he
added, if the IRS ``for some unintended reason lacks the authority
and resources necessary to pursue individuals who break the law, I
can assure you we'll revisit the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new strictures on the agency have had a variety of
unintended consequences _ most notably the de facto all-or-nothing
policy on tax debts.
</P>
<P>
   The policy stems from a requirement by Congress that the IRS
negotiate all terms of a tax-collection agreement up front. In the
past, the agency would often collect what it could from a taxpayer,
and then _ as the period for collection was about to end _ threaten
action such as seizing a house to persuade the debtor to pay the
balance or extend the collection period, sometimes for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to tax professionals, if a taxpayer does not
agree to pay in full, collectors are quick to designate the debt
``currently noncollectible,'' which, for the purposes of
performance reviews, effectively closes a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenue officers are no longer judged by the dollars they
collect, but by the efficiency with which they close cases,'' said
Mike Wellman, a tax accountant in Longview, Texas, with numerous
clients who he says could pay more than half of their back taxes
but are paying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said he now limits extensions of the statute of
limitations on collecting back taxes to an extra five years. And if
the taxpayer will not grant an extension _ or if regular payments
would not cover 100 percent of the debt even with the extended pay
period _ the IRS is refusing to accept an installment agreement and
suspending its collection efforts. If the statute of limitations
expires without IRS action, the taxpayer successfully avoids paying
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, explained Manaka, the IRS collections executive, is
that the agency could revive the case within the allotted time _
and seek penalties and interest. ``Tax professionals who advise
clients to do this are taking a risky approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manaka acknowledged, however, that the chance of a case being
revived is small, provided the taxpayer continues to file annual
tax returns and there is no evidence of a sharp increase in income.
Adjusted gross income would have to rise between 25 percent and 200
percent, depending on the taxpayer's income level, before IRS
computers would flag the case for review, tax professionals and
former tax collectors said.
</P>
<P>
   Kassel, the California tax preparer, said that for taxpayers
with a stream of income sufficient to pay part of their back taxes,
but no significant assets, there was no incentive to grant the IRS
an extended collections period, let alone pay delinquent taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One of his clients, Louis, a Connecticut taxpayer who insisted
his last name not be used, said the IRS initially told him it would
accept payments that would total $66,000 of the $90,000 of back
taxes owed on his family's failed food business. Six months later,
another IRS official said the payment agreement could not be
accepted, because it would not cover the full tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Because his income may rise, and so expose him to renewed
attention from the IRS, Louis said he was negotiating to settle his
tax debt with a lump sum payment _ a payment that may be as little
as 22 percent of what he would have paid in installments. He called
the IRS policy ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said the all-or-nothing policy shows that ``there are
some combinations of circumstances that we still need to work on.''

<P>
   In the meantime, many tax professionals say that they have
clients who should be made to pay, but who are facing no IRS
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Oelerich, an accountant in Davenport, Iowa, said that until
recently he represented an Illinois doctor who owes millions of
dollars in federal income taxes, but has not faced any collection
attempts by the IRS _ even though he has a substantial income and
substantial equity in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor's conduct was flagrant up and down the line,'' said
Oelerich, who serves on a national board that advises Rossotti. ``I
was not happy that I had taken the case, because the further I got
into it, the more I could see that there was no doubt that this
taxpayer was abusing the system. The revenue officer had dotted his
i's and crossed his t's, and yet nothing is being done to collect,
and it stinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a taxpayer I am outraged,'' Olerich said, adding that he
has two other clients who also could, and should, pay back taxes,
but whom the IRS is ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Albaum, a Manhattan tax accountant who works on collection
cases, said he would advise most clients against counting on the
IRS to ignore their tax debt, especially if they had most of their
assets in their home. Knowing that the government might seize your
house, he said, ``is a terrible way to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``there is no question the IRS is going to lose
a lot of cases because the statute of limitations will expire.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti acknowledged that it is widely believed within the IRS
that he has an unwritten policy against seizing homes to pay back
taxes, except in cases involving major drug dealers or people who
make their living claiming that the income tax is a government
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not true,'' he said. ``We have heard that
some managers have said, `Don't ever, ever send a home seizure case
to me,' and we're working to get over that. The fact is that we do
have the power to seize homes, and we will.'' Seizures will resume,
he said, once collection officers are fully trained in the new
rules governing their conduct. Every significant tax delinquency
will be pursued, he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   By far the government's biggest source of tax dollars is
withholding from paychecks. Yet in interviews, tax collectors said
thousands of cases of withheld taxes not being paid over to the IRS
by employers are simply being recorded in computer files, with
little or no action to collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   In some IRS offices, tax collectors said, managers have coped
with a shortage of tax collectors by simply raising the threshold
for when prompt action is required, in some cases to more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these cases are so old that by the time we go out, the
business will be gone and we'll never see a dime,'' said one tax
collector in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti acknowledged that there had been a significant increase
in the number of small businesses failing to turn over withheld
taxes. His staff said it had no current figures, however.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He wants the IRS to adopt the same collection practices as
private industry, with an emphasis on contacting taxpayers within
days after a payment becomes overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But tax collectors say it takes weeks, and sometimes months,
before the service's ancient computers flag cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti characterized the collection problems as transitory
while collectors are trained.

   WASHINGTON _ A Latin American country slides toward chaos.
Leftist guerrillas attack the government, right-wing death squads
attack guerrilla sympathizers, peace talks falter. The economy
spirals downward, scattering thousands of refugees, and fears of
instability sweep through the region. The United States hurries to
the rescue with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
   With the Colombian government facing its most serious crisis in
years, Clinton administration officials confirmed last week that
they are putting together a package of military and economic
assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the hemisphere
since the Cold War. They are also trying to reassure anyone who
will listen that Colombia today really looks nothing like El
Salvador did some two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will not be giving Colombia lots of
sophisticated weapons and aircraft, the officials say, nor will
legions of Colombian soldiers be training at Fort Bragg. U.S.
military advisers in Colombia are to help troops there fight the
drug trade rather than insurgents, except where the insurgents
protect the trade. ``There are, in my view, few if any really
logical, easy comparisons to make between El Salvador 10 years ago
and Colombia now,'' said the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, Thomas Pickering, who once presided over the military
build-up in El Salvador as the U.S. ambassador there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many in the administration and many more
outside it who see quicksand in Colombia. The government that
Washington is supporting in Bogota is weak and increasingly
unpopular. The army it trains has been ineffective on the
battlefield and frequently complicit in the massacres of civilians
by rightist paramilitary groups. The rebel armies it hopes to bend
have held out in the jungles for decades. The administration is
also on unsteady ground at home: For domestic political reasons, it
has proclaimed a central goal in Colombia _ curtailing the drug
trade _ that will likely mislead Americans about what it hopes to
achieve there.
</P>
<P>
   What has panicked both the Clinton administration and
congressional Republicans is not so much the latest turn in
Colombia's cocaine problem as the growing troubles of its new
president, Andres Pastrana. Little more than a year after Pastrana
came to power with bold concessions intended to bring the biggest
rebel army to the negotiating table, the talks are stalled in the
earliest stages, the guerrillas appear stronger and more
recalcitrant and the president is widely criticized as naive.
Unrest within the armed forces has surged and paramilitary killings
have continued. Colombia's long-buoyant economy, having made it
through the regional debt crisis of the 1980s relatively unscathed,
is suffering its most severe recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States sinks deeper into Colombia's troubles
or helps to solve them may ultimately depend a good deal on how it
defines its objectives there. Over the last three months, officials
have gone to unusual lengths to reconsider those aims: Working
groups have been set up, strategy papers have been prepared and
assistant secretaries of all sorts have shuttled back and forth to
Bogota. Yet even as that review got under way, senior officials
seemed to limit its parameters: The center of U.S. policy, they
insisted _ ``the spear point,'' as Pickering put it _ will remain
the illicit drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's drug problem has taken a significant turn for the
worse. Over the last several years, as the authorities in Bolivia
and Peru have made headway in intercepting drug planes and helping
poor farmers supplant crops of coca, the raw material of cocaine,
drug producers have sharply expanded their fields in remote,
sparsely populated areas of southern Colombia. That shift has
strengthened both the Colombian producers and their guerrilla
allies, who profit by taxing the coca fields and hiring out to
guard jungle air strips and drug-processing labs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the drug ``emergency'' that some senior United
States officials have begun to describe does not necessarily
threaten new waves of cocaine washing onto American streets. It is
not clear how or even whether the shifting of coca crops around the
region will affect the availability or price of cocaine abroad.
Nor, despite technological advances in tracking drug shipments
through the Caribbean, can the administration promise that
better-funded interdiction efforts will seriously reduce the flows
of cocaine and heroin into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to several officials, most of the aid proposals being
circulated internally would give relatively short shrift to such
basic (and comparatively inexpensive) solutions as the training of
Colombia's judges and the strengthening of its notoriously porous
prisons. Instead, U.S. ``counternarcotics'' aid will aim to help
the security forces beat back the guerrillas in southern Colombia
so that crop-spraying and lab raids can proceed. As illogical as
the assurance increasingly sounds, administration officials
continue to insist that the United States will stay out of the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In private, at least, such officials are more candid about
acknowledging that a decade after the Cold War's end, the drug
fight is the only policy objective likely to win political support
for the $1 billion to $2 billion in aid that they have talked of
putting forward over the next three years. (Even then, a Colombia
package will have to compete in the weeks ahead with foreign-aid
proposals ranging from help for peacekeeping in Africa to support
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly disputed that the United States has other
significant interests in Colombia, from oil fields to radar
stations to the stability of a democratic ally. In recent months,
State Department and National Security Council officials, in
particular, have pressed for what they call a more ``integrated''
approach _ one that might include trade benefits, development aid
and human rights programs as well as military support.
</P>
<P>
   But as Colombia's military leaders showed their wish lists
around Washington last week, it appeared that some central issues
remained unresolved: how the beleaguered military might best be
strengthened, how the guerrillas might be drawn into serious talks,
and how those two goals interlock.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 20 letter to Pastrana, President Clinton suggested a
new point of departure for U.S. policy, saying, ``The hardest step
may be the first: convincing all sides in Colombia that a military
solution is not possible and that all will gain from a negotiated
settlement.'' But neither Clinton nor his senior aides have
explained clearly how this might be achieved. Administration
officials have begun trying to recruit other Latin American
countries and United Nations mediators to bring pressure on both
sides. In the meantime, the search for a comprehensive strategy in
Colombia continues to resemble a free-for-all in which different
factions of the administration have put forward different aid
proposals _ many of them with different implications for how to
wage peace.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials, including the commander of U.S. military
forces in Latin America, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, argue that only
significant reverses on the battlefield will bring the rebels to
the bargaining table. But at the pace at which the United States is
now training and re-equipping the Colombian military, officials say
it could take years to start changing the military balance. Critics
of the policy also ask what might happen if Colombia's generals
gain unexpected ground against the guerrillas _ and decide to
continue fighting in order to press for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the thinking has not gone much beyond, `Let's get some
helicopters in there,''' said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at
the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from Washington, the greatest difference between Colombia
in 1999 and El Salvador in 1979 may be that virtually no one in the
White House now believes Colombia's government is in any immediate
danger of falling to the rebels. That consensus may make it harder
for officials to argue for a huge ``emergency'' infusion of
American aid. It could, however, be the basis for an approach to
Colombia's problems that might be sustained even when the flow of
illicit drugs fails to miraculously end.

CHECHNYA'S CHIEF, UNDER FIRE, TAKES A FIGHTING STAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ The Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, a former
colonel in the Soviet Army, is a restrained, gray-haired man.
Dressed in camouflage uniform, sitting on a sofa, he issues firm
orders to his men in a low voice in the Chechens' urgent, hiccuping
language.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is confronting Russia in Chechnya this time is a
pale shadow of Dzokhar Dudayev, the former Soviet Air Force general
who took the republic into war in 1994. Where General Dudayev, who
perished toward the end of Chechnya's war with Russia in 1996, was
famous for his flamboyance and explosive rhetoric, Maskhadov is
known more for his straightforwardness and reason. He has always
been seen as politically moderate and as someone who could
negotiate with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an interview last week, he seemed to drop his usual
conciliatory talk. As Russia has gradually pushed into Chechnya,
and bombed its towns and villages in the name of flushing out or
destroying Islamic militants, Maskhadov has shown himself ready to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the end was near for Russian power in the
Caucasus _ a power derived from Russia's traditional role as broker
or military bulwark of the various Caucasian peoples, locked in
centuries-old quarrels among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, important events are happening in the Caucasus.'' he
declared. ``The West is already here,'' he added, referring to the
presence of Western investment and aid in Azerbaijan and Georgia,
which lie just south of this small mountainous republic. ``Russia
will soon go from all the Caucasus.''
</P>
<P>
   While deploring the involvement of Chechens in fighting in the
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in August and September,
he described the underlying cause as a ``nationalist liberation
movement,'' motivated by broad disagreements with the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to denounce the two most wanted men in Russia,
the prominent Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev and the Arab
fighter known as Khattab. Russia has accused them of leading the
incursions into Dagestan this summer, and implied that they were
behind a series of explosions that killed some 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov is seen, even in Moscow, as a man with whom Russia
could have negotiated. Indeed, the Kremlin did so for a time. He
was elected president after the war in January 1997 by an
overwhelming 65 percent of the vote, in elections judged free and
fair by foreign observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia even sent him congratulations
in what was seen as a peace offering, effectively a fresh start
after the 1994-96 war that humiliated the once-mighty Russian
military and ended with the status of Chechnya, formally a Russian
republic, frozen in its current limbo until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Twice after the Chechen election, Yeltsin and Maskhadov met in
Moscow, and Yeltsin vowed on television that he would always get
together personally with the Chechen leader to resolve any future
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now, although the Chechen leader has offered talks, Moscow has
ruled them out. Yeltsin, whose grip on Kremlin power is firm but
increasingly overshadowed by the knowledge that his era will end
after presidential elections next summer, seems to have forgotten
his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   To push Maskhadov into a fight may, however, be shortsighted. He
has proved himself a hard man when his back is to the wall. He is
legendary among Chechens for his stand in Grozny's besieged
Presidential Palace in the winter of 1994, when he hung on for
weeks commanding the resistance as Russian tank shells were
blasting the building from 500 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   He is also prepared to go on the offensive. As Chechen chief of
staff, he masterminded the rebels' seizure of Grozny in August
1996, when several thousand Chechen fighters swooped on the city in
a coordinated assault and trapped some 12,000 Russian troops there.
The operation brought the Russian Army to a standstill and forced
an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of what he sees as fruitless efforts at
cooperation with Russia, and now facing another war, Maskhadov has
hardened his line. ``I should have said to Russia that this is all
a waste of time,'' he said, looking back on the agreements he
signed with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia was always looking for some way to weaken us, with some
sort of provocation or sabotage,'' he said. ``They have been the
bosses here for a hundred years and they have their own people
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Russia apparently feels that Maskhadov has been
unable to deliver on any of the promises he might have held out for
the Kremlin. Certainly, in the view of Russia, the Chechen leader
cannot control the fighters it blames for the incursions into
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's rejection of Maskhadov's overtures is pushing him
closer to die-hard commanders who will never give up their
ambitions for independence or their armed resistance to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He has alienated many of them over the last few years with his
attempts to cultivate warm relations with Russia. Aslanbek
Izmailov, one of his senior commanders and the deputy chairman of
his cabinet of ministers, criticizes him harshly for that policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was absolutely not right from the beginning to try to be
friendly with Russia,'' Izmailov said. ``He hoped Russia would
recognize our independence. Maybe now he has realized a bit how
wrong that was, but not totally.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little tangible evidence that Moscow was ever serious
about helping Maskhadov. The city of Grozny remains in ruins, as
does much of the republic's industry. He has barely won a penny of
promised compensation for his people from the Russian government,
let alone any sort of long-term aid for development or
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government's frustration is that Maskhadov is weak.
He has been unable to bring under control many of the powerful
field commanders, who have become virtual warlords in their own
areas, or dilute their demand for independence. Nor has he been
able to prevent the wave of kidnappings that has alienated local
people seized for ransom and driven foreign investment,
international aid organizations and all but the most intrepid
outsiders from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has always called for full independence for Chechnya
because, he says, the people do not want to be ruled by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chechens do not want to be subjects of the Russian
Federation, and so the Chechen people need to build joint relations
in a civilized way with a normal government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has also been blamed for not moving against the
Wahhabis, members of a conservative Arab Islamic sect who are seen
as major troublemakers by many ordinary Chechens and who are blamed
for catapulting Chechnya into this new war. Maskhadov has refrained
from a complete crackdown because he says it would start a civil
war in Chechnya, which he says is what Russia wants.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest offensive has ended the internal divisions for
the moment and brought his opponents in Chechnya around the
president again. But Maskhadov is also sounding tougher than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will protect our land and Russia, if it comes in to occupy
it, will be annihilated,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: civil war.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In private, at least, such officials are more candid about
acknowledging that a decade after the Cold War's end, the drug
fight is the only policy objective likely to win political support
for the $1 billion to $2 billion in aid that they have talked of
putting forward over the next three years. (Even then, a Colombia
package will have to compete in the weeks ahead with foreign-aid
proposals ranging from help for peacekeeping in Africa to support
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly disputed that the United States has other
significant interests in Colombia, from oil fields to radar
stations to the stability of a democratic ally. In recent months,
State Department and National Security Council officials, in
particular, have pressed for what they call a more ``integrated''
approach _ one that might include trade benefits, development aid
and human rights programs as well as military support.
</P>
<P>
   But as Colombia's military leaders showed their wish lists
around Washington last week, it appeared that some central issues
remained unresolved: how the beleaguered military might best be
strengthened, how the guerrillas might be drawn into serious talks,
and how those two goals interlock.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 20 letter to Pastrana, President Clinton suggested a
new point of departure for U.S. policy, saying, ``The hardest step
may be the first: convincing all sides in Colombia that a military
solution is not possible and that all will gain from a negotiated
settlement.'' But neither Clinton nor his senior aides have
explained clearly how this might be achieved. Administration
officials have begun trying to recruit other Latin American
countries and United Nations mediators to bring pressure on both
sides. In the meantime, the search for a comprehensive strategy in
Colombia continues to resemble a free-for-all in which different
factions of the administration have put forward different aid
proposals _ many of them with different implications for how to
wage peace.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials, including the commander of U.S. military
forces in Latin America, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, argue that only
significant reverses on the battlefield will bring the rebels to
the bargaining table. But at the pace at which the United States is
now training and re-equipping the Colombian military, officials say
it could take years to start changing the military balance. Critics
of the policy also ask what might happen if Colombia's generals
gain unexpected ground against the guerrillas _ and decide to
continue fighting in order to press for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the thinking has not gone much beyond, `Let's get some
helicopters in there,''' said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at
the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from Washington, the greatest difference between Colombia
in 1999 and El Salvador in 1979 may be that virtually no one in the
White House now believes Colombia's government is in any immediate
danger of falling to the rebels. That consensus may make it harder
for officials to argue for a huge ``emergency'' infusion of
American aid. It could, however, be the basis for an approach to
Colombia's problems that might be sustained even when the flow of
illicit drugs fails to miraculously end.

IRAN REFORMERS, SILENCED 3 TIMES, START ANOTHER PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran Undaunted by the closure of its three preceding
newspapers, all of which rocketed to the highest circulation in
Iran, a group pressing for a more democratic and tolerant form of
Islamic rule has opened a fourth daily. Once again, the reformers
are challenging the conservative clerics who would have the country
remain the bristling, anti-Western, inward-looking creation of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The first edition announced itself on Thursday with a banner
headline proclaiming ``Comeback'' and a robust editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the world is approaching the third millennium,
Islamic people, including Iranians, have to ask themselves what our
attitude toward this new age is going to be,'' the paper said. It
added, ``The answer is that ease of access to information of all
kinds is one standard by which we can differentiate between
countries that have established civil societies and those that have
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamidreza Jalaeipour, 41, a financial backer, editor and
columnist for each of the three closed papers and for the new one,
is something of a veteran of the cat-and-mouse game of publishing
bold newspapers in a society in which reformers and conservatives
are locked in a struggle for Iran's future, and the conservatives
control the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, a judge ordered the closure ``forever'' of the
third of a string of reformist newspapers that Jalaeipour and his
colleagues have published _ and been forced to close _ in the last
16 months. In that most recent ruling, the judge declared that the
daily, Neshat, had insulted Islam with articles chronicling the
conservatives' hard-knuckle tactics.
</P>
<P>
   So Jalaeipour and his colleagues delved into the stock of
publishing licenses they took out as a precaution two years ago,
when the election of a reformist president, Mohammad Khatami,
emboldened Iranians looking for relief from 20 years of Islamic
authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Their new paper, Asr-e Azadegan, looks like nothing so much as a
clone of its three purged predecessors. Despite the euphoria at the
new paper over being back on the streets, the
conservative-controlled Parliament signaled that it intended to
strike back, this time with a bill that would broaden the already
broad powers of the press court to close publications.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers plan to boycott Parliament to deny the conservatives a
quorum, but the outcome is likely to await a parliamentary election
in February in which the two sides will vie for a majority,
particularly for the votes of young people in a country where
two-thirds of the 69 million people are under 30.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the 100 editors, reporters and production
specialists at Asr-e Azadegan are hoping they can outlast Neshat,
the longest-surviving of the paper's predecessor, which published
149 editions before it was closed. Along with the closure of
Jaameeh and Tous, Neshat's forerunners, the closures have left the
paper's backers with a $200,000 debt _ a heavy burden in a country
where newspapers sell for the equivalent of 6 cents and the average
monthly salary is less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   There are worries, too, about the eventual fate of Latif Safari,
Neshat's publisher, who held the paper's publishing license. After
an eight-hour trial last month, the 28-year-old judge, Said
Mortazavi, sentenced Safari to 30 months in jail and banned him
from journalism for five years, but left him free pending appeal, a
process that could take months or even years.
</P>
<P>
   In his haste to see Neshat shut down, Judge Mortazavi even
refused to adjourn the court hearing for the noontime prayers,
usually imperative among Islamic stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reformers, the closure of Neshat, and new threats that
were made against Asr-e Azadegan even before its first edition,
have been viewed as part of a wider attempt to use the courts to
stifle change.
</P>
<P>
   Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, the editor of Neshat and now of Asr-e
Azadegan, has written an open letter to Khatami appealing for him
to be bolder in defending the reforms. ``Everyone understands that
what happened to Neshat was because of the complex political
situation in the country,'' he said. ``The clash between the
different forces has slammed the brakes on the entire process of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians think the country could still go one way or the
other _ toward a more open and democratic society that would enable
Iran to rejoin a world it has largely shunned since the shah's
overthrow in 1979, or back to the rigidity of the past.
</P>
<P>
   If the odds swing back and forth, it is partly because so much
of the struggle within the clerical establishment _ between those
backing Khatami, a middle-ranking cleric himself, and hard-liners
who see Khatami as an apostate _ takes place beyond public view.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the man who heads the clerical establishment,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stunned the country with a speech praising
Khatami as a pious man who has been working ``for the rebirth of
Islam.'' The speech was all the more striking for being delivered
at the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini, his predecessor as Iran's
``supreme leader'' and the man who more than any other fashioned
the Iran now criticized by the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei may have decided that the high-ranking clergy must
accommodate Khatami's reforms, which envisage a continuing
``guardianship'' role for the top ayatollahs, or risk losing power
altogether as popular impatience with the conservatives builds.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that much that has been done to frustrate change,
and particularly to thwart the ``liberal'' intellectual class
represented by the reformist newspapers, has been done by the
powerful state apparatus that Khamenei ultimately controls.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, reformers were chilled by the slayings of five
leading reformers, three of them writers. Within weeks, an inquiry
established by Khatami forced the powerful intelligence ministry to
admit that the killers belonged to a secret death squad operating
within the ministry, supposedly without knowledge or approval of
their superiors. One man accused of being a leader was later said
to have committed suicide in a Tehran jail, but three others have
still to be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no new killings, reformers say that in the
wider struggle, Khamenei has generally aligned himself with the
hard-liners, particularly on the issue of press freedom. Last year,
he described reformist papers as ``the crawling cultural advance of
the enemy.'' And Gen. Rahim Safavi, the commander of the
Revolutionary Guards, said, ``Heads need to be rolled, tongues need
to be cut, and pens need to be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, the reformist newspapers operate in a
minefield.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jaameeh, the first of the four papers put out by Jalaeipour and
his colleagues, was closed after five months for ``publishing
lies,'' among them its report of General Safavi's remarks about
cracking down on intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Tous, Jaameeh's successor, lasted two months before it was
closed for ``endangering national security,'' apparently with its
criticism of Iran's threats of war after the Taliban movement in
Afghanistan killed nine Iranians, including eight diplomats, in the
Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Zan, a reformist paper edited by Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the previous president, was closed in
April after it published parts of a new year's message from Farah
Diba, the exiled wife of the deposed shah.
</P>
<P>
   Salam, founded by Mohammed Moussavi, a middle-level cleric who
is a close ally of Khatami, was banned in July for ``attempting to
create turmoil and instability'' after it published what it said
was a handwritten letter from the man accused of leading the
intelligence ministry death squad.
</P>
<P>
   Salam's closure prompted student demonstrations at the
University of Tehran in July that escalated into the worst rioting
since the shah's overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   Neshat, the most recent newspaper closed, hastened its demise
with its reporting of the rioting. The paper was found guilty of
inciting the students and insulting the national police commander.
The main charge, insulting Islam, stemmed from an article that
suggested that the death penalty and other harsh punishments in
Iran's criminal code were un-Islamic.  &QL;

<P>
   Major league baseball teams have padded their considerable
coffers in recent years by linking corporate sponsors to almost
every play in the game, from the ``AT&AMP;T call to the bullpen'' to a
``National Arbitration and Mediation umpires lineup.'' (No kidding;
it's a dispute-resolution business.) If baseball wants a perfect
corporate match, however, it should call the folks over at Anbesol
and pitch a tie-in for home runs, because we're getting a little
numb to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Like 100-point swings in the stock market, home runs don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in a unparalleled flurry of
four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseum on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the homer-happy news media have fallen asleep to home runs'
metronomic regularity. Major leaguers slammed a record 5,528 home
runs this season, a 10 percent increase over last year's previous
high of 5,064, and barely anyone cared. ``Last year kind of
desensitized everybody,'' said Peter Schmuck, baseball columnist
for the Baltimore Sun. ``I guess nobody noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa captivated the
sports world with their 70 and 66 home runs, respectively, capping
modern players' long climb to grab the crowns of Roger Maris and
Babe Ruth. This season's reprise failed on two counts. With McGwire
hitting 65 and Sosa 63, they neither made a serious run at the new
record nor fell short enough to reaffirm how amazing last year
truly was. Instead, their unremarkable sequel only helped
underscore how current home run totals, like Canadian dollars, have
less value than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are a dime a dozen now. (Or, if you're McGwire, about
$2 million a dozen.) Even the hitters themselves have to
acknowledge it. Doug Glanville, the center fielder for the
Philadelphia Phillies, said: ``When I was growing up, if a guy hit
20, I was like, `Twenty! Wow, he's good!' Now, it's like,
`Whatever. No big deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 20 major leaguers hit at least 36 homers, a total that
a decade ago would have led the American League. The grand slam
once was the most delectable of home runs; now more than 100 of
them get hit every year, sating even the most voracious fan. This
season Robin Ventura of the New York Mets hit two in one
doubleheader. Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals hit two in
one  &UR; inning. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The paradox here is that while home runs as a whole mean less,
fans still delight in each individual long ball as it happens. (The
frenzy receives a steroid-like boost when rock music immediately
gets blared through the stadium speakers. ``Whoomp! There It Is!''
is Yankee Stadium's injection of choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Team owners have built smaller ball parks, shrunk the strike
zone _ yes, it's now smaller than a bread box _ and allowed
aggressive hitters to don suits of armor at the plate (arm pads,
shin guards and the like) to facilitate more and more home runs,
with each of these moves validated at the ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is clear: Americans love anything big, from big
biceps to big drives to big scores, and prefer brute force to
cunning. The home run is indefensible. The pitcher can only watch
the ball's persistent arc, and must stand in shame as the hitter
saunters around the bases. The triple remains baseball's most
exciting play, but excitement involves risk. It requires strategy.
Why go to all that trouble when you can simply beat the other
side's brains in?
</P>
<P>
   This predilection was embodied in New York City's feelings
toward how its Yankees and Mets reached the playoffs this year. The
Yankees essentially hit a home run, enjoying a cozy lead in their
division for the entire summer. The wild-card Mets, meanwhile,
staged an old-fashioned rally, drawing a walk, hitting a single,
getting another single, getting foolishly caught in a rundown, then
extricating themselves and finally scoring with a dust-flying slide
into home. Safe! Ask most New Yorkers and they'll probably say they
prefer the Yankees' commodious approach, when the Mets' journey was
far more thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is moving toward an all-or-nothing culture, to its
detriment. As home runs skyrocket, so do strikeouts. Fewer stolen
bases and hit-and-run gambits make for less strategy and
second-guessing, and before you know it the sport will dovetail
into a dressed-up homer-hitting contest. That's essentially what
fans got in the final weekend of this season _ Fox TV disguised the
McGwire-Sosa longball showdown as the ``Game of the Week,'' even
though the players' teams were a combined 50 games out of first
place while the Mets, Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds were
locked in a marvelous pennant race. The Cubs' manager, Jim
Riggleman, put it best: ``I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no more embarrassed than the modern player who doesn't
hit home runs. A Nike commercial this year featured Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, two of the decade's most
successful pitchers, taking extra batting practice because, they
claimed, ``Chicks dig the long ball.'' For how long is the
question. All home runs, even McGwire's, fall to earth eventually.

   For nearly a year, collectors, whose numbers are dwindling, have
been in training on complex new rules imposed by Congress instead
of pursuing cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IRS interprets the new rules as requiring an
all-or-nothing stance on back taxes. Rather than reach negotiated
settlements and work out payment schedules, as was customary in the
past, the IRS is demanding full payment.
</P>
<P>
   If the taxpayer is unable or unwilling to comply, the agency is
setting the cases aside as temporarily uncollectible. Then,
calculating that the agency is unlikely to act before the 10-year
statute of limitations runs out, many big tax delinquents are
opting to take their chances and pay nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have clients who owe taxes in six figures and could pay 60
percent, 70 percent, and the IRS is collecting nothing,'' said
Steve Kassel, a tax preparer in Daly City, Calif., who specializes
in tax collection cases. ``The IRS is leaving a ton of money on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no updated official tally of the money going
uncollected, but tax collectors say that it is in the billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, the tax commissioner, confirmed in an
interview that the number of collection cases languishing in IRS
files is growing, particularly cases involving taxes withheld from
paychecks and then not turned over to the Treasury by small
businesses. ``Our case inventory is building up because we are not
working as many cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tax consultants say some wealthy taxpayers are also shielding
assets from the IRS by putting them into homes, fully aware that
the government _ which used to seize as many as 1,000 houses in a
year for nonpayment of taxes _ has not seized one in more than 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   Though some tax advisers say it remains risky to dodge tax
debts, even some high-level IRS officials acknowledge that the
latest ploys may be successful. They blame antiquated computer
systems, the shortage of collectors and complex new regulations
that taxpayers can manipulate to delay collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the resources anymore to do hand-to-hand
combat'' with recalcitrant taxpayers, said Harry Manaka, the IRS
chief of collection practices.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of tax returns filed has increased 13
percent, to 226 million this year, but Congress has cut the number
of tax collectors 19 percent, to about 6,800. Meanwhile,
restrictions imposed by Congress to protect people from overzealous
IRS officials mean tax collectors handle far fewer cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new rules were imposed after descriptions of armed
raids, bullying tactics and other abuses of taxpayers by the IRS
were given at Senate Finance Committee hearings in 1997 and 1998.
While some of the testimony has since been discredited, Sen.
William Roth Jr., R-Del., who was chairman of the hearings, said
that they nonetheless showed that the IRS was out of control and
needed to change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that the problems in collections ``are like growing
pains'' and that the new protections for taxpayers ``were never
intended to allow tax cheats to escape the consequences of their
lawless behavior.'' Once the new policies are fully in place, he
added, if the IRS ``for some unintended reason lacks the authority
and resources necessary to pursue individuals who break the law, I
can assure you we'll revisit the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new strictures on the agency have had a variety of
unintended consequences _ most notably the de facto all-or-nothing
policy on tax debts.
</P>
<P>
   The policy stems from a requirement by Congress that the IRS
negotiate all terms of a tax-collection agreement up front. In the
past, the agency would often collect what it could from a taxpayer,
and then _ as the period for collection was about to end _ threaten
action such as seizing a house to persuade the debtor to pay the
balance or extend the collection period, sometimes for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to tax professionals, if a taxpayer does not
agree to pay in full, collectors are quick to designate the debt
``currently noncollectible,'' which, for the purposes of
performance reviews, effectively closes a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenue officers are no longer judged by the dollars they
collect, but by the efficiency with which they close cases,'' said
Mike Wellman, a tax accountant in Longview, Texas, with numerous
clients who he says could pay more than half of their back taxes
but are paying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said he now limits extensions of the statute of
limitations on collecting back taxes to an extra five years. And if
the taxpayer will not grant an extension _ or if regular payments
would not cover 100 percent of the debt even with the extended pay
period _ the IRS is refusing to accept an installment agreement and
suspending its collection efforts. If the statute of limitations
expires without IRS action, the taxpayer successfully avoids paying
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, explained Manaka, the IRS collections executive, is
that the agency could revive the case within the allotted time _
and seek penalties and interest. ``Tax professionals who advise
clients to do this are taking a risky approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manaka acknowledged, however, that the chance of a case being
revived is small, provided the taxpayer continues to file annual
tax returns and there is no evidence of a sharp increase in income.
Adjusted gross income would have to rise between 25 percent and 200
percent, depending on the taxpayer's income level, before IRS
computers would flag the case for review, tax professionals and
former tax collectors said.
</P>
<P>
   Kassel, the California tax preparer, said that for taxpayers
with a stream of income sufficient to pay part of their back taxes,
but no significant assets, there was no incentive to grant the IRS
an extended collections period, let alone pay delinquent taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One of his clients, Louis, a Connecticut taxpayer who insisted
his last name not be used, said the IRS initially told him it would
accept payments that would total $66,000 of the $90,000 of back
taxes owed on his family's failed food business. Six months later,
another IRS official said the payment agreement could not be
accepted, because it would not cover the full tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Because his income may rise, and so expose him to renewed
attention from the IRS, Louis said he was negotiating to settle his
tax debt with a lump sum payment _ a payment that may be as little
as 22 percent of what he would have paid in installments. He called
the IRS policy ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said the all-or-nothing policy shows that ``there are
some combinations of circumstances that we still need to work on.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, many tax professionals say that they have
clients who should be made to pay, but who are facing no IRS
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Oelerich, an accountant in Davenport, Iowa, said that until
recently he represented an Illinois doctor who owes millions of
dollars in federal income taxes, but has not faced any collection
attempts by the IRS _ even though he has a substantial income and
substantial equity in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor's conduct was flagrant up and down the line,'' said
Oelerich, who serves on a national board that advises Rossotti. ``I
was not happy that I had taken the case, because the further I got
into it, the more I could see that there was no doubt that this
taxpayer was abusing the system. The revenue officer had dotted his
i's and crossed his t's, and yet nothing is being done to collect,
and it stinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a taxpayer I am outraged,'' Olerich said, adding that he
has two other clients who also could, and should, pay back taxes,
but whom the IRS is ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Albaum, a Manhattan tax accountant who works on collection
cases, said he would advise most clients against counting on the
IRS to ignore their tax debt, especially if they had most of their
assets in their home. Knowing that the government might seize your
house, he said, ``is a terrible way to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``there is no question the IRS is going to lose
a lot of cases because the statute of limitations will expire.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti acknowledged that it is widely believed within the IRS
that he has an unwritten policy against seizing homes to pay back
taxes, except in cases involving major drug dealers or people who
make their living claiming that the income tax is a government
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not true,'' he said. ``We have heard that
some managers have said, `Don't ever, ever send a home seizure case
to me,' and we're working to get over that. The fact is that we do
have the power to seize homes, and we will.'' Seizures will resume,
he said, once collection officers are fully trained in the new
rules governing their conduct. Every significant tax delinquency
will be pursued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By far the government's biggest source of tax dollars is
withholding from paychecks. Yet in interviews, tax collectors said
thousands of cases of withheld taxes not being paid over to the IRS
by employers are simply being recorded in computer files, with
little or no action to collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   In some IRS offices, tax collectors said, managers have coped
with a shortage of tax collectors by simply raising the threshold
for when prompt action is required, in some cases to more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these cases are so old that by the time we go out, the
business will be gone and we'll never see a dime,'' said one tax
collector in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti acknowledged that there had been a significant increase
in the number of small businesses failing to turn over withheld
taxes. His staff said it had no current figures, however.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He wants the IRS to adopt the same collection practices as
private industry, with an emphasis on contacting taxpayers within
days after a payment becomes overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But tax collectors say it takes weeks, and sometimes months,
before the service's ancient computers flag cases.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti characterized the collection problems as transitory
while collectors are trained.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mystery unfolded last year when India, on May 13, announced
that it had set off a pair of nuclear blasts. The global network of
seismometers _ sensitive devices buried deep in the earth to
monitor shock waves from distant earthquakes and blasts _ recorded
no faint rumbles emanating from India's underground test site in
its northwestern desert. There was no blip, no twitch of pen or
meter suggesting the awesome power of the atom had just been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Had India faked the explosive tests? Were they flops? Or had
small blasts eluded the eavesdroppers? And if they had, what did
that mean for a global ban on nuclear blasts in which compliance
was to be assiduously verified?
</P>
<P>
   These questions have a strong bearing on the bruising battle in
Washington over whether the Senate should bless Washington's
participation in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which more than
150 nations have signed.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and foes have engaged in a war of words, with arms
control experts from the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Department of Energy warning Congress that the United States would
have a hard time knowing if foreign states were secretly setting
off small blasts. But two of the world's top groups of earth
scientists weighed in heavily on the side of treaty backers, saying
technology could easily police the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban supporters say that even current sensors are up to
the job and that the network called for by the treaty will be even
better. Moreover, this official network will be augmented by the
rapid global spread of all kinds of private sensors, including
seismometers and spy satellites. All this, treaty advocates say,
will make it hard to hide all but the smallest blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Though opponents of the treaty point to the Indian claim as a
test-ban embarrassment, the emerging consensus among nuclear
experts is that what failed that day was not global monitoring gear
but the pair of explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian claims were exaggerated,'' said George Perkovich,
author of ``India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California), to
be published this week. The problems were so great, he added, that
India had another nuclear device in the ground that it left
undetonated.
</P>
<P>
   To police the globe for clandestine blasts, the nuclear test ban
treaty calls for 321 monitoring stations _ 170 to detect
underground shock waves, 80 to sniff the air for telltale
radioactivity, 60 to listen for revealing sounds and 11 to track
undersea booms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a suspicious occurrence cannot be resolved through
consultation and clarification,'' says a treaty document, ``each
state party has the right to request an on-site inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   This array of monitoring devices should be be able to detect
nuclear blasts as small as a kiloton, or equal to 1,000 tons of
high explosives. On recording gear for earthquakes, experts say,
such a blast would measure about magnitude 4, like a minor tremor.
</P>
<P>
   In the bomb business, 1,000 tons is indisputably small. The
weapon that leveled Hiroshima had a power of about 15,000 tons, and
the first hydrogen bomb was about 700 times as powerful, enough to
cause the Pacific isle of Elugelab, one mile in diameter, to
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   The American Geophysical Union and the Seismological Society of
America, in a joint statement released last week in Washington,
said that when arrays of sensors called for by the treaty are all
switched on worldwide, ``no nation could rely upon successfully
concealing a program of nuclear testing, even at low yields'' in
which blasts are very small.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory E. van der Vink, an earth scientist at Princeton
University who helped draft the statement, said existing
instruments already exceed the treaty's monitoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for such places as the underground test sites in China
and Russia, Dr. van der Vink added, the sensitivity of existing
seismic detectors is already up to hundreds of times better than
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said the treaty's own 170 seismic stations will
be augmented and strengthened by thousands of private ones run by
universities and research institutions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most private seismic sensors track earthquakes. But for decades
such detectors have also been used for monitoring arms control
treaties and nuclear blasts, whose characteristic signatures in
most cases are easy to distinguish. ``We've had 40 years to work on
this and we've done quite well,'' Jeffrey Park, a Yale geologist
who helped draft the scientists' statement, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists cautioned that no verification system can be
perfect. But they added that treaty monitoring would be good enough
to detect all but the most egregious cheating, which would require
not only great cost and skill but would probably be exposed anyway
by satellite photographs or atmospheric sampling
</P>
<P>
   Some of the trickiest spots to monitor are old underground
nuclear test areas _ like Novaya Zemlya in Russia's northern
archipelago, Lop Nor in China's northwestern desert and the Nevada
Test Site in the American West _ where the treaty allows
non-nuclear tests, including the detonation of conventional
explosives to compress nuclear fuels short of firing.
</P>
<P>
   Such tests are considered vital for checking weapon safety and
reliability. Although it can be hard to distinguish their seismic
effects from those of very small nuclear blasts, nuclear blasts
emit certain radioactive isotopes of xenon, a colorless, odorless,
highly unreactive gas _ gas that invariably percolates up through
the ground. Sniffing for such gas is to be a main job of
atmospheric surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Turnbull, a top CIA seismologist, has long warned of
clever ways to evade detection of nuclear explosions. In 1995, he
briefed industry executives on how foes could use large mines or
caves for small clandestine blasts. The surrounding air would
soften the bomb's shock waves, in theory making them so diminutive
as to be undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn R. Sykes, a seismologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University and an authority on detecting
nuclear blasts, dismissed the CIA's fears as groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing in a cavity is portrayed as easy, when in fact it is
exceedingly difficult,'' he said. And experts say even deft
clandestine tests would still emit telltale xenon gas, in theory
allowing the cheats to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   What of small blasts that somehow managed to escape detection?
After the Cold War, official disclosures made clear that the
superpowers had occasionally done very small tests underground.
Most of these small explosions _ all below 1,000 tons _ were done
after the superpowers had mastered the art of producing big blasts.
The intentional making of tiny nuclear explosions can be difficult
for a novice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of a beginner doing anything under a kiloton is
zilch,'' said Dr. Ray E. Kidder, a scientist at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California and a former bomb
designer. Besides, he noted, there would be strong incentive to
progress to larger blasts more useful for bomb design.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., a former Pentagon official in the
Reagan administration who now directs the Center for Security
Policy, a private Washington group that opposes the test ban, said
tests below 1,000 tons were sufficient to investigate some aspects
of the atomic triggers used to ignite hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be very valuable militarily,'' he said in an
interview. ``And from such a successful test you can extrapolate.''
Small blasts, he added, echoing the view of some intelligence
officials, ``can escape detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney concluded that the treaty is a bad thing. ``Our hands
are tied,'' he said. ``And everybody else does what they want.''

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Gary Bauer ordered a glass door for his office
at his presidential campaign headquarters here last week. There was
nothing wrong with the old wooden one _ except that two former
aides have said they left because Bauer frequently closed it to
meet one-on-one with his female deputy campaign chief.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bauer quipped, better a glass door than a glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   There were titters after the conservative former head of the
Family Research Council called a news conference to deny rumors
almost no one had heard _ about improprieties no one seems to
believe occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a particularly funny episode for Bauer, who seems
to have suffered with his base on the Christian right after the two
former aides, men who are now working for his Republican rival
Steve Forbes, came forward to say they quit because Bauer had been
willfully oblivious to appearances. The 27-year-old woman who was
the subject of the rumors certainly isn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians and their consultants said that, especially
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the incident was sadly
unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals, not to
mention the female aides who would be penalized if they had only
limited access to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's reaction to the criticism seemed to speak to a general
skittishness in the post-Monica moment in U.S. politics. And while
the long-term impact on professional women in a still mostly-male
arena is unclear, the state of play for men and women at work on
campaigns is certainly a live issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks again, Bill and Monica,'' said Republican consultant
Alex Castellanos, who added that while he does see a
much-heightened sensitivity to appearances, he does not advise
candidates to safeguard appearances at the expense of female staff.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Joe Trippi left Clinton out of it, but
otherwise agreed. ``It's crazy that it's gotten to this point,'' he
said. ``It's probably the one and only time I agree with Gary
Bauer.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of conservatives felt Bauer should have been more
cautious, and should have stopped meeting privately with his female
aide after their strategy sessions caused talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrong, especially after he was warned'' by his former
aides that long closed-door meetings didn't look right, said Cathie
Adams, head of the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative women's group.
``That should not be part of what a man of integrity does. You've
got to have true friends around you, who will confront you if there
could even be a perception of misbehavior. Maybe it doesn't mean no
closed-door meetings, but not hour after hour with someone half
your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, who was a political adviser to presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, said Bauer should expect to be held to a
particularly high standard because ``many Christians believe that
to avoid temptation, men and women just shouldn't be alone when one
is married.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view ``seems sexist to me,'' Bauer said in an interview
_ one-on-one, with the door open _ in his headquarters, where his
wife, Carol, has an office across the hall, and his 22-year-old
daughter, Elyse, a campaign aide, is just down the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the whole brouhaha over private meetings was hard for
him to comprehend. ``I'm not this debonair guy,'' he said. ``And I
don't understand how we can set a standard that says young
professional women can never rise to a point with a male boss that
they're able to give confidential advice. My daughter said, `Dad,
if that's the standard, I just wasted four years of college.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, feminist standard-bearer?
</P>
<P>
   He gave a wounded smile. ``I'm not the Neanderthal I've been
made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is not, apparently, the only politician wondering about
how to preserve his own reputation without damaging the careers of
female aides. On Capitol Hill, several members said the fact that a
female congressional staff member had been named in Newt Gingrich's
divorce proceedings had further complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
   One House Democrat said that in September, when Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., was accused of, and denied, sexually harassing a female
aide he had let go, ``Every one of us looked at that and said,
`There but for the grace of God go I.' Even if you're not doing
anything wrong, you know you could be accused of anything at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This man, who like others said he was afraid to be named even
talking about the issue, said he had himself been warned by
supporters not to let a woman drive for him during his last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cautioned to be careful of appearances,'' he said, but
decided to ignore the advice. But he added: ``I know several
members who feel they have to keep the door open when they meet
with female staff. And the question is whether that diminishes the
effectiveness of top female staff.''
</P>
<P>
   No member, of course, admitted to compromising female employees
in that way. Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., whose spokesman had been
quoted by The Washington Post as saying he would not meet alone
with women, said via a spokesman that he in fact has ``no hard and
fast rule, but tries to use common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But several members did say they knew others who had concluded
that private meetings with women were just too risky.
</P>
<P>
   With more women in powerful positions, do female principals have
to be equally careful? Nah, said several consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole has been traveling with young male aides
throughout the course of this campaign, and it's never been a
problem,'' said Linda DiVall, who is Mrs. Dole's pollster. ``Though
some of them do have to carry her purse.''
</P>
<P>
   As more than one political adviser pointed out, State Department
spokesman James Rubin has been all over the world with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, presumably without scandalizing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the former Reagan and Bush adviser, said he, for one,
would tell women candidates to be just as careful as their male
counterparts _ and has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran Paula Hawkins' Senate campaign and I gave her that same
advice, not to travel alone with male aides,'' he said, referring
to a Florida Republican. ``There's a little more attention on it
now, but this is not totally new.''

Family Research Council called a news conference to deny rumors
almost no one had heard _ about improprieties no one seems to
believe occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a particularly funny episode for Bauer, who seems
to have suffered with his base on the Christian right after the two
former aides, men who are now working for his Republican rival
Steve Forbes, came forward to say they quit because Bauer had been
willfully oblivious to appearances. The 27-year-old woman who was
the subject of the rumors certainly isn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians and their consultants said that, especially
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the incident was sadly
unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals, not to
mention the female aides who would be penalized if they had only
limited access to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's reaction to the criticism seemed to speak to a general
skittishness in the post-Monica moment in U.S. politics. And while
the long-term impact on professional women in a still mostly-male
arena is unclear, the state of play for men and women at work on
campaigns is certainly a live issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks again, Bill and Monica,'' said Republican consultant
Alex Castellanos, who added that while he does see a
much-heightened sensitivity to appearances, he does not advise
candidates to safeguard appearances at the expense of female staff.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Joe Trippi left Clinton out of it, but
otherwise agreed. ``It's crazy that it's gotten to this point,'' he
said. ``It's probably the one and only time I agree with Gary
Bauer.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of conservatives felt Bauer should have been more
cautious, and should have stopped meeting privately with his female
aide after their strategy sessions caused talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrong, especially after he was warned'' by his former
aides that long closed-door meetings didn't look right, said Cathie
Adams, head of the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative women's group.
``That should not be part of what a man of integrity does. You've
got to have true friends around you, who will confront you if there
could even be a perception of misbehavior. Maybe it doesn't mean no
closed-door meetings, but not hour after hour with someone half
your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, who was a political adviser to presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, said Bauer should expect to be held to a
particularly high standard because ``many Christians believe that
to avoid temptation, men and women just shouldn't be alone when one
is married.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view ``seems sexist to me,'' Bauer said in an interview
_ one-on-one, with the door open _ in his headquarters, where his
wife, Carol, has an office across the hall, and his 22-year-old
daughter, Elyse, a campaign aide, is just down the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the whole brouhaha over private meetings was hard for
him to comprehend. ``I'm not this debonair guy,'' he said. ``And I
don't understand how we can set a standard that says young
professional women can never rise to a point with a male boss that
they're able to give confidential advice. My daughter said, `Dad,
if that's the standard, I just wasted four years of college.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, feminist standard-bearer?
</P>
<P>
   He gave a wounded smile. ``I'm not the Neanderthal I've been
made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is not, apparently, the only politician wondering about
how to preserve his own reputation without damaging the careers of
female aides. On Capitol Hill, several members said the fact that a
female congressional staff member had been named in Newt Gingrich's
divorce proceedings had further complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
   One House Democrat said that in September, when Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., was accused of, and denied, sexually harassing a female
aide he had let go, ``Every one of us looked at that and said,
`There but for the grace of God go I.' Even if you're not doing
anything wrong, you know you could be accused of anything at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This man, who like others said he was afraid to be named even
talking about the issue, said he had himself been warned by
supporters not to let a woman drive for him during his last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cautioned to be careful of appearances,'' he said, but
decided to ignore the advice. But he added: ``I know several
members who feel they have to keep the door open when they meet
with female staff. And the question is whether that diminishes the
effectiveness of top female staff.''
</P>
<P>
   No member, of course, admitted to compromising female employees
in that way. Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., whose spokesman had been
quoted by The Washington Post as saying he would not meet alone
with women, said via a spokesman that he in fact has ``no hard and
fast rule, but tries to use common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But several members did say they knew others who had concluded
that private meetings with women were just too risky.
</P>
<P>
   With more women in powerful positions, do female principals have
to be equally careful? Nah, said several consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole has been traveling with young male aides
throughout the course of this campaign, and it's never been a
problem,'' said Linda DiVall, who is Mrs. Dole's pollster. ``Though
some of them do have to carry her purse.''
</P>
<P>
   As more than one political adviser pointed out, State Department
spokesman James Rubin has been all over the world with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, presumably without scandalizing anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the former Reagan and Bush adviser, said he, for one,
would tell women candidates to be just as careful as their male
counterparts _ and has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran Paula Hawkins' Senate campaign and I gave her that same
advice, not to travel alone with male aides,'' he said, referring
to a Florida Republican. ``There's a little more attention on it
now, but this is not totally new.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Susan Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor
who ran Michael Dukakis' Democratic presidential campaign in 1988,
said that men's fear of career-stopping sexual allegations was
acute in the world of politics _ ``a weird world of married men and
single women'' _ but also quite common in the business world. And
in part, she says, that's a result of the laws that were supposed
to protect women from sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are reluctant to go on business trips with women,'' said
Ms. Estrich, who teaches a course in gender discrimination. ``At
the end of a hard day, a man can have a beer and watch the game in
his room with another man, and that's OK, but with a woman, it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that as a result, professional women were often left
without the mentors that are crucial to most successful careers.
``It's pretty hard to be mentored by somebody who doesn't want to
be alone with you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she finds that yes, Monica Lewinsky, and even Ally McBeal,
the mini-skirted TV lawyer, have made men at work still more
nervous. ``The message to guys is, if you see a 24-year-old woman,
particularly one who's a little bit sexy, beware.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate outlook for young women in politics does seem
circumscribed. ``If I were running a campaign today, even I
wouldn't assign a 25-year-old woman to travel with the candidate,''
Ms. Estrich said. ``I wouldn't want to encourage people to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa McClard, the passionately conservative 27-year-old
Bauer aide whose closed-door meetings and campaign trips with her
candidate did become an issue, said she has drawn precisely the
opposite conclusion from her recent educational experience. And
what she feels she's learned the hard way is that you can't let the
whisperers have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has undermined my confidence in the workplace and other
people's confidence in me, because now women are mistrusted in the
workplace,'' she said. ``In the wake of everything that's happened
in the last year, the presumption is that, when the door closes,
there is something else going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll be honest, this has changed things in my job. Whether
it's conscious or subconscious, it's always in the back of your
mind and it's hard to keep a focus and not allow anger to take
over. You don't want to overcompensate, but you have to be
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   After disapproval over her access to Bauer first registered, she
said, ``I went through a phase where I did not wear skirts to the
office and I did not wear makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day somebody said, `Maybe you should pull your hair
back in a bun.' At that point, I didn't know if they were kidding
or not. But when that comment was made, I finally realized that
what others say is not as important as how you feel when you sit
down all alone, and you know who you are.''

 WHY THE PRESS LOVES JOHN MCCAIN
 (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>

York Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JACOB WEISBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain isn't running in Iowa, and he may get clobbered in
New Hampshire. But he's miles ahead in the very first contest of
the 2000 campaign: the press primary. Journalists go weak in the
knees around the guy.
</P>
<P>
   The few who have attempted to write debunking pieces about him
have failed miserably. When I set out to spend a few days with
McCain recently, I promised my editor that I wouldn't join in this
collective swoon. That proved impossible. But perhaps I can redeem
myself a bit by examining the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the hacks love McCain? You could start with our
admiration for a quality not many of us possess: physical courage.
But I think the deeper admiration is for the guts McCain showed in
his Vietnamese captivity and which he's shown consistently ever
since. Everyone knows by now the story told in McCain's book, how
he voluntarily suffered five and a half years as a POW in Vietnam
after refusing an early release.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wasn't just a war hero. He was a kind of spirit of
resistance personified, a man who writes in his book that he found
freedom in captivity by tormenting his torturers, even at the cost
of additional abuse. McCain is a Faulknerian character, in a very
different sense than Bill Clinton is. And I think that at this
point, even those of us who think Clinton has been a good president
hunger for a successor more deserving of our respect.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who have covered McCain in the Senate have seen
Republican politics considerably enlivened by this defiant
character. McCain is barely tolerated by his party's leadership,
and he hardly conceals his contempt for Trent Lott and Mitch
McConnell. He has broken with his colleagues over campaign-finance
reform, over legislation to punish cigarette makers, and over
corporate welfare. There's a bit of the ``strange new respect''
phenomenon in the way journalists respond to these positions.
</P>
<P>
   When a conservative politician takes liberal stands, he is often
described as having ``grown.'' Yet McCain remains a genuine
conservative, the farthest to the right of any of the other
plausible candidates in the race (a category that excludes the
born-again Bible slinger Steve Forbes). Reporters respect McCain
less because he takes liberal positions than because of the way he
puts his beliefs ahead of his career as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been conducting himself in the same delightfully
subversive way as a candidate for the GOP nomination. There were
two guys in the campaign brave enough or clueless enough to oppose
ethanol subsidies beforehand. Both faced the unappealing prospect
of having to run in the Iowa caucus with this millstone around
their necks. One of those candidates, Bill Bradley, brazenly
changed his position to favor tax breaks for ethanol. The other,
John McCain decided not to run in the Iowa Caucuses rather than
change his position--even though forgoing the first contest makes
his uphill struggle that much steeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate that I've observed in a race, if winning is
the only objective, they always end up doing something,'' he told
me. ``They compromise in order to experience some real or imagined
short-term political gain.'' McCain says this not with contempt,
but with pity for those of his colleagues who cannot resist
political temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the McCain charm. I doubt I'll enjoy any part of
this 2000 campaign so much as a couple of days spent as part of a
three-person press corps traveling with McCain. He's funny,
friendly, and far too candid for his own good. Most politicians go
off the record when they want to state the obvious. McCain doesn't
go off the record at all, at least in my experience.
</P>
<P>
   He behaves, in fact, more like a civilian talking about politics
than a politician discussing politics. He does reverse spin:
Unprompted, he tells me that his big announcement speech the
previous day in South Carolina was something of a failure,
describing himself as tired and his audience as merely ``polite.''
And there aren't too many other senators, let alone presidential
candidates, who will start a conversation (in the van, leaving the
Reagan Library) with the line, ``One of the many reasons I hate the
French ...'' (the reason related to a diplomatic insult to Warren
Christopher when he was secretary of state.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said other things in recent weeks that would land
another candidate in deep doo-doo. In a recent piece in U.S. News,
Roger Simon quoted him referring to his North Vietnamese prison
guards as ``the goddamn gooks.'' Reporters usually either put such
indiscretions off the record on McCain's behalf or congratulate him
for making them. One reason for this is the media's sound instinct
not to punish a politician for being exceptionally candid with the
media. Another is the feeling that McCain has earned the right to
say whatever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have watched his career, his outspokenness on the
campaign trail appears as a refusal to be cowed by yet another
prison and its silly rules. As Bob Dole once said about McCain, you
spend five-and-a-half years in a box, you get to say whatever you
want.
</P>
<P>
   He also responds to the press. Unlike the inaccessible George W.
Bush, you can get to McCain easily, and have a frank, intelligent
discussion with him about just about any topic. I've developed a
minor obsession with how the various Republican education plans
don't make sense even on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's flawed plan, like Bush's even more flawed plan,
wouldn't give vouchers a fair test, because it doesn't fund the
voucher at anywhere near the cost of most private schools. And if a
voucher won't pay for private school, it won't create any pressure
on public schools to improve. I made this point to McCain on a
flight from Grand Rapids, Mich., to the Reagan Library in
California. His initial response was that while $2,000, the amount
in his plan, wouldn't cover tuition at Sidwell Friends or Andover,
it would pay for many Catholic parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unembarrassed to tell you that one of my happiest days of
recent years was when my daughter was accepted in Catholic
school,'' he said. ``I know she'll get a quality education. She'll
wear a uniform, and she'll be away from those little bastards that
are trying to get their hands on her.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain then called across the aisle of the plane to his wife.
``Cindy, honey, good morning. How much is our tuition for Megan at
Xavier?'' Meghan, 14, is the McCains' oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``$6,100,`` Mrs. McCain answered. ``Not including books or
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain seemed surprised at how high it was. And the next thing I
knew, he was running with my criticism, trashing his own proposal.
``It's one thing to say we'll give everybody a choice,'' he said.
``Well, if they can't get in, then we'd better either provide
incentives for schools to come into being where they can afford it,
or figure out a way to give them enough of a voucher where they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say that McCain is to be faulted for not working out a
better education proposal in the first place. But in a way, being
able to profit from valid criticism is more important than being a
master of policy detail. The Clinton health-care plan is a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   This points to a final press-friendly quality of McCain's:
brilliant flattery. It's fairly unusual, in my experience, for a
politician to accept a reporter's opinion that one of his major
proposals is seriously flawed. It's also gratifying to the
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is a master of buttering up journalists by quoting
their books and articles back to them. But with Clinton, the effort
at seduction is transparent. You know he really hates the press,
and is forcing himself to try to win them over. When McCain
flatters you, it doesn't feel automatic or calculated.
</P>
<P>
   He truly likes us journalists. It's his fellow senators he can't
stand.

   LAS VEGAS _ The mystery train that carried Andrea Bauer to the
MGM Grand Hotel this weekend started in her family's living room
when she was a girl, in the 1950s. Sometimes when her father, a
devoted Perry Como fan, left the house, her mother would quickly
switch to a record by that new singer, the twitchy kid from Tupelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis Presley would sing, and my mother and I would dance and
dance and dance,'' Ms. Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   So, four decades later, she came to Las Vegas to get herself a
little piece of Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley Enterprises, the group that manages Graceland _
Presley's former home _ and other Elvis-related properties,
including the trove of archives from a man who seems to have thrown
away nothing (do you still have your 1960 Texaco credit card?),
decided it was time to put some of its treasures on the auction
block.
</P>
<P>
   For three days this weekend, each one devoted to memorabilia
from a decade of Elvis' performing life _ beginning with the 1950s
on Friday and ending with the 1970s on Sunday _ collectors,
obsessives and ordinary fans from all over the world could walk
away with a piece of Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands came to see the auction preview exhibits that went on
display Sept. 28, said Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's
auction house in New York, which is handling the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened the doors, there was already a line, and there
was not a time during all of those days that it was not crowded,''
Ettinger said. ``We have handled a lot of big auctions, including
the baseball auction that had Mark McGwire's record home-run ball
and an auction of John F. Kennedy items, but we have never seen
anything like this. I had to triple the size of my staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous, chandeliered auction hall at the MGM Grand was
humming Friday afternoon when the lights dimmed and ``Also Sprach
Zarathustra,'' better known as the theme from ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' blared over the loudspeakers. It was the music Elvis
always played to announce his arrival on the stage in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the lights came up and it was Ettinger at the
microphone. ``I guess you were hoping it would be someone else,''
he said. ``I guess I was, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just the kind of oddball scene you might expect _
tourists from Iowa seated next to serious collectors whispering
into cell phones, several Elvis impersonators working the crowd
(including one guy who, frankly, save for his pompadour and
gleaming jewelry, looked a bit more like Broderick Crawford), and
dozens of people of all shapes, ages and sizes in Elvis T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bauer fidgeted excitedly in her seat near the back of the
room, grimacing as she lost out on the bidding for a couple of
items. Finally, she hit pay dirt, forcefully raising her auction
paddle into the air until, for $950, she became the owner of a 1956
note from Steve Allen to Col. Tom Parker, Elvis' legendary manager,
thanking him ``for sending the wonderful saddle for Stevie.'' Elvis
had appeared on Allen's show in July 1956, singing ``Hound Dog'' to
an actual hound dog that sat nervously beside him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bauer, who flew in from Carol Stream, Ill., to attend the
auction with her 17-year-old son, did not care whether anyone else
thought the note was worth the money. She came to Las Vegas for
this and she wanted to take something away with her. Her mother got
her started collecting Elvis memorabilia, and she already has some
concert tickets, a pocket watch and other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a big Steve Allen fan and I'm a big Elvis fan,
so it feels right,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades most of this Elvis arcana was out of sight and in
the care of archivists. Then, said Jack Soden, the chief executive
officer of Elvis Presley Enterprises, the idea of the auction came
in a flash one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   An arm of the group, the Elvis Presley Charitable Foundation,
had been working for decades on a variety of projects in Memphis,
Tenn., and had gradually become more and more impressed with the
work being done by the Memphis Inter-Faith Alliance to get homeless
families off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were drawn to the program because of the role public
housing played in Elvis' life,'' Soden said. ``When his family
moved to Memphis from Tupelo, they had to live in public housing,
and he never forgot that period of poverty in his childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance had built ``villages'' of transitional housing for
homeless families that had particularly impressed Soden and the
others. So they came up with the idea of auctioning the memorabilia
to pay for the construction and maintenance of Presley Village, a
new housing development near downtown Memphis, to be managed by the
Inter-Faith Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   They asked Lisa Marie Presley, the singer's daughter and heir,
if she liked the plan (``It's her stuff,'' Soden said), and she
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much the three-day auction brings in _ sales have
been projected to reach $2 million, but Soden and Ettinger say
nobody really knows _ the Presley Foundation will give $1.5 million
for Presley Village, which will have 12 units. That is enough to
break ground in about a month, have the first homeless family move
in next year and maintain the place for many years.
</P>
<P>
   If the auction makes more than $1.5 million, the excess will be
pumped into the Presley Foundation until it has what its managers
believe is a sufficient cash reserve. If there is any money left,
it will go into expanding and upgrading the Presley archives and
exhibits at Graceland, Soden said.
</P>
<P>
   He was keen to assure people that none of the items put up for
auction had been on exhibit at Graceland. ``This auction does not
diminish the Graceland experience,'' he said.

   Those who came looking for something to sneer at (as a great man
once said, don't be cruel) found a rich banquet for their
patronizing scorn _ furry pillows, furry chairs, a leopard-skin
beanbag chair (also furry), coats with lime-green lapels, black fur
collars and red-leather pocket flaps, a 9-foot-long love seat
shaped like a banana, several sparkling jumpsuits in neon shades of
green and red and gold, a table whose legs were statues of nude
mermaids, holding a lamp that looked like a Mardi Gras float, and
on and on.
</P>
<P>
   There were also enough trivial financial documents among the
objects _ hotel bills, canceled checks, performance contracts,
plane tickets, car-repair invoices _ that it seemed all someone
would need was Elvis' W-2 to be able to do his taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these were not the overwhelming impressions left by the
auction's assemblage of objects. Instead, what you saw, peeking
from amid the relics, were the little flashes of humanity, through
the eyes of a bewildered country boy from Tupelo who walked a very,
very strange American road from poverty to pop-cultural deity,
perhaps getting a little loopy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   There was Elvis' sixth-grade report card from Tupelo Junior High
School in 1947. He was particularly strong in music and spelling,
weak in geography and arithmetic, scored higher and higher in the
``citizenship ratings'' of reliability, cooperation, industry and
courtesy, and was absent only a handful of days.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the receipt from the Fountainbleau Hotel in 1960,
with Presley's precise and demanding breakfast order, including
eggs fried hard (``yolks broken'' is underlined), bacon crisp,
sliced tomato, hash brown potatoes, toast (``well buttered'' is
also underlined), coffee and milk.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a hand-scrawled note found in Parker's desk that
reads: ``Hello Colonel, I used your phone. Hope you don't mind.
Respectfully, E.P.''
</P>
<P>
   One imagines Parker saving it so he would remember to bill Elvis
for the call.
</P>
<P>
   All through the auction, bits of Elvis' life disappeared with
the nod of the auctioneer's head into the lives of strangers. His
first piano went for $90,000. The report card fetched $8,000. His
1956 white Lincoln Continental Mark II went for $250,000 to an
anonymous bidder on the phone. His draft card drew $22,500. Elvis'
set of keys to Graceland went for $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to Graceland!
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Johnson, the director of the Association for Retarded
Children in Knoxville, Tenn., said she did not know exactly why she
had wanted those keys, but she got them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain why,'' she said. ``I came with a list of five
or six items I might bid on, and they were one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons they cannot explain, some people just want to see
Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson seemed a little shocked that her purchase of the
keys prompted television cameramen to follow her out of the auction
room and down the hotel corridor, past the celebrity-chef
restaurants and toward the casino and the palm-lined Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'll just put them in my underwear drawer, where
they'll be safe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no plans to display the keys and no desire to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll take them home and tell my friends I've got
them,'' she said. ``Or maybe I'll go on over to Graceland and see
if they changed the locks.''

</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, the $123 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when
it veered off course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere. NASA
revealed the cause: One part of the orbiter's navigation system was
speaking in English units and another in metric.
</P>
<P>
   Why hasn't the U.S. adopted the metric system?
</P>
<P>
   The metric system originated in France in the late 17th century
to combat rampant commercial fraud by farmers and shopkeepers who
used the varied systems of weights and measures to their advantage.
Scientists were also demanding a standardized system to facilitate
international cooperation on research.
</P>
<P>
   While old systems seemed arbitrary, the new standardized system
had an apparent basis in nature: The meter was defined as
1/10,000,000 of the distance between the equator and either pole
(it has since been redefined in terms of the speed of light). It
was also easier to remember than other systems because it was based
on the decimal system.
</P>
<P>
   France officially adopted the metric system in the early 1800s,
and the rest of the continent quickly followed in hopes that a
standardized measurement system would spur international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next hundred years, the metric system spread globally.
The British Commonwealth resisted abandoning their traditional
measures, but in the early 1970s--under the slogan ``Metric: 10
times better''--they, too, metricated. (Some road signs and body
weights, however, remain ``customary.'') Today, the U.S. is one of
only three countries--along with Myanmar and Liberia--where the
metric system is not commonly used.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, at least, the U.S. has gone metric. The yard, the
pound, and the gallon--prototypes of which were once held in
London--are now officially defined by reference to metric units. In
1975, the federal government adopted metric as the nation's
``preferred measurement system'' and established the United States
Metric Board to manage the transition. The changeover was
ineffective, however, and by the early 1980s, the only tangible
progress was that liquor and wine had to be labeled in liters.
</P>
<P>
   Metrication was revived in 1988, when Congress required that all
government agencies be metric by 1992 to the extent ``feasible.''
Today, agencies with large international or scientific
operations--like the Department of Defense and NASA--are almost
fully converted; others--like the Department of Education--have
done little, citing the rights of states to decide such matters.
America's private sector is similarly mixed: Large corporations
with overseas exports are at least partly converted, but most small
businesses still use the English system.
</P>
<P>
   American metric advocates encountered stiff opposition in the
'70s and '80s. Labor unions worried that workers would be unable to
learn a new system. Businesses protested that redesigning machines
and products to metric standards would be costly. States objected
to the expense of replacing road signs and revising laws. And
average citizens argued that change was unnecessary and said the
metric system--with its multiples of 10, instead of the more
intuitive halves and quarters of English measures--was not
compatible with human experience. In contrast, there was no natural
constituency for the pro-metric cause.
</P>
<P>
   But similar obstacles were encountered--and overcome--in other
countries. So, some metric advocates attribute America's
non-conversion to national character. American individualism, they
say, makes us more resistant to government-mandated change than
other cultures. For example, Mother Jones reported that the
National Cowboy Hall of Fame sued to block metrication, claiming
``the West was won by the inch, foot, yard, and mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Metric supporters also see xenophobia in Americans' distaste for
a foreign system of measurement. In the 1970s, some opponents
suggested that metric road signs would facilitate a Russian
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Others ascribe American inaction to logistical obstacles. It is
a classic instance of path dependency: Once a course is chosen, it
is difficult to induce people to switch. And until the 1990s, the
U.S. had little incentive to do so, since the economy was
sufficiently dominant in its trade relationships to enforce English
units on its partners. (This may soon change, as the European Union
plans to ban products labeled in English units at the end of the
year).
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike other nations, the United States' metrication
legislation has been entirely voluntary, so few organizations have
transitioned. The Department of Commerce's Metric Program--which
took up the cause when the Metric Board was abolished in 1982--now
focuses on outreach to the business community, instead of
legislation. The year's marquee event, ``Metric Week,'' began
Sunday, October 10--the 10th day of the 10th month.

   VIENNA, Austria _ Wedged inside a crowd in the central square
here, listening to a politician harangue the throng while 200
student demonstrators behind you scream ``Nazis, raus! Nazis,
raus!'' at him, it's important to quell those waves of memory and
remind yourself: You don't speak German, stupid. Forget all those
black-and-white films you watched as a kid. This isn't ``Triumph of
the Will'' even if you're getting the guttural aural cues. It was
your father who was in on the Normandy landing; you only caught the
flick.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often think they spot Nazism on the march in
German-speaking countries. It's a conditioned reflex, the same way
African newspapers love to run big pictures of tiny Ku Klux Klan
rallies, leaving the impression that every third American is a
Klansman.
</P>
<P>
   One American TV report on the 27 percent showing by Joerg
Haider's right-wing Freedom Party in voting here last week worked
in old clips of goose-stepping soldiers and a fulminating Hitler.
An Israeli headline said: ``One Out of Every Four Austrians Chose a
Neo-Nazi Chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   That offended even Austrians who detest Haider (whose party tied
for second and is highly unlikely to become chancellor).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my translator said, the speaker was criticizing the gap
between the pay of Austrian bank presidents and working stiffs.
It's true that when Haider complains about ``Uberfremdung,'' or
over-foreignization, even Austrians say the word has a certain
``Deutschland Uber Alles'' ring to it. But the overtly racial
element of Nazism is lacking. It's similar to the sentiment
expressed in Ross Perot's ``giant sucking sound'' from south of the
border _ nativist populism.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, it isn't necessarily racial. An Egyptian taxi driver,
Hassan Ramy, told me he was a Haider voter. What about his
anti-immigrant feelings? I asked. He's against the ones who don't
have papers, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   True, Austria was long criticized for failing to deal with its
Nazi past; for years, while Germany apologized, it portrayed itself
as Germany's first victim. And Haider has made what a Jewish leader
in his party called ``a couple of stupid remarks that are
constantly quoted.''
</P>
<P>
   In one, he retorted in the heat of debate that the Third Reich
had a sounder employment policy than the today's governing Social
Democrats, and in another he told a veterans' reunion that included
some Waffen SS soldiers that they were ``decent people who stuck to
their belief through the strongest headwinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither at the Vienna gathering I attended nor at a noisy
beer-tent rally in Haider's home area, near the Slovenian and
Italian borders, did his supporters harp on race. ``Sixty percent
of the people here, I think, are protest votes,'' said Hans
Hechenleitner, 53, explaining that people felt the ruling Social
Democratic-conservative coalition in Vienna left them feeling
powerless. ``There's not racism, except maybe among some of the
uneducated ones, and you have also this difference in the U.S., is
it not so?''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hechenleitner about something Haider has said in Vienna,
complaining about the ``extremist'' tag: ``People say I'll declare
war on Slovenia if I'm elected. But that's not true. In my area, we
have good relations with the Italians and Slovenians.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction suggested Haider had gone a bit bleeding heart in
pandering to the urbane Viennese. Hechenleitner and his friend,
Horst Assam, 62, looked at each other. Hechenleitner finally spoke,
betraying the Austrian mistrust of outsiders: ``No, you can't say
we  &UR; like &LR;  them. But we work together.''
</P>
<P>
   There is definitely something creepy about Haider's xenophobia
and how many Austrians it appeals to. Austria is in the middle of
Europe and has been overrun by a lot of peoples _ and Austrians
themselves are often eager to enumerate their diverse ethnic
backgrounds for you. But there's something in at least 27 percent
of the country that wants to shut the door, and it lives even in
the breasts of Egypto-Austrian cabbies. Andreas Rudas, a senior
tactitian for the Social Democratic Party, called it ``the omnibus
effect,'' as in, ``Once I'm on the bus, I want the doors to close
so it doesn't get crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   What liberal leaders find disturbing is less Haider's rhetoric
on race than his oratory on crime _ which, by extension, whips up
fear of foreigners. Prodded by his claims that it is coddling drug
dealers, the government launched a series of drug raids. ``But the
subtext becomes anti-black, anti-Nigerian,'' said Georg
Hoffman-Ostenhof, a political columnist for the weekly Profil, even
though the black population is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   With 4 percent unemployment, health care for all and a
negligible murder rate here, it's a mystery why a lot of Austrians
are convinced that their tiny nation is a hotbed of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drug dealers?'' my translator, who weighs about 100
pounds and feels safe bicycling anywhere in Vienna at night, asked
Horst Thaler, a 66-year-old in a Tyrolean jacket at a rally for
Haidar's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in the Karlsplatz,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a subway station a few blocks away, so we did. By Times
Square standards, it's an Alpine village. By Austrian standards,
it's littered, and there were several unwashed guys begging for
``Zigaretten.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, coming home from watching the late returns, I
passed the Karlsplatz again. The beggar who approached me was, I
presume, Austrian; he was polite and completely bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Then a music event nearby let out, and a crowd came surging
toward the tram. They climbed on, loud and obnoxious, practically
shouting at each other. They were from North Carolina and
California, they were in black tie and had hearing aids. They were
ticked: They didn't know the opera in Vienna begins at 6, and they
had missed the whole first act.
</P>
<P>

U.S. TROOPS START ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ The U.S. military has arrived in East Timor in
force, although the bulk of the American troops participating in
the international peacekeeping mission will remain safely aboard a
warship in the waters off this looted, burned-out shell of a city.
</P>
<P>
   The amphibious assault ship, the Belleau Wood, landed in Dili's
harbor on Friday. During their deployment here, most of the 1,800
sailors and marines aboard the 40,000-ton ship will never go
ashore, staying safe from attack by the Indonesian-backed militias
that rampaged across East Timor after the territory voted for
independence from Indonesia in August.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 U.S. troops are assigned to duty on shore, and of
those, most spend the night aboard the ship, about half a mile off
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 priority is taking care of my people,'' said Brig.
Gen. John Castellaw, commander of the U.S. forces participating in
the Australian-led peacekeeping mission. ``We're not at war with
anybody; nobody has been declared hostile to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The machine guns aboard the four large Sea Stallion helicopters
stationed on the Belleau Wood ``are only for self-defense,'' he
said. ``And they're the last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in a former schoolhouse that is serving as his
headquarters in East Timor, the Marine general said that the U.S.
mission here centered on the use of the helicopters to help the
Australians ferry heavy equipment, vehicles and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, the largest in the U.S. military inventory, can
each carry a payload of 32,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian military has enthusiastically taken on the actual
work of peacekeeping _ securing the shattered territory from
further attacks by the militias, which have largely fled across the
border to Indonesian-controlled West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Castellaw said that the mission had been ``a success story _ the
Australians don't have to prove anything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only gun battle to date involving the peacekeepers, two
militia members were killed and two Australian soldiers wounded on
Wednesday when a militia tried to ambush a peacekeeping unit near

A POLITICAL PUZZLE OF 2 TEXANS:   BUSH AND DELAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo.)  (mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are a couple of leading theories about the
relationship between the Texas Republicans who may soon be running
the country:
</P>
<P>
   A.) That the party's presidential front-runner, Gov. George W.
Bush, and the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, R-Texas, are closer
than we know, ideological kindred spirits who like to play good
cop/bad cop but then share the double-secret conservative handshake
when nobody is looking.
</P>
<P>
   B.) That these two guys from opposite sides of the tracks have
little to nothing in common and if Bush was elected president,
would enjoy roughly as easy a relationship with DeLay as the
governor's father did with Newt Gingrich, the firebrand who later
became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to both men suggest yet another possibility: that
while they are not unfriendly and are at least somewhat
like-minded, they are also similarly tough and competitive _ enough
so to be willing to win at the other's expense, if need be. And
smart enough to recognize, too, that they need each other, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Bush certainly seemed to go out of his
way to poke DeLay and all House Republicans in the eye a couple of
times. First, he accused them of trying to ``balance their budget
on the backs of the poor.'' Then, in a speech on education, he
portrayed his party as fixated on affluence _``focused on the
national economy, to the exclusion of all else.'' But aides to Bush
insist that his later remarks, which had been written before the
first flap occurred, were not intended to cut congressional
Republicans a second time, and seemed harsher in light of the
earlier criticism.
</P>
<P>
   After initially lashing out that the governor ``does not know
how Congress works,'' DeLay is said to be over his pique (or
facsimile of pique, in the alternative view). DeLay, who is
commonly viewed as the real power in the House, volunteers that he
and the governor have ``never had dinner. We aren't social
friends.'' But his comments do advance the theory that the two are
ideologically much closer than their stylistic differences might
suggest. And, of course, no one in the Bush campaign has ever
hinted that their candidate is anything other than a credentialed
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between us,''
DeLay said in a recent interview, before Bush's unflattering
remarks. ``I'm not sure there's a dime's worth of difference
between us, philosophically. I don't know of any moderate Texas
Republicans, if you really want to know. It's conservative and more
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In his quest to put a friendlier face on the Republican Party,
Bush has more reason to put some distance between himself and the
majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, another fellow Texan, and DeLay,
also known as ``the Hammer,'' whom Democrats are trying to make
Bush's de facto running mate. (``Just remember B-A-D,'' said Chris
Lehane, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore. ``Bush-Armey-DeLay:
Bad policy, bad politics, bad for America.'')
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist said that because Bush would be
jettisoning the House Republicans' confrontational style, the
members of Congress hurrying to board the Bush bandwagon seemed to
be catching on only belatedly to the fact that their instant
affection for the governor might not be reciprocal. Most House
Republicans rushing to support him ``never calculated that it was
an act of self-immolation,'' the strategist said, adding that most
were still ``as oblivious to what this means for them over the next
two to four years as a 6-year-old is to the workings of a jet
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   But not so DeLay, who seems both reconciled to the fact that
some distancing is probably inevitable and willing to return the
favor and speak out against the governor, if necessary. ``Bush has
to do what he has to do to win his presidency,'' he said at the end
of last week. After making the critical remarks about fellow
Republicans in last week's education speech, one adviser to the
governor said that Bush had acknowledged that House leaders knew
the score, saying, ``Those guys understand.''
</P>
<P>
   And the governor, in turn, understands that he needs
congressional support _ 152 House members have endorsed him so far,
along with 25 senators _ and so must keep DeLay at least relatively
happy. ``For House Republicans, DeLay is the most important figure,
and within the campaign there's a recognition that we need to be
working with him,'' the Bush adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress have already pitched in with fund-raisers back
home, and will help to turn out the Republican vote in their
districts, where many of them are quite popular. If Bush is
elected, a working relationship with House Republicans would
certainly make life easier, even if they fail to hold on to their
majority. But it is also generally understood that if he has to
sacrifice the House to get elected, he will.
</P>
<P>
   Relations do not seem to have been permanently chilled by the
recent criticism. Aides to the two men socialize, and the
governor's official liaison on the Hill, Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who
says he talks to the governor's staff nearly every day, is also
DeLay's chief deputy whip.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bush formally announced his candidacy, he and some
House Republicans had begun meeting informally to discuss an agenda
for 2000. Bush needed their early support, and House Republicans
needed a strong presidential candidate, one with the potential to
help them preserve their slim majority despite some pretty iffy
poll ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' Blunt said recently, ``a lot of our members
endorsed him before they met him,'' but have only become more
enthusiastic as they have gotten to know him, he added. When asked
to name Bush's closest friends on Capitol Hill, he thought for a
while and said, ``I think he and Tom DeLay are friends'' _ again,
not golfing buddies, but political allies with an understanding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In background, bearing and basic style, the two men are
obviously worlds apart: Bush is an Ivy League-educated former owner
of a professional baseball team who was born into a political
dynasty _ a sunny, big-picture guy's guy who likes to get along and
seemed to enjoy governing Texas alongside his good friend, the late
Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, on the other hand, is the son of an alcoholic wildcatter,
a man DeLay describes as ``like something straight out of
`Giant.''' The House whip is a former pest exterminator who made
his own way, got into politics to cut red tape and became a
true-believing, i-dotting and t-crossing, fight-to-the-finish
conservative, the ultimate partisan, and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush does the forest, DeLay does the trees,'' said Ed
Gillespie, a Republican strategist, with a laugh. ``Bush is
passive-aggressive, DeLay is aggressive-aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by all accounts, seems to regard DeLay with a respect
exactly commensurate with the power he wields in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They first met in 1980, ``when I was first starting,'' DeLay
remembers, ``and his daddy was running with Ronald Reagan.'' Their
first encounter was at a fund-raiser in Houston, where DeLay said
the younger Bush made an impression. ``He was, what's the word I
want? Passionate is too feminine, but he was gung-ho for his daddy.
He was kind of oil field trash _ that's an endearing term, by the
way. And when I first met him he was trying to find himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ``He's certainly smoothed over the edges. Probably
the best thing that ever happened to him was getting involved with
the Texas Rangers, because he focused and learned from that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when President Bush abandoned his no-new-taxes pledge,
DeLay was front and center among House Republicans who opposed him.
And the younger Bush did not enlist DeLay into his gubernatorial
campaign against the incumbent governor, Ann Richards, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay does seem to get along better with the governor than
he ever did with President Bush, referring to the younger Bush as a
fellow Christian and ``much more of a people person'' than his
father. Typically, he likes to position himself as the benefactor,
rather than the supplicant, in the relationship. ``When he needs
something, he calls, and we try to take care of him,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if in truth the balance of power is probably in Bush's
favor, DeLay does have the power to hurt the governor, and those
who know Bush say that means he will try to keep him as close as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   As one Bush supporter who knows them both put it, ``They're
different guys, but at the end of the day, they're both just a
couple of pols. And I can see them now, on the Truman balcony with
their boots up, trading war stories.''

   President Goes on Offensive In a Foray Into Canada
</P>
<P>
   The sun was shining, he was among friends, and soon the
president was on a roll, improvising jokes as he worked his way
through a speech inaugurating the new U.S. Embassy in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Blithely unaware of the Canadian government's defensiveness over
its high tax rates, Bill Clinton cracked that his host, Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, ``says that if I come one more time I have
to start paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton, who undoubtedly has been briefed on the national
aspiration of many French-speaking Quebeckers, described a family
trip he made a decade ago to Montreal as a trip to ``France.''
White House stenographers corrected the transcript to read
``Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the blooper that catapulted a routine trip to the top
of Friday evening's BBC television news. He improvised a folksy
image to illustrate his efforts to ``help the people in the land of
my forebears in Northern Ireland get over 600 years of religious
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And every time they make an agreement to do it, they're like a
couple of drunks walking out of the bar for the last time,'' he
said of the zigzag peace process between Protestants and Catholics
in Northern Ireland. ``When they get to the swinging door, they
turn around and go back in, and say, I just can't quite get
there.'' Clinton later apologized for what he called an
inappropriate metaphor.

</P>
<P>
   Some wanted posters of the future may have no photographs, no
names, only strands of DNA, if a Wisconsin prosecutor's charge
against an unknown suspect is upheld. And the notion of a time
limit for filing criminal charges may go the way of the powdered
wig.
</P>
<P>
   Someone committed three rapes in Milwaukee in 1993. But with the
state's six-year time limit for filing charges about to run out in
one case, police have no idea who the rapist is. So to put a foot
in the door, the prosecutor has filed charges of rape and
kidnapping against ``John Doe, unknown male with matching
deoxyribonucleic acid profile.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can change your name, but you can't change your genetic
code,'' said the prosecutor, Norman Gahn.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the case will be challenged, but is not
frivolous. ''We are at the beginning of an era where law
enforcement has to go back and look at old unsolved cases,'' said
Barry Scheck, a law professor and member of the Commission for the
Future of DNA Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I assure you,'' he said, ``you are going to find thousands
of serial murderers and serial rapists.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of numbers that describes the Milwaukee suspect's
genetic code were uploaded by modem to the FBI's national databank
of DNA Each month, they will be compared with 200,000 profiles from
convicted offenders and crime scene evidence submitted by police
around the country.

   A Presidential Visit To the Teamsters
</P>
<P>
   For decades, U.S. presidents have shied away from meeting with
leaders of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters because of
that union's malodorous past. But President Clinton cast such
caution aside by attending a dinner honoring James P. Hoffa, the
union's new president and the son of its most famous leader. Union
officials say Clinton spoke at the dinner in the hope of persuading
the teamsters to endorse Vice President Al Gore. White House
officials say the president appeared at the dinner because the
teamsters union is such a large, important organization. These
officials also noted that thanks to a 10-year federal cleanup, the
union is far less corrupt than it used to be. _ By STEVEN

   Interest Rates Hold  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is in a tough spot.
Traditional economic models say the economy is so strong that there
is a danger of inflation, but in the real world inflation is almost
non-existent. So Greenspan held interest rates steady, but hedged
his bets by hinting that the Fed could push rates up as soon as
next month. Even the hint was enough to give Wall Street a case of
the jitters.

   A Blueprint for East Timor
</P>
<P>
   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid out his
blueprint for the new nation of East Timor _ Timor Loro S'ai in
Tetum, the local language. The two-to-three year project promises
to be the biggest operation the United Nations has had to mount
since rebuilding Cambodia in 1992 and 1993. With a U.N.
peacekeeping force assuming responsibility for defense, the
organization will be expected to take over East Timor's gutted
towns and depopulated civil administration and organize everything
from garbage collection to a new legal system. Putting the troops
in place could take a few months, but Annan made it plain that
civilian administrators should move into the dangerous political
vacuum much sooner. The Security Council is likely to give the
go-ahead in the next week or two.

   India's Hindu Party Gains A Solid Victory
</P>
<P>
   When election returns were counted in India, the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged in a commanding
position, able to lead a centrist coalition of 24 parties that
offered hope that India would now have a durable government, rather
than the shaky one that the party had been leading. The big loser
was the once-dominant Congress Party, which had hoped to return to

   3 Indicted in Money Case  &QL;

   A federal grand jury indicted three key figures in the
investigation of about $7 billion in suspect funds that moved

Russian emigres named _ former Bank of New York executive Lucy
Edwards; her husband, Peter Berlin, and a business associate,
Aleksey Volkov _ are charged with running an illegal wire transfer
business, but investigators indicated last week that further
indictments are on the way. The investigation is examining whether
the enormous money transfers involved money laundering, the process
of washing ``dirty'' money through a series of bank accounts until
it looks ``clean.'' Investigators say that is hard to prove and
federal investigators still haven't uncovered proof of it at the
Bank of New York.

development money this year but none for procurement until it pass

   Return of the Iron Lady
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Conservatives, smarting from their loss to Labor two
years ago, have been in need of steeling. So they sent for the Iron
Lady. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher went to their annual
party conference in Blackpool and moved effortlessly to the center
stage she had occupied until being ousted from office by Tory
rivals in 1990. She may have been too outspoken for the
Conservatives then, but not now. Modern-day Tories want to hear
about British pride and the dangers of encroaching Continentals,
and Baroness Thatcher obliged. ``We are quite the best country in
Europe,'' she said. ``In my lifetime, all the problems have come
from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the
English-speaking nations across the world.''

   Nixon Speaks. Again.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon's use of anti-Semitic remarks are
fairly well known because of the use of his secret taping system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when a new batch of those tapes was released by the
National Archives, it was jarring to hear him telling aides that
every member of the communist conspiracy was Jewish except for
Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss, and he harbored the suspicion
that Hiss might have been half Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Hiss' son, Tony, when told of Nixon's notion, said:
``Unfortunately, it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not over. The National Archives is to release more X-rated
Nixon tapes in the next two years.

   A Step Back For Genetic Engineering
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto Co., the biggest name in agricultural biotechnology,
pledged not to market a controversial product that does not yet
exist: seed genetically altered to produce infertile crops. Such
seed would put a stop to farmers saving seed from their harvest for
replanting the next year, giving biotech companies a better shot at
selling them new seed annually. Monsanto does not currently control
the rights to the technology and some scientists say it will never
work outside of the laboratory, but it has already become so
infamous that Monsanto decided to repudiate it. Biotechnology
critics, referring to it as ``Terminator genes'' or ``suicide
seeds,'' have been using it as a potent symbol for everything they
oppose in agribusiness.

   Train Crash in Britain
</P>
<P>
   Britain's worst train wreck in decades provoked soul-searching
about safety measures on the national railroad system since it was
sold to private investors three years ago. The debate raised the
question of whether national assets like the railroads should be
shielded from raw market forces and run by the state. The police
said more than 70 people were believed to have died in the crash
between two trains in West London on Tuesday, and scores more were
unaccounted for. _ By ALAN COWELL

go-ahead in the next week or two.

   India's Hindu Party Gains A Solid Victory
</P>
<P>
   When election returns were counted in India, the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged in a commanding
position, able to lead a centrist coalition of 24 parties that
offered hope that India would now have a durable government, rather
than the shaky one that the party had been leading. The big loser
was the once-dominant Congress Party, which had hoped to return to
power but suffered a humiliating defeat instead.

   3 Indicted in Money Case  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted three key figures in the
investigation of about $7 billion in suspect funds that moved
through the Bank of New York over the last three years. The three
Russian emigres named _ former Bank of New York executive Lucy
Edwards; her husband, Peter Berlin, and a business associate,
Aleksey Volkov _ are charged with running an illegal wire transfer
business, but investigators indicated last week that further
indictments are on the way. The investigation is examining whether
the enormous money transfers involved money laundering, the process
of washing ``dirty'' money through a series of bank accounts until
it looks ``clean.'' Investigators say that is hard to prove and
federal investigators still haven't uncovered proof of it at the
Bank of New York.

   Congress will allow the Air Force's $70 billion F-22 fighter jet
to proceed to the assembly line, but only if it can pass stringent

F-22, projected to be the most expensive fighter jet ever built at
$200 million a plane, will receive $2.5 billion in research and
development money this year but none for procurement until it pass
a series of hurdles and milestones.

   Return of the Iron Lady
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Conservatives, smarting from their loss to Labor two
years ago, have been in need of steeling. So they sent for the Iron
Lady. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher went to their annual
party conference in Blackpool and moved effortlessly to the center
stage she had occupied until being ousted from office by Tory
rivals in 1990. She may have been too outspoken for the
Conservatives then, but not now. Modern-day Tories want to hear
about British pride and the dangers of encroaching Continentals,
and Baroness Thatcher obliged. ``We are quite the best country in
Europe,'' she said. ``In my lifetime, all the problems have come
from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the
English-speaking nations across the world.''

   Nixon Speaks. Again.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon's use of anti-Semitic remarks are
fairly well known because of the use of his secret taping system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when a new batch of those tapes was released by the
National Archives, it was jarring to hear him telling aides that
every member of the communist conspiracy was Jewish except for
Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss, and he harbored the suspicion
that Hiss might have been half Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Hiss' son, Tony, when told of Nixon's notion, said:
``Unfortunately, it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not over. The National Archives is to release more X-rated
Nixon tapes in the next two years.

   A Step Back For Genetic Engineering
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto Co., the biggest name in agricultural biotechnology,
pledged not to market a controversial product that does not yet
exist: seed genetically altered to produce infertile crops. Such
seed would put a stop to farmers saving seed from their harvest for
replanting the next year, giving biotech companies a better shot at
selling them new seed annually. Monsanto does not currently control
the rights to the technology and some scientists say it will never
work outside of the laboratory, but it has already become so
infamous that Monsanto decided to repudiate it. Biotechnology
critics, referring to it as ``Terminator genes'' or ``suicide
seeds,'' have been using it as a potent symbol for everything they
oppose in agribusiness.

   Train Crash in Britain
</P>
<P>
   Britain's worst train wreck in decades provoked soul-searching
about safety measures on the national railroad system since it was
sold to private investors three years ago. The debate raised the
question of whether national assets like the railroads should be
shielded from raw market forces and run by the state. The police
said more than 70 people were believed to have died in the crash
between two trains in West London on Tuesday, and scores more were
unaccounted for. _ By ALAN COWELL

</P>
<P>
   The PBS broadcast last month of An American Love Story--a
10-hour film about an interracial family--spawned a great deal of
chatter to the effect that mixed-race couplings were the wave of
the future. In fact, they are the wave of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Interracial marriages accounted for only 2.2 percent of all
marriages in the Current Population Survey of 1992, a gain of only
two-tenths of a percent over 1980, and the number of mixed
couplings actually decreased slightly in 1991. The census pattern
suggests that slightly more interracial couples will fall into each
other's arms in the coming years but that there will be nothing
resembling a dramatic acceleration of marriage across the color
line.
</P>
<P>
   But America already has almost 400 years of race mixing behind
it, beginning with that first slave ship that sailed into Jamestown
harbor carrying slaves who were already pregnant by members of the
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have grudgingly accepted the fact that sex between
masters and slaves such as Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings was
frequent, leading to a many-hued race of people who do not look
African at all, even though they call themselves
``African-American.'' Outside of recent African immigrants to the
United States, there are virtually no black Americans of purely
African descent, which is to say no black people who lack white
ancestry, left in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries of race mixing have had a similar impact on
Americans who define themselves as white. Convincing estimates show
that by 1950 about one in five white Americans had some African
ancestry. This inheritance most often arrived at the bedroom door
in the form of a fair-skinned black person who had slipped over the
color line to live as white. Put another way, most Americans with
African blood in their veins think of themselves as white and
conduct themselves as such--and check ``white'' when they fill out
census forms.
</P>
<P>
   How did so much ``black'' blood get into so many ``white''
people? Consider the story behind the 1967 case of Loving vs.
Virginia, in which the Supreme Court overturned laws in 17 states
that forbade black people and white people to marry. Richard Loving
was white and Mildred Jeter was black. In 1958, weeks after the two
were married, the Caroline County sheriff dragged them from their
marriage bed and jailed them for the crime of being married. The
Lovings were then exiled from Virginia under pain of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   In banishing the couple from the Old Dominion, the Caroline
County judge said from the bench: ``Almighty God created the races,
white, black, yellow, Malay, and red and placed them on separate
continents, and but for the interference with his arrangement there
would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated
the races shows that he did not intend the races to mix.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement would have been ludicrous anyplace but was
especially laughable in Caroline County--and in the Lovings'
hometown of Central Point, which had been an epicenter of race
mixing for at least 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   There were many such centers in the South. In cities such as
Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans, for example, white families and
their fair-skinned black relatives lived so close together that
they bumped into each other on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed-race people were initially treated as a ``new people'' who
existed in the space between white and black and deserved a status
not quite as high as whites but higher than that of black people in
general. This special status began to dry up just before the Civil
War and evaporated when slavery ended and free blacks competed with
whites for jobs and political power. White Southerners became
obsessed with drawing an impossible line that would preserve white
``racial purity''--another way of referring to white political
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The ``one-drop rule'' defined as black anyone who had any black
ancestry at all, even if that ancestry was invisible to the naked
eye or in the genealogical record. Those who fell on the black side
of the law often lost the rights to vote, to hold high-status jobs,
and to defend their persons and property in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The revocation of special mulatto rights accelerated the
practice of passing for white. Central Point was locally known as
the ``passing capital of the world.'' Passing for white was so
common there that a section of Central Point had actually been
named ``Passing.'' Some Central Pointers lived as Negroes at home
but crossed the line to seize white privileges just an hour or two
away in Richmond, Va. Local children were often taken for white
during excursions to nearby towns, where they shopped in stores
that did not serve blacks and were admitted to the ``white only''
sections of movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned the rewards of whiteness early, these children
grew up, moved away, and continued the charade. Those who entered
the armed forces, which were segregated until 1948, were often
classified as white and attached to all-white units. This made for
dicey moments when brown-skinned classmates from Central Point
turned up in all-black units. Some of these former classmates kept
the secret, but a few exposed the passers as frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Britain nor France had laws that forbade interracial
marriage, and people in those countries had no clue what the Yanks
were going on about when they argued over who was really white or
really black. To the French and the British, race was defined by
what you looked like: If you looked white, well then, you were.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Caroline County, soldiers who were passing were sure to
travel home alone to prevent their white buddies from knowing who
and what they were. The passers from Passing married white spouses,
moved into white jobs, took up residence in white neighborhoods.
When the couples returned to Central Point to visit, the town went
along with the masquerade. Families ditched brown-skinned friends
and relatives, and children stayed out of school to avoid being
seen on the colored bus headed to the colored school. Principals
and teachers stuck to the script.
</P>
<P>
   One of them told Ebony magazine in 1967 that blacks in Central
Point had ``infiltrated the white race more than any other group of
Negroes. When a student plays hooky from school for a week and says
an in-law is visiting the family, we understand. The kids just
can't afford to catch the Negro school bus without giving away the
racial identity.''
</P>
<P>
   This infiltration was common not just in Virginia but all over
the United States. The most interesting document listed in the
amicus briefs for Loving vs. Virginia is a statistical study called
``African Ancestry of the White American Population'' by Robert
Stuckert, a sociologist and anthropologist from Ohio State
University. Stuckert's statistical models are tough going, but
eye-opening for what they show. Simply put, he examined census and
fertility data to arrive at estimates of how many white Americans
had African blood lines and how many fair-skinned blacks had
crossed over the line to live as white.
</P>
<P>
   Stuckert's tables show that during the 1940s alone, roughly
15,550 fair-skinned blacks per year slipped across the color
line--about 155,500 for the decade. Stuckert estimates that by 1950
about 21 percent of the whites--or about 28 million of the 135
million persons classified as ``white'' in the census--had black
ancestry within the last four generations. He predicted that the
proportion would only grow in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that one's ancestors are ``racially uniform'' is a
basic American fiction, Stuckert wrote, but a fiction nonetheless.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Communism may have died 10 years ago in
Eastern Europe, but it lives on, after a fashion, in Yugoslavia _
both in patterns of power and habits of mind. The failure of
political and social transformation helps explain why efforts to
oust President Slobodan Milosevic are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   While ``reform communists'' are back running Poland, for
example, they are a younger generation, humbled and educated by
periods out of power, during which more liberal reformers bungled
government in their own peculiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the republics of the former Yugoslavia, with the
exception of Montenegro and Slovenia, the same leaders continue to
rule as did 10 years ago in the name of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Montenegro, which is Serbia's last sister republic in
Yugoslavia, the Western-backed leader, Milo Djukanovic, runs his
tiny republic (population 650,000) with all the old habits of
cronyism and patronage. Slovenia is the only former Yugoslav
republic that might be considered democratic.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason for this durability of the old leaders and
their style of rule was the nature of Titoism _ a softer brand of
Communism that rejected Stalinism and the higher authority of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Standing proudly, even contemptuously, outside the Soviet bloc,
with a better living standard, a freer press and easy access to the
Western world for ordinary citizens, the old Yugoslavia became a
model for Soviet reformers like Mikhail Gorbachev. And Belgrade was
also insulated from the crisis of Soviet-bloc communism that led to
its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of Yugoslav communism, with its commitment to
private agriculture and some private business and employment in
service industries, allowed the system to bend rather than snap. In
Yugoslavia, there was less repression aimed at ordinary citizens
and more freedom of expression, especially after Tito died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A higher standard of living meant that the state and its
companies could afford to provide decent social benefits for longer
_ benefits, like good pensions and free education, that people
still fear losing now, even when Belgrade no longer has the money
to pay them on time, and they have become virtual, rather than
real.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the state and its instruments of repression were
used more thoroughly to keep the multi-ethnic Yugoslavia together
and to tamp down national expression _ especially resentment felt
by Serbs at the economic and political sacrifices they were called
on to make for the idea of a federal state.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change swept through Yugoslavia after Tito's death,
but it took the form of national and ethnic ``liberation'' and
conflict rather than political and economic transformation, said
Ivo Viskovic, a political science professor at Belgrade University.
</P>
<P>
   New freedoms of expression were used for nationalist ends, even
by the Serbian intellectual elite. By 1987, the Serbian Academy of
Science had published an infamous memorandum complaining of Serbian
humiliation and mistreatment in Yugoslavia _ a harbinger of
Milosevic's own manipulation of nationalist passions, on which he
built his power.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has been different from the rest of Eastern Europe
for a long time, Viskovic said. ``People didn't suffer so much as
in other countries, and the standard of living was pretty high. So
people didn't feel such a need for a dramatic change of the
system.'' The Serbs, Bosnians, Croats and Slovenes ``tried to free
themselves from the others, instead of from the system of economics
and power,'' he said. ``Led by their political and intellectual
elites, people chose to go to war instead of changing the system.''
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic renamed the party, he has never recanted or
disowned any part of the ideology. Yet he is an authoritarian
coalition-maker, not a dictator, and this is a multiparty state
with the possibility of change through elections.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given the basic tenets of communism as it was
practiced _ social ownership of the means of production and a
single-party state _ the Yugoslav version doesn't really qualify,
says Ljiljana Smajlovic, an independent journalist originally from
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Smajlovic said, ``this place is more like the old
Yugoslavia than any of the other broken states.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cling to what is left, a little frozen in time.'' she
said. ``They still put their confidence in the army and the
education system. They no longer have salaries, but 40 percent of
people are afraid of privatization. They hold to the notion of
socialized medicine and of job security when there is none. They
have lost the reality of social security but they are convinced
they are clinging on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental habits persist in part because of Western-imposed
isolation, and in part because many of Serbia's best, youngest and
brightest _ up to 350,000 people _ have emigrated in the last 10
years. In many ways, the West's quarantine of Milosevic has only
strengthened the curtain of ignorance behind which, like some odd
Wizard of Oz, he continues to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Now people are so poor and desperate here that they have lost
the sense that change is possible, Viskovic said. ``It's much
riskier to be for change now than 10 years ago,'' he said. ``To
lose your job now is a life tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the case of a student who took his doctorate and
taught as a professor in a Smederevo high school, then was fired
six years ago for criticizing the local authorities and has nowhere
to turn for redress. ``People simply feel that if they are in
conflict with the regime they will lose,'' Viskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears, explicit in polling data, have reduced people's
willingness to demonstrate. The regime has fostered such fears,
with cameras filming rallies, sudden investigations by the
financial police and ordinary police visiting homes to check
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a large recent poll of Serbian attitudes, nearly two-thirds
of respondents were unhappy with the regime. But some 70 percent
were afraid to participate in demonstrations compared to only 40
percent in 1996, when Belgrade saw 88 days of pro-democracy
protests. Today, 90 percent fear a decline in living standards, and
nearly as many fear new inflation and the loss of jobs. Some 80
percent fear civil war and 70 percent hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's larger problem of authoritarianism is reflected
throughout the former Yugoslavia, except for Slovenia, Viskovic
said. ``This is not just an inheritance of communism or Titoism but
of our history.'' Except for some 10 years in Serbia before World
War I, he noted, there has been no experience of democracy in the
Balkans in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is not a new leader,'' he said, but a new
generation and a more modern political ideology, where politicians
solve problems through pragmatism and cooperation and not simply
fealty and force.

<P>
   Such fears, explicit in polling data, have reduced people's
willingness to demonstrate. The regime has fostered such fears,
with cameras filming rallies, sudden investigations by the
financial police and ordinary police visiting homes to check
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a large recent poll of Serbian attitudes, nearly two-thirds
of respondents were unhappy with the regime. But some 70 percent
were afraid to participate in demonstrations compared to only 40
percent in 1996, when Belgrade saw 88 days of pro-democracy
protests. Today, 90 percent fear a decline in living standards, and
nearly as many fear new inflation and the loss of jobs. Some 80
percent fear civil war and 70 percent hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's larger problem of authoritarianism is reflected
throughout the former Yugoslavia, except for Slovenia, Viskovic
said. ``This is not just an inheritance of communism or Titoism but
of our history.'' Except for some 10 years in Serbia before World
War I, he noted, there has been no experience of democracy in the
Balkans in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is not a new leader,'' he said, but a new
generation and a more modern political ideology, where politicians
solve problems through pragmatism and cooperation and not simply
fealty and force.

   WASHINGTON _ From inside the White House, Bill Clinton's chances
of carving out a place in history as a master of foreign policy
don't look so bad. The White House, in fact, has a wish list of
fairly spectacular goals, and at least some of them seem
tantalizingly reachable.
</P>
<P>
   A lasting Middle East peace deal that ends the hostilities
between Israel and the Palestinians and Syrians? A better
understanding with China? An opening to Iran? Restoring U.S.
prestige at the United Nations by paying Washington's overdue
bills?
</P>
<P>
   Well, wait a minute. Clinton may want to do all this, but this
is the same president who was forced last week to back down on
perhaps the longest of his long-vision goals: ratification of the
nuclear test-ban treaty. Faced with a Republican phalanx of nays in
the Senate, Clinton buckled; he said he was ready to see a vote put
off for a year or more. That sounded a lot like what the Republican
leadership had in mind: to allow ratification _ if it is allowed at
all _ only on a new president's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The incident speaks volumes about the political atmosphere in
which Clinton will have to operate as he tries to burnish his
legacy in his final 15 months in office.
</P>
<P>
   When presidents enter office, the record shows, they usually
find that a foreign policy masterstroke is the easiest way to
establish their stature as the nation's leader. But as presidents
enter their last year they often find themselves more
circumscribed; election year politics, a weary bureaucracy and, in
Clinton's case, an ever more hostile Congress, are closing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain irony that as an administration nears its
end, foreign policy becomes much more difficult because of the
political context,'` said diplomat Winston Lord, who has served in
both Republican and Democratic administrations. ``Either the
president wants to get re-elected or his party wants to get
re-elected and in the Congress you've got partisan juices flowing
as well. That means the White House, the press, the national
political committees, whether Republican or Democratic, view
everything through the political prism.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is more irony in Clinton's case, because this
president came to office with nary a thought to foreign-policy
initiatives. Then he lost control of Congress, and has spent most
of the time since mired in one partisan battle after another.
</P>
<P>
   He has, of course, had accomplishments, among them placing his
signature on the test ban treaty back in 1996. But now, instead of
being able to build on them, Clinton finds himself again ambushed
by domestic politics. The president's supporters were left
lamenting that Clinton had failed to press Congress for
ratification much earlier, because he feared a confrontation with
the Senate's Republicans over the Democratic domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not all presidents, faced with a hostile Congress, have suffered
on foreign policy like Clinton. President Harry S. Truman launched
the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine in the first years of his
administration, when Republicans controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a major difference between then and now, said
James Chace, a biographer of Dean Acheson, who was one of Truman's
secretaries of state. ``Unlike in Truman's time, there is no
overwhelming threat and Congress can afford to deny Clinton
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``History,'' he added, ``judges by results, and the results
under Clinton show that no overall architecture has emerged. There
are no building blocks like the Marshall Plan or the establishment
of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   So the wish list remains long. Here, according to Clinton
administration policy- makers, is the rough condition of the
wishes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A comprehensive Middle East peace settlement would be prize
No. 1. But Syrian President Hafez Assad so far has turned away the
administration's inducements, while Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have agreed to try for a
framework by February that outlines the final agreement to be
achieved by September. Clinton is on the phone two or three times a
week with Arafat and/or Barak, trying to build trust between the
pair, White House aides say. But even if a deal is completed,
Clinton will be under pressure to be modest about his role in it,
because Barak has made a point of insisting that he and Arafat are
in charge _ and not the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making China a `strategic partner' was a major objective. But
now the administration is struggling to restore relations to where
they were a year ago; allegations of Chinese nuclear spying aren't
helping, nor are China's internal political rivalries.
Administration officials acknowledge that Clinton lost an
opportunity last April when he refused to bend in talks with China
about terms for its entry to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, has taken on the job of lobbying Congress in a last
ditch effort to get U.S. arrears to the United Nations paid. But
meanwhile, U.S. standing at the United Nations has become so dicey
that Washington had to lobby tiny New Zealand to give up its
candidacy on the budget committee so that the United States could
seek the role unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a near-perfect world, Clinton is said to very much desire a
rapprochement with Iran and Cuba. But Iran is still not ready,
administration officials say. And competition for the votes of
Cuban immigrants in Florida in the 2000 election make a gesture
toward Fidel Castro all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the column marked accomplishments, Kosovo looms large. But
while the war Clinton led last spring took Kosovo out of the
clutches of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, many of those
who favored the intervention remain angry that Milosevic remains in
power.

<P>
   HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress is rediscovering the
health care crisis _ which did not go away with the 1994 collapse
of the Clinton administration's effort at a comprehensive overhaul.
What often got lost in the partisan maneuvering and millions of
dollars of lobbying is now unmistakably clear: There was an
objective reality out there. This was not just a political
exercise. President Clinton all but snapped an `I told you so' last
week. `What has happened is exactly what we said would happen,' he
said. By Robin Toner. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-SEX-REVIEW (Alexandria, Va.) _ After GOP presidential
aspirant Gary Bauer was criticized for holding private meetings
with a female aide, other politicians and their consultants called
the incident unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals
and at least potentially penalized female aides, particularly in
the wake of the Lewinsky scandal. Bauer and other politicians are
wondering how to preserve their reputations without putting female
aides at a disadvantage in terms of legitimate yet confidential
conferences. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SHOPPING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As electronic commerce
moves into the mainstream, it has prompted a new appreciation for
old-fashioned business skills. Customers, it seems, still have
decidedly offline standards of service. They demand timely delivery
of goods and the ability to easily return merchandise that proves
disappointing, for example. The online retailers who come up short
on those fronts will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin
during this Christmas shopping season. By Steve Lohr. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HOMERUNS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Home runs have become a dime a
dozen. Like 100-point swings in the stock market, they don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in an unparalleled flurry
of four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseam on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity. Yet somehow fans still delight in
each individual long ball as it happens. By Alan Schwarz. (also
moving in `s' category as BBO-HOMERUNS-REVIEW). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-WORRIES-REVIEW (New York) _ The region is in the midst
of outbreaks of E. coli bacteria and West Nile flu, and it is the
latter that most people are more concerned about. West Nile is
exotic to this area, and thus provokes fear and a sense that the
ecosystem is out of balance. E. coli is generally perceived to be
the result of human error _ undercooked meat or negligence with the
water supply _ and thus preventable. What is forgotten is that E.
Coli has killed far more people, including children. By Jennifer
Steinhauer.

<P>
   AUSTRIA-NAZIS-REVIEW (Vienna) _ A look at why fears of a revival
of Nazism in Austria are exaggerated. Austria is sometimes
criticized for failing to deal with its Nazi past, while Germany
has constantly apologized. Yet Austria doesn't have gangs attacking
Jewish cemeteries as Germany does. In Austria, non-Nazi
right-wingers and mainstream conservatives have both been offended
by cries that Jorg Haider is a neo-Nazi. By Donald G. McNeill.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-COMMUNISTS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ In a way, communism still
lives in the former Yugoslavia _ both in patterns of power and
habits of mind. This failure of political and social transformation
helps explain why efforts to overthrow President Slobodan Milosevic
are faltering. While `reform Communists' are back running Poland,
for example, they are a younger generation, humbled and educated by
periods out of power. But in most former Yugoslav republics, the
same leaders still rule as they did 10 years ago in the name of the
Communist Party. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ With the Colombian
government facing its most serious crisis in years, the Clinton
administration is scrambling to assemble a package of military and
economic assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the
hemisphere since the Cold War. But administration officials are
struggling to reassure anyone who will listen that Colombia today
looks nothing like El Salvador once did. By Tim Golden.

A BLEAK HOUR FOR SOUTH AFRICA MINERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ For days, the miners listened to
the crackle of good news from their battered radios and prayed that
the soaring price of gold would save them. But the banner headlines
that have thrilled government officials, economists and mining
executives were not enough to stop the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 2,895 miners lost their jobs at the Western Areas
gold mine, which in recent months has suffered from poor
productivity and slumping prices. And last week, even though gold
prices surged to their highest levels in nearly two years, the men
who built a living burrowing underground found themselves
unemployed and out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped the gold price would minimize layoffs, but it
didn't,'' said Welcome Mzunjani, 31, who supported a wife and two
daughters on his $230 monthly paycheck. ``Now I will have to battle
to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   These are heady days for South Africa, the world's leading
producer of gold. The metal dipped to a 20-year low of $255.75 an
ounce in early July but is flying again. On Friday the price closed
at $323 an ounce in London.
</P>
<P>
   If it holds at this level, economists say, annual export
earnings will increase by about $762 million to $5.1 billion, which
would provide a desperately needed lift for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even optimists acknowledge that the gains will not stop the
labor force from shrinking. Since 1989, the number of gold miners
has dropped to about 180,000 from about 514,000. A strong gold
price will slow the pace of decline, economists say, but layoffs
will probably continue as mines become more efficient, ore deposits
are depleted and the country continues to reduce its reliance on
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big boost to the economy, but it doesn't mean that
retrenchments are going to cease,'' said Roger Baxter, chief
economist for the Chamber of Mines. ``You're still going to have
retrenchments, but the rate of decline in employment numbers will
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Manuel, the finance minister, also cautioned against
over-optimism, telling local reporters that while higher prices
would save some jobs, ``there will always be difficulties,
especially given the fact that a number of mines are as marginal as
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month the East Rand Proprietary Mine, the country's oldest
operating mine, closed down, leaving 5,000 workers jobless. Another
4,000 miners have lost their jobs since July, when the gold price
plummeted and several other companies laid off workers, union
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to halt the layoffs at Western Areas, the National Union
of Mineworkers went to court, seeking an injunction. But on Tuesday
the judge ruled in favor of the mining company, which is jointly
owned by Western Areas Ltd. and the Canadian-based Placer Dome. The
company argued successfully that it could not keep the workers,
because it had lost about $4.5 million in the quarter that ended in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week, even two weeks is too soon to be able to say this is a
stable, sustainable price,'' said Patrick Evans, a spokesman for
Placer Dome, of the current gold price. ``We had to bring the
business back onto a profitable footing.''
</P>
<P>
   The company allocated $2 million to help jobless men find work
in their villages in Swaziland, Lesotho and South Africa, and hoped
that 70 percent would be self-sufficient in two years, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   But union officials complained that the company cares more about
its bottom line than the livelihood of its workers. Referring to
the Canadian owners, George Molebatsi, a spokesman for the National
Union of Mineworkers, said: ``They came to make money in this
country. That's the bottom line. The issue of job creation doesn't
mean anything to them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The laborers are typically men in their 30s and 40s with little
education, few skills and little hope of finding work in a country
where unemployment has reached nearly 40 percent. At Western Areas,
the average miner has spent about 10 years digging for gold.
</P>
<P>
   Now they sit restlessly outside their concrete-block hostels,
waiting for their final medical exams and severance pay and
watching enviously as the 5,000 remaining employees put on hard
hats and overalls, rubber slickers and rubber boots, and descend
into the deep.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Shongwe, 35, said he might try planting corn in Swaziland,
his country. Simon Gumedze, 24, said he would take up computers, if
he could find the money to pay for a course. Palita Tyobsile, 34,
said he would take a job, any job.
</P>
<P>
   But all three said they expected to struggle for months without
work. Gumedze said it took him a year and a half to get the job at
Western Areas; for months he waited hours every day at the mine's
hiring depot, until they finally called his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would have 10 years working here,'' said Gumedze,
a father of two who has spent two and a half years at Western
Areas. ``But my chances to be in the mine is past. Now I'm thinking
about my future, how I will support my family, how we will
survive.''

PARENTS SEEK BAN OF BOOK FROM SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CECILIA CHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A best-selling children's book about a boy wizard
learning magic at a school called Hogswarts is not only rousing the
imagination of young readers but anger from some parents who want
the book banned from classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' the third in the
popular series, debuted last month to rave reviews and eager
anticipation from fans, who mobbed the Internet for the book before
it hit the U.S. market. In the latest work by British author J.K.
Rowling, a mass murderer is thought to be heading for Hogswart _ a
plot that some local parents think is too dark for youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the material to be offensive and didn't want my son,
as a young fourth-grader, listening to that material,'' said
Cynthia Kersey, whose son, Andy, attends Simi Elementary School.
``There are much better literary choices to be read to children,
such as classics. Just because something is popular doesn't mean
it's edifying for children's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   School district officials say that aside from volumes on the
required reading list, it's pretty much up to the teachers to
decide what is appropriate in their classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers use a variety of supplemental material,'' said Madge
Lamb, director of curriculum and instruction with the Las Virgenes
Unified School District. ``It's their professional judgment if they
want to bring something in and use it in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   District policy, however, does allow for parents to challenge
any of the instructional material, Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   Kersey has instructed Andy's teachers to dismiss him during the
classroom reading time. So while his peers listen to Harry Potter's
latest exploits in battling the forces of darkness led by Lord
Voldemart, Andy is reading ``The Swiss Family Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Kersey's complaint, a committee of parents, teachers
and administrators will convene to read the book and make a
recommendation _ one that could range from ``It's a perfect book to
we don't think it's appropriate for the elementary level or for
school,'' said Becky Wetzel, the school district's director of
elementary education.
</P>
<P>
   She said in her eight years at the district, about five books
have been challenged by parents. A committee over the summer
rendered a decision on a required reading book at the middle
schools, ``The Giver,'' and found that it was more appropriate for
high school because of its sophistication, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The book had garnered a highly coveted children's award and came
recommended for sixth- and seventh- grade reading levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very careful to look at the material so we are not in
that banning-books kind of mode,'' Wetzel said. ``Is this material
appropriate and where is it appropriate. We have a K-12 school
(system) here and somewhere this book may have value to some
students somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the district will make accommodations for students
uncomfortable listening to the Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   Kersey said if the school doesn't ban the book, she will hand
out fliers alerting parents to the content.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Moorpark, where Teresa and Dominic
Schmidt asked that their son, Brandon, be removed from his
fourth-grade class at Walnut Canyon Elementary School because the
teacher was reading Harry Potter. Because classes at his original
school were full, he transferred to Flory Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible book,'' said Teresa Schmidt, who read the
first installment, ``Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It talked about death and killing. It talks about drinking
animal blood. That is witchcraft and as a religion it doesn't
belong in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who monitors what Brandon watches on television, said
the book teaches rebellion and alludes to drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids don't eat a wholesome dinner are you going to let them
have candy?'' asked Schmidt. ``This is basically the candy they are
giving them _ garbage in, garbage out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think entertainment should be during class time,'' she
said. ``If parents buy the book and read out of class time, that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she expects the fourth Harry Potter book to be even
worse because the author has said she will kill off one of the
beloved characters in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said she is working to get schools to have a ``censored
book list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers can read whatever they want without any boundary,''
she said. ``They have to go by some sort of curriculum. They can't
pick a book off the wall because it's popular. Popular is not
always the best.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time a book has generated such uproar in
Moorpark. In 1992, a member of the NAACP unsuccessfully asked the
Moorpark Unified School District to ban ``The Cay'' from classroom
reading lists, saying it promoted racial stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   Parents from around the country such as Georgia, New York and
Minnesota have complained to school librarians that the Harry
Potter books dealt with witchcraft, said Beverly Becker, associate
director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom with the American
Library Association in Chicago. The association publishes a
newsletter every other month highlighting attempted censorship of
reading material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that it's a parent's right if they don't want
their children to read that book,'' Becker said. ``But other
children and other parents have the right to have access to the
book and use the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope (teachers) give an alternative selection if it's
a required reading book,'' she said. ``We believe in access to all
sorts of information and diversity of opinions.''

THE BUSH TRIANGULATION STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When House Republicans recently tried to postpone a fiscal
squeeze by deferring payment of the Earned Income Tax Credit to
low-income workers, their presidential front-runner, George W.
Bush, shot them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs
of the poor,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, speaking in New York about education reform, Bush
spanked his party again, this time for projecting pessimism,
indifference, and ``disdain for government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's broadsides have filled the talk shows and front pages
with speculation that he is ``triangulating'' against congressional
Republicans, just as Bill Clinton ``triangulated'' against
left-wing rap artist Sister Souljah in 1992 and against
congressional liberals in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the media's one-dimensional understanding of
triangulation--that Bush is trying to ``distance himself from the
GOP's right wing'' and ``stake out the middle ground'' between two
extremes--oversimplifies the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't positioning himself on a straight line between
Clinton and the congressional GOP. He isn't even taking up a third
position on their two-dimensional battlefield. He is venturing into
a third dimension, rejecting the whole Washington debate, and
defining his contest with Al Gore along a new axis.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to render Gore's three-point campaign message
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   --POINT ONE: THE COUNTRY IS DOING WELL. Clinton and Gore
constantly recite statistics that reflect well on their
administration: more jobs, lower deficits, lower interest rates,
fewer people on welfare, less crime. They credit their own
policies, particularly the 1993 tax hike, for achieving these
results by establishing fiscal responsibility. For years,
congressional Republicans predicted that Clinton's plan would ruin
the economy. Then they defied credulity by reversing their message,
claiming that the economy was in great shape and that their own
policies were responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest obstacle facing Bush: He is challenging the
incumbent vice president in a time of peace and prosperity, and the
congressional GOP has not made a persuasive case either that the
prosperity is false or that it is true because of Republican
efforts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore have spent seven years telling Americans the
story of how their administration revived the economy. Whether or
not this story is true, it is now deeply ingrained in the public
consciousness, and Bush can't look to his party in Washington for
an effective rebuttal to it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush is attempting something far more bold and
interesting: He is weaving an alternative story. While focusing on
Bush's criticisms of his party in his speech Tuesday, the media
overlooked the more important passage that preceded them. He said:
</P>
<P>
   ``In state after state, we are seeing a profound shift of
[educational] priorities. An `age of accountability' is starting to
replace an era of low expectations. ... The principles of this
movement are similar from New York to Florida, from Massachusetts
to Michigan. ... At the beginning of the 1990s, so many of our
nation's problems, from education to crime to welfare, seemed
intractable. ... But something unexpected happened on the way to
cultural decline. Problems that seemed inevitable proved to be
reversible. They gave way to an optimistic, governing conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in New York, Mayor Giuliani brought order and civility
back to the streets--cutting crime rates by 50 percent. In
Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy Thompson proved that welfare dependence could
be reversed--reducing his rolls by 91 percent. Innovative mayors
and governors followed their lead--cutting national welfare rolls
by nearly half since 1994 and reducing the murder rate to the
lowest point since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now education reform is gaining a critical mass of results. In
the process, conservatism has become the creed of hope. The creed
of aggressive, persistent reform. The creed of social progress.''
</P>
<P>
   What's important about this narrative is not what it says but
what it doesn't say. It makes no mention of anything that happened
in the White House or in Congress. Bush has decided that he can't
win the federal policy debate that has consumed Clinton, Gore, Newt
Gingrich, and the national media for seven years. So he has simply
erased it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, crime is down, fewer people are on welfare, and school
reform is gaining momentum. And yes, the incumbent party deserves
credit. But in Bush's story, that party isn't the Democratic White
House. It's the state and local GOP.
</P>
<P>
   --POINT TWO: CONGRESS IS PETTY AND MEAN. Republican
congressional leaders--Gingrich, House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay--have spent their tenure in the
majority denouncing government, bickering with Clinton and the
Democrats, impugning their integrity, and blaming them for every
problem. They have convinced many people that Clinton and Gore are
blameworthy. But they have convinced many others that congressional
Republicans are more interested in impugning integrity and fixing
blame than in solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   The negative portion of Gore's game plan, therefore, is to lump
Bush together with Armey and DeLay as the party of carping and
destructiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's game plan is to turn Gore's game plan on its head. He's
not going to argue with Gore over which party is destructive or
blameworthy. He's going to reject the whole Washington blame
game--undercutting his own party as well as Gore--and portray
himself as a man who solves problems instead of complaining about
them or blaming them on his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, my party has confused the need for limited
government with a disdain for government itself,'' Bush said
Tuesday. ``Our Founders rejected cynicism and cultivated a noble
love of country. That love is undermined by sprawling, arrogant,
aimless government. It is restored by focused and effective and
energetic government. And that should be our goal: a limited
government, respected for doing a few things and doing them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans, including DeLay, have fired back at
Bush, accusing him of betraying them, meddling in their business,
and distorting their ideas. This counterattack has only helped Bush
achieve the distance he sought in the first place. Others,
including Armey, have tried to spin Bush's comments, suggesting
that he's really siding with them against Clinton in the Washington
budget fight. They don't understand that they've lost that fight
and that Bush is willing to repudiate the fight and everyone in
it--including them--in order to ruin Gore's strategy and beat him.
</P>
<P>
   --POINT THREE: THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IS SCARY. Gore, like Clinton,
has often used cultural issues such as abortion to make the GOP
look extreme. The media and ``moderate'' Republicans, convinced
that these issues are the party's weakness and that its libertarian
economic ideas are its strength, have interpreted Bush's remarks as
a rebuke to Republican ``Puritanism.'' But a closer look at Bush's
comments suggests the opposite: He is concerned that the party
looks mean because of its economic policies, and he is using
cultural issues to soften that image by projecting Republican
``compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush had felt a need to triangulate against the cultural
right, he could have joined others in repudiating Pat Buchanan for
questioning the wisdom of American intervention against Nazi
Germany. He didn't. Alternatively, he could have used his address
to the Christian Coalition last Friday to criticize religious
intolerance. Instead, he gave a speech that bypassed traditional
moral issues such as school prayer and homosexuality and never
mentioned the word ``abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The media inferred that Bush was ignoring moral issues because
the religious right has nowhere else to go. They missed the real
story: The reason why Bush doesn't have to talk about old moral
issues that might make him look mean is that he's introducing new
moral issues that make him look warm and caring.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the coalition, Bush used the word
``compassion'' 16 times. He urged Christians to pursue a kinder,
gentler mission: ``What we need are people who live out their faith
in every walk of life, in politics, but also working in crisis
pregnancy centers, drug treatment programs, and homeless shelters.
People who make God's work their own. ... Our compassion must
extend to the poor and to the fatherless. Our compassion must
defend the disabled. ... I will rally the armies of compassion to
nurture, to mentor, to comfort, to perform their commonplace
miracles of renewal. ... I will involve them in after-school
programs, maternity group homes, prison fellowships, and drug
treatment programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush warned, ``Too often, on social issues, my party
has painted an image of America slouching toward Gomorrah. Of
course there are challenges to the character and compassion of our
nation--too many broken homes and broken lives. But many of our
problems--particularly education, crime, and welfare
dependence--are yielding to good sense and strength and idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``Too often, my party has focused on the national
economy, to the exclusion of all else--speaking a sterile language
of rates and numbers, of CBO this and GNP that. Of course we want
growth and vigor in our economy. But there are human problems that
persist in the shadow of affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   On this view, the GOP's problem is libertarian indifference in
Washington, and the solution is to fix ``broken homes and broken
lives'' through ``compassion'' back home.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recognizes Bush's strategy and is trying to drag him back
into the Washington fight. ``He's now differed with [congressional
Republicans] on one little detail,'' Gore said on Face the Nation.
``If he really wants to try to break with them, he ought to endorse
our health-care Patients' Bill of Rights. He ought to endorse an
increase in the minimum wage for the working poor. And he ought to
come out against this huge, risky tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush isn't biting, and congressional Democrats, more
interested in beating their Republican colleagues than in beating
Bush, have welcomed and exploited his indictment of the GOP. Bush
doesn't mind. They can have the battle. He wants the war.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA, Canada _ Canadians on both sides of the nation's deep
linguistic divide say they were stunned by President Clinton's
unexpectedly passionate appeal here for national unity and
federalism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traveled to the flashpoint of separatism in North
America and, without once mentioning Quebec nationalism, argued
Friday that ``the United States and Canada are among the most
fortunate countries in the world because we have such diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   If every major ``racial and ethnic and religious group'' won
independence, ``we might have 800 countries in the world and have a
very difficult time having a functioning economy,'' Clinton said,
addressing a forum on federalism that earlier in the week had
become a platform for complaints by Quebec separatists. ``Maybe we
would have 8,000 _ how low can you go?
</P>
<P>
   ``The great irony of the turning of the millennium is that we
have more modern options for technology and economic advance than
ever before, but our major threat is the most primitive human
failing _ the fear of the other,'' he said at Mont Tremblant, north
of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must think of how we will live after the shooting stops,
after the smoke clears, over the long run,'' the president said.
National independence, he warned, is often ``a questionable
assertion in a global economy where cooperation pays greater
benefits in every area than destructive competition.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. leaders traditionally sidestep the hornet's nest of the
separatist aspirations of many Quebecers, the central political
quandary of Canada for the last three decades. In turn, Canadians
put extraordinary weight on the words of the president of the
United States, the nation that dominates Canada's foreign trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's widely read weekend papers, English and French, viewed
the speech as a strong argument for Quebec's remaining inside
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made ``a powerful argument in favor of federalism, which
he describes as the political regime of the future,'' Vincent
Marissal wrote in La Presse, a Montreal daily that bills itself as
the largest-circulation French newspaper of the Americas. ``But his
message on the merits of federalism went much further, questioning
even the usefulness of the nationalist projects in the era of
globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The English-speaking media were less restrained.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Gazette, one of only two surviving English language
daily newspapers in Quebec, proclaimed, ``U.S. President Bill
Clinton ran up the federalist flag.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Post, a conservative newspaper, hailed Clinton's
``historic speech'' with a banner headline, ``Clinton Takes a Swing
at Separatists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail, Canada's other nationally circulated
newspaper, declared, ``Clinton's speech was the most powerful and
subtle argument in favor of the federal idea heard in Quebec in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec separatists sought to make the best of the speech, noting
that Clinton had praised the European Union, a relationship they
see as a model for future ties between an independent Quebec and
``English Canada.'' Separatists also noted that after the speech
Clinton met with Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, the first such
meeting between a U.S. president and a separatist premier.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not allow photographs, kept the meeting to 15
minutes, and then rushed off to a photo opportunity and golf with
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1995, Quebec voters came within a whisker of
approving a third nation for North America. In a referendum with a
huge turnout, the yes vote for an independent Quebec was 49.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But austerity policies adopted by Bouchard's Parti Quebcois
government seem to have contributed to a fall in separatist
support, currently said in opinion polls to be around 40 percent.
Consequently, Bouchard has been vague about holding what would be a
third referendum on the issue since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of Quebec voters do not want another
referendum, according to a Sondagem poll conducted for Le Devoir, a
separatist daily in Montreal, in early September. This position is
shared by Quebecers opposed to independence and by nationalists who
fear they would lose for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, the Bouchard government was hit with the
resignation of its top secession strategist, Jean-Francois Lisee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a departure that says out loud what everyone in Quebec
City is whispering and doesn't dare say yet,'' Michel C. Auger
wrote in September in Le Journal de Montreal. ``Unless there is a
miracle, there will not be a referendum on sovereignty during the
PQ government's current mandate.''

MEXICAN SEEKS PRESIDENCY, BUT HIS PARTY SEEMS COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox Quesada, a brash-talking presidential
candidate with a bold swagger, thinks he can build the frustration
among Mexican voters into a runaway victory for the opposition next
year.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he can win without his conservative National Action
Party forming a coalition with the other major opposition party,
which leans to the left. Negotiations over a coalition collapsed
the week before last after Fox vetoed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox's campaign for the top job faces a debilitating problem:
He does not have the unqualified support of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need more enthusiasm from the PAN,'' Fox acknowledged in an
interview, using the party's Spanish acronym. ``I need more
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The tepid response from the 60-year-old party, Mexico's oldest
opposition group, has become painfully evident since Fox was
officially nominated as its presidential candidate on Sept. 12
after a nationwide primary. Although Fox was the sole contender,
only 132,976 people voted for him, barely 37 percent of the party's
registered members. He had said he hoped for at least 300,000 votes
in a show of force by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Fox from outside the party, who were able to take
part in the primary by writing his name on informal ballots,
outnumbered the party members voting for him by more than three to
one.
</P>
<P>
   On primary night, when Fox made what he planned as a bracing
acceptance speech to rally his team behind him, he received no
messages of congratulations from the party's best-known leaders.
The head of the party's delegation in the Congress, Carlos Medina
Plascencia, gave a short speech expressing his support and left
before Fox arrived at the election headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make a distinction between the lack of warm support
from the leaders of my party and the support I get from the grass
roots, where people are working with a lot of enthusiasm,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 57, who served until recently as governor of the state of
Guanajuato, began his quest for the presidency two years ago
without seeking any endorsement from his party. He runs his
campaign through a group separate from the party called the Friends
of Fox. He is more liberal and less nationalistic than his
conservative, Catholic party on several key economic and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Fox said, his party has not provided any money for his
campaign. He said he would receive none until after Jan. 15, when
the government will turn over special funds to the party for the
presidential campaigns. In the last six weeks his advertising has
dropped almost completely off television and radio because his
coffers are empty.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Fox will be running in an essentially
three-way race between Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the former
mayor of Mexico City who is the leader of the leftist opposition,
and a candidate from the governing party, who will be chosen in a
primary on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll by the newspaper Reforma showed Fox favored by 32
percent while Cardenas drew only 12 percent. But either one of the
two leading governing party candidates would come out ahead of Fox,
with at least 35 percent, according to the poll.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fox said he had no regrets about withdrawing from the coalition
talks, which reached an impasse over whether to hold a primary to
choose a single opposition candidate between him and Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Cardenas and his followers came from ``a culture of
electoral fraud'' and that he feared they or infiltrators from the
governing party would tamper with the votes in a primary election.

YELTSIN IN HOSPITAL, REPORTEDLY WITH FLU 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHECHNYA-MASKHADOV) 
(mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin of Russia was taken to the
Central Clinical Hospital on Saturday morning suffering from what
his press secretary described as the flu accompanied by a high
fever.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Yakushkin, the Kremlin press secretary, said that
Yeltsin, 68, had not felt well Friday but refused to go into the
hospital until Saturday. Yakushkin said the president would stay in
the hospital for at least two days.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, now less than a year away from finishing his second
four-year term in office, has been repeatedly plagued by poor
health.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he underwent multiple bypass heart surgery, and he has
also suffered from acute back pain, several bouts of pneumonia and,
earlier this year, a bleeding ulcer, for which he was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   These ailments have complicated a fitful work schedule. Yeltsin
has sometimes stayed out of public view for weeks at a time. In
recent weeks, as Russian troops moved into the breakaway region of
Chechnya, Yeltsin has again kept a low profile, although Kremlin
aides have reported that he was holding regular meetings with top
government officials up through the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has not made any public appearances for more than a
week. In the early phase of the 1994-96 Russian war against
Chechnya, Yeltsin also remained out of sight, as he underwent what
Kremlin aides said was an operation on his nose.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Yakushkin suggested that the president might soon be
ready for a vacation. ``Undoubtedly, it is very hard to work in
such a rhythm, taking into account his age and other factors,''
Yakushkin was quoted as saying. On Saturday, Yakushkin said the flu
would not prevent Yeltsin from watching a televised soccer match
Saturday night between Russia and Ukraine, fierce rivals in the
playoffs for the European championship in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With presidential elections scheduled for next June, Yeltsin and
his political advisers have been waging a behind-the scenes
struggle to take control over his succession. Last August, Yeltsin
designated Prime Minister Vladimir Putin _ his fourth prime
minister in the last year and half _ as his preferred heir, and in
the same televised address last August, he said he intended to
become Russia's first leader to hand over power in a democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the Kremlin has denied recurring rumors that
Yeltsin may choose to resign early because of poor health, and in
accordance with the Russian constitution, hand over power to his
prime minister, Putin. In that event, presidential elections would
have be held within three months of the handover.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Yakushkin rejected as ``nonsense'' reports that
Yeltsin was going to Germany for heart surgery later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russian troops now reportedly moving deeper into
Chechnya, fighting a low-intensity war that at the moment holds out
little or no prospect for a political solution, Yeltsin's physical
and political weakness have again become an issue. In an interview
with The New York Times last month, Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the
Russian Parliament's upper house, caused a political stir by saying
it would be better for both the country and the president if
Yeltsin voluntarily left his job before the end of his term.

<P>
   RHINELANDER, Wis. _ Wheeling the car down the sloped pathway
through a forest of soaring oak and pine trees, John Sobolewski
glimpsed his beloved old cedar cabin, and noticed the door had been
left open.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed it on the wind, or his own forgetfulness. In 30 years
of weekend trips to his cabin in the pristine north woods of
Wisconsin, Sobolewski had never once had trouble with thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, he left the doors unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I walked in, I realized burglars had gotten in,''
said Sobolewski, 65, who quickly discovered that intruders had
stolen his hunting guns, his binoculars and other valuables. ``I
couldn't believe it. You never had to worry about anything in the
woods, except, you know, for the squirrels and raccoons getting
into the garage and chewing up the boat cushions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deepest, most tranquil lands of Wisconsin, where people
could retreat for a few days and forget about urban woes, burglars
have been clearing out vacation homes with the efficiency of a
moving company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become epidemic up here in the last few years,'' said
Michael Roberts, a sheriff's investigator in Price County. ``It's a
sign of the times, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Price County has seen more than 100 burglaries this year, at
least double the rate of five years ago, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of crime that happened so rarely 15 or 20 years
ago that it scarcely registered on the police radar screen. ``Back
in the '80s, when we saw some tracks leading to a cabin in the
winter, we just figured, oh somebody on a snowmobile is stopping
by,'' said Joe Fath, the chief deputy of the Vilas County Sheriff's
Department. ``
</P>
<P>
   In some recent cases, burglars have cleaned out cabins so
thoroughly that they even pulled up the carpet and took the
toothbrushes and deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the wooded privacy that draws vacationers also suits
the working conditions of burglars, and the thefts are made easier
still because the homeowners generally come around only on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The burglars also know that vacation cabins in these affluent
times tend to be stocked with expensive furniture and artwork, said
Fath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the typical old shacks anymore,'' he said.
``Nowadays, people build a $200,000 home and call it a cabin.
They've got stereos, hot tubs, all the comforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Jim Wood, of the Oneida County Sheriff's Department
here, said some thieves specialize in guns, while others are
looking for deer antlers. Some people will buy the black market
deer antlers, he said, so they can hang them on their walls and
boast of their hunting prowess. He said the antlers had also become
popular as artwork and lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't seen them, they're really pretty neat,'' he
said of both.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the thieves were becoming especially busy during
this time of year, as many of the owners had said goodbye to Lake
Tomahawk and Crescent Lake, among the hundreds of freshwater bodies
in the woods, and gone back to the screech and bustle of Chicago
and Milwaukee until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these burglars are going to work right now,'' said
Fath. ``And people won't know what hit them until they come back in
the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of snowmobiling, with trails plowed by
the county highway departments, has also made it easier for thieves
to reach their targets, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's not the old north woods like it used to be,'' he said
sadly, noting that break-ins in the north woods were as scarce as
nightclubs when he joined the force in the '80s. ``A lot of people
up here still act like it's the old way, leaving everything open.
They think you don't have to worry, since you're hundreds of miles
from a city, where all the bad things supposedly happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fath said he tells them otherwise. ``If you compared crime to
population,'' he said, ``it's not so different here than it is for
them back in Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobolewski, a retired chain company worker who lives near
Chicago, acknowledged that he was being naive. He said he never
imagined people could be up to trouble in a place that seemed so
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But that has changed. A few weeks ago, he had sturdy locks put
on the doors of his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's problems all over anymore,'' Sobolewski said.
``I hear they've even got gangs in little towns in Wisconsin now,
for heaven sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobolewski, the son of Polish immigrants, said the vacationers
in the north woods used to be mostly working people, like himself.
One of his neighbors was a brewery worker. Others were tradesmen.
Fishing was a passion they all shared.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the north woods have become more popular
among younger people who drive sport utility vehicles and pack a
computer in their travel bags. Some of them do not even fish.
</P>
<P>
   As he has for years, Sobolewski still likes to walk down from
his cottage to the banks of the Wisconsin River, cast a line out
into the deep, still waters, and wait for the perch to bite.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he discovered the burglary in September, he brought
along his 10-year-old great-grandnephew, Daniel. It was going to be
a special day for the young man and his uncle. Sobolewski, who does
not have children of his own, was going to show Daniel how the red
squirrels in the north woods bring pine cones into the garage and
fill open pails, stocking up food for the harsh Wisconsin winter.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he needed to call the sheriff's department and
make a report.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the cabin has not been the same for Sobolewski for
the past two years, since his wife, Charlotte, died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could really fish,'' he said, growing quiet for a moment.
``We did everything together _ walk, bike, garden. Oh, we had
fun.''

   Major league baseball teams have padded their considerable
coffers in recent years by linking corporate sponsors to almost
every play in the game, from the ``AT&AMP;T call to the bullpen'' to a
``National Arbitration and Mediation umpires lineup.'' (No kidding;
it's a dispute-resolution business.) If baseball wants a perfect
corporate match, however, it should call the folks over at Anbesol
and pitch a tie-in for home runs, because we're getting a little
numb to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Like 100-point swings in the stock market, home runs don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in a unparalleled flurry of
four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseum on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the homer-happy news media have fallen asleep to home runs'
metronomic regularity. Major leaguers slammed a record 5,528 home
runs this season, a 10 percent increase over last year's previous
high of 5,064, and barely anyone cared. ``Last year kind of
desensitized everybody,'' said Peter Schmuck, baseball columnist
for the Baltimore Sun. ``I guess nobody noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa captivated the
sports world with their 70 and 66 home runs, respectively, capping
modern players' long climb to grab the crowns of Roger Maris and
Babe Ruth. This season's reprise failed on two counts. With McGwire
hitting 65 and Sosa 63, they neither made a serious run at the new
record nor fell short enough to reaffirm how amazing last year
truly was. Instead, their unremarkable sequel only helped
underscore how current home run totals, like Canadian dollars, have
less value than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are a dime a dozen now. (Or, if you're McGwire, about
$2 million a dozen.) Even the hitters themselves have to
acknowledge it. Doug Glanville, the center fielder for the
Philadelphia Phillies, said: ``When I was growing up, if a guy hit
20, I was like, `Twenty! Wow, he's good!' Now, it's like,
`Whatever. No big deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 20 major leaguers hit at least 36 homers, a total that
a decade ago would have led the American League. The grand slam
once was the most delectable of home runs; now more than 100 of
them get hit every year, sating even the most voracious fan. This
season Robin Ventura of the New York Mets hit two in one
doubleheader. Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals hit two in
one  &UR; inning. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The paradox here is that while home runs as a whole mean less,
fans still delight in each individual long ball as it happens. (The
frenzy receives a steroid-like boost when rock music immediately
gets blared through the stadium speakers. ``Whoomp! There It Is!''
is Yankee Stadium's injection of choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Team owners have built smaller ball parks, shrunk the strike
zone _ yes, it's now smaller than a bread box _ and allowed
aggressive hitters to don suits of armor at the plate (arm pads,
shin guards and the like) to facilitate more and more home runs,
with each of these moves validated at the ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is clear: Americans love anything big, from big
biceps to big drives to big scores, and prefer brute force to
cunning. The home run is indefensible. The pitcher can only watch
the ball's persistent arc, and must stand in shame as the hitter
saunters around the bases. The triple remains baseball's most
exciting play, but excitement involves risk. It requires strategy.
Why go to all that trouble when you can simply beat the other
side's brains in?
</P>
<P>
   This predilection was embodied in New York City's feelings
toward how its Yankees and Mets reached the playoffs this year. The
Yankees essentially hit a home run, enjoying a cozy lead in their
division for the entire summer. The wild-card Mets, meanwhile,
staged an old-fashioned rally, drawing a walk, hitting a single,
getting another single, getting foolishly caught in a rundown, then
extricating themselves and finally scoring with a dust-flying slide
into home. Safe! Ask most New Yorkers and they'll probably say they
prefer the Yankees' commodious approach, when the Mets' journey was
far more thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is moving toward an all-or-nothing culture, to its
detriment. As home runs skyrocket, so do strikeouts. Fewer stolen
bases and hit-and-run gambits make for less strategy and
second-guessing, and before you know it the sport will dovetail
into a dressed-up homer-hitting contest. That's essentially what
fans got in the final weekend of this season _ Fox TV disguised the
McGwire-Sosa longball showdown as the ``Game of the Week,'' even
though the players' teams were a combined 50 games out of first
place while the Mets, Houston Astros and Cincinnati Reds were
locked in a marvelous pennant race. The Cubs' manager, Jim
Riggleman, put it best: ``I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no more embarrassed than the modern player who doesn't
hit home runs. A Nike commercial this year featured Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, two of the decade's most
successful pitchers, taking extra batting practice because, they
claimed, ``Chicks dig the long ball.'' For how long is the
question. All home runs, even McGwire's, fall to earth eventually.

GAMBLING FACES TWO BIG TESTS IN SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCK HILL, S.C. _ It has been more than 50 years since any state
banned an existing form of gambling, but a drive around the border
roads of York County helps to explain why South Carolina is poised
to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Video poker is everywhere. Its robotic musical signature drones
from gambling machines in virtually every gas station and
convenience store as mesmerized players feed in dollar after dollar
to play five-card stud and blackjack. Gaudy windowless parlors with
five machines to a room greet visitors who cross the state line
from North Carolina. The industry crept up on the state through a
series of back-door legal moves, but 34,000 of the machines have
now taken root across South Carolina, far more than in any other
state, and many people have had enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, voters will have a choice either to ban the machines
beginning next summer or regulate them more closely. The latest
newspaper poll shows that a sizable majority of likely voters _
more than 60 percent, in one poll _ want the machines permanently
unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   That vote, and another one on Tuesday in which Alabama will
decide whether to institute a state lottery, will be among the most
important tests in years of whether gambling's steady growth in the
Southern Bible Belt has finally reached its limit. Although the
lottery is more accepted and far less intrusive than video
gambling, several polls show that its popularity in Alabama has
dropped in recent months. The outcome of next week's lottery vote,
which once seemed certain to pass, is now considered a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very big symbolic votes coming up,'' said William
Thompson, a gambling industry expert and public administration
professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ``The last time a
state voted out gambling was in 1948, when Idaho banned slot
machines. It will be a very big victory for the anti-gambling side
if it's thrown out in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's governor, Donald Siegelman, campaigned almost
exclusively on a promise to create a lottery, and is selling it as
the only way to create a pre-kindergarten program and a college
scholarship program similar to that in neighboring Georgia and
other states. Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who also ran on a
pro-lottery platform and accepted about $3 million from video poker
interests, now says he is opposed to video poker. His state's
lottery will be on the ballot in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In both of the coming votes, gambling proponents have
encountered large and potent coalitions of religious groups, but
the size of the opposition in South Carolina has been particularly
remarkable. Virtually every denomination in the state _ including
Southern Baptists, Presbyterians and Jews _ has joined in
well-organized coalitions to get anti-poker voters registered and
to the polls. They have been joined by the South Carolina Chamber
of Commerce and most large businesses, which are worried about the
state's image, and most editorial pages. The state election
commission has reported a noticeable burst in voter registrations
in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social cost and the implications for our citizens were
already huge,'' said Paula Harper Bethea, chairwoman of the South
Carolina chamber. ``But we also think it has a negative economic
impact on the state, because it greatly affects our image. We're
struggling to get ahead in a lot of areas, and we have a good
quality of life, and we think we deserve better than video poker.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,300-member chamber, the state's largest business
organization, is running television and radio advertisements
against the machines, while an anti-gambling group, Legacy
Alliance, is putting up billboards. Meanwhile, religious groups are
distributing yard signs and building grass-roots support. A recent
rally in Rock Hill, a hotbed of anti-poker sentiment, drew a crowd
of 3,500 to protest the effects of video gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have an endless sheaf of stories about middle-class
parents who lost their life savings to a video poker addiction, or
poor families who spend their food money in the parlors. But they
have been careful not to make the vote a referendum on the merits
of gambling itself. The Rev. Steve Hogg, pastor of the First
Baptist Church of Rock Hill and a prominent leader of the
anti-poker forces, said many people in his coalition approved of
lotteries or horse racing, though he does not, and so they decided
to focus on the one issue that united them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have put this coalition together if the lottery
was on the table, but we all agree that video poker is the most
destructive and addictive form of gambling there is,'' said Hogg, a
conservative Southern Baptist who wore a blue Vote No button on his
shirt pocket. ``I'm not one of those Christians who believes in
outlawing everything I think is sinful or immoral. I'm part of the
community, and we have to be pragmatic about what we consider to be
life-or-death issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the support for the machines has come from the state's
video poker industry, which has revenue of about $2.8 billion a
year and has raised about $2 million on the campaign to keep the
machines, more than twice as much as its opponents. Supporters say
the state will lose $200 million to $300 million in yearly tax
revenue if the machines are banned, and predict that 28,000 people
will lose their jobs. Many video parlors and gas stations are
plastered with fliers that cast the issue in terms of personal
freedom, saying that the next step is to ban the Internet or rock
music.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the poll was published by The State, in Columbia, and five
other newspapers last month, the pro-poker forces have intensified
their broadcast advertising and direct mailings, and are building a
get-out-the-vote effort among poker employees and players to rival
that of the churches. But many who have watched the issue say the
industry may have grown too large to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tightened up since the poll,'' said John
Cavanaugh, a political science professor at the University of South
Carolina. ``But there's still a strong anti-gambling feeling that's
catching hold in the state. Everyone sees the machines when they go
to the gas station, and many people know someone with an addiction
problem. The tide seems to be turning.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a considerable sentiment against the lottery in
Alabama, as well, again led by church groups, but the intensity of
the opposition is less than in South Carolina because of the nature
of the game. Many people consider the lottery less addictive and
less harmful than video poker, and are jealous of the
lottery-financed college scholarships offered to Georgia students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails, there is no Plan B,'' said Rick Dent, a
spokesman for the Alabama Education Lottery Foundation, which is
running the pro-lottery campaign. ``This is our one chance to ever
have college scholarships, pre-K and computers in the schools. If
there were another way to pay for them, surely we would already
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   But lottery opponents have also repeated a frequent criticism of
the numbers game: Most tickets are purchased by poorer residents, a
large number of whom are black, while the scholarships tend to go
to middle-class white students. Church leaders said they were
particularly angered by a statement from Siegelman, the governor,
several weeks ago that opponents of the lottery should be ashamed
of themselves, and they said no other issue had brought different
denominations so closely together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply believe that government should not fund itself with
money from the people who can least afford it,'' said Michael
Anderson, executive director of the Mobile Baptist Association,
which represents about 100 churches.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman later said he respected those who disagree with him on
religious or moral grounds, but pollsters say the intense
church-by-church mobilization has significantly eroded support for
the lottery. A poll conducted by three newspapers and published
this week showed that 51 percent of likely voters said they
supported the lottery, down from 61 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, every church in Alabama has a bus,'' said Eric
Johnston, a Birmingham lawyer who is treasurer of the largest
anti-lottery coalition. ``And on Tuesday, they're all heading for
the polls.''

U.S. TROOPS START ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct dateline to East Timor. No other changes.)  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ The U.S. military has arrived in East Timor
in force, although the bulk of the American troops participating in
the international peacekeeping mission will remain safely aboard a
warship in the waters off this looted, burned-out shell of a city.
</P>
<P>
   The amphibious assault ship, the Belleau Wood, landed in Dili's
harbor on Friday. During their deployment here, most of the 1,800
sailors and marines aboard the 40,000-ton ship will never go
ashore, staying safe from attack by the Indonesian-backed militias
that rampaged across East Timor after the territory voted for
independence from Indonesia in August.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 U.S. troops are assigned to duty on shore, and of
those, most spend the night aboard the ship, about half a mile off
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 priority is taking care of my people,'' said Brig.
Gen. John Castellaw, commander of the U.S. forces participating in
the Australian-led peacekeeping mission. ``We're not at war with
anybody; nobody has been declared hostile to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The machine guns aboard the four large Sea Stallion helicopters
stationed on the Belleau Wood ``are only for self-defense,'' he
said. ``And they're the last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in a former schoolhouse that is serving as his
headquarters in East Timor, the Marine general said that the U.S.
mission here centered on the use of the helicopters to help the
Australians ferry heavy equipment, vehicles and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, the largest in the U.S. military inventory, can
each carry a payload of 32,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian military has enthusiastically taken on the actual
work of peacekeeping _ securing the shattered territory from
further attacks by the militias, which have largely fled across the
border to Indonesian-controlled West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Castellaw said that the mission had been ``a success story _ the
Australians don't have to prove anything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only gun battle to date involving the peacekeepers, two
militia members were killed and two Australian soldiers wounded on
Wednesday when a militia tried to ambush a peacekeeping unit near
the southwestern city of Suai.
</P>
<P>
   The general, a Tennessee-born marine who says he keeps a
well-thumbed biography of Robert E. Lee on his desk here in part to
remind him of the terrors of combat, first visited East Timor about
three weeks ago from his home base in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Dili, the capital of the former Portuguese
colony, it had been looted and burned, he said. ``There were very
few people, and the militias were still present.''
</P>
<P>
   As he drove through the city in a military convoy on Saturday,
the village seemed to burst with activity.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees have returned to the city from hiding
places in the surrounding hills, and some have opened small
roadside stands to sell fruits and vegetables, packages of soup,
soap and mosquito coils.
</P>
<P>
   A seaside condo has been turned into a hotel for journalists and
aid workers, and local residents are accepting payment in the form
of small donations for repairing the damage done to the building by
the militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are cleaning out their homes, trying to rebuild,''
Castellaw said. ``Life is coming back here.''

some Kentucky tobacco fields will produce half their typical yield.
But the real heat, the farmers say, comes from a $206 billion
health settlement by Big Tobacco. Experts predict cigarette prices
will keep climbing and escalating excise taxes will further
diminish domestic demand. That means Kentucky farmers will need to
grow less tobacco. Their toil has made Kentucky the state most
economically reliant on tobacco and helped generate the country's

CLINTON SAYS SENATE HOLDING UP HISPANIC JUDGESHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton told a national Hispanic group
Saturday that the U.S. Senate was a black hole of delay, unwilling
to vote for his Hispanic nominees for federal judgeships but afraid
to vote against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't know about you, but if I took three and a half
years to make a decision, you wouldn't think I was a very good
president,'' Clinton said. ``How many times has somebody been on
you because you took three and a half hours?''
</P>
<P>
   The president was warmly received Saturday morning at the annual
conference of the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, a nonpartisan
organization that promotes voter registration and training of
Hispanic officials. He gave credit to the Clinton-Gore
administration for the growing economy, particularly this week's
economic information showing that household incomes of Hispanics
are growing faster than those of other Americans. But he devoted
much of his address to the judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was not an isolated incident last week when the
Senate rejected his nominee for the federal bench in Missouri after
the seat sat empty for two years. The Senate on Tuesday voted 54-45
against the nominee, Justice Ronnie White, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said they have approved hundreds of Clinton
nominees, including two on the day that White was rejected. They
said the Missourian had an extremely pro-criminal record in hearing
appeals in death penalty cases. The president criticized White's
rejection as ``a disgraceful act of partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many Republicans said they were not aware of White's
race when they voted against him, in its reaction to the vote the
White House emphasized what it called unfair treatment of minority
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued that theme Saturday, turning the focus on
Hispanic judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just disappear somewhere in the dark recesses of the
calendar of the Senate,'' Clinton said. ``Why? Well, they don't
want to vote him down because they hope that you will vote with
them in the next election, but they don't want to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Senate was dragging its feet on the nominations of
Richard Paez of California, the first Mexican-American to serve on
the federal bench in Los Angeles, to serve on the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ; Marsha Berzon, an appellate lawyer, also in the
9th Circuit; Judge Julio Fuentes in the 3rd Circuit; Enrique Moreno
in the 5th Circuit; and Judge Ronald Guzman for the Northern
District of Illinois.

PASSING ALONG THE ART OF APPALACHIAN FIDDLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va.)  (bl) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICUT, W. Va. _ The mountain-hollow art of old-time Appalachian
fiddling, long withering under the pressures of youthful emigration
and homogenized broadcast entertainment, is hanging on by a few
well-bowed strings here in a backwoods master-apprentice program.
</P>
<P>
   Toe-tapping in syncopation, his right wrist snapping off bow
movements the way other lads ply a curve ball, 14-year-old Jake
Krack followed his master, 78-year-old Lester McCumber, through the
popping, tuneful intricacies of ``Ida Red.''
</P>
<P>
   The lustrous, haunting scrape of the music drifted out toward
the surrounding forest this evening, the sound wreathing the simple
McCumber household as pungently as autumnal chimney smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The two were jamming, by the boy's terminology, or just
fiddling, by that of his lean and craggy master. But the music _
part of an ever-fading pre-Colonial Appalachian canon rarely
written down and ``played by air,'' as the teacher tells his pupil
_ was assuredly alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's the original way of playing `Ida Red,''' the way
the old man who lived down the road _ Senate Cottrell was his name
_ played it,'' the master instructed, suddenly looking back on his
own young tutelage by a departed local legend.
</P>
<P>
   In the gifted hands of Jake, the fiddling arts of McCumber _ and
of Cottrell, the fiddler French Carpenter and sundry masters before
_ now promises to outlive them all through a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having fun,'' Jake said, at a pause in the bowing.
``Aside from that, my main concern is to carry on this music into
the future. That's my passion: to pass it forward. Lester always
says there's no charge for the lessons, just pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the underlying passion, as well, of the
master-apprentice program that the Augusta Heritage Center of Davis
&AMP; Elkins College in Elkins has threaded through the hills and
hollows of West Virginia. Many young people historically have been
forced to leave this state to find promising careers, rarely
mastering and passing on the Appalachian folk ways of their elders.
But lately, young people searching out uncommercialized, authentic
old music have been showing up on Heritage Center scholarships at
the cabin doors of the aging masters.
</P>
<P>
   Jake is apprenticed to Lester here in Calhoun County just as
Phyllis Marks, a blind balladeer in her eighth decade over in
Gilmer County, is teaching pure backwoods songs of yore, some of
them long forgotten but for the urgings of her talented young
student, Helena Triplett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like they're channeling people who are gone,''
said Margo Blevin, director of the Augusta Center, summarizing how
the music of departed masters flows across time to nurture
apprentices like Jake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not purist,'' she said, emphasizing that the music is
always changing. The fiddling had homespun roots and its heyday was
preradio, performed for family and country gatherings where
fiddlers constantly memorized and readapted each others' new tunes
in the tradition of the hollows.
</P>
<P>
   Far from academic, Jake and Lester jauntily connected the
generations by bowing their way through unscripted versions of
``Cotton Eyed Joe,'' ``Cherry River Line,'' ``Sally Comin' Through
the Rye,'' ``Old Joe Clark'' and a half dozen others. Each fresh
tune was summoned from memory by the merest old title.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sheet music in old-time Appalachian playing, a naive
musical art with a mournful sound that wanders off freely from the
eight-tone scale and conventional rhythms. Some call it ``crooked
tune music,'' perfect for the crooked roads and mountain crooks of
Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   The chord-free, note-by-note flurries that mark old-time
Appalachian tunes date to the earliest European settlers from the
British isles and Germany. Old time was the seed for modern Blue
Grass with its harmonies and orchestration. But it remains a far
older thing unto itself, built around fiddles and banjos and never
a guitar, Ms. Blevin noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to old timers who said the first Sears Roebuck
guitars revolutionized things around here in the 1920s,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In sticking with old-time fiddling, Jake nimbly handled this
day's lesson. The boy never looked down at his own fiddling. But he
played apace, gravely watching McCumber's slashing right wrist and
dancing eyes. He plumbed the old man's musical memory with a few
words of a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' the master exclaimed when the boy wanted more of
``Ida Red'' and McCumber suddenly remembered a scrap of lyric to go
with their furious bowing. ``I'm in love with Ida Red!'' he
shouted. ``Little bit drunk and out of my head!''
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, the master grinned across at his insatiable
apprentice. ``All I ever learned is in my head,'' McCumber said.
``Jake knows every one that I know and a lot of good 'uns
besides.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake, who has been enthralled with fiddling since he was 8 and
his parents encouraged an obvious talent, politely thanked the
master and stressed that he would be back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking everything that comes to us,'' he explained of
his family's decision last year to move here from Indiana. They
wanted to be near McCumbers and another master in a nearby hollow,
90-year-old Melvin Wine, who taught Jake techniques and tunes
passed down from the fiddle of his great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel part of these people,'' said Jake, whose father, Reed,
is a fiddle maker, and mother, Dara, a librarian. They moved to a
weathered old farmhouse somewhere east of Chloe and south of
Stumpton when their son won summer fiddling scholarships and honors
from the Augusta center. But he still seemed to need his own place
in the hollows near the masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more than the fiddling, Jake is learning something about
life, about a special attitude, an appetite for life around here,''
Mrs. Krack said of the people in this deeply rural, working-class
region. ``I continue to be surprised about where we continue to be
led by this.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival in the 1970s of Interstate 79, just 10 miles to the
east, carried off much of the younger generation as traumatically
as the radio and the guitar made inroads into the old-time music.
Then again, it made it easier for Jake to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lester and Melvin are some of the last old-time musicians not
influenced by TV and radio,'' said Jake, explaining his journey to
the hollows. He vaguely thinks of becoming a naturalist, he said,
and cannot imagine a professional life for himself as an old-time
fiddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you'd get in a rut, limit the songs you perform, travel
one night to the next,'' Jake said. Rather, he emphasized that his
masters had made him plainly happy with the music and taught him
enough to know that he eventually must be passing it on.

 &HT;    Fiandaca's fall line offers youthful style and old-fashioned
attention to detail
 &HT;    By Robert Janjigian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Flattery can get you everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Fiandaca presented 79 distinctive day and evening
ensembles for autumn and winter 1999/2000 at his petite
second-floor salon along Boston's Newbury Street.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm evening and 79 is a large number of looks to take
in at one sitting, but the Fiandaca flair came across, as did a new
direction that will undoubtedly have women from Palm Beach, Fla.,
to Portland, Ore., clamoring for a chance to add some Fiandacas to
their fall and winter wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of ordering on the minute the last model,
dressed in an ivory silk satin bridal-style gown, left the
spotlight. Fiandaca's agenda the following day was filled to the
brim with appointments and fittings.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston- and New York-based designer, who spends a large
portion of the Palm Beach season working out of his Via Mizner
shop, has a large number of loyalists, among them Jane Dudley and
Emily DiMaggio. In the crowd at the Boston showing were several
stylish Palm Beach locals, including Diane Tosi, Denise Swan, Jerre
and Cheryl Gowdy, Carol Henderson, Mickey Lee, Heather Hill, Ruth
Shapiro and Phyllis Rappaport. They and many others come to
Fiandaca for the old-fashioned attention he pays to making
almost-custom, couture-level clothes for them.
</P>
<P>
   Fiandaca, at a point in his career when he could probably rest
on his laurels, is consciously making a slightly younger design
statement. He acknowledged this by suggesting daring, baring
features in some outfits, but didn't forget about those who don't
want to show too much skin, adding boleros, stoles and jackets to
give women the option of covering up in a finished way. The
strategy of producing a collection that appeals to everybody, from
20-somethings to 80-somethings, worked very well.
</P>
<P>
   Several young things, so to speak, invited to preview Fiandaca's
fall collection, could be heard murmuring their approval during the
show.
</P>
<P>
   For the fall and with a eye on the big new year ahead, Fiandaca
touched all the stylistic bases. Some might view that as taking the
safe route, addressing a variety of tastes to appeal to a wider
range of buyers, but Fiandaca's creative concerns didn't seem muted
or hesitant about making a statement. He mixed it up in an apt
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Bright brocade suits would make a handsome addition to a woman's
closeted repertoire. While reminiscent of Fortuny, Issey Miyake and
Mary McFadden (certainly not bad company to keep), Fiandaca's
pleated velvet pieces were a triumph. Steel gray mattelasse and
chiffon pieces came off as rich and pretty instead of bland (as
this tone can come off in the hands of less-reputable stylists).
Mixed prints were eye-catching and contemporary. Retro peasant
passages, in the New Bohemian vein, were deftly inserted. Both
goddess-style and beaded gowns would make a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Looks reminiscent of the jet-set era were also on hand, with one
charmeuse halter gown worn with a cream lace cover-up. It was just
so Claudine Longet, it made you want to rethink those layered-look
crocheted vests everybody wore at one point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few missteps. A ruffled purple-velvet gown
looked like something a bridesmaid would lament. The dresses that
offered unnatural geometric necklines and a graphic sensibility
were not quite up to snuff. But, overall, there was something for
everyone, age be damned.

   A plume of tropical moisture will precede a cold front moving
swiftly across the northern tier of the nation. The corridor of
humid air will stretch from the mouth of the Mississippi River to
the northern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, more than 2 inches of rain fell on Paducah, Ky., a
daily record. More heavy rain is expected Sunday in the central and
southern Appalachians as high pressure east of the Carolinas
circulates additional moisture into this region from the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Very mild air will cover the East as morning readings average
well above seasonal levels due to thick clouds and winds from the
south. Florida will be bright and rather hot with isolated
thundershowers in the southern sections.
</P>
<P>
   Fog will be slow to dissipate in the middle Mississippi and
western Tennessee valleys. Cooler, dry air will push into the upper
Midwest on blustery breezes from the northwest, which will gust
over 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   An elongated high pressure system will promote very pleasant
conditions for most of the western half of the nation. The
clockwise circulation will direct dry, warm air from the interior
west to the Pacific Coast. Temperatures will rise to near record
values in parts of California.
</P>
<P>
   The jet stream will flow along the border states from Washington
to Michigan. Streamers of moisture above 10,000 feet will interrupt
the otherwise tranquil, bright weather in this region. Sunday night
will be cooler in the northern Plains and upper Great Lakes. The
Southwest will be sunny and hot, though a few high clouds will
arrive later on.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: AUTUMN FROST
</P>
<P>
   While mild air has returned to the Northeast this weekend, a
frost occurred in much of the region earlier in the week. The date
of the first frost can differ by weeks within 100 miles. There are
significant delays in frost in major cities as opposed to the
suburbs, in coastal communities compared to inland areas, and in
hilly terrain vs. nearby valleys. In the mountains of northwestern
Pennsylvania, there is a 70 percent chance of a freeze by October
1. Yet, not far away along the shores of the relatively warm Lake
Erie, wine makers can enjoy frost-free weather into early November.

ROWING CREW OF YOUNG MOTHERS IS RACING FOR CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SOUTH HADLEY, Mass. _ Their oars splashed and slipped a little
more often than the other rowers' did. Their shoulders didn't lean
as far back on each stroke. But the crew members from the Holyoke
Care Center, competing in their first regatta, had the biggest
cheering section of any team on the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   The four-person scull was easy to spot. As Anne Teschner, their
mentor, said, the care center's crew was the only team of ``single
mothers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Out there, or maybe on a rowing team anywhere. In recent years,
rowing has been praised as an alternative sport for inner-city
children, a way to impart fresh air, exercise and discipline. Ms.
Teschner, executive director of the center, decided to see whether
rowing could do the same for young mothers on public aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than sitting at home or being a couch potato,''
said Marilyn Cruz, 20, who passed a high school equivalency exam
this summer with the center's help and is taking classes at a
community college. Ms. Cruz, a ninth-grade dropout and mother of a
1-year-old, plans to use her crew connections to apply to Mount
Holyoke's program for students with children.
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen women who volunteered for the program practiced
two afternoons a week, an hour and a half at a time, for two
eight-week sessions over the summer. Mount Holyoke College offered
its boat house, boats and coaches to train. The care center
provided a rowing machine for off-water practice, along with day
care for the rowers' children.
</P>
<P>
   Tessa Spillane, the coach who worked closest with them, said the
mothers _ and sometimes mothers-to-be _ learned faster than some of
her other novices, who practice daily. At the Mount Holyoke
Invitational, the oldest women's regatta in the country, the care
center team competed against Amherst, Middlebury, Regis, Simmons,
Smith and other colleges known not only for their academic programs
but their rowing prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spillane's biggest challenge in training was that only about
half the women spoke English. About 95 percent of the care center
clientele is Puerto Rican. Ms. Spillane relied on the bilingual
team members to translate.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Perez, 19, taught her colleagues how to put an oar in the
water properly. ``I don't know the word for oar,'' she admitted.
``I call it a `stick' _ `palillo.'''
</P>
<P>
   The translators became the leaders of the group. ``These four in
particular are quite feisty,'' Ms. Spillane said of Ms. Cruz, Ms.
Perez, Vicky Ortiz, 18, and Desiree Velez, 17. Although all the
trainees could have participated in the regatta, only this small
group wanted to compete.
</P>
<P>
   This was their first time hearing the cow bells and the Mount
Holyoke cheer that accompany a launch: ``We drink acid, we eat
rocks!''
</P>
<P>
   The care center is located in downtown Holyoke, where blighted
patches contrast with the stately brick buildings of Mount Holyoke
College just across the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis has never been on going fast, but on showing them
that they could do something new,'' said Jeanne Friedman, Mount
Holyoke's head crew coach. ``The hope is that the self-confidence
would carry over to other parts of their lives. They are living in
parts of the city which are not beautiful, and this gets them on
the river. It's a stone's throw from where they live, but most of
them have never been on it.''
</P>
<P>
   On shore, Ms. Perez's daughter, 2-year-old Keysha, watched the
race from the arms of her father, Lioneo Alsina, 20. At first Ms.
Perez ``was complaining that her muscles were sore,'' said Alsina,
who shares an apartment with her. But the comments are more
positive now. ``She said she's getting very good at it,'' he
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part for Ms. Perez and the other high school
dropouts has not been the discipline _ showing up on time for
practices and learning the skills _ but ``carrying the boat,'' Ms.
Perez said. ``It's real heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for who won, well, it turned out the care center crew rowed
the only four-person boat in the novice class that day. But the
team's 11 minutes 32 seconds would have been respectable time, even
if there had been competition, Ms. Teschner assured them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ortiz scoffed. ``11:32? We should have done nine minutes.''

 &HT;    Tobacco farms' last gasp?
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAINT LICK, Ky. _ Henry West is finished with his back-breaking,
brow-drenching burley tobacco harvest. In boots and Wrangler
bluejeans, he spent the hottest parts of summer weaving leaves of
burley through 4-foot-long wooden tobacco sticks to dry. Family and
hired hands hung thousands of them from barn rafters so leaves
would cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up from daylight to dark-thirty,'' the 55-year-old former
accountant said, repeating a refrain of tobacco farmers across the
South. In a few weeks, tobacco auctions will start in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But growers worry the sun's about to set on their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Baked by a summerlong drought, some Kentucky fields produced
just half their typical yield. But the real heat, the farmers say,
comes from legal setbacks for Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Already bleeding from a $206 billion settlement with 46 states
that had pressed or threatened lawsuits, the top tobacco companies
recently were hit with a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice
Department. It seeks to recover hundreds of billions of federal
health care dollars spent to treat illnesses blamed on smoking.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, experts predict cigarette prices will keep climbing
and excise taxes will continue escalating, further diminishing
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
   That means Kentucky farmers will need to grow less tobacco.
Their toil has made Kentucky the state most economically reliant on
tobacco and helped generate the country's highest smoking rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see themselves under enormous attack, and there's a lot
of pessimism,'' said Hampton Henton, director of Kentucky's Farm
Service Agency, which administers price support programs. ``A
banker might ask, `How much longer are you going to be raising this
stuff? Are you going to sell any land for development? What are you
going to do next?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep your head down and keep on truckin' when
you're asked the same questions all the time.'' Cigarette companies
say they'll buy just 618 million pounds of burley and flue-cured
tobacco this year _ the smallest amount this decade. Also expected
to push down demand is the decision by cigarette makers to increase
wholesale prices _ five times last year, including 45 cents a pack
in November, the largest boost ever.
</P>
<P>
   The continued decline in demand for tobacco could quite
literally change the agricultural landscape in some Southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk about cigarette companies contracting
directly with growers, allowing farmers to sell their quotas or
eliminating the tobacco program and its price supports. If direct
contracts take the place of auctions, cigarette makers may find an
economy of scale by turning to larger operations at the expense of
small family farms.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, production may shift to flatter land in the
eastern part of the state, where large farms aren't limited by the
Appalachian Mountains. Similarly in Kentucky, the rugged land in
the central and eastern parts of the state ultimately may yield to
friendlier landscape to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to farm in central Kentucky and make a decent
living, you've got to farm tobacco,'' said Donald Mitchell, who
grows about 53 acres just outside Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of these changes is last year's legal settlement
between 46 state attorneys general and Big Tobacco _ and the threat
of still more litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The national settlement, which some experts said might be
undermined by the federal lawsuit, came after legal challenges in
four states that resulted in separate settlements totaling about
$40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Inc. _ the nation's largest tobacco company and
maker of Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Basic and Cambridge _ noted in
its annual report that it faces 500 domestic smoking suits from
individuals as of March 1. There were 185 at the end of 1996.
International sales are growing, but so are foreign lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The company recorded total pretax charges of $4.6 billion for
1998 and 1997 to accrue for its share of the tobacco settlement.
The annual report warned investors ``it is possible that the
company's business ... could be materially affected by an
unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken it's toll,'' West said. ``It makes you wonder how
important tobacco will be in the future.'' Southern farmers from
Georgia
</P>
<P>
   to Virginia grow more than 90 percent of the nation's tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, the number of U.S. tobacco farms fell 27
percent. In 1954, there were 512,000 domestic tobacco farms. Today,
there are only 90,000 _ half of them in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, which grows flue-cured tobacco on many
commercial farms, produces more leaf than any other state _ 320,000
acres, or nearly 38 percent of the U.S. total.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky depends on tobacco even more. On average, tobacco has
accounted for nearly half the state's crop values, producing nearly
$825 million annually. ``You're probably going to see a 20
(percent) to 25 percent long-term decline in demand due to the
settlement,'' predicted Will Snell, a tobacco expert at the
University of Kentucky. ``Tobacco will remain a viable enterprise
in the state but for a lot fewer people.'' For generations, picking
burley by hand has been embedded in Kentucky culture. Henry West
grows 15 acres in low spots between rocky hills an hour south of
Lexington, just like his father and grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Burley doesn't lend itself to the mechanization that has helped
make the harvest easier in North Carolina. Almost anybody who farms
here grows at least a small tobacco patch, squeezing dollars out of
backyard plots the same way suburban teen-agers turn to
baby-sitting or cutting the neighbor's grass. Thousands of farmers
tend 5-acre fields on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a federal program that dictates how much tobacco a
farmer can grow and guarantees a minimum price at auction, Kentucky
burley can fetch up to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``No crop generates the money per acre that tobacco does,'' West
said. ``Tobacco is the only cash crop I grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the health settlement, Big Tobacco set aside $5.15
billion to compensate growers in 13 states. The trust fund will be
financed by contributions over 12 years by Philip Morris, R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp. West is one of six farmers on a state board that
decides how Kentucky will parse its $1.5 billion. Outside of
tobacco, there aren't many farming options in Kentucky. There's
little flatland for livestock feed. The state lacks huge produce
processing plants. West and his neighbors have tried growing
tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans. But the payoff paled compared
with the subsidized value of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had tomatoes, everybody had tomatoes,'' West said. In
Garrard County where West farms, bluebells grow on the shoulders of
winding country roads. Cattle and horses graze. Land speculators,
usually developers aching for the chance to build 100-home
subdivisions, snatch up available farm land. West stores most of
his tobacco in a charcoal-colored barn his father built in the
1930s. He sowed seeds in March into square Styrofoam containers
that float in water. Two months later, West spent a week
transplanting the seeds in tilled ground the color of cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   In August and September, West, his two grown daughters, son,
wife and about 10 hired hands picked burley. Through slots in
wooden sticks, they weaved tobacco leaves, then loaded them on
wagons and hoisted the leaves into curing barns.
</P>
<P>
   The rafters will be emptied this month and next for auctions
that open just before Thanksgiving. The leaves will be tied off in
100-pound bales. Tips from the plant will command the highest
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard life,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a tenant farmer five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to slow down a little bit,'' West said. ``I
wanted to play a little golf. There's more to life than standing in
a tobacco patch.''
</P>
<P>
   None of his children has an interest in tobacco farming, and the
family tradition may end with him _ an exit quickened by the
political unpopularity of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke and I don't chew,'' West said. ``There's not a
reasonable American that doesn't understand that there's some
problems with smoking. But as long as it's legal, it's a pure
economic situation with me.''

PITT STADIUM, AT 74, IS PUT ON THE AUCTION BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE ROSENWALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ With 42 seconds left in the 1982 Sugar Bowl game,
Susan Coyne and her husband sat nervously in the Superdome in New
Orleans as Pittsburgh, their beloved alma mater, trailed Georgia by
3 points. They had driven 23 hours and 1,100 miles from Pittsburgh
and did not want to return home disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers had a fourth-and-5 on Georgia's 33-yard line, and
Coach Jackie Sherrill forsook the tying field goal and went for the
victory. Quarterback Dan Marino passed to tight end John Brown over
the middle, and he marched into the end zone for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne has cherished the memory over the years, and she has
thought about it often lately, especially since the university
recently decided to demolish 74-year-old Pitt Stadium. While
forging ahead with plans to share a stadium with the Steelers, the
university is giving fans such as Coyne the chance to savor
football history by auctioning off memorabilia from the stadium,
which will face the wrecking ball in December.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding in-person auctions and sales, as has been
done for many stadiums before demolition, the university has set up
a Web site much like other popular online auctions for people to
buy and bid on a variety of relics, ranging from bricks to
locker-room carpet to ticket windows and even the giant scoreboard.
It is believed to be the first such sale of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it was decided that Pitt Stadium was coming down, we
knew right away that people would want mementos,'' said Steve
Pederson, the athletic director. ``And we did get flooded with
people who wanted things. This made a lot of sense. The Internet is
a great way to communicate with large numbers of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyne heard about the Web site (www.pittstadium.com), and on it
she came across a painted wooden sign depicting the Panthers'
participation in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. Each item up for bidding has
a picture and a list of previous bids. She saw the high bid was
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne, who lives in Washington, Pa., south of Pittsburgh,
registered with the site and put up a bid for $200. A few days
later, the site e-mailed her, as it does with anyone who is outbid,
and told her she had lost her position as high bidder. She raised
her bid to $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things to bid on, this was the item that was most
special to my husband and I,'' said Coyne, who also bid on another
sign from the 1976 Sugar Bowl. ``It would be nice to have. But
we'll have to wait and see. I keep thinking that I'm going to have
to up my bid. I check every day. So far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitt, which also has an abridged paper catalog of items, has
received about 60 bids since the site went up in August, according
to Brian Cavanaugh, the director of licensing and merchandising.
There are 500 registered users to the site, which also accounts for
between 40 and 50 sales transactions a day for less coveted and
abundant mementos such as bricks, bottles of dirt, bathroom sinks,
railings and small pieces of turf.
</P>
<P>
   The associate athletic director Jim Earle is overseeing the
project, and said that officials from other old stadiums told him
similar auctions had earned more than $1 million from nostalgic
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a goal we've set, but we're extremely pleased with
how things are going,'' Earle said. ``The bids have been slower
than sales, but once the season moves forward and we get closer to
the demolition I think we'll see things heat up. It's obvious that
we have made a great piece of history available to a lot of fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson and Earle are curious to see what people will covet.
</P>
<P>
   There is the large window covered with a painted Panther above
Gate A. It is original to the stadium. Bidding opens on it for
$10,000. The opening bid for the entire north end zone turf is
$7,000. A program stand opens at $300.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular item so far has been a sign that lists all of
Pitt's national championships. Bidding opened at $75 and 13 bids
later it was up to $350.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the main scoreboard, which takes
up a good deal of the north end of the stadium. It's only four
years old. Bidding opens at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a chance someone might want it,'' Pederson
said, only half joking. ``You'd have to have the right place for
it, though.''

<P>
   In Colorado, nominees for governor do not get to choose their
running mates. Rather, at the same time each party holds a primary
to choose its candidate for governor, it holds a separate primary
to pick its candidate for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that come November, when the nominees must run as a
pair on the same ticket, everything is not always buddy-buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does a victory on Election Day necessarily improve
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, relations could hardly be worse between Gov. Bill
Owens and Lt. Gov. Joe Rogers, the first Republican team (if team
is the right word) to be in charge of running Colorado in 24 years.
Since the moment last year when they were first thrown together on
the same ticket, they have hardly spoken _ except to snipe and
spat, much to the embarrassment of fellow Republicans and the
chuckling delight of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The governor contends that the lieutenant governor is an inept
public official and last week asked the state controller to
investigate his use of state funds for gifts, meals and
long-distance phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor, the state's highest-ranking black
office holder, says the governor is too authoritarian about budget
matters, assumes powers he does not legally have and is insensitive
to the needs of others, especially the state's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men talk of the need to get together and thrash things out
_ but continue to thrash each other.
</P>
<P>
   One of their first public breaks occurred early in the 1998
campaign when Owens backed out of a debate with the Democratic
candidate, Gail Schoettler, and infuriated Rogers by ordering him
to fill in. The debate never took place.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the two men tangled when the governor called a summit on
youth violence after the shootings at Columbine High School and
scheduled it to take place during the week when Colorado blacks
traditionally commemorate the freeing of American slaves. Rogers
said the governor was being insensitive and owed the black
community an apology. Owens refused.
</P>
<P>
   Still later, the two men tangled when Colorado's secretary of
state, Vikki Buckley, died and Rogers tried to postpone a task
force meeting on child welfare so he could assist the Buckley
family with funeral arrangements. The governor ordered the meeting
to be held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the two men have feuded over whether the governor
can order the lieutenant governor's employees to undergo the same
criminal background checks he requires for his own staff.
</P>
<P>
   The governor insists he can. And when a Rogers employee refused
to submit to a check, he held up her pay.
</P>
<P>
   She filed suit _ with the lieutenant governor's blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Which led the governor to raise still another question about the
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he asked last week, did the state police decide not to
ticket a Rogers aide they caught driving 103 mph in a state car _
with Rogers riding in the passenger seat?
</P>
<P>
   Strictly a state police decision, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon the governor took it upon himself to suspend the aide
for a week without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gay Marriages, Religion and Speech
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has one of the nation's largest and most
politically active gay and lesbian communities. So no issue is
hotter in that city at the moment than a statewide initiative to be
voted on in 2000 that would bar the state from recognizing gay or
lesbian marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Gay men and lesbians all over the country are looking to San
Francisco's gay men and lesbians to lead the fight to defeat the
initiative, figuring that a victory in the nation's biggest state
would give a huge lift to efforts to beat back similar restrictive
measures elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of traditional marriage also see the California vote
as crucial to their struggle and likewise are girding for the fight
and looking for a signal victory. Among the most outspoken of them
are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the
Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some gay and lesbian leaders say Mormon support for the
California initiative is so outspoken and organized that it goes
well beyond what is permitted by federal laws regulating political
activity by tax-exempt organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders disagree. They insist that church members are
doing no more than exercising their constitutional right of free
speech as they urge passage of the measure that, in effect, would
define marriage in California as strictly a one-man, one-woman
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, last week the city's board of supervisors
went along with the wishes of gay and lesbian leaders and, on a
unanimous vote, passed a resolution calling on the IRS to look into
whether the church was violating federal laws that forbid churches
to engage in ``substantial lobbying or political activity.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the resolution, sponsored by Supervisor Mark Leno,
who is gay, some church members have told city officials that the
church has set quotas for church members' donations to the
initiative cause.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's most prominent Mormons, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, happened to be in San Francisco pushing his quest for the
Republican presidential nomination when the resolution was passed.
</P>
<P>
   He called the board's action ``idiotic, bigoted and
prejudiced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It flies in the face of free-speech rights almost as much as
anything I've ever seen,'' he said. ``If that type of philosophy
became the norm, that almost means nobody affiliated with any
religion would have a right to talk freely.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pre-Emptive Strike Pays Off in the Polls
</P>
<P>
   Remember Mayor Lincoln Chafee of Warwick, R.I., a Republican who
is running to replace his father, John Chafee, in the U.S. Senate?
</P>
<P>
   Early on in his campaign, before anyone had even bothered to
ask, he confessed that in his younger days he smoked some pot and
snorted a bit of cocaine. The way he figured it, by coming clean up
front, he could ``inoculate'' himself against any embarrassing
questions that might come at him down the road and, at the same
time, garner a few extra votes for being honest and forthright.
</P>
<P>
   It appears he has.
</P>
<P>
   A new Brown University poll puts the mayor in a dead heat with
the leading Democratic candidate, Rep. Bob Weygand, who represents
the 2nd Congressional District in western Rhode Island. Weygand led
by eight points in a June poll.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll also has Chafee a couple of points ahead of the
independent candidate in the contest, former Attorney General
Arlene Violet. She led him by a couple of points in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``People appreciate a politician who is straight-shooting on
tough issues _ as long as the bad behavior was in your past,'' says
the director of the poll, Darrell West.

A VISIONARY AND A WINNER IN THE RACE OF LIFE

<P>
   The first time Grete Waitz met Fred Lebow, she did not like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1978,'' she recalled Thursday, ``I had been a world
cross-country champion and a world record-holder on the track. But
there were no distance runs in the Olympics, no pro track and no
opportunity to make a living in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to retire. But Fred had this New York City
Marathon and I thought maybe I could run in it if they paid my
expenses. When I called, the secretary asked me what my fastest
marathon time was. I said I had never run a marathon. She hung
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But she had written Waitz's name on a scrap of paper. When Fred
saw it, he knew who she was and invited the Norwegian to run in the
marathon. ``I flew in a couple of days before the race,'' Waitz
said. ``I got to the hotel in the middle of the night, and all I
wanted to do was sleep. He wanted me to come to Tavern on the Green
and meet sponsors. I didn't like him that much because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon liked him, and they became good friends. Limited sleep
or not, she won that first marathon in 2 hours 32 minutes 30
seconds, a world record. The next year, she won it again in
2:27:33, the first time a woman had bettered 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago Saturday, Lebow died at 62 after a four-year
battle with brain cancer. On Thursday, Waitz and Allan Steinfeld,
Lebow's right-hand man and successor, reminisced about the
visionary who, Waitz said, ``sort of invented the marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a memorial of death, but a celebration of life. At
the townhouse headquarters of the New York Road Runners Club on
East 89th Street (the street sign reads ``Fred Lebow Place''),
Waitz and Steinfeld told Lebow stories.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Fischel Lebowitz in Transylvania. He fled the Nazis
and then the Soviets, got to the United States and created a
successful garment-district business knocking off designer
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Steinfeld told how Lebow had given up recreational tennis for
running and had become the co-director of the first New York City
Marathon in 1970. That race, entirely in Central Park, drew 200
runners. With his creative genius, Lebow nurtured the marathon to
where it now encompasses the city's five boroughs and attracts
30,000 or so runners (plus 25,000 other applicants who can't get a
race number). As the president of the New York Road Runners Club
from 1972 to 1992, he also created the Women's Mini Marathon, Chase
Corporate Challenge, Fifth Avenue Mile, Empire State Building
Run-Up, New York Games and more.
</P>
<P>
   Every picture of him seems to have the smile of a man bursting
with ideas. Who else could persuade a bagel maker to sponsor an
annual race in Central Park, call it the Bagel Run and give the
runners a free bagel breakfast after the race?
</P>
<P>
   Except for the most formal occasions, such as Steinfeld's
wedding, Lebow dressed in a painter's cap, sweatsuit and racing
shoes. When he met King Olaf in Norway and President Ronald Reagan
in the White House, he wore a jacket, a tie and sneakers. In 1992,
his life ebbing, he wanted to run in his own marathon. Waitz, long
retired, returned and ran with him near the back of the pack. It
was rough going, Waitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we came in the park with three miles to go,'' she
said, ``it was like someone gave him energy. He was on home ground.
The number of people in the park waiting for us was amazing. At
that point, I knew we would make it. I was crying. He said, `Are
you hurting?' I said, `No, just realizing we're going to make it.'
He started crying, too. It was more than just running a race. It
was about life.''
</P>
<P>
   When that life ended, Lebow was buried in a cemetery in Queens.
At his gravesite was a marker used during his race. It said:
</P>
<P>
   FINISH
</P>
<P>
   26.2 MILES
</P>
<P>
   NYC MARATHON
</P>
<P>
   After his death, people flocked to the club headquarters to
write farewells in tribute books. Some of those tributes said:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Thanks for your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You gave my life a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Without you, there wouldn't be us.'' &QL;

FLEURY CAN PASS, TOO, IN THE STYLE OF GRETSKY 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theo Fleury is primarily known as a goal scorer. But
Friday night at Madison Square Garden, Fleury showed just how well
he can pass the puck, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury was so effective in the Rangers' 3-1 victory over the
Carolina Hurricanes _ their first triumph of the season _ that
Rangers Coach John Muckler had to restrain himself from comparing
Fleury to Wayne Gretzky, indisputably the greatest passer in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theo really sees the ice,'' Muckler said. ``He's really a
super passer. He did that in Calgary when he was playing against
Edmonton. Those little short passes he makes under pressure, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler was speaking after Fleury had scored his first goal in a
Rangers' uniform. And that came after Fleury had set up the first
two scores with beautiful feeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably don't know how good he passes the
puck,'' said center Petr Nedved, who figures to reap the benefits
of Fleury's passes all season.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury is a prolific scorer, but he is definitely not
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 40 goals last season. The diminutive 5-foot-6 right
wing has scored 40 or more goals four times in his career, which is
entering its 12th year. In 810 National Hockey League games, Fleury
has 375 goals.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has 482 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Fleury can pass the puck, too. It's just that
his passing ability is usually overshadowed by his scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes that's been the case,'' said Fleury, who
often was Calgary's only true scoring threat in his later years
with the Flames. ``But I'm playing with two shooters now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, however, those two shooters _ Nedved and Adam
Graves _had not scored a point. Friday night, the line broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury (a goal and two assists), Nedved (three assists) and
Graves (power-play goal plus an assist) combined for 8 points.
Nedved and Graves were good. Fleury was great.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear Rangers President Neil Smith heave a sigh
of relief.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, this was the Fleury that Smith spent $28
million for over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury admitted late Friday night he had been putting pressure
on himself to produce. Perhaps that was one reason he did not tally
a point in the Rangers' first three games. It also could have been
a reason why the Rangers went 0 for their first 15 on the power
play, while scoring a goal a game over their first three outings,
until they exploded for three goals (including one on the power
play) on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And Fleury had a hand in each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theo took a lot of pressure off himself playing the game he
played,'' Muckler said. ``He was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury was artistic, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a world-class player and a world-class talent,'' Graves
said. ``Those are things you can't teach. He can do basically
everything. When you're playing with him, you just try to give him
the puck and go to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fleury will usually find you, if he doesn't find the net
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does everything,'' Rangers Captain Brian Leetch said.
``That's the type of player he is. He's been one of the top five,
six or seven forwards in the league for a long time. And he
competes hard, too. He's got the elite skills.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Fleury was buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told you guys,'' Fleury said late Friday night. ``It
was just a matter of time.''

 CLEMENT MARKERT, 82, BIOLOGIST SUSPENDED IN McCARTHY ERA  
(bl) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Clement L. Markert, a noted developmental biologist whose
decision as a teen-ager to battle the forces of Generalissimo
Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War cast a cloud over his
career during the McCarthy era, died Oct. 1. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Markert died at a hospice near his home in Colorado Springs, his
wife, Margaret, said.
</P>
<P>
   Highly regarded by his peers in the scientific community, and a
former chairman of the biology department at Yale, Markert may be
best remembered, however, for a decision he made when he was 20 and
a year away from graduating from the University of Colorado in
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   He left school in 1937 with his roommate, rode freight trains
across the country and then, because the U.S. government was not
allowing travel to Spain, stowed away on a freighter bound for
Europe. He then made contact with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the
force of 2,800 American volunteers who tried unsuccessfully to
prevent Franco from toppling the democratically elected government
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markert, who met her future husband in school, said his
motives were that ``he was just a good citizen, anti-fascist.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 interview, Markert said, ``I felt the most concrete
thing I could do at the time was to destroy fascism, and Spain was
the battleground on which to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised around Pueblo, Colo., the young soldier was able to put
his mountain experience to use as a scout, often traveling behind
enemy lines, said a friend and Yale colleague, Dr. Sidney Altman, a
Nobel laureate in chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Markert, unlike his college roommate, lived to return from the
war, earning a bachelor's degree in Colorado in 1940 and a
doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1948. But he was never
able to put the war behind him fully.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Air Forces refused to accept him during World War II,
so he enlisted in the merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1954, the University of Michigan suspended him and two
colleagues from their teaching positions after they refused to
testify before a subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Markert was later reinstated; his colleagues were not. Although
the university refused in later years to apologize, in 1991 an
annual lecture series on intellectual freedom was named for the
three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is better,'' Markert said in a Detroit Free Press
interview at the time. ``This way, they'll have to think about and
squirm about it at least once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Markert, who was later named to the American Academy of
Sciences, went to Yale in the mid-1960s and served as chairman of
its biology department for two decades. He was credited with the
discovery of isozymes, enzymes that vary in form to allow the
development of different human organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing age 70, then the mandatory retirement age at Yale,
Markert resigned and took a position at North Carolina State
University.
</P>
<P>
   There he focused on animal husbandry research. After his
retirement, he and his wife returned to Colorado, where they had
long spent their summers.
</P>
<P>
   Markert is survived by three children: Alan, of Maine, and
Robert and Samantha Schreck Markert, both of California.
</P>
<P>
   Associates said Markert never lost his interest in politics over
the years or his commitment to what he believed was justice. But in
his 1986 interview, Markert said he had had to forgo his activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the conscious decision that I could not be both a
first-rate scientist and a social activist,'' he said.

WALTER BERGMAN, 100, CHAMPION OF CIVIL RIGHTS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Pa., Ill., Ala.)  (bl) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Bergman, an indefatigable civil rights advocate who
in 1961 was savagely beaten by members of the Ku Klux Klan in
Alabama as one of the first Freedom Riders and won compensation for
the attack from the FBI more than two decades later, died Sept. 29
in a nursing home in Grand Rapids, Mich., his wife said. He was
100.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a stroke 10 days after the beating and used a
wheelchair for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after an FBI informant had testified that the bureau
had ignored warnings of the impending attack, Bergman won a damage
suit against the federal government, though he was awarded only
$35,000 of the $2 million he had sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit righted the essential history of the period,'' said
Howard Simon, who was executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Michigan when the suit was tried. ``It proved
the federal government was not an ally of the civil rights worker,
but in fact was in league with local law enforcement and the KKK.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack and its aftermath were emblematic of a life lived at
the barricades of social activism. By profession an educator,
Bergman over the years took such controversial stands as declaring
in a public debate in 1935 that the New Deal was too timid in its
attack on poverty, and that the United Auto Workers was wrong to
bar officials from claiming their Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination when asked about communist leanings. He was a
founder of both the Michigan chapter of the ACLU and the Michigan
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, the State Department seized his passport while he was
teaching at the International People's College in Elsinore,
Denmark. His wife, Patricia, said the reason was a trip he had made
to the Soviet Union to study that country's educational system.
After protests by civil liberties groups and education
organizations, the passport was quickly restored.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, the son of a Swedish immigrant farmer, was the third of
three siblings born in Youngsville, Pa. He graduated from high
school at 15, and attended Greenville College in Greenville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted into the Army during World War I and served in
the Signal Corps, where he learned to fly. The war ended before he
could participate in combat, and he was sent to Germany to help
administer the Allied occupation. Seeing the devastation, he became
a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to a factory job in Youngsville, then began teaching
in Cherry Creek, N.Y. He moved to Detroit, where he taught high
school classes and worked nights at the University of Michigan to
earn a master's degree and then a doctorate in education. He rose
to research director of the Detroit school system and taught
education at the system's universities, which were later merged
into Wayne State University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he received conscientious objector status,
but later enlisted to participate in what he had come to believe
was a moral war against Hitler. He participated in the Normandy
landing. After the war he stayed on in Germany to work with the
United Nations helping refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On his return home, he continued working for the Detroit schools
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued to act on social and political beliefs. He was
the first white to join a black Unitarian church, which then
gradually became integrated. He formed a pacifist American Legion
post.
</P>
<P>
   When the Congress of Racial Equality began its Freedom Rides,
with blacks and whites riding buses through the South to test the
efficacy of a Supreme Court ruling that desegregated interstate
transportation, he joined up. He and his first wife, Frances, were
two of three whites in the first group of 14 to travel to the
South, Simon said. Both were brutally attacked as the bus was
parked in Anniston, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Bergman suffered a severe stroke. He
retained most of his speech, but had to learn to write and feed
himself again. He never regained the ability to walk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Gary Thomas Rowe, an undercover informer for the FBI
who joined the Klan, testified before the Senate Intelligence
Committee that he had told the bureau about the planned attack on
the Freedom Riders but that it had done nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   While testifying, Rowe wore a cotton hood that resembled a Klan
headpiece without the point to protect his identity. He died in
1998, his death initially reported under another name.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, now the ACLU's executive director in Florida, said Rowe's
testimony prompted Bergman to sue the FBI, and he won in 1983.
After ruling in Bergman's favor, Judge Richard Enslen of U.S.
District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich., limited his award to $35,000
because his condition might have resulted in part from an
appendectomy he had four months after the beating.
</P>
<P>
   The estate of Frances Simon, who had died in 1979, was awarded
$15,000. All proceeds were donated to the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman remained active in social causes until he entered the
nursing home less than two years ago, said his second wife, who, as
Patricia Verdier, met him and his first wife at a peace
demonstration in 1970. They were married in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   From his first marriage, Bergman has two surviving daughters,
Margaret Dickson of Detroit and Barbara Boyd of Galesburg, Ill., as
well as 10 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and two
great-great grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Years after he was beaten by klansmen, Bergman revisited the
Anniston bus station. He noticed four nail holes that had once been
used to hold a sign segregating two drinking fountains; now both
black and white people were drinking freely from the fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a part in pulling out those nails,'' he said.

 &HT;    Supporters say Bush's record rosy; critics
 &HT;    find many gaps
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush's critics like to say he has a habit
of jumping in front of a parade as it nears the reviewing stand.
</P>
<P>
   His friends say he is a natural consensus builder, unusually
adept at giving people what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, supporters and detractors agree that the Texas
governor has not been a trailblazer, but rather a cautious steward
who has picked his fights carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is only now beginning to lay out specific proposals for
what he would do as president. Last week, for the second straight
week, Bush spiced his campaign speeches with criticism of
Republicans in Congress for lacking compassion. The tactic has
puzzled some Republicans since so many members of Congress support
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate's willingness, even eagerness, to separate
himself from other leaders of his party should be no surprise. It
illustrates the way he has governed Texas for the last five years.
Bush has generally avoided pitched battles with the
Democratic-controlled Texas Senate, sometimes parting ways with his
own party. He also has found ways to salvage public relations
victories from legislative defeats, most notably on a failed tax
plan in 1997, and made the most of changes that were under way
before he took office, particularly in the areas of education and
criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown remarkable shrewdness for a political newcomer,''
said Elspeth Rostow, former dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of
Public Affairs at the University of Texas. ``It hasn't yielded any
tremendous policy breakthroughs. It's more that he has taken
advantage of things already under way.'' Things like the booming
Texas economy, the billions of dollars in state budget surplus,
decreasing crime and an improving educational performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters look at this rosy picture and conclude he is
doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   His critics look at the same set of facts and lament that, even
in flush economic times, Texas remains on the bottom rung in many
measures of education, the quality of its environment and he
availability of health care for children. They see in Bush's tenure
as governor a bushel of missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But a Texas governor's ability to act on such opportunities is
restricted because the office lacks many of the formal powers that
are given to governors in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for the state's budget, for example, rests
primarily with the Legislature. Bush also has no appointed Cabinet
and does not name judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technically a weak governor system, which means the
governor has to pull strings to get things done,'' Rostow said.
``That includes extending his right hand in fellowship to the
Democratic side.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tended to sketch broad themes _ changing welfare,
improving education, limiting awards in civil lawsuits, overhauling
the juvenile justice system _ while leaving the details to others.
Here's a look at Bush's record on a number of key issues that are
likely to arise in his campaign for president:
</P>
<P>
   TAXES
</P>
<P>
   In campaign speeches, Bush claims credit for the two largest tax
cuts in Texas history _ nearly $3 billion worththat he says he
``fought for and signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie James, director of the Southwest Regional Consumers
Union, said the reductions provided ``illusory benefits for the
masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anti-tax groups complain that a $1 billion property tax
cut in 1997 was all but eliminated when local authorities increased
property appraisals and tax rates in response. A recent study found
a similar trend after this year's tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics say that the tax cut disappeared, and maybe taxes
went up for some people,'' said Jim Oliver, Bush's former budget
adviser. ``But without him, they would have been even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's cuts included more property tax relief, some sales
tax reductions and a research and development credit for business.
</P>
<P>
   His boldest legislative proposal was killed by his own party. In
1997 he pushed a measure to shift the financing of public schools
away from local property taxes. That would have lowered property
taxes, but the state sales tax would have risen. Doctors, lawyers,
architects, consultants and other service providers would have
faced a new business tax.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opposition killed the plan, and lawmakers gave the
governor the $1 billion property tax cut instead. James credits
Bush for raising the right question in 1997: Was the allocation of
state taxes fair?
</P>
<P>
   But he faults Bush for taking a politically tepid stand this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have surpluses forever,'' James said, ``and
he passed up the chance to set up a rainy day fund or to do
something about what we know will drive costs in future years _ our
aging population and our increasing school population.''
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Scores on standardized tests for elementary school students have
taken a leap forward during Bush's administration. This is
especially true of African-American and Hispanic children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backed tougher standards in math, English and science in
1995, his first legislative session. Demonstrating bipartisan
appeal, he signed the bill in a Democratic lawmaker's district.
</P>
<P>
   The governor this year signed a Democratic-backed $3,000 pay
raise for public school teachers and won approval of a plan to end
so-called social promotion, the practice of advancing
schoolchildren to the next grade regardless of their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves credit for signing (the salary increase). He could
have vetoed it,'' said John Cole, president of the Texas Federation
of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Texas' public schools are among the worst. They ranked
46th in SAT scores in 1999; and dropout rates, while in decline the
past 10 years, are still distressingly high among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Cole and others point out that Bush also is taking credit for
educational reformsdevised under his predecessors, including
setting academic standards and establishing regular testing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also supports vouchers, which would give public money to
parents to pay for their children's private education.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush could not persuade the Legislature to go along with his
proposal this year. ``I said, `Let's try it in Texas. Let's just
see if it works,''' the governor said. ``I tried to tie it to an
accountability system.''
</P>
<P>
   While the opposition was mainly Democrats, social conservatives
objected to some provisions of the voucher proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagle Forum, a conservative family group, opposed what it
considers onerous state requirements, including the testing of
voucher recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``His bill would have taken away the freedoms of a private
school,'' said Cathie Adams, director of the Eagle Forum in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents and some civil libertarians cringe when
they talk about Bush's record, which includes lowering the age at
which children may be tried as adults and sending an increasing
number of convicts to their deaths. The governor also vetoed a
bill, passed without dissent by Texas lawmakers, that would have
guaranteed a lawyer for indigent defendants within 20 days of their
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas Senate passed legislation to bar the execution of
mentally retarded prisoners, Bush announced his opposition and said
juries should retain that decision-making authority. The bill died
in the state House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's law and order approach has been extremely popular, and he
has signed 100 death warrants. Explaining his support for the death
penalty, Bush invokes compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty because I think it prevents people
from killing people,'' he said recently in Georgia. ``That's
compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrington, executive director of the Texas Civil Rights
Project, said the governor has done nothing to ensure the death
penalty is administered fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the whole issue of DNA testing, what you need is time _
and he doesn't give anybody time at all,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I review every case,'' Bush countered. ``I always ask if there
are any outstanding appeals. I always ask if the courts have vetted
all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He has commuted one death sentence (when the evidence suggested
the convicted killer was in another state), and he allowed Karla
Faye Tucker, a pickax murderer who became an evangelical Christian
in prison, to die, despite the protests of Christian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The crime rate has dropped during his administration, although
not as quickly as the national crime rate. More prisoners are in
Texas prison facilities, and the governor has claimed a share of
the credit.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate of crime fell more steeply in Texas during the
administration of Democrat Ann Richards, whom Bush defeated in
1994. The bulk of new prison construction had begun and criminal
penalties for many violent crimes had been strengthened before Bush
took office.
</P>
<P>
   The parole rate also dropped sharply under Richards.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The recent killings in a Texas church refocused attention on
Bush's opposition to most gun control measures. (Bush has more
recently endorsed a national instant background check for sales at
gun shows.)
</P>
<P>
   He signed a bill, over objections of many Texas police chiefs,
allowing Texans with permits to carry concealed weapons. ``I don't
imagine that any governor could have gone against the Legislature
on concealed weapons,'' Rostow said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he outlawed lawsuits by local governments against gun
manufacturers _ although no Texas municipality was known to be
considering such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   Bush comes under attack from both sides on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He incurred the wrath of anti-abortion leaders this year when he
declared that abortion would not be a litmus test in his choice for
vice presidential running mate or judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   Along with most other Republican presidential candidates, he has
sought to play down the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
has tried to remind voters in key primary states that Bush has a
long record of opposing abortion rights, noting 16 measures he has
signed as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he signed a bill requiring that parents be
notified before minor children have abortions. The bill also
requires a 48-hour waiting period for young women.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagle Forum's Adams said Bush ``has been very quiet'' on
abortion. ``He should be saying, `I am going to defend innocent
life,''' she said. ``Everything short of that is appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   Texas' industries emit more toxic pollutants than those of any
other state. The state's pollution has worsened through the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent campaign trip in New Hampshire, Bush proclaimed,
``I'm for clean air and clean water and have a record in Texas to
prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many environmental activists are skeptical, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a poor record,'' said Tom Smith, director of
the Texas chapter of Public Citizen. ``He had the opportunity to
hit a home run in environmental protection, and instead he got to
first base.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed two bills into law this year dealing with emissions
from utilities and other industrial plants that were exempted from
the state's anti-pollution laws.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than force the companies that own older facilities to
reduce their emissions, Bush supported a voluntary program.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hammond, chairman of the Texas Association of Business and
Chambers of Commerce, praised Bush for achieving a balance between
``a clean environment, which we all want, and jobs. If it had been
more draconian, Texas definitely would have lost jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said the proposal that became law essentially was
written by industry. Worse, he and other environmentalists say,
Bush let several years pass before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   The other measure Bush signed, adopted as part of a law that
deregulates electric utilities, requires older electric plants to
cut emissions by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also had been for voluntary compliance and accepted the
tougher language only after House Democrats insisted on it.
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Bush never took a position on a hate crimes bill spawned by the
case of James Byrd Jr., a black Texan dragged to his death behind a
pickup truck in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The bill never made it out of the Legislature, sparing Bush from
having to make a decision on a sensitive issue just before he began
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a bill guaranteeing admission into a state college or
university for the top 10 percent of high school graduates from
every Texas school, regardless of race or ethnicity. Supporters of
minority preferences devised the plan in response to challenges to
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   On one matter, even Bush's critics credit him with standing
tall: ``When a lot of Republicans were engaging in immigrant
bashing, I was really proud of George Bush when he stood up and
said, `That's not how we play the game,''' said James of the
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   Texas' managed care reform of 1997 is serving as a model for
bipartisan legislation under consideration in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides touted that recently when President Clinton mocked
Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' as being light on compassion
and heavy on conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush didn't support a major reform _ allowing Texans to sue
HMOs. He allowed it to become law without his signature, having
vetoed a managed care bill two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There have been just a handful of lawsuits so far, said Kim
Ross, a lobbyist with the Texas Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was in the position where he had supported tort reform,
so he felt he couldn't sign a bill that created a new class of
lawsuits,'' Ross said. ``To his credit, he allowed it to become law
and said he would be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   On children's health care, lawmakers decided Bush was too stingy
when he proposed an insurance plan that set eligibility at a
maximum of 150 percent of the poverty line. Critics said his plan
would have ignored 200,000 children. Legislators set the limit at
200 percent of the poverty line.

ROBERT G.L. WAITE, 80, HISTORIAN WHO FOCUSED ON HITLER'S PSYCHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Manitoba, Minn.)  (bl) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert G.L. Waite, a Williams College historian who set off
a debate by bringing the psychoanalytic approach to books about
Hitler, died Oct. 4 while visiting his son Peter in Glastonbury,
Conn. He was 80 and lived in Williamstown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Waite was one of the earliest and strongest proponents of
analyzing events in Hitler's early life in Freudian terms to
explain his behavior as fuehrer.
</P>
<P>
   In his most influential book, ``The Psychopathic God: Adolf
Hitler'' (Basic Books, 1977), Waite took ``the psychological thing
to its limits,'' said Ron Rosenbaum, whose book, ``Explaining
Hitler: The Search for the Origin of his Evil,'' was published last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum said he and other authors had criticized Waite for
undervaluing external influences, including European history,
Christian anti-Semitism and ideology, in explaining Hitler. But he
said the psychological approach had now been at least partly
incorporated in the work of many historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waite's contribution is important, even if you, as I do,
disagree,'' he said. ``Hitler's psyche is certainly not without
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, a leading student of the psychological
dimensions of history, said some evidence presented and analyzed by
Waite, including claims about Hitler's sexual preferences and a now
much-debated autopsy report that he had one testicle, now seemed
shaky. But he said Waite had nonetheless made a significant
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did something important in trying to collect everything he
could about Hitler's psychological behavior and pulling it together
in a single study,'' said Lifton, who is a professor of psychiatry
and psychology at John Jay College and the Graduate Center of the
City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Waite was born on Feb. 18, 1919, in Manitoba, the son of a
United Church of Canada minister, and spent his youth moving among
small parishes that often paid his father in kind rather than in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Macalester College in St. Paul on a scholarship and
graduated in 1941. He served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945,
attaining the rank of corporal, and earned his Ph.D. in history
from Harvard in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Waite then joined the faculty of Williams, in Williamstown,
Mass. He conducted research in Germany as a Guggenheim Fellow in
1953 and wrote a number of biographies for the World Book
Encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote ``Vanguard of Nazism,'' 1952; ``Kaiser and Fuhrer:
A Comparative Study of Personality and Politics,'' 1998, and his
memoirs, ``Hitler, the Kaiser and Me,'' which was released in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Waite retired from teaching in 1988, but with his bushy beard
and array of dramatic hats remained a colorful figure on campus as
he was led about by Duncan, his West Highland terrier.
</P>
<P>
   A dedicated needlepoint embroiderer, he often did needlework
while attending lectures and meetings, including the annual Town
Meeting. He served as moderator and deacon of the First
Congregational Church in Williamstown, developing a reputation for
spirited sermons.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Alice, died in 1991. In addition to Peter, he is
survived by another son, Geoffrey of Ithaca, N.Y., and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   In his work on Hitler, Waite relied heavily on a study by Walter
C. Langer done for U.S. intelligence officials in World War II. His
goal was to take this important study to deeper levels. Hitler, he
said, ``was a human phenomenon which the historian must seek to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waite never contended that so-called psychohistory provided
a full explanation, much less the only one. ``I believe that the
career of Adolf Hitler raises questions that can be answered
neither by psychology nor by history working alone,'' he said in a
1977 interview.

 &HT;    Alabama vote on lotter will test slipping Christian clout
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Christian clout in Alabama ain't what it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Gov. Fob James was ousted 11 months ago, a bill that
would have expanded Sunday alcohol sales snuck through the
Legislature this year, and, after a decade of waiting, voters
finally will get a chance to approve a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've lost a great deal with the Legislature this time
from a church perspective or a religious perspective. If we hadn't,
this wouldn't even be on the ballot,'' said Joe Bob Mizzell,
director of Christian ethics for the Alabama Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For the state's Christian soldiers, the next battle is Tuesday.
The fight is over Amendment 1, a proposed change to Alabama's 1901
constitution. If approved, the referendum would authorize a
Georgia-style education lottery that would pay for HOPE
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Christian group in the state, the Alabama Baptist
Convention, claims 3,100 churches and 1.1 million members. With
help from other denominations, the socially conservative Baptist
group has helped closed the gap on lottery advocates.
</P>
<P>
   One poll puts lottery support at just 51 percent after years of
riding support at higher rates. Another poll puts support at 54
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But just like in 1992 _ when Georgia churches narrowed the lead
of lottery supporters _ the surge may be too little, too late. As
in Georgia, where Christian conservatives failed to elect
Republican Guy Millner over Democrat Roy Barnes as governor last
year, Alabama's religious right is behind in rallying votes for
lottery opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be an indication of Alabama's movement to more of a
secular state,'' said William Stewart, a political scientist at the
University of Alabama. ``People aren't taking the lead from their
Protestant church leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving around Tuscaloosa, Stewart sees church marquee after
marquee deriding the lottery. But gone are the days, he said, when
Alabama preachers would make pronouncements and the flock would
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Baptists on the rolls, but they're not
taking their cues from the religious leaders,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery opponents claim momentum on the strength of a University
of South Alabama poll taken in September that shows 51 percent of
likely voters favor the amendment. In August, the same poll showed
61 percent favored the measure. But pollster Keith Nicholls said
support actually may be higher because opponents are framing
gambling as immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be more of a social desirability issue than a
political issue,'' Nicholls said. ``You may favor the lottery, but
you're not going to tell that to someone on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition of Alabama had planned to distribute
thousands of anti-lottery voters guides this weekend. But rather
than subject itself to a state law that requires groups spending
more than $1,000 on an election to disclose contributors, the
Christian Coalition backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks in the churches know where we stand,'' said John Giles,
president of the Alabama Christian Coalition and a former candidate
for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Don Siegelman, the Democrat who ousted James in November,
ran almost exclusively on the issue of creating a state lottery
modeled after the Georgia lottery. Since 1993, Alabama residents
have spent more than $400 million on Georgia's lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama has one of the country's lowest tax burdens and one of
the most underfunded school systems. The state is surrounded by
lotteries in Georgia, Florida and Louisiana along with casinos in
Mississippi and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman projects a state lottery would churn out $150 million
a year for college scholarships, a pre-kindergarten program and
school computers. As in Georgia, HOPE scholarships would pay for
tuition at state schools.
</P>
<P>
   The majority-black electorate in Birmingham could help pass the
lottery the same way it swept Siegelman into office. In November,
nine of every 10 black voters cast ballots for Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   Though black politicians aggressively are backing the lottery,
the black clergy opposes the amendment, Mizzell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fearful that a lot of ministers are not talking about it
or their congregation is not listening to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like easy money to raise revenue for issues they care
about,'' said Phillip Cook, a Duke University economist whose
lottery research was incorporated into the National Gambling Impact
Study Commission report, which urged curbs on gaming. ``Some people
are reluctant to raise taxes unless the lottery option has been
explored.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire started the nation's first lottery in 1964. Today,
37 states and the District of Columbia operate lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, South Carolina voters get their chance at a lottery
referendum. State legislatures in North Carolina and Tennessee have
debated the issue and are watching the Alabama vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly believe there's enough revenue to go around,''
said David Gale, executive director of the North American
Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. ``You can see that
in areas where there are adjoining states with lotteries.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, 11 contiguous states operate profitable games.
</P>
<P>
   In the South from Texas to Virginia, money still gushes into
lotteries _ but slower than before. Over the past six years, sales
have flattened or declined in five of six Southern lotteries. Only
Georgia's ticket sales have increased every year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a social cost, say Alabama ministers, who will be
pushing an anti-lottery message from their pulpits this weekend.
Poor people will gamble their food money. An already regressive tax
system in the state will get even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even the socially moderate United Methodist Church has joined
the anti-lottery crusade. Rev. Bill Morgan, the district
superintendent who supervises 50 of North Alabama's largest
churches, said there are those in his congregations who will vote
for the lottery ``knowing it's not a good thing'' socially but
perhaps the only way to raise cash for higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a historical reluctance to raise taxes for anything,''
he said. ``Methodists who vote for it will be saying it's the
lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   But only 15 percent of state voters consider the lottery immoral
or sinful, which works against religious-based opponents, said
Gerald Johnson, pollster for the Alabama Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is an uphill struggle to oppose the education
lottery in Alabama,'' Morgan said.

SIR NIGEL BROACKES, 65, BRITISH ENTREPRENEUR AND DEVELOPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sir Nigel Broackes, a real estate developer who
controlled the Ritz Hotel in London as chairman of Trafalgar House
and was one of Britain's most successful young entrepreneurs during
the 1960s and '70s, died Sept. 28. He was 65 and lived in
Oxfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives described the cause of death only as a short
illness.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 24, Broackes, the son of a Russian lawyer who died
when Nigel was 8, became the managing director of Trafalgar House,
a small holding company that at the time had little more than an
assortment of investment properties.
</P>
<P>
   But Broackes, depicted in the company's prospectus as ``almost
29'' when Trafalgar House first sold shares of the company to the
public in 1963, had grand ambitions. In short order, he managed to
acquire several construction and engineering companies, giving him
a reputation as a shrewd businessman and spirited entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Broackes brought in Victor Mathews, who would later
become instrumental in turning Trafalgar House into a well-known
diversified conglomerate. By age 35, Broackes had become the
chairman of Trafalgar House and with the advice of Mathews began
acquiring some of Britain's most prized properties. In 1975,
Broackes bought the Ritz Hotel in central London for 2.7 million
pounds. He also bought the Cunard shipping fleet, giving him
control of the QE2.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Broackes made a bid for the troubled Beaverbrook
Newspaper group, which owned some of Britain's most well-read
newspapers: The Daily Express, The Sunday Express and The Evening
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   The move to buy the newspaper company was the brainchild of
Mathews, who became chief executive of Trafalgar House and was 14
years older than Broackes. While Mathews was instrumental in the
company's growth, the relationship between Broackes and Mathews
soon became strained.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Broackes published an autobiography in 1981 with
critical references to Mathews, the newspaper interests were spun
off and Mathews left Trafalgar House to head them.
</P>
<P>
   However, his departure also signaled the beginning of a downturn
for Trafalgar House. Broackes made an unsuccessful and embarrassing
hostile takeover bid for Peninsular &AMP; Oriental Steam Navigation
Co., the British cruise-line operator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Broackes became the chairman of London Docklands
Development Corp. redeveloping the Docklands area, which had become
run-down after the docks were closed. He then gave up active
management of Trafalgar House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Broackes returned to Trafalgar House, but the company
had already lost focus and had begun a steady decline. By 1992 the
company reported pretax losses of 30.3 million pounds. Toward the
end of the 1980s the company had been embarrassed by reports of
eccentric accounting practices. Broackes was forced into early
retirement in 1992 when Hong Kong Land bought 15 percent of
Trafalgar House as part of a reorganization of the management.
Trafalgar House has subsequently been acquired by Kvaerner.
</P>
<P>
   Broackes was knighted in 1984 for his work redeveloping the
Docklands.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Joyce, died in 1993. He is survived by two sons,
Justin and Simon, and a daughter, Vicky.

COMMON PERCEPTION: THE MAYOR WILL GET YOU FOR THAT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 BY BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before New York's major cultural institutions came
out against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's attack on the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, museum directors fretted that the mayor would get angry at
them and then he would get even.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor tends to take those who disagree with him as enemies
to be punished,'' Martin McLaughlin, a lobbyist for the cultural
institutions, wrote in an e-mail circulated among museum directors.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, New Yorkers traveling by subway last weekend to the
Brooklyn Museum to see ``Sensation,'' the exhibition that is the
object of Giuliani's ire, believed they were targets of mayoral
punishment. They complained that train service was suspended as
part of a City Hall plot to torpedo the exhibition. Subway repairs,
however, had been scheduled for months by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which the mayor does not directly
control.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia over the Brooklyn Museum is a reminder that after
nearly six years in office, Giuliani's reputation for retribution
has grown to near-mythic proportions, triggering tremulous
hand-wringing among those who contemplate crossing him and
convincing many New Yorkers that he is out to get them, even when
he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to run a city? Does Giuliani possess a tactical
genius that finally makes America's largest city governable or does
he suffer from a tragic flaw that may one day bring him down?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would not comment last week on these questions, but he
has said in the past that he ``does not really care'' whether New
Yorkers like him, so long as they perceive that the city is
becoming a better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people whose livelihoods depend on City Hall say they
are growing weary of the mayor's get-even act, even as they concede
that New York is safer, cleaner and more livable than it was before
Giuliani was elected. These grumblers, who, out of fear, demand
anonymity, include builders, directors of nonprofit agencies and
business leaders of nearly every stripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimidation is his full-time operating style,'' said a
prominent businessman who says he likes the mayor and raises money
for him, but is afraid to be even mildly critical of him in public.
</P>
<P>
   The self-appointed spokesman for this cowed and cowering camp is
former Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat who says he twice voted for
Giuliani, a Republican, but has since come to regard the mayor as a
bully.
</P>
<P>
   Koch feels so strongly about what he calls the mayor's
``despotic'' qualities that this year he wrote a book, ``Giuliani,
Nasty Man,'' to explain his contention that the mayor's penchant
for ``disemboweling'' his opponents is approaching the point of
``Greek tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His nastiness is causing his self-destruction,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, though, the mayor is not self-destructing.
Polls over the past several years have found that Giuliani's
aggressive style is a key to his political appeal. Although a
recent poll in the Daily News said most New Yorkers did not support
Giuliani's threats to cut city funds for the Brooklyn Museum, the
mayor generally remains popular, and his political advisers have
said that his position on the museum is good politics because it
shows resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In his presumed campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the
U.S. Senate, his advisers have said, Giuliani's tough leadership
skills will be a central part of his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of his governing style, specialists in New
York City history generally agree that Giuliani has outdone all his
recent predecessors when it comes to striking fear into the hearts
of those who do business with City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   No other New York mayor since World War II has ``terrified'' so
many New Yorkers in so many walks of life, said Mike Wallace, a
professor of history at John Jay College and co-author of
``Gotham'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), a Pulitzer
Prize-winning history of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He casts his net so broadly,'' Wallace said. ``I don't think
it is fair to characterize it as personal vindictiveness. What he
is doing is very interesting from a historical point of view.
Machiavelli said it is better for a leader to be feared than loved.
I think he intends for people to be scared because he thinks that
this is one way to achieve the social order that is beneficial for
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over 60 years of New York mayors, Wallace said that
Fiorello La Guardia, whom Giuliani has often called his role model,
was probably the only individual who could fairly be described as a
``holy terror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But La Guardia tended to punish only people inside his
administration,'' Wallace said. ``He kept score as most politicians
do, but nothing on the order of Mr. Giuliani.''

 NEW YORK: ... Mr. Giuliani.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace said that Koch also was known to hold political grudges,
but not to the extent of ``casting a pall of concern'' across the
city, which, he said, Giuliani has done.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist
Church and a leader in Harlem, said he is ``one of those who have
crossed the mayor and suffered the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Butts called Giuliani a ``racist'' whose
policies were moving the city toward ``a fascist state.'' The
minister has since retreated from those remarks and made peace with
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the minister's words infuriated Giuliani and
triggered 18 months of City Hall delays at a commercial development
on 125th Street, which is being built, in part, by Butts'
Abyssinian Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was instant, naked retaliation,'' said a state official
familiar with the project. ``Without question, it is the way City
Hall works.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has said it delayed the project out of concern for
smaller retailers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of good will in many businesses and agencies are afraid
to speak their mind,'' Butts said. ``That is not the kind of
climate in which people should have to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear of Giuliani's bite is so pervasive that in many cases he
doesn't even have to bark to keep his critics silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a self-fulfilling prophecy at work here,'' said
Raymond D. Horton, a professor at Columbia University Business
School and the former president of the Citizen's Budget Commission,
an independent watchdog agency that, under Horton's watch,
infuriated the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent retaliation for years of criticism, the mayor's
office tried in 1997 to undermine Horton's agency by urging
investment bankers not to buy tickets for a fund-raising dinner
that accounted for nearly a third of the commission's annual
budget. Instead of caving in to pressure, Horton said, he chose to
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our case, it turned out to be a public relations disaster
for the mayor,'' Horton said. ``We wound up with more donations,
rather than less, and the mayor came out looking like a
troglodyte.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people opt for silent tolerance rather than public
confrontation with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the city's cultural institutions, many of which
are in city-owned buildings or depend on city money for daily
operations, several museum directors said privately that they took
so long to criticize the mayor because they were afraid he would
punish them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the fear and intimidation that is out there
because this is an administration that engages in retribution
constantly,'' said Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn
Democrat who last year sponsored a homeless shelter bill that the
mayor did not like. In retaliation, Giuliani threatened to _ but
ultimately did not _ put a homeless shelter in DiBrienza's
district.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mayor's most ardent supporters, business leaders who
say that his achievements in reducing crime and cleaning up the
city are historically significant, are often just as afraid of him
as his harshest critics.
</P>
<P>
   One businessman said developers were afraid to speak ill of the
mayor, even privately, for fear that word would get back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the director of a private nonprofit agency that
depends on the city said that she and dozens of her peers have
concluded that the only way to protect the poor people they serve
is to never say anything in public that the mayor might not like.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of evidence, however, that the mayor's
fear-inducing manner continues to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, Giuliani used threats to force the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to adopt a plan to spend $645
million to build a subway link to La Guardia Airport. The mayor
threatened to hold up approval of the entire 5-year capital plan
for the transit authority in the New York region unless the subway
extension was included, said Jeff Zupan, a transportation analyst
for the Regional Plan Authority, a nonprofit planning group.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being insistent, he has gotten his way,'' Zupan said.

CLINTON FAULTS SENATE OVER HISPANIC JUDICIAL NOMINEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Calif., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton told a national Hispanic group
Saturday that the Senate was a black hole of delay, unwilling to
vote for his Hispanic nominees for federal judgeships but afraid to
vote against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't know about you, but if I took three-and-a-half
years to make a decision, you wouldn't think I was a very good
president,'' Clinton said. ``How many times has somebody been on
you because you took three-and-a-half hours?''
</P>
<P>
   The president was warmly received Saturday morning at the annual
conference of the Hispanic Leadership Institute, a nonpartisan
organization that promotes voter registration and training of
Hispanic officials.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his administration credit for a growing economy, and
cited information released last week that shows that household
incomes of Hispanics are growing faster than those of other
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But he devoted much of his address to the judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was not an isolated incident last week when the
Senate rejected his nominee for the federal bench in Missouri, an
African-American, after the seat had been empty for two years. The
Senate on Tuesday voted 54-45 against Justice Ronnie White of the
Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they have approved hundreds of Clinton nominees,
including two on the day that White was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of White was rejected, Republicans claimed,
because the Missourian had an extremely pro-criminal record in
hearing appeals of death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   The president criticized the rejection of White as ``a
disgraceful act of partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many Republicans said they were not aware of White's
race when they voted against him, the White House, in its reaction
to the vote, emphasized what it called unfair treatment of minority
nomiees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued that theme Saturday, turning the focus on
Hispanic judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just disappear somewhere in the dark recesses of the
calendar of the Senate,'' Clinton said. ``Why? Well, they don't
want to vote him down because they hope that you will vote with
them in the next election, but they don't want to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Senate was dragging its feet on the nominations of
Richard Paez of California, the first Mexican American to serve on
the federal bench in Los Angeles, for a vacancy on the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals; Marsha Berzon, an appellate lawyer, also
in the 9th Circuit; Judge Julio Fuentes in the 3rd Circuit; Enrique
Moreno, a lawyer, in the 5th Circuit, and Judge Ronald Guzman for
the Northern District of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I think the treatment of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon is
shameless,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to announce that Judge Guzman finally received
his Judiciary Committee hearing last week for a vacancy here,'' the
president said. ``But the Senate's treatment of Judge White and its
failure to vote on the outstanding Hispanic nominees that are
pending creates a real doubt'' about the Senate's willingness to
perform its ``constitutional duties to advise and consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are the fastest-growing group when it comes to voting,
according to a study released here by the Leadership Institute.
From 1976 to 1996, Latinos increased their voter registration by
164 percent, compared with 31 percent for the nation. In votes
cast, Latinos have increased to 5 million in the 1996 presidential
election, up from 2 million in the 1976 election. The number of
Hispanic elected officials has not risen so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted an administration that looks like
America,'' the president said. ``You've heard me say that a dozen
times, I bet. More and more, America will look like you.''

 &HT;    NFL realignment will result in both winners and losers
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After more than 18 months of debate, the NFL announced
this week that professional football would return to Houston. NFL
owners also passed a resolution to realign the league into eight
divisions of four teams each, when the Houston team begins play in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year-and-a-half, NFL owners will be jockeying for
position, hoping to stay in their current divisions to maintain
long-standing rivalries and sellouts. Houston will play in the AFC,
which means that one existing AFC team will be forced to move to
the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be in for a big fight on realignment,'' said
Buffalo's Ralph Wilson, an original American Football League owner.
``Agreeing on realignment might be tougher than deciding to expand
to Houston or Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The realignment plan will be completed by May 2001. The NFL
still will be split into an AFC and an NFC, and 12 teams still will
make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario has each team playing 16 games _ six in
its own division, four against other teams from its conference,
four from one division in the other conference and two wild-card
games.
</P>
<P>
   Realignment won't get done without a long, nasty battle. Here's
an early look at the possible winners and losers:
</P>
<P>
   WINNERS
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers: Team president Dan Rooney says he has been
assured by the NFL that rival Cleveland will remain in the
Steelers' division. Cincinnati and Baltimore also could join
Pittsburgh in the AFC Central, which would be the league's weakest
division this season. The Steelers also will go from five division
opponents to three, leaving more room for variety in its schedule.
   Atlanta Falcons: The Falcons' only true rivalry has been with
the Saints. One proposal has Tampa Bay and Carolina joining Atlanta
and New Orleans in a new division. The teams' close proximity to
each other would create some interesting matchups, and the Falcons
wouldn't have to play San Franciso two games per season. Atlanta
has lost 23 of its past 30 regular-season games against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Buccaneers: By joining a new division, Tampa Bay would
leave the rugged NFC Central. The Bucs haven't won in Green Bay
since 1989, and they would avoid those frigid trips to Lambeau
Field and Chicago's Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Seahawks: The Seahawks will have a new stadium in 2002
and possibly a new NFL address. Seattle is the popular pick to
switch conferences, as it doesn't have a natural rival in the AFC
West. The Seahawks could join the NFC West, and a Seattle/San
Franciso series would be an intriguing rivalry. Seahawks coach Mike
Holmgren loves to beat the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   LOSERS
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams: The NFL wasn't happy in 1995 when the Rams left
Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest television market. As
punishment, the Rams didn't receive their cuts from the past two
franchise fees, which owners usually share equally. St. Louis lost
$17 million when Cleveland joined the league and $23 million when
Houston was awarded a team. Another condition in the Rams' move to
St. Louis was that the team would have no vote in future
realignment. Now, the NFL can put the Rams in any division, but St.
Louis probably will stay in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Cardinals: The Cardinals probably are headed to the NFC
West, with San Francisco, St. Louis and possibly Seattle, which
would be the one franchise switching conferences. Arizona owner
Bill Bidwell doesn't want to leave the NFC East and lose a
guaranteed sellout for the Dallas game each year. It might take
millions of dollars to persuade him to switch, but Bidwell doesn't
have much leverage after he pulled his team out of St. Louis.

LAYOFF OVER, ISLES WILL LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight days between games in the National Hockey League can be
either good or bad. The Islanders will find out Sunday whether they
benefited or were harmed by that long a layoff when they play their
home opener against the Colorado Avalanche at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The layoff between the first and second games on their
regular-season schedule provided the Islanders with plenty of time
to fix the things they got wrong in a 4-2 loss to the Tampa Bay
Lightning last Saturday. Practice they did, skating through drills,
working on the power play and learning new systems for two hours
each day.
</P>
<P>
   But, as some players complained, the layoff was just enough time
for the team to lose any momentum it may have had entering the
season. They are not in the regular-season groove they should be in
for the season's second week, and the butterflies that should have
vanished by now will be fluttering in full force on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited three weeks for the season to start,'' Islanders
Coach Butch Goring said after practice on Friday. ``Now we've
played one game and we've had to wait again. It's felt like an
eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran defenseman Rich Pilon said: ``We're very anxious to
play a game. It was good to get some more practice, but now it's
time to get in a groove, get into the normal rhythm of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some coaches, who may change their lines as often as
every shift during the early part of the season, Goring seems
satisfied with the forward lines and defensive pairings he
assembled during camp. Even after losing the season opener, he has
kept those combinations through the days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Islanders take the ice Sunday, the forward lines
should look like this, from left to right: Brad Isbister, Mats
Lindgren and Mariusz Czerkawski; Mark Lawrence, Tim Connolly, Gino
Odjick; Jorgen Jonsson, Claude Lapointe, Olli Jokinen; Mike Watt,
Tony Hrkac, Chris Ferraro. Steve Webb is the extra forward.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive pairings will be: Kenny Jonsson and Zdeno Chara;
Jamie Heward and Jamie Rivers; Rich Pilon and Eric Brewer. A
rookie, Mathieu Biron, is the extra.
</P>
<P>
   If that lineup does not sound formidable, it isn't. The
Islanders played hard against the Lightning, but made mistakes and
paid dearly for them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the season's first game was against the lowly Lightning,
the worst team in the league the past two years, Goring said it was
hard to for him to determine how good or bad his Islanders would
be. The first-year coach said he would have a better idea after
Sunday.

 &HT;    Test of mettle for Iron Mike
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When Mike Ditka was named coach of the New Orleans
Saints more than two years ago, he expected to revive a franchise
that had endured three consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But after two 6-10 finishes, Iron Mike's eminence has been
reduced to tin foil. And the Big Easy's still an easy win in the
NFL for most teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought we'd won the Super Bowl my first year if
you'd asked me,'' Ditka said. ``But what I think and what we do are
two different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka, who guided the Chicago Bears to a victory in Super Bowl
XX in 1985, left coaching for five years after the 1992 season. He
was finally persuaded out of the television booth in 1997,
replacing Jim Mora in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Saints, Ditka doubled the team's
win total from the previous season. In August 1998, he was rewarded
with a five-year contract extension through the 2002 season, but
few NFL observers believe he'll last that long.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those same observers second-guessed Ditka in April after
he made one of the biggest gambles in NFL history. The Saints
traded eight draft picks _ all six this year and two in 2000 _ to
the Washington Redskins for the fifth choice overall. New Orleans
selected Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams of
Texas, who became the first one-man draft class in history.
</P>
<P>
   But Ditka believes Williams, the NCAA's all-time leading rusher,
might be what was missing from the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka already has a gritty leader in quarterback Billy Joe
Hobert, and there's more speed at receiver after he traded for
Eddie Kennison. The offensive line has been solidified with
free-agent signee Wally Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints finished fourth in the NFL in total defense in 1997,
before falling to 26th last season. This year, free-agent signees
Ashley Ambrose and Willie Clay have upgraded the secondary, which
ranked last a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing star defensive end Joe Johnson to a season-ending
knee injury in the preseason, the Saints still have one of the
league's most aggressive units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of struggles, that's for sure,'' Ditka
said, ``but nobody is throwing in the towel. We're not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ditka isn't giving up his sideline tirades, either.
Offensive coordinator Danny Abramowicz will move from the sideline
to the press box today against the Falcons. Ditka didn't like
Abramowicz's play-calling in last week's 14-10 loss at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike probably calls five plays every game,'' Abramowicz said.
``And we yell at each other like crazy. Yeah, he yelled at me. But
if people think this is the first time, they're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Saints
</P>
<P>
   Age: 59.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Aliquippa, Pa.

   But there is always something going on. He is a man with places
to go, and eager to get there.
</P>
<P>
   That is a window into what Giants fans can expect Sunday when
Collins makes the first start of his Giants career against the
Arizona Cardinals. Collins may or may not make the Giants better,
but he isn't going to wait for the team's plodding offense to catch
up to him. He's eager to get somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not likely to be a debut laced with indecision.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kerry, he drops back and the football is coming out of
the pocket right now,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said last week.
``You better be ready to make a play. He's got real good
anticipation and he'll just put it in there. He may not wait to see
if it's open, he's figuring somebody can make a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point:
</P>
<P>
   In relief of Kent Graham last week, Collins threw a pass deep
down the sideline to Amani Toomer. Toomer was covered, but Collins'
pass was to the receiver's outside shoulder, the one place Toomer
could catch it and no one else could. Toomer spun to the outside
and made the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best thing Kerry did in the game,'' Fassel said of
the 32-yard gain. ``He was covered, but he threw it anyway. Let
your best guys make plays. The Minnesota Vikings set a league
record doing that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has the arm strength, and the confidence, to force
passes into small openings and he makes extremely quick decisions
in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem.
</P>
<P>
   Throw into coverage and passes can also be intercepted. Collins
has 51 career touchdowns, but he also has 65 career interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Can Fassel, who likes his quarterbacks to play without mistakes,
handle the high-reward, high-risk style Collins has often
displayed?
</P>
<P>
   Or put another way, can the slumbering Giants' offense afford
not to accept the risk for the reward?
</P>
<P>
   If the average Collins game is two touchdown passes and two
interceptions, is that still a net gain for the punchless Giants?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, after all, have a strong defense. They might be able
to overcome the turnovers. But the defense can't win every game if
the offense doesn't find a little spark.
</P>
<P>
   And Collins is a sparkplug. Indeed, he's an excitable young man.
</P>
<P>
   When Collins entered the Giants' huddle last week, the regulars
were surprised by his animation and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks really fast,'' tackle Scott Gragg said last week of
Collins. ``Kerry, how can I say this, well, he calls plays like
he's had a few cups of coffee. It's not a deer-in-the-headlights
look, he's very sure of what he's doing. But he's pretty worked
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins doesn't refute this scouting report on his huddle
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am excited,'' he said. ``In the back of my head, I can still
hear Joe Paterno yelling at me: `Get them in and out of the huddle.
Play quick. It's a game of quickness.'''
</P>
<P>
   If he is high-strung in games, some of his teammates have also
observed what tight end Pete Mitchell termed ``a cool confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He is someone who's been in the spotlight a long time.
</P>
<P>
   As a 6-foot-5-inch, 15-year-old starting quarterback in high
school, he played before crowds of 7,000 and larger before he
learned to drive a car. He was an All-America quarterback at Penn
State, leading them to an undefeated season as a senior and a Rose
Bowl victory in his last college game. Just days after his 24th
birthday, he was playing in the National Football Conference
championship game with the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, still just 26, he will make his 50th start in a NFL
game.
</P>
<P>
   Too much too soon also led to a host of off-the-field problems.
And he is hardly a proven winner in the NFL. In a rag-tag season a
year ago, he was frequently reckless with the football, fumbling it
in the pocket and making foolhardy throws on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his glory days with the Panthers, some of his teammates
and coaches said they worked around him _ the team carrying him,
not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But he is smart and his talent to play the position is
unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, another pass in his relief role last
Sunday that exemplified what Collins can do that few at his post
can. He threw a deep square out, heaving the ball on a line from
the left hash mark all the way to the opposite sideline. The ball
arrived just as receiver Ike Hilliard was coming out of his break.
Hilliard grabbed it out of the air. First down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dangerous pass, but an indefensible one if thrown
properly.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a pass the Giants didn't dare attempt in the days of
Dave Brown and Danny Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time Kerry threw one of those in
practice,'' Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn, said. ``I thought, `You
mean we have to cover that now?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of timing and decisiveness and it takes a
quarterback with a certain conviction about his abilities, and
maybe someone just a bit antsy to get the ball down field. It takes
someone who is convinced he's got places to go. And he's not
waiting for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants find out Sunday just where Kerry Collins might take
them. This is what their $16.9 million gamble on Collins bought
last February.
</P>
<P>
   It does not figure to be a boring ride.

REVERSING TREND, COURT SYSTEM MOVES BACK TO A BROOKLYN
NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Teresa Cama, a lifelong resident of Red Hook,
Brooklyn, stood outside her home on Visitation Place and recalled
the days when the long-vacant brick building across the street was
a Roman Catholic elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from the eighth grade at Visitation School a
half-century ago. Two of her children graduated from the school,
and another was in first grade when declining enrollment forced the
school to close in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mrs. Cama spoke of the building's ``heartbreaking'' fate,
she also looked forward to its transformation. The three-story
Tudor Gothic structure is becoming the city's second community
court _ part of an effort to bring the local justice system closer
to the people while helping to improve their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' Mrs. Cama said as workers in the
building hammered, drilled and threaded electrical wiring through
unfinished floors and walls. The $5.4 million interior
reconstruction is to be completed, and the Red Hook Community
Justice Center up and running, by about year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than being empty,'' Mrs. Cama continued. ``And it
will help keep the drug addicts out of the park and off the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's first community court opened in Manhattan six years
ago, and a third is planned for Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   When the work in Red Hook is completed, the site will include a
court that will handle cases that would normally be dealt with in
three separate courts in downtown Brooklyn: Criminal Court, Family
Court and Housing Court.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal cases will include low-level felonies like
possession of relatively small amounts of drugs, and misdemeanors
like minor assaults, shoplifting, fare beating and so-called
``quality of life'' offenses like prostitution, vandalism and
graffiti. Cases that would otherwise go to Family Court are to
include juvenile delinquency; those that would usually go to
Housing Court will include landlord-tenant disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to hear about 10,000 cases a year
originating in Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Park Slope
and Sunset Park, officials say. But the building will not only be a
courthouse. In reflecting a key goal of community court advocates _
to help offenders overcome problems that lead to their tangles with
the law _ the building will also house programs like drug-abuse and
domestic-violence counseling, job placement and health services.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where municipal tribunals like the defunct Magistrates
Courts used to be scattered across each borough, until local courts
were consolidated in the early 1960s, current moves toward
decentralizing the courts by opening community courts would seem to
be merely a swing of the pendulum. But not so, state court
officials and supporters of community courts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Magistrates Courts were geographically based in the
community, but there wasn't an effort to understand the problems of
the communities,'' John Feinblatt, director of the Center for Court
Innovation, said of the defunct courts. The old system was replaced
by the current system of a Criminal Court and a Civil Court, with
more centralized branches in each borough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geography is only one part of the story _ philosophy is the
other part,'' Feinblatt said. He said the current community court
movement promotes courts that are not just away from downtown civic
centers, but that also emphasize social service and counseling
programs. His group, which helped plan the Red Hook center, is a
research and development unit of the state court system that was
established with the aid of the Fund for the City of New York,
which seeks to improve government functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief administrative judge, said,
``The whole idea of community courts is to make justice not some
far-away abstraction but something meaningful.'' He said that in
the current Criminal Court the volume of cases is so great that
``often the defendant walks out of the courtroom'' with no
punishment for the type of low-level offenses that will be dealt
with in the Red Hook court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the message will be that crimes will result in
adjudications that benefit the community, whether it's cleaning up
a local park or a local dump,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said court officials envisioned at least one community
court in each borough, though ``I don't see a return'' to the more
scattered system that characterized the old Magistrates Courts. He
said Red Hook was chosen for the city's second community court
because the area _ which for years was scarred by crime and
deterioration but is showing signs of revival _ was ``receptive to
the resources that a court can bring in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone favors community courts. Critics say they unfairly
favor the neighborhoods lucky or influential enough to obtain them.
When the Manhattan court was being planned, Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau was among those who held that the money
devoted to the community court should be used to improve conditions
in the borough's main Criminal Court at 100 Centre St. in lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remains concerned that the resources that are used for the
community court in Manhattan can be better used at 100 Centre,'' a
spokeswoman for Morgenthau, Barbara Thompson, said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes has
strongly supported the Red Hook court.
</P>
<P>
   While courts across the country have been consolidated in recent
decades to gain greater efficiency, advocates of community courts
believe centralization ``perhaps went too far, that the downtown
courthouses are inconvenient for most residents of an area,'' said
David Rottman, associate director of research at the National
Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But for the people of Red Hook, there are other reasons for
supporting the community court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they see the court,'' Evelyn Rivera, 35, said, ``people
around here will have more respect.''

 &HT;    Woman's new life after escaping prison snatched back
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She wears a plain white cotton jumpsuit, her skin is
sallow and her hair is dyed a muddy brown. Only her vivid blue eyes
stand out, darting nervously around the stark white room.
</P>
<P>
   She blends in with her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   She is Vianna Edith Branham, 42, a convicted murderer returned
to prison in Georgia after 12 years as an escapee.
</P>
<P>
   She blended in so well that during those 12 years on the lam
that she was an upholsterer, a painter, a student, a stripper and a
caretaker of Alzheimer's patients. She even went unnoticed as she
built her small frame from a drug addict's scrawniness into that of
a bodybuilder buff enough to win prizes in public competitions.
</P>
<P>
   She also had a son, but she never married his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to marry him,'' she said. ``I couldn't do it, of
course. I wasn't even me.''
</P>
<P>
   However well-planned and ingenious their escape, fugitive
convicts are rarely able to overcome the gravity-strong pull of the
familiar. The first thing their hunters do, routinely, is watch the
fugitive's mother's house, or spouse's house, or some other loved
one's residence. Sooner or later, and usually sooner, the escaped
prisoner will return to old haunts and contact family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Vianna Branham didn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a place she'd never been, a place she'd scarcely
even heard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nine years she had no contact with a single soul who knew
her,'' said Jeff May of the Metro Fugitive Squad, who has hunted
her for six years. ``She never got in trouble, she never got
fingerprinted, she never made contact with anyone she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, she counted on her chameleonlike qualities to keep
from being recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I look kind of ordinary,'' she said. ``I never worried
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her freedom ended 10 days ago, when federal agents arrested her
in El Paso, Texas. Almost inevitably, it was a family connection
that put the hunters on her trail, although they won't reveal
exactly who it was or what prompted it.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a youth was lost, it was Branham, and she doesn't even
know why. She talks of hunting with her father and helping him on
construction jobs, before she ran away from home in Illinois at age
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no real reason other than adolescence that caused me
to go off the wall,'' she mused in her Midwestern accent in an
interview room at Metro State Prison in Atlanta. ``Stupid, just
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 17, she had had a daughter and put the child up
for adoption. Later, still drifting, she had a son. ``He has a good
life now,'' she said, but avoided saying where he is.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, she picked up a heroin habit. ``I left New
Orleans to kick the heroin,'' she said. But when she got to Atlanta
she ``turned to other junk. I called myself a trash can _ I'd use
anything I could get.''
</P>
<P>
   She was high on something _ ``I can't even remember what'' _ on
the day in February 1979 when she killed Charles Brown in an
attempt to snatch his wife's purse in front of their home. She shot
him in the throat when he grabbed her.
</P>
<P>
   Branham pleaded guilty and drew life plus 10 years at the
Women's Correction Institute in Hardwick, then the state's only
prison for women. She served eight years and then was turned down
at her first chance for parole.
</P>
<P>
   She started planning her escape in 1987. She said she was afraid
for her safety, and incidents of abuse at the prison, since closed,
have been well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   Female prisoners rarely escape, and security at the east Georgia
prison was lax. Branham's job was cutting grass, and she was
allowed outside the fence with her mower.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother went into a coma and died when I was sentenced to
life,'' she said. ``She left me $2,000. I had my cousin get the
cash and send it to a friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, the date Branham chose, her friend drove by the
prison and dropped a nondescript bag containing the money into a
roadside ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Branham put on spandex tights and a pajama top _ ``It looked
kinda like a workout outfit'' _ under her white-and-blue jumpsuit,
boarded her riding mower and headed for the front gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the lady in the tower I was going to mow the warden's
lawn,'' she said. ``Then I told her I'd pick her some mulberries. I
don't know why I threw that out. I wasn't coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, wanted posters have reported she got into a
Chevrolet Impala that stopped to pick her up. Branham insists that
isn't true. She said she abandoned the mower in a pecan orchard and
started walking up a highway, unsure of the geography around
Hardwick. She only knew that the woods off the highway were part of
a swamp. ``Everybody knew about that. They said it was full of
snakes and alligators,'' she said with a shiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned on hitching a ride but the first thing to come along
was a prison truck. I panicked and ran into the woods. It sure
enough was swamp. I smushed and sloshed along best I could, and
after a while I heard the dogs. But I knew from hunting with my
daddy they wouldn't be able to track me in the swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   When she came back out on the road, she said, ``some nice old
fella'' took her to a truck stop, and a trucker gave her a ride to
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   At the Augusta airport, she bought a ticket to Alamogordo, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Department of Corrections did not hunt its
fugitives with the intensity it does now, and Branham's trail
quickly grew cold. She said she chose southwestern New Mexico
because ``I had a friend who told me about it. It just seemed
right. The mountains are really beautiful.'' Left unsaid is that
she'd never been near the place.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived with $1,500, became Linda Kay Branham, and started
putting together a life. Whether it was as blameless as she makes
it seem is questionable, according to law enforcement officers, but
certainly she avoided trouble and usually held a job.
</P>
<P>
   She met a man _ ``he's Spanish'' _ and began living with him. A
couple of years after her escape, she gave birth to their son, but
a few years after that she asked her lover to leave. ``He was
alcoholic, and he was getting to be emotionally abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup, she said, ``I was depressed. My doctor told
me I had a hormone imbalance. I remembered that when I was in
prison, I used to run, maybe five miles, every other day. I wasn't
depressed then. So I went to the gym and started lifting weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Branham claims she tuned her body up to show quality in only a
year, and denies using steroids. She entered her first competition
in 1996, she said, and then won the state middleweight championship
for women. She never worried about being recognized, and in truth
she scarcely resembled the woman who fled Hardwick prison. In her
long-sleeved prison jumpsuit, the 5-foot-3 Branham doesn't give any
hint of great muscularity until a movement stretches the trouser
legs tight over her thighs.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was a good mother, and set a good example for her
son. ``I always told my boy to stay away from guns,'' she recalled.
``Don't touch 'em, don't pick 'em up. I kinda harped on it. One day
he turned around to me and said:
</P>
<P>
   ```Mom, have you shot someone?'
</P>
<P>
   ```Never mind,''' I said to him. ```Just do what I say. Don't
mess with guns.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she said, ``I had a feeling time was getting short.''
She said she moved to El Paso, leaving her son at their country
house in the care of neighbors and his father, because ``I wanted
him to get used to me being gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, she wandered into a gym that offered her a free
membership and free entry in a bodybuilder's contest. She won fifth
place, but she couldn't find a job. She started dancing at The
Naked Harem. She frequently came back to
</P>
<P>
   Alamogordo for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This year, her cold trail suddenly turned hot. ``We received a
call on July 2 that the FBI had received a tip that she was living
in Alamogordo as Linda Kay Branham,'' said May, who heads the
Department of Corrections team within the fugitive squad.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Gary Brotan, stationed in Las Cruces, went to
Alamogordo and found the tip was very likely true. Neighbors told
him Branham was working in El Paso and would be coming home on the
weekend to see her son. One of them agreed to let Brotan set up
surveillance inside her house.
</P>
<P>
   But, May said, ``during the surveillance Brotan got word that
Branham had been tipped to him and was on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Brotan went to El Paso, got a publicity picture of Branham, and
tracked her activities there. But nobody knew where she had gone.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, May said, Branham called both Brotan and the
Department of Corrections in Atlanta, and ``indicated she would
turn herself in at Las Cruces on the 18th.'' May flew to Las Cruces
and waited with Brotan. Branham didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got scared,'' she said. ``I was scared of going back to that
prison.'' She wrote to her son in Alamogordo, telling him who his
mother really was. ``I said, `Now you know why I always told you
never to pick up guns.'''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, May found that Branham had fled from El Paso to
Rockingham, N.C., another place she had never been. But he was
several weeks behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Branham had gone to Dallas and taken a job caring for
Alzheimer's patients. ``It paid $100 a day,'' she said, ``and it
was good work. I could be happy doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   While watching television at the home, she said, she saw a
Geraldo Rivera program on prisons which touched on the scandal at
Hardwick, reported how several new women's prisons had been
established, and contained an interview with Metro State Warden Guy
Hickman. ``He seemed really proud of the place,'' she said, and ``I
couldn't see how he could talk like that if it was as bad as it
used to be. So I decided to stop running.''
</P>
<P>
   She flew to El Paso the next day. On Sept. 29, she was spotted
in the border town, and Brotan led a team that arrested her in her
apartment at 7:30 p.m. the following day.
</P>
<P>
   After her arrest, she called her father. ``He said a woman came
by named Nicole, looking for me. He said she's been calling all the
time.'' It was, Branham realized immediately, the daughter she had
given up for adoption 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's real excited about meeting me,'' Branham said, thrusting
out her arms to display her prison jumpsuit. ``Well, great. Look at
me.'' She hasn't called Nicole back yet.
</P>
<P>
   May flew to El Paso to bring Branham back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really nice fellow,'' she said. ``I always said I
didn't mean to kill that man. I had no intention of doing it. Jeff
told me he had stayed in touch with the man's wife. He said. `She
knows that you didn't mean to kill him, and she has forgiven you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me feel so much better,'' Branham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A life sentence is what I got,'' she said, looking at the
concrete block walls around her. ``That life is gone. The part of
me that craved drugs is gone. I've definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   However changed she may be, Branham is unlikely to see any fairy
tale ending to her escape. Prison authorities say it will probably
be 10 years _ some of those under close security _ before she has
any chance at all of freedom again.

   ROCK HILL, S.C. _ It has been more than 50 years since any state
banned an existing form of gambling, but a drive around the border
roads of York County helps to explain why South Carolina is poised
to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Video poker is everywhere. Its robotic musical signature drones
from gambling machines in virtually every gas station and
convenience store as mesmerized players feed in dollar after dollar
to play five-card stud and blackjack. Gaudy windowless parlors with
five machines to a room greet visitors who cross the state line
from North Carolina. The industry crept up on the state through a
series of back-door legal moves, but 34,000 of the machines have
now taken root across South Carolina, far more than in any other
state, and many people have had enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, voters will have a choice either to ban the machines
beginning next summer or regulate them more closely. The latest
newspaper poll shows that a sizable majority of likely voters _
more than 60 percent, in one poll _ want the machines permanently
unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   That vote, and another one on Tuesday in which Alabama will
decide whether to institute a state lottery, will be among the most
important tests in years of whether gambling's steady growth in the
Southern Bible Belt has finally reached its limit. Although the
lottery is more accepted and far less intrusive than video
gambling, several polls show that its popularity in Alabama has
dropped in recent months. The outcome of next week's lottery vote,
which once seemed certain to pass, is now considered a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very big symbolic votes coming up,'' said William
Thompson, a gambling industry expert and public administration
professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ``The last time a
state voted out gambling was in 1948, when Idaho banned slot
machines. It will be a very big victory for the anti-gambling side
if it's thrown out in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's governor, Donald Siegelman, campaigned almost
exclusively on a promise to create a lottery, and is selling it as
the only way to create a pre-kindergarten program and a college
scholarship program similar to that in neighboring Georgia and
other states. Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who also ran on a
pro-lottery platform and accepted about $3 million from video poker
interests, now says he is opposed to video poker. His state's
lottery will be on the ballot in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In both of the coming votes, gambling proponents have
encountered large and potent coalitions of religious groups, but
the size of the opposition in South Carolina has been particularly
remarkable. Virtually every denomination in the state _ including
Southern Baptists, Presbyterians and Jews _ has joined in
well-organized coalitions to get anti-poker voters registered and
to the polls. They have been joined by the South Carolina Chamber
of Commerce and most large businesses, which are worried about the
state's image, and most editorial pages. The state election
commission has reported a noticeable burst in voter registrations
in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social cost and the implications for our citizens were
already huge,'' said Paula Harper Bethea, chairwoman of the South
Carolina chamber. ``But we also think it has a negative economic
impact on the state, because it greatly affects our image. We're
struggling to get ahead in a lot of areas, and we have a good
quality of life, and we think we deserve better than video poker.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,300-member chamber, the state's largest business
organization, is running television and radio advertisements
against the machines, while an anti-gambling group, Legacy
Alliance, is putting up billboards. Meanwhile, religious groups are
distributing yard signs and building grass-roots support. A recent
rally in Rock Hill, a hotbed of anti-poker sentiment, drew a crowd
of 3,500 to protest the effects of video gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have an endless sheaf of stories about middle-class
parents who lost their life savings to a video poker addiction, or
poor families who spend their food money in the parlors. But they
have been careful not to make the vote a referendum on the merits
of gambling itself. The Rev. Steve Hogg, pastor of the First
Baptist Church of Rock Hill and a prominent leader of the
anti-poker forces, said many people in his coalition approved of
lotteries or horse racing, though he does not, and so they decided
to focus on the one issue that united them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have put this coalition together if the lottery
was on the table, but we all agree that video poker is the most
destructive and addictive form of gambling there is,'' said Hogg, a
conservative Southern Baptist who wore a blue Vote No button on his
shirt pocket. ``I'm not one of those Christians who believes in
outlawing everything I think is sinful or immoral. I'm part of the
community, and we have to be pragmatic about what we consider to be
life-or-death issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the support for the machines has come from the state's
video poker industry, which has revenue of about $2.8 billion a
year and has raised about $2 million on the campaign to keep the
machines, more than twice as much as its opponents. Supporters say
the state will lose $200 million to $300 million in yearly tax
revenue if the machines are banned, and predict that 28,000 people
will lose their jobs. Many video parlors and gas stations are
plastered with fliers that cast the issue in terms of personal
freedom, saying that the next step is to ban the Internet or rock
music.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the poll was published by The State, in Columbia, and five
other newspapers last month, the pro-poker forces have intensified
their broadcast advertising and direct mailings, and are building a
get-out-the-vote effort among poker employees and players to rival
that of the churches. But many who have watched the issue say the
industry may have grown too large to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tightened up since the poll,'' said John
Cavanaugh, a political science professor at the University of South
Carolina. ``But there's still a strong anti-gambling feeling that's
catching hold in the state. Everyone sees the machines when they go
to the gas station, and many people know someone with an addiction
problem. The tide seems to be turning.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a considerable sentiment against the lottery in
Alabama, as well, again led by church groups, but the intensity of
the opposition is less than in South Carolina because of the nature
of the game. Many people consider the lottery less addictive and
less harmful than video poker, and are jealous of the
lottery-financed college scholarships offered to Georgia students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails, there is no Plan B,'' said Rick Dent, a
spokesman for the Alabama Education Lottery Foundation, which is
running the pro-lottery campaign. ``This is our one chance to ever
have college scholarships, pre-K and computers in the schools. If
there were another way to pay for them, surely we would already
have them.''
</P>
<P>
   But lottery opponents have also repeated a frequent criticism of
the numbers game: Most tickets are purchased by poorer residents, a
large number of whom are black, while the scholarships tend to go
to middle-class white students. Church leaders said they were
particularly angered by a statement from Siegelman, the governor,
several weeks ago that opponents of the lottery should be ashamed
of themselves, and they said no other issue had brought different
denominations so closely together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply believe that government should not fund itself with
money from the people who can least afford it,'' said Michael
Anderson, executive director of the Mobile Baptist Association,
which represents about 100 churches.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman later said he respected those who disagree with him on
religious or moral grounds, but pollsters say the intense
church-by-church mobilization has significantly eroded support for
the lottery. A poll conducted by three newspapers and published
this week showed that 51 percent of likely voters said they
supported the lottery, down from 61 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, every church in Alabama has a bus,'' said Eric
Johnston, a Birmingham lawyer who is treasurer of the largest
anti-lottery coalition. ``And on Tuesday, they're all heading for
the polls.''

 &HT;    Phloundering in NHL East Conference

<P>
   ATLANTA _ After going 15 consecutive quarters without a
touchdown, it's safe to say the Philadelphia Eagles had only one
small set of fans left in the city: the Flyers. The Eagles were the
only thing distracting Philly sports fans from the fact the Flyers
failed to score a goal in their first two games, despite
possessing, according to general manager Bobby Clarke, their most
talented roster in the last five years. The consecutive home
blankings predictably have Philly fans, not the reserved sort,
looking for scapegoats. Clarke no doubt realizes that his own
future rides with the success of this team and coach Roger Neilson.
Owner Ed Snider also has let it be known that the team's payroll is
way too high _ and a sudden mandate to lop off salaries usually
isn't conducive to building a Stanley Cup winner. The public's
cries to dump Neilson, Clarke said, ``is all the media's fault.''
Alluding to the fact that the Flyers also were shut out in their
final exhibition, Neilson said, ``That's three games in a row it's
happened. Three games without a goal. Nine periods without a goal.
Wasn't in the plan for the start of the season.''
</P>

   COMRADE BURE

<P>
   The story was a rehash of previous reports, but a Canadian
television network's report about a possible relationship between
Florida's Pavel Bure and alleged Russian organized crime boss Anzor
Kikalichvilli remains a concern for the league. Russian mobsters
have tried to extort money out of Russian NHL players in recent
years. NHL chief counsel Bill Daly said of Bure's alleged ties to
Kikalichvilli: ``It's a relationship we're concerned about and a
relationship we're monitoring.'' Bure's response: ``They can be
concerned, but there's nothing to be concerned about. It's all
stuff that's been written over and over and there's nothing to
say.''

   Alexander Daigle wanted so badly to leave Tampa Bay for New York

$600,000. The Lightning wanted so badly to get rid of him that it
is picking up a majority of the salary while Daigle plays in the
Rangers' minor-league system.... Agent Kurt Overhardt on the
Devils' dealings with restricted free agent Brendan Morrison:
``They're not even treating him as a member of their family, unless
it's a dysfunctional family.''... Yes, that was former Atlanta
Knight (IHL) Stan Drulia scoring for Tampa Bay Thursday vs. the
Kings. It was his first NHL goal since 1992.... Carolina GM Jim
Rutherford reiterated that the team is not close to a deal with
Keith Primeau. In the meantime, Ron Francis is the new team
captain. ``I understand the club needs to try to put this situation
behind them and get on with the season,'' Francis said. ``Until
Keith's situation gets resolved, there's a big hole on this hockey
club. All of us notice that.''

 &HT;    Pressure's on Rangers
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Neil Smith might be a native of Ontario, but his style
is pure Manhattan. And if the New York Rangers, a team of skating
dollar signs, should crash this season, the general manager's
office is going to look like the site of a subway derailment.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to tell where Smith is feeling more heat these
days, from around the league or from within his own city limits.
The Rangers continue to flounder at Penn Plaza, despite the
league's highest annual payroll at nearly $59 million, more than
triple the Thrashers'.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's summer shopping spree of six free agents, including Theo
Fleury, had netted two losses and a tie before winning their first
game of the season 3-1 at Carolina on Friday. No need to ask who
most of Smith's fellow NHL executives were pulling for last week
when Ottawa, which is ranked 23rd in payroll and is standing firm
in not renegotiating with holdout Alexei Yashin, visited Madison
Square Garden last week _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith doesn't seem to mind being perceived as the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're upset as much as they're maybe jealous
or envious, because they can't spend as much and they don't have
the revenue streams to do it,'' Smith said by telephone. ``This is
New York, and if they were in New York, they would be doing the
same thing. But they can also look at it this (way) . We've been in
the league for 74 years and we've only won four Stanley Cups, so
it's not like it's a sure-fire method.''
</P>
<P>
   A common league joke these days is that if NHL general managers
are colluding in holding down salaries, it's a 27-team collusion
with one maverick. But if the Rangers miss the playoffs for the
third year in a row and Smith is fired, he'll be going down having
spent somebody else's money, owner Cablevision's. The total value
of the deals given to Fleury, Valeri Kamensky, Sylvain Lefebvre,
Stephane Quintal, Kirk McLean and Tim Taylor was $67 million.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia owner Ed Snider, whose own team is struggling
despite the second-highest payroll, ripped the Rangers' spending
habits in Canada's National Post the other day. ``They are
continuing down a lane that everybody else in the league has
decided is a disaster,'' Snider said. ``So, obviously, they don't
care about the league. They say to hell with the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith initially wouldn't respond to Snider's comments, then
said, ``It doesn't surprise me. We're rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he doesn't think the team's 1999 payroll _
which includes a $15.5 million base-salary top line of Fleury,
Peter Nedved and Adam Graves _ creates an atmosphere atypical for
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure here,'' Smith said. ``There's pressure
to find a cab in the morning. That's the way of life here. You get
used to it. We're not into slow rebuilding programs here. We're
into fast, like everything else here. When you're driving and you
see construction in your lane ahead, you don't slow down; you speed
up and cut in front of the car in the lane next to you. That's our
philosophy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the Rangers appear to be deep into a massive backup.

 &HT;    History checks Salei's denial
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anaheim's Ruslan Salei insists he wasn't trying to
injure Mike Modano when he crosschecked the off-balanced Dallas
center from behind and came close to paralyzing him. But Salei's
history screamed for something more than the 10-game suspension he
was handed. The defenseman was suspended two years ago for
head-butting and last year for ``slew-footing'' (taking down a
player with a leg-sweep from behind). Then there are the things he
wasn't even penalized for. Ask Thrashers center Mike Stapleton.
Last season, when he played for Phoenix, Stapleton nearly had his
left eye carved out by Salei's stick blade. As it was, he was
suffered a 28-stitch gash under the left eye and missed four games.
But no official saw the infraction and didn't penalize Salei. ``He
cut me down to the bone and damaged the tear duct,'' Stapleton
said. ``I don't know if he has respect for other players. I
understand he plays hard but there's a difference between playing
hard and (lacking) respect.... We're all kind of in like a
fraternity. This is our livelihood. The scary thing is, he could've
killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   FACEOFF: STEVE LUDZIK, TAMPA BAY COACH
</P>
<P>
   _ On his training ground in the IHL: ``I learned that talent is
not going to win it for you. You have to have chemistry. You have
to have guys who want to show up every night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Comparing the IHL and AHL: ``I don't think there are too many
American League teams that would be able to compete. Look at teams
like Pittsburgh and you see a lot of International League players
playing on NHL teams that are doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the trading of Alexander Daigle: ``It wasn't done for
personal reasons. It was just we couldn't get him to show that
passion that we thought we needed. We thought it was a bad example
to other players. It is very tough as an organization starting anew
like we are, when you say to guys, `We need passion.' That painted
(GM) Rick Dudley and myself in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the team's playoff chances: ``If you say there's a
long-term plan, fans kind of get turned off. If your only
expectations are to play .500 hockey that would be, to me, like a
father saying to his son, `See if you can get 50 percent on this
exam and I'll be happy with that.' If you set your sights low,
you're going to be an underachieving team. I'd like my guys to
overachieve and push themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   DECADE LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, who scored goals in two of Dallas's first three
games, merely was extending his excellence in the 1990s. Hull
entered the season as the NHL's leading goal-scorer since Jan. 1,
1990. Note the absence of Wayne Gretzky, who had a league-high 702
assists in the decade. Here are the top 10 goal scorers, with

 &HT;    Star struck in NHL West Conference
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not surprisingly, the check by Anaheim's Ruslan Salei
on Dallas Stars center Mike Modano last week caused a lot of
reaction around the league. The growing concern is that players _
upset league officials are taking insufficent action against
offenders _ will take their on-ice retribution to a new level.
Modano expressed concern that, ``Somewhere along the road, players
have lost respect for one another and the sport, and that is
unacceptable.... Hitting from behind and attempting to injure each
other does nothing for the game.'' But Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg, who played for the same Minnesota/Dallas organization as
Modano, defends Salei, saying, ``I'll go to my grave with it. I
don't think Rusty had any intention of any viciousness. It's just a
freak thing that happened.'' He couldn't convince Brett Hull,
Modano's teammate. Hull said of Salei, who is a native of Belarus:
``I'd like to see the guy sent away and have his passport taken
away. But we all know that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   TRADE WINDS
</P>
<P>
   Word is that Rick Tocchet is not long for Phoenix. The
high-scoring winger is entering the final year of his contract and
Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith hasn't given any indication he
is interested in bringing Tocchet back. The player didn't help his
cause when he publicly questioned the team's commitment to winning
when it appeared it was more intent on slashing payroll. Owner
Richard Burke responded, ``Rick Tocchet is 80 percent of the
solution and 20 percent of the problem.'' Burke later apologized,
and Tocchet now says, ``It's water under the bridge. He said he was
sorry and we haven't talked about it since, so forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY . . .
</P>
<P>
   Good move by Colorado to sign veteran David Reid, who came
cheaply (one year, $475,000). He scored twice for Dallas in last
year's conference finals when the Stars dumped the Avalanche.
``He's a depth guy and he's going to help these kids coming in,''
Avalanche GM Pierre Lacroix said. ``We saw that we needed someone
to grandfather these kids. All he wanted was to go for it another
time, to try to win it. He feels we have what it takes to reach his
objective.''... Wayne Gretzky says he has been contacted by ``five
or six'' teams _ including, presumably, Edmonton and Los Angeles _
about a position in the organization and that one unnamed team has
offered him 35 percent ownership. But he reiterated he will stay
out of hockey for at least one year before making a decision on his
future.... Edmonton president Glen Sather on Thrashers captain
Kelly Buchberger's departure: ``I admired Kelly for his
competitiveness, the work ethic he brought to the rink, his
fearless play. He loved it here but he was stuck in the system,
making Canadian dollars.... He's got a new three-year contract for
big dough. It's better for him.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium,
atop some of baseball's most hallowed ground, Michael Franklin, 13,
leaned against a black metal fence, largely unmoved by what others
were calling the magic of October baseball. He lives in Polo
Grounds Towers, an upper Manhattan housing project built on the
remains of the legendary home of the New York Giants, and later the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Yankees,'' Michael said Thursday with a grin. ``But
basketball is my game.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, on the blocks where once stood Ebbets Field, home
of the Brooklyn Dodgers, another housing project now dominates. The
only indication of its previous incarnation is a small granite
plaque under a fading ``Renting Office'' sign. There, on a day much
of the city was swept up with the fates of the Mets and Yankees in
the playoffs, Shawn Tyson, 23, said he had even less use for
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch like everyone else, but I don't catch it
anymore,'' said Tyson, who lives in the Ebbets Field Houses.
``Baseball is boring, it's too slow. Basketball has much more
action. I honestly can't see the appeal of the game at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Franklin and Shawn Tyson, who are black, were both
standing on ground steeped in baseball history _ ground where Bobby
Thomson hit his home run heard round the world and Jackie Robinson
broke baseball's color barrier. And they both gave voice to a
certain disconcerting truth about baseball. Among many American
blacks, it is a sport in decline.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is reflected in the shrinking number of blacks in
the major leagues and in the primacy of basketball as the sport of
choice among black youngsters in the inner city, and it is not
likely to be halted by the excitement and nostalgia surrounding the
first simultaneous World Series playoff appearances of the Mets and
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, a group of black teen-agers at the Polo
Grounds Towers, asked to rank their favorite sports, spoke in what
amounted to a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball, football, baseball and hockey,'' said Maurice
Burgess, 18, who acted as a spokesman for the group. ``And soccer?
You've got to interview some Australians about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, plenty of black residents at the two housing
projects, children and grandparents alike, have watched, and will
cheer for, the Mets and Yankees as they make their way through the
playoffs. Not all blacks have lost interest in baseball. But still,
black residents of the buildings express a certain sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Giles, 81, a retired truck driver and ``devout Yankees
fan'' who lives at Polo Grounds Towers, said he vividly remembers
trips to the Polo Grounds and can recall where he was when Bobby
Thomson's home run won the pennant for the Giants in 1951. ``It was
a short home run,'' he said, eyes alight. ``But it was a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles acknowledges that things have changed. ``During my time,
no black man was allowed to play,'' he said. ``Then Jackie Robinson
did it, and all of a sudden there were so many blacks you couldn't
count them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in next breath, he added, ``Now, there are so many
Latinos, you can't count them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bear him out. According to the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, the percentage of
blacks in the major leagues dropped to 15 percent in 1998, the
lowest number of the decade. In the same year, the percentage of
Hispanic players rose to 25 percent, a decade high.
</P>
<P>
   And the representation of blacks in baseball pales in comparison
to their numbers in football (nearly 70 percent) and basketball (80
percent). Also, nearly 90 percent of Little League programs
nationwide are located in mostly white suburban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern about the number of blacks declining,
certainly,'' said Ricky Clemons, vice president for public
relations in baseball's National League. He said one major concern
was that ``a lot of inner-city high schools have eliminated
baseball. It's the first to go. It takes a lot of equipment and a
lot of space.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, Major League Baseball has supported Reviving
Baseball in the Inner Cities, an organization that aims to develop
fans and players in the hearts of the nation's larger cities. The
organization counts more than 30,000 participants in 50 cities.
</P>
<P>
   But developments at Ebbets Field Houses and the Polo Grounds
Towers illustrate baseball's urban decline. At Ebbets Field, an
adjacent playground was recently renovated to make more room for
basketball courts, eliminating a cement softball diamond. Baseball
players must now drag their equipment to diamonds in Prospect Park,
about a mile away, to play.
</P>
<P>
   At the Polo Grounds housing project, a central playground known
as the Willie Mays is the domain of basketball players, with
baseball shoved to the periphery; at nearby Holcombe-Rucker
Playground, a nicely groomed baseball diamond is used principally
for ``cookouts and such,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess pointed to his Yankees cap. ``This stands for New York,
New York, not New York Yankees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the younger blacks interviewed said they enjoyed
basketball and football more because the games were faster, more
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that loose action,'' said Mike Kelly, 15, who lives at
the Polo Grounds Towers. ``It's swifter than people standing around
with bats.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of suggestions for improvements, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nine-inning game is too long,'' said Shawn Maynard, 19,
who lives in the Ebbets Field Houses. ``Maybe they should shorten
it to five innings.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Leshawn Swea, 17, said baseball should consider
adding flashy sideshows, loud music during games or time limits.
``Or cheerleaders,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball has its passionate curators among black New Yorkers
who live on the grounds of the old ball parks, they are usually the
older residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to sneak over the fence here,'' said Clinton Collins,
71, of Ebbets Field Houses, who wore a New York Knicks cap. ``But
you could get a $2.50 box seat if you wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off the names of players he had seen _ Pee Wee Reese,
Don Hoak, Jackie Robinson. Then, as if to make a point, he pulled
out a picture of his 13-year-old grandson, Farouk, dressed in a
football uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the love of baseball the older residents hold has been
embraced by some young blacks. The more talk about the prospect of
the Yankees or Mets, or both teams, in the World Series, the more
excitement bubbled up. Some youngsters could give a glowing review
of Derek Jeter's stylish play and Mike Piazza's clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love watching baseball, especially when a player hits a home
run,'' said Rogelio Henry Jr., 13, an eighth-grader at Jackie
Robinson Middle School, behind his home in the Ebbets Field Houses.
``I'm living on history. Right here is history.''

   EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S UNPAID U.N. DUES  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   American foreign policy reaps important benefits when the United
Nations sends peacekeepers to East Timor, relief workers to East
Africa, police and civil administrators to Kosovo or arms
inspectors to Iraq. But for years, Congress has prevented the
Clinton administration from paying the back dues America legally
owes the U.N. This fall, there is a good chance to end the long
stalemate, but only if House Republicans act responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and the Senate have agreed on a plan to make
up a large portion of the arrears, which now total about $1
billion. But the House version of the legislation is expected to be
saddled with unacceptable anti-abortion language that has nothing
to do with the U.N. dues issue. The language, promoted by Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., would prohibit U.S. assistance to groups
involved in lobbying foreign governments to liberalize their
abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith provision is bad policy that would bar Washington from
giving any money to these groups for purposes unrelated to
abortion. It would also discourage efforts to reform extremely
harsh foreign abortion laws. If it appears in the final version of
the legislation, President Clinton is almost certain to veto it.
Smith should stop trying to attach this language. If he persists,
when it comes time to reconcile House and Senate versions, Speaker
Dennis Hastert must choose conferees who will eliminate the
abortion language. Unless the United States pays at least $300
million this year, it could lose voting privileges in the General
Assembly. Unless it pays a substantial portion of back dues, like
the $900 million the Senate has authorized, it risks losing moral
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has withheld its dues to bring pressure for U.N.
financial reforms. But in recent years, the U.N. has reformed its
budget and staffing. Most of the U.N.'s costs are paid by other
countries and many of its purchases are made from American
companies. Refusing to pay now would seriously weaken the U.N.'s
ability to respond to future crises.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   A bewildering series of mergers and regulatory actions in the
telecommunications industry in the past two weeks could ultimately
improve telephone service to consumers. But some of the mergers
designed to make local phone service better risk constraining what
viewers can see on their cable systems, threatening the diversity
of information that is central to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A scorecard was needed to keep track of all the recent
maneuvers. Bell Atlantic, the largest local phone company, asked
the Federal Communications Commission for permission to enter
long-distance service, where it would take on AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom
and Sprint, thereby increasing competition. But then MCI Worldcom
and Sprint decided to merge, a move that would lessen competition.
Meanwhile, the commission approved the merger of SBC Communications
and Ameritech, two large regional Bell companies. It also approved
rules that will make it easier for AT&AMP;T, a huge cable operator, to
take over another cable company, Mediaone, putting about 60 percent
of American households within reach of AT&AMP;T's cable programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some hail these events as the dawn of technological change that
will throw every telecommunications company into competition with
every other, bringing consumers dramatically lower prices and fancy
new video, phone, wireless and Internet services. In this view,
there will be no such thing as a regional phone company or
long-distance company or cable company. Instead, full-service
companies will do it all. One company might provide all these
services over the phone lines. Another might use the cable line.
Others will deliver information by satellite or land-based
microwave. The optimists see five or six companies luring
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear a world in which one or two companies take over,
concentrating control of the information that flows into a hundred
million households. That, critics fear, would squelch the variety
of news, information and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission may have fueled these fears by permitting too
many phone mergers. The 1996 Telecommunications Act invited AT&AMP;T
and others to go after local phone customers of the Baby Bells. So
far, that has not occurred and the commission is under intense
pressure from Congress to make it happen. The commission approved
the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, two original Baby Bells,
because it extracted promises that Bell Atlantic would open up its
network to competitors. It approved the SBC-Ameritech merger
because the company agreed to offer local service in the
territories of the remaining Baby Bells. It would like to approve
AT&AMP;T's takeover of Mediaone because AT&AMP;T promises to provide local
phone service over cable lines _ the first important challenge to
the Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission has approved too many mergers, thus stifling
competition, the error means only that local phone rates will
remain too high for too long _ nothing disastrous. That is because
phone companies do not control the content of the calls and
Internet services that flow over their wires.
</P>
<P>
   The troubling issue concerns the rules the commission has issued
for mergers among companies that do control content, notably the
cable companies that decide what we see and hear. If the commission
allows AT&AMP;T to buy Mediaone, Consumers Union argues, one monster
cable company will threaten to dominate the purchase of video
programs _ indeed, a video programmer that fails to sell to AT&AMP;T
might be forced to close up shop.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, a cable channel carrying, say, sports or
Spanish-language programming might need to reach 20 percent of
cable subscribers to generate enough revenue to survive. If one
cable company expanded to 80 percent or more of the market, its
decision to reject the channel would leave it too few subscribers
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rules for cable ownership are designed to
preserve diversity. They permit a cable company to serve at most 30
percent of the national market. That would allow at least three
cable companies to exist, each large enough to provide programmers
with enough viewers to survive. That way, no one cable company
could block programmers from finding an audience. But Consumers
Union says the commission's rules are full of loopholes and may not
prevent AT&AMP;T from growing large enough to dominate programmers.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing mergers of companies that control information, the
commission cannot rely solely on traditional antitrust standards
that are used to protect consumers from paying too much for orange
juice or hair cuts. The commission needs to set a higher standard
even if that means blocking mergers that could pry open the local
phone market. A proper standard would insure that consumers end up
with many providers, not a couple of behemoths that can strangle
the information flow.

ART MUSEUM TRUSTEES SAY CITY HALL PUSHED THEM TOO HARD
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The board of trustees of the Brooklyn Museum of Art
has long been a placid little backwater for the rich and powerful
of New York City. Once, years ago, there was a bit of a dust-up
over a decision to buy an Albert Bierstadt by selling a Winslow
Homer. Some trustees resigned in protest.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, board membership has consisted of tiresome meetings
about museum attendance and budget problems, spiced up with the
obligatory black-tie fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasn't been particularly memorable,'' Henry Luce III said,
summing up his experience as a trustee.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed two weeks ago, the day the trustees were
summoned to the museum for a climactic meeting about whether to
proceed with a controversial exhibition of contemporary art.
Suddenly, trustees were plotting with ``Mission Impossible''
precision how to sneak into the museum without getting trapped by
reporters. Their wealthy friends, never before all that curious
about their board membership, now could not get enough museum
gossip at cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time they left the museum that evening, this group of
otherwise staid, work-it-out-over-Scotch lawyers and corporate
leaders had been transformed into angry champions of artworks that
most of them did not even particularly like or understand.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, a dozen board members described a
transformation shaped by two pivotal events that day. The first was
a private, trustees-only tour of the ``Sensation'' exhibit. The
second was the trustees' visceral response to Michael Hess, the
city's corporation counsel, who attended the meeting to convey
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's distaste for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was scary, really scary,'' a trustee, Susan Soros, the wife
of the financier George Soros, said of Hess. ``When he spoke, he
united the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it had to do with Hess' message. He made it clear that
the only sure way the museum could overcome Giuliani's opposition
was by removing a Chris Ofili painting of the Virgin Mary adorned
with elephant dung and surrounded by cutouts from pornographic
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trustees had just got their first look at the
exhibition, and while they found some of the works ``kooky,''
``banal'' and ``not very interesting,'' they were almost unanimous
in their admiration of the Ofili painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extraordinarily beautiful,'' said Sol Schreiber, a prominent
lawyer and former U.S. magistrate whose tastes lean toward the
tamer realm of glass art.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur John A. Friede, a nephew of Walter H.
Annenberg, said he had got the impression from Giuliani's
descriptions of the Ofili painting that he was going to see animal
excrement smeared over the Virgin Mary. ``It was about as smeared
as a Vermeer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But more than the message, the trustees took offense at the way
it was delivered by Hess and Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota. On the
whole, the trustees are people used to being courted and coddled
and recognized. In their view, Hess treated them as if he were
sternly lecturing a bunch of unruly teen-agers about proper table
manners. Hess said it was the way the trustees treated him that was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Some trustees said Hess called them ``arrogant'' _ an allegation
Hess firmly denies. Particularly galling, they said, was his
assertion that Giuliani could have them removed from the board.
``He can't do that to me, and there would be a terrible stink if he
tried,'' said Luce, who went on to describe Hess as ``a rude and
ugly man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, several trustees said, a galvanizing moment that
solidified their view of Giuliani and his aides as barbarians at
the gate of artistic expression and dangerous threats to their own
sense of civic order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows no amenability to civilized discourse with anyone who
disagrees with him, so what do you do?'' said Richard W. Hulbert, a
retired managing partner of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &AMP; Hamilton, a
large Manhattan law firm. ``You've got Attila the Hun baying at you
from City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Several trustees said they had walked into the boardroom unsure
of what the board would do. Events had transpired so quickly that
no one was sure of the overall sentiment. They had no clear idea
how many trustees might support a proposal _ floated and then
quickly withdrawn the day before by the board chairman, Robert S.
Rubin _ to remove the Ofili painting.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Hess finished speaking, several trustees said,
there was no longer a doubt about the board's mood. The tense body
language, the fixed facial expressions, the sighs of disgust pretty
much said it all. With one dissenting vote _ from Lhota, the
mayor's representative on the board _ the trustees passed a
resolution authorizing the exhibition to go forward and Rubin to
take any legal action necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that he went to the meeting in peace and that, if
anything, some of the board members were rude to him. He
particularly recalled a man in a handlebar mustache snickering
during his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   As the voting proceeded, Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment
lawyer who had been retained by the museum the day before, kept a
nervous eye on the clock. At 4:56 p.m., the moment voting finished,
Abrams said, he quietly excused himself to call his office, which
then called one of his associates, who was standing by at federal
District Court in Brooklyn waiting for the signal to file a lawsuit
against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, who sat next to Abrams during the meeting, thought nothing
of the sudden departure. ``I thought he was going to the men's
room,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, most of the trustees had been left in the
dark, too. They had not been told that a lawsuit had already been
drawn up, or that it was to be filed the moment they voted. Mrs.
Soros, returning home that night from a dinner honoring Richard C.
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, turned on
the television and heard the news that the museum had filed suit.
She thought the reporter got the story wrong. ``I had no idea,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Abrams' tactical desire to catch the city by
surprise, the secrecy surrounding the lawsuit reflected the extent
and style of Rubin's influence over the museum. A shy man with a
terse, understated manner _ ``I don't like being in the
newspapers,'' he had told Hess _ Rubin is revered by the museum's
staff for his generosity in time and money. He donated more than $1
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Yale and the Harvard Graduate School of
Business, Rubin joined Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment
firm, in 1958, the same year he and his wife moved to Brooklyn.
Regarded on Wall Street as a brilliant banker, Rubin rose to the
presidency of Lehman Brothers, a position from which he surely
could have had his pick of museum boards. He picked the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, he said, out of a sense of duty to the place where
he and his wife raised four children. ``Brooklyn was good to us,
and I felt that's where I wanted to spend my time that was not
involved in business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is Rubin's authority at the museum that he felt free to
meet with Hess and discuss possible concessions to Giuliani without
informing the board or the museum's director, Arnold Lehman.
Equally telling, after word of the negotiations leaked _ much to
the chagrin of Rubin _ neither Lehman nor the other board members
criticized Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody questions Bob's good faith,'' said Eugene J. Keilin,
chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. ``He's worked too
hard and too long.''
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of demographics, Rubin and the board's 40 or
so trustees are worlds away from the audience the museum is hoping
to attract. Under Lehman, the museum has tried to attract a young,
hip, ethnically diverse audience with a taste for cutting-edge art.
Thus the ``Sensation'' exhibition and its advertisements warning
that viewing it may induce vomiting or shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   The museum board, on the other hand, is establishment all the
way, overwhelmingly white and not at all to be confused with
Generation X. A museum spokeswoman, Sally Williams, said three
trustees are members of minority groups. The trustees are a mixture
of major Wall Street players, corporate and civic leaders, or their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very sensible people,'' Hulbert said. ``They're not
bomb throwers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have roots in Brooklyn, in the arts or in both. Several
visited the museum as children, taking drawing lessons, going on
treasure hunts, or wondering what exactly was inside the mummies.
Others, like Seth S. Faison, a retired insurance executive, form a
kitchen cabinet of Brooklyn leaders who have cross-pollinated the
boards of the borough's major institutions, and who have made a
strategic decision to align Brooklyn's cultural institutions with
the avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   It has little to do with artistic preferences _ Faison allowed
that many on the academy board preferred the Boston Pops over
Philip Glass _ and a lot to do with extracting Brooklyn's cultural
scene from the long, dominant shadow of Manhattan. So when a
trustee like Jack A. Josephson, an Egyptologist, says that being on
the Brooklyn Museum of Art board ``is not as socially acceptable''
as being on the board of the Museum of Modern Art or the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, he does not say this defensively. He
means it as a point of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Friede said: ``I have relatives on the board of the Met.
Brooklyn is a different kind of board. The Met is sort of like IBM.
While it's considered a great honor, most of what they do is write
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are big checks, far bigger and more plentiful than
those written for the Brooklyn Museum of Art. And if the trustees
of the Brooklyn museum like to think they are in it to elevate art
and not their social status, some suspect that Giuliani felt
emboldened to move against them because he perceived a weakness.
``I'm sure that was in his mind _ `Oh, they're easy game,'''
Josephson said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the trustees wanted to prove otherwise, to
serve notice that the Brooklyn Museum of Art is nobody's cultural
punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman had already been quietly trying to beef up the board,
recruiting not only Luce but also Mary Schmidt Campbell, a former
city cultural affairs commissioner who is dean of the Tisch School
of the Arts at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing solid public support for the museum, and with
presidential candidates being asked for their opinions about the
museum, many of the trustees now exude a giddy confidence.
</P>
<P>
   They are certain, absolutely certain, they say, that they will
prevail in court. They argue, optimistically, that it will have
been a price well worth paying if one result of the controversy is
that the Brooklyn Museum of Art is branded into the consciousness
of New York City as a pretty cool place to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   But there are pessimists, too, trustees who hold a deep fear
that, win or lose, Giuliani will find a way to hurt the museum. Or
as Friede put it: ``Mommy is going to be mad. And next year is
Christmas. And next year Mommy is going to find a way to slip us a
lump of coal.''

FORD AND AUTOWORKERS AVERT STRIKE WITH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mo., Minn.)  (mk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ After round-the-clock negotiations lasting
nearly 30 hours, the United Automobile Workers union reached a
tentative agreement Saturday with Ford Motor Co. on a new contract
for its 101,000 unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UAW has reached a tentative agreement with Ford on a new
contract covering hourly workers at Ford facilities in the United
States,'' the union and the company announced in a joint statement
at 1:30 Saturday afternoon. Both the union and the company refused
to discuss any details of the contract until they have had a chance
to discuss the contract with workers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Ford contract is expected to have terms nearly
identical to those in contracts the union already reached with
other auto companies, it is expected to cover four years and call
for hefty raises.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's unionized workers would get annual raises of 3 percent on
top of increases that nearly compensate for inflation. In addition,
they would get a $1,350 signing bonus and sweetened pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized workers were awaiting details of the contract, but
were pleased that a threatened strike at midnight Friday did not
materialize, despite negotiations that continued past the strike
deadline. Workers are expected to ratify the contract later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people are relieved,'' said Rob Bellamy, a
trustee at Local 845 in Plymouth, Mich., where workers build
heaters, radiators and other auto parts for Ford. ``We haven't
heard any other information except that there is a tentative
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Saturday ends the union's drive this fall to
negotiate new labor contracts covering the nation's 400,000
unionized autoworkers, whose contracts were due to expire Sept. 14
but were extended during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, the union reached a deal with DaimlerChrysler Corp.
covering its 75,000 factory workers in the United States. On Sept.
28, the union reached a deal with General Motors Corp. covering its
143,200 blue-collar workers and 48,000 workers at Delphi Automotive
Systems, the auto parts unit that GM spun off to shareholders in
May. This week, the union told Ford it would end the current
contract at 11:59 p.m. on Friday, and would call a strike if no
agreement had been reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   With auto companies earning record profits, the union was able
to force them to share the wealth with blue-collar workers, who now
earn $50,000 to $100,000, depending on the amount of overtime they
work and the levels of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fattest contract in decades,'' said John Casesa,
an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``The auto industry has been in
continuous restructuring since the early '70s, so this was a rare
opportunity to get a piece of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The union had threatened to strike to show dissatisfaction with
Ford's plan to spin off its giant Visteon Automotive Systems unit
to shareholders. Nearly a quarter of Ford's unionized workers toil
in Visteon factories, and they feared that their jobs and pensions
would be less secure if Visteon were an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continued past the midnight Friday deadline,
thousands of workers at four Ford factories walked off the job,
causing Ford to lose about 13 1/2 hours of production. Workers
building Ford Explorers in St. Louis; pickup trucks and sedans in
Kansas City, Mo.; Ranger pickups in St. Paul, Minn., and Mercury
Cougars in Flat Rock, Mich., walked off their jobs at midshift.
However, the company said Saturday morning that workers at those
factories had reported to work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither the union nor the company released details
Saturday, Ford was expected to have promised wage and job
protection for its 23,500 Visteon workers in the event of a
spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there has been for six months now very intense
separation anxiety prevailing among the Visteon workers,'' said
Scott Merlis, a managing director and head of the automotive
practice at Wasserstein Perella Securities. The fact that the union
and the company overcame those fears without a strike, he said,
``really shows the strength of the historical, amicable
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it has been 23 years since there has been a strike at
Ford, which has basked in sunny labor relations as its rival,
General Motors, suffered 17 strikes in the last six years,
including one last year that cost it $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But after two weeks of bargaining resulted in a settlement here
at Ford's headquarters, local unions _ which had rushed to assemble
picket signs _ were able to put them away again, unused.

A SCRAMBLE FOR OFFICE SPACE IN JERSEY CITY, MANHATTAN'S `WEST
BANK' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest address for investment bankers today is the former
home of a toothpaste and detergent factory.
</P>
<P>
   It is not on Fifth Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas or Wall
Street, but across the Hudson River in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is about to close on the purchase of a
waterfront parcel for a million-square-foot office tower where
1,300 workers once churned out Colgate toothpaste, according to
real estate executives and Jersey City officials. And Goldman Sachs
&AMP; Co., the investment bank, is negotiating with Colgate-Palmolive
Co. to buy as many as four other parcels for what could be 3.9
million square feet of office space.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co. will move its entire operations there from
the General Motors building. And, real estate brokers said,
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette is looking for space for its Internet
business at the 20-acre site, where Colgate's landmark 55-foot
octagonal clock still illuminates the Jersey City waterfront at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hottest address in town,'' said Leonard Boxer, a real
estate lawyer with Stroock &AMP; Stroock &AMP; Lavan who has many Wall
Street clients and a residential project at the Colgate site.
``Jersey City is benefiting from its proximity to where the action
is: New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chase Manhattan Corp. announced that it would move
3,500 back-office jobs to Florida and Texas, while continuing to
expand in Manhattan. But most financial companies are looking
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a repeat of the late 1970s or early '90s, when some
Manhattan companies fled a recession- and crime-racked city. Wall
Street is increasingly looking to what New Jersey developers like
to call the West Bank of Manhattan for back office space and,
occasionally, a new headquarters, because financial companies are
booming and large blocks of office space are virtually nonexistent
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City is less expensive and only minutes away by PATH
train or ferry. State and local governments there are willing to
provide enormous tax breaks and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these financial services firms are bursting at the
seams,'' said Richard B. Clark, president of Brookfield Financial
Properties, a major Manhattan landlord. ``They're moving
nonessential functions across the river so they can expand the
front office in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of losing large segments of the financial industry,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has provided $2 billion in tax breaks to 50
large corporations threatening to leave Manhattan. But his
administration has failed, urban planners say, to create back
office space in Brooklyn or Queens that may stem some of the
defections to Jersey City, where office rents are $10 to $30 a
square foot cheaper than in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the last real estate boom, in the 1980s, Mayor Ed Koch
oversaw the development of office buildings in the Long Island City
section of Queens, as well as the Metrotech complex in downtown
Brooklyn, which serves as back office space for Chase Manhattan
Bank and other companies. But those projects have been full for
years.
</P>
<P>
   H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, a
nongovernmental planning group, said the city should have provided
land and incentives to developers to build additional office space
on waterfront sites outside Manhattan, rather than giving corporate
giants like Time Warner, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley billions
in tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no economic development policy,'' Shostal said.
``They've thrown all the incentives at the big guys and they don't
have anything left for the development of back office space or the
small- and medium-sized firms that generate a lot of job growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy L. Levine, deputy mayor for economic development,
disagreed sharply with Shostal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to our success in retaining and attracting companies,
there is a shortage of space in Manhattan,'' Levine said. ``We are
trying to find, and in some cases have succeeded, in finding back
office space in Staten Island and College Point, Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   But developers say no Wall Street company would go to College
Point or Staten Island, the psychological equivalent of the other
side of the moon. It is the Colgate site that is suddenly in the
corporate searchlight.

<P>
   Unlike the developers of other Jersey City office parks, Colgate
wants to sell the land rather than lease it. The company's Jersey
City factory closed in 1986 after more than a century of operation.
Colgate sought to turn the site into an office park, and in 1992, a
developer completed what is now called 101 Hudson Street, offices
for both Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. But not much else
happened for years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hartz Mountain Industries is completing one office building
at 90 Hudson Street, which will be a home for Lord, Abbett and the
National Discount Brokers Group, and is starting a second on
another Colgate site.
</P>
<P>
   SJP Properties, one of the largest commercial developers in New
Jersey, recently bought the only remaining factory building at
Colgate and plans to transform it into modern office space, which
has attracted Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, as well as other
potential tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives on both sides of the river said Merrill
Lynch would soon complete the acquisition of another parcel for a
large office tower at Colgate. Merrill will almost certainly enjoy
a number of tax breaks, just as it has in Manhattan. Peter
Riguardi, the real estate broker representing Merrill Lynch,
declined to discuss the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jersey City affords large companies the ability to get large
blocks of office space at competitive prices,'' Riguardi said.
``The Colgate sites, in particular, provide them the ability to
control the development.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the developer Lester Fisher won approval from the
Jersey City planning board for a twin-towered complex with 650
apartments that would rise nearly 30 stories over a garage on the
Colgate property.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the prospect of Goldman Sachs' buying all the
remaining land at Colgate that has Jersey City buzzing. The
investment bank has doubled in size (to 3.5 million square feet)
and the number of employees (10,180) in lower Manhattan over the
last four years. Goldman anticipates it will need an additional 2
million square feet by 2004, which brought it to the Colgate site,
where it would own the land.
</P>
<P>
   New York City officials say that Goldman has talked to them
about a vacant lot at the north end of the World Financial Center,
or the office tower over a new trading complex for the New York
Stock Exchange, if and when it is built. But many brokers are
betting on Colgate, where, they said, Goldman is negotiating a
contract to buy two parcels and an option on two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldman Sachs is interested in tying up all the remaining
office sites on the river,'' said Joseph Barry, chairman of The
Applied Cos., a residential developer on the Jersey coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the number of companies landing on the Jersey City
beachfront is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the focus on the waterfront will become even more
intense over the next 18 months'' as the economy slows and
corporations become more interested in reducing costs, said Josh N.
Kurilofs, executive director of Cushman and Wakefield, a real
estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Insurance Services Office, an information
clearinghouse, announced that it would move its headquarters from
Manhattan to an office building under construction at Samuel J.
LeFrak's vast Newport complex on the water in Jersey City. LeFrak
is just finishing a separate building in Newport that will have
offices for PaineWebber, U.S. Trust and Cigna.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Murray, a spokesman for Colgate, declined to discuss any
pending deals. But, he added, ``If everything were to happen, it
would be the culmination of a dream we set out for that site 13
years ago.''

STATEMENTS IN LOUIMA CASE BECOME ISSUE IN LATEST TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two years, they have been hovering in the shadows of one of
the most heavily publicized cases of police brutality in New York
City: two police officers charged with lying about what they saw
when Abner Louima was tortured in a Brooklyn police station.
</P>
<P>
   As the case of the two officers, Rolando Aleman, 29, and
Francisco Rosario, 34, moves toward a trial early next year in
federal District Court in Brooklyn, prosecution and defense lawyers
are skirmishing over a crucial question: whether the prosecutors
are illegally using evidence that was supposed to be off limits.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are statements that Aleman and Rosario made to Police
Department investigators not long after Louima, a Haitian immigrant
who was arrested in a street brawl, was attacked in August 1997 by
officers of the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn. Two officers were
convicted and three were acquitted in connection with the actual
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman and Rosario, although not members of the precinct,
happened to be in the Flatbush station house on another case when
Louima was tortured in a bathroom by a precinct officer, Justin A.
Volpe, who rammed a stick into Louima's rectum, causing severe
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers were later questioned by Police Department
investigators about what they had seen. Under department
procedures, officers questioned under such circumstances are told
that any statements they make and any evidence derived from such
statements will not be used in any criminal prosecution against
them.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers were charged with lying to federal
investigators during interviews that were separate from their
sessions with the Police Department. The prosecutors say the
officers first falsely denied they were in the cell area of the
station when Volpe placed Louima in a cell after attacking him.
</P>
<P>
   In later interviews, the prosecutors say, Aleman and Rosario
admitted they had been in the cell area, but falsely said they saw
a different officer place Louima in the cell.
</P>
<P>
   Just what Aleman and Rosario told the Police Department
investigators was not revealed in court papers questioning whether
prosecutors used improper materials, and a defense lawyer in the
case declined to say on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense's papers charge that the two officers'
statements to Police Department investigators might well have been
illegally used by federal investigators and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers contended that it ``strains credulity'' that
the statements, or evidence stemming from them, were not
``transferred to the federal prosecutors.'' They asked that the
judge in the case, Eugene H. Nickerson, hold a hearing to determine
whether the evidence the prosecution plans to offer at the trial
has been tainted and should be excluded, which could weaken the
prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   But, in responding last week, the U.S. Attorney's office in
Brooklyn said that officials in the office responsible for
prosecuting Aleman and Rosario ``have not been exposed'' to the
statements made to police investigators. Certain members of the
office received copies of the interviews, the response said, but
those officials were not involved in investigating and prosecuting
the two officers, and the people who were involved were not given
or told of the statements.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the two officers lied because they wanted to
avoid becoming witnesses against a fellow officer, a reticence that
law enforcement officials have called the blue wall of silence.
Cracks appeared in that wall when several other officers testified
for the prosecution in the earlier trial, which Volpe interrupted
to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The jury went on to convict another officer, Charles Schwarz, of
helping Volpe, but acquitted three other defendants _ Sgt. Michael
Bellomo and Officers Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese _ of other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have denied they lied to federal investigators, and
on Friday a lawyer for Rosario, Richard W. Levitt, said, ``You can
be sure there's a powerful and credible defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The two officers, who were members of the Street Crimes Unit in
Brooklyn at the time Louima was attacked, are on restricted duty
pending the outcome of their case. If convicted of lying to federal
officials, they could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.

SCHOOLS FIND PLUSES IN MARATHON-LENGTH CLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Va., Wis.)  (lb) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTSDALE, N.Y. _ Deborah Valentino's seventh-grade English
class had just passed the 60-minute mark when she suddenly swung
open a classroom window, hoping the autumn air would act like a
cold washcloth on the faces of her 25 students.
</P>
<P>
   They had been heatedly deconstructing the character of Long John
Silver, the two-faced mutineer at the center of ``Treasure
Island,'' but there were still 20 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put your head down!'' Ms. Valentino shouted at a
12-year-old boy who was fighting a sore throat, his cheek nestled
on his folded hands. ``We have a lot to do today.''
</P>
<P>
   In another era, Ms. Valentino's sixth-period class would have
ended after 40 minutes, but like hundreds of middle and high
schools across the United States _ more than one out of three, by
some estimates _ Woodlands Middle School rearranged its academic
day last year into a ``block schedule.'' Core courses like English,
math, science, social studies and foreign language now are held in
80-minute marathons, every other day, with no course being held two
days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest to remake schools in recent years, education
reformers in New York, Virginia and Colorado, among other states,
have repeatedly turned to the block schedule _ with the firm belief
that it gives teachers more time to probe topics in depth and gives
adolescents fewer opportunities to get in trouble while roaming
school halls.
</P>
<P>
   But tinkering with school culture, even a bell schedule, is
never easy, and the challenge of asking teachers and students alike
to sit still for 80 uninterrupted minutes was underscored
dramatically last week when teachers in Yonkers went on strike,
largely over the superintendent's introduction of block scheduling
at the beginning of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yonkers teachers, their planning books filled with lessons
that had never had to run more than 45 minutes, said that the
superintendent, Andre Hornsby, had confirmed his plans only days
before the start of school. When the strike was settled on
Wednesday, after a four-day walkout, the longtime schedule was
restored and the block schedule was put on hold for further study.
</P>
<P>
   To the teachers at Woodlands, in a separate district a few miles
north of Yonkers in Westchester County, the abruptness with which
the Yonkers superintendent had added block scheduling seems
inconceivable: Before such schedules were installed here, teachers,
parents and business leaders formed a committee that studied the
issue for two years. Once the plan was approved, the teachers had
an entire summer to rework their lessons, exploring ways to break
up their new-found time into what might in effect be several
classes, with lectures supplemented by extended group work, quiet
study and presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change your teaching style,'' said Ms. Valentino,
who has worked at Woodlands for 23 years. ``I don't feel as
stressed out, feeling like I had to scrunch everything into 40
minutes. Things aren't left hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the concept is still fairly new, preliminary studies in
North Carolina _ where nearly three-quarters of all high schools
have switched to block schedules since 1992 _ indicate that
students in the longer classes generally did as well, and often
better, on standardized tests when compared with their peers on
more traditional schedules.
</P>
<P>
   But tests are only one measure of an educational experiment's
promise: Other studies have suggested that students on block
schedules had fewer suspensions and were more likely to make the
honor roll, and that their teachers reported feeling more relaxed,
said Michael Rettig, an expert on block scheduling who is an
associate professor of education at James Madison University in
Harrisonburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the block schedule, which first migrated
to U.S. school districts from Ontario and British Columbia in the
early '90s, has won universal acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as little surprise that there is at least one
anti-block-schedule Web site _ www.jefflindsay.com/Block.shtml,
which was created by a Wisconsin parent who contends that an
adolescent is too restless to be confined in a classroom so long.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the material listed on the site is a study of the British
Columbia experience by Gordon Gore, a retired physics teacher who
taught for two decades in a small city high school north of
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt the ideal period was 55 minutes to an hour,''
Gore said in a phone interview. ``Beyond that, my personal
experience is that you don't use the time efficiently. You wind up
filling the rest of the time with homework, which they should be
doing elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At Woodlands, a school of 300, the new schedule has proved most
challenging to teachers of math and special education, who put a
premium on seeing their students, and reviewing material with them,
daily. A concept introduced on a Thursday might not be revisited
until Tuesday, if a Monday holiday intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My students need the consistency,'' said Mary Mekeel, who has
taught children with learning disabilities at Woodlands for 10
years. ``I'd take 80 minutes, every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Valentino, the English teacher, has embraced her new
hours, and it shows in her class, which is studying
``Frankenstein,'' ``Our Town'' and ``Treasure Island,'' among other
works this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, she opened the class with a quiz, allowed
perhaps 20 minutes for students to finish a writing assignment
while she stood by to answer questions (``What's watered-down
rum?'' one boy asked), and then permitted them to read another
chapter of ``Treasure Island'' silently before engaging in a
half-hour dialogue. There was even time for Ms. Valentino to take
the discussion off on a tangent, albeit one relevant to literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you use white-out like you're painting a fence,'' she
told her students at one point as they completed their assignments
at their one-piece, formica-and-metal desks. ``You're like
Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment prompted a brief exchange over how Samuel Clemens
came to take the name Mark Twain _ from the periodic shout of the
riverboat captains seeking to mark the depth of the Mississippi
River. That, in turn, led back to the ship's setting on ``Treasure
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States and Canada, there have been two main
branches of the block schedule. While, in general, neither
appreciably adds to or subtracts from the total minutes spent in
one class over the span of a year, the concentration of those
minutes is greater.
</P>
<P>
   In one variation, a course like mathematics meets for a double
period every day for an entire semester and then is replaced,
perhaps by science, for the second semester.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Hartsdale, administrators and teachers settled on
another plan, one that alternates a double period of math on one
day with a double period of science on the next, with the hope that
the material in both classes will seem fresh to students at the end
of the year, when standardized tests are taken.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Valentino's class ended at 2:05, having begun at
12:45, all of the students told a visitor they preferred their new
schedules, and not just because homework is no longer due every day
in every subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get to do as much before,'' said Erin Steiner, 12.
``They'd call attendance, you'd take a test and then you'd be
packing up to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cho, 12, conceded, ``Sometimes, when I try to stay put, my
mind wanders and I forget to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the teacher makes jokes once in a while, it's not so
boring,'' he added. ``As long as there's a little fun in there,
it's OK with me.''

DRYING OUT WATERLOGGED HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One unsettling reminder of last month's devastating
assault by Tropical Storm Floyd has been the sight of soggy
furniture along curbs and driveways in suburban metropolitan New
York neighborhoods rarely touched by flood waters in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the waters have receded and the decision to discard
damaged possessions has been grudgingly made, some homeowners may
soon discover that their waterlogged walls are incubators for
air-contaminating mold, mildew and other fungi.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many people having gotten so much water damage, and
with the timing of it coming just at the start of the heating
season, we believe that many homes are at serious risk of having
very poor indoor air quality,'' said Thomas Peter, an industrial
hygienist with Whitman Cos., an environmental engineering company
in East Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Peter explained that unless all water-logged materials in a
house are dried quickly and thoroughly, mold and mildew are likely
to eventually appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moisture in the walls is now the main issue,'' Peter said.
``And when you're turning on the heat and closing all the windows,
you're creating a perfect environment for mold and mildew to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   And when mold and mildew are present, he explained, some people
have allergic reactions to the airborne spores released by the
fungi. They can range from flulike symptoms of fever, chills, and
nasal stuffiness to full-blown respiratory-system infections, Peter
said. Those most susceptible, he continued, are infants and
children, the elderly, and people of any age who have compromised
immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that there's a large population out there that is
highly susceptible to fungus contamination,'' Peter said, noting
that because mold and mildew thrive in areas where moisture is
trapped, the contamination is not always obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small dot on the room side of a wall can mean that the
inside of the wall is covered with black mold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Burge, an associate professor of environmental health at
the Harvard School of Public Health in Cambridge, Mass., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In flooding conditions, there's usually ample time for fungi
to grow,'' Ms. Burge said. ``Within just two weeks you can have a
massive problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Ms. Burge said, people who have allergic
reactions to mold spores have essentially ``acquired'' the allergy
after having been exposed to spores a number of times. There are
cases, however, when even those who are not currently allergic can
become so after a brief but intense exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are exposed to a high dose for even a short while
can get very sick,'' Ms. Burge said. ``And that could conceivably
happen in some of these houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Most contaminated surfaces will eventually dry out, thereby
killing any mold or mildew that may have formed. But that does not
mean the homeowner is in the clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be affected by mold that's dead,'' Ms. Burge said.
``The mold is still there, and the mold allergy doesn't depend on
the fungus being alive.''
</P>
<P>
   What then should a homeowner with a wet basement do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get everything completely dried out,'' said Jeffrey May, a
Cambridge indoor-air-quality consultant, adding that ``everything''
means paneling, studs, wallboard and insulation that may have
gotten wet.
</P>
<P>
   May, who is writing a book on household hazards titled ``My
House is Killing Me'' for Johns Hopkins University Press, said that
once mold or mildew has formed on one surface, it can quickly
spread to other surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, once mold or mildew get a foothold, it is
possible for the fungus to survive on even relatively dry surfaces
if there is an ample supply of humidity in the air _ a scenario
common in many basements.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he said, once wet wood, wallboard, fabric, paneling
and insulation have been removed or dried, it is necessary to
eradicate any mold or mildew that may have already formed.
</P>
<P>
   That can be done, May said, by brushing all such surfaces with a
solution of laundry detergent and bleach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash everything down and let it dry completely,'' he said.
``And never use more bleach than you would use for a load of
laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   May said that homeowners with forced-air heating systems should
make sure that the blower-box _ where the ducts are attached to the
heater _ is clean and dry and that the system's filter is changed.
Failure to do so, he said, could result in the distribution of mold
spores throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Gersh, president of Maxons Restorations, a disaster
remediation company in Manhattan, said that one mistake homeowners
make after a flood is to start rebuilding before everything has
dried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concrete and cinderblock are porous and retain moisture,''
Gersh said. ``So you want to make sure you dry them out before you
start putting things back.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to eliminate moisture from a house, he said, is to use a
commercial-grade dehumidifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have units that can pull 60 pints of water out of the air
in a day,'' Gersh said, noting that such machines can be rented
from equipment-supply houses for $40 to $90 a day. When the outside
air is dry, he said, it is also possible to dehumidify an area by
using an ``air mover'' to remove moist air from the house while
replacing it with dry air from the outside. Such machines can be
rented for $25 to $35 a day.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Gersh said, homeowners who have the time, patience
and determination can use an ``insider's trick'' to rid an area of
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have air conditioning, you set the thermostat at the
coolest level possible and shut the windows and doors,'' Gersh
said. Then, after the house has been thoroughly chilled, he said,
the air conditioning should be turned off and the heat turned on
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the cool air warms up it acts like a sponge,'' he said.
After the temperature has risen, he added, the heat should be
turned off, the windows and doors should be opened and the moist
air should be driven out with fans and cross-ventilation. The cycle
should be continued, he said, for as long as it takes to rid the
house of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Gersh pointed out that it is important to make sure that the
system is in working order before starting, and that the settings
are returned to normal afterward.
</P>
<P>
   One way to determine whether an area has been adequately dried,
he said, is to buy a temperature-humidity gauge and compare the
humidity reading from a room that was not flooded with a reading
from a room that was. A higher reading in the flooded area means
that there is moisture in the walls or floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also use your nose,'' he said. ``If something smells
musty, it's probably still wet.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: CAMPAIGNS OF THE RICH AND IRONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  According to Jedediah Purdy, the earnest 24-year-old author of
the new book ``For Common Things,'' irony is the scourge of our era
_ a smirking, self-knowing stance that serves as a ``marker of
worldliness and maturity'' while sheltering us against the
betrayals and disappointments of politics. And to think that he
wrote that before Jesse Ventura, Warren Beatty and Donald Trump
toyed with the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Goofy presidential candidacies have long enlivened American
history, and many third-party candidates were prophets for
honorable causes. But this year the wonder is that so few
experienced people are running for the White House, even in the
mainstream. Each party has only two serious White House candidates
who have ever been elected to anything before _ Democrats Bill
Bradley and Al Gore and Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain
_ and all of them started at the top because they were famous or
had famous names.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many times when a business background was
regarded as a good qualification for the White House. Trump, after
all, is trying to re-create the ``Ross Perot spring'' of 1992, when
the combustible Texas billionaire was in first place in some
presidential polls. Republicans nominated Wendell Willkie in 1940,
and leaders of businesses and universities were often beseeched to
run for president when the system seemed most broken in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But Trump is better known for his personality than anything he
actually built or accomplished. Today if there are leading figures
in the academic, business or scientific worlds who might qualify
for the presidency, they have little chance of becoming known
without a knack for exploiting the culture's obsession with
celebrities. Famous people fill a void that the writer George W.S.
Trow once called ``the context of no context.'' In his view,
Americans are so busy with work and family that it is easier for
them to relate to the turbulent world of celebrities than to
traditional leadership figures. Personalities like Trump or Beatty
may have useful ideas, and ideas in government often come from
outside the system, but it is their fame that draws attention.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas alone do not make for successful leadership, of course.
Candidates must connect with voters, and a dash of glamour does not
hurt. But one must also remember that Franklin Roosevelt, Abraham
Lincoln and other successful presidents who acted with eloquence,
courage and vision also brought superb skills of political
management, without which they would have failed. Like it or not,
these skills included the art of compromising, reversing course
when necessary, saying different things to different people and
deferring decisions _whether declaring war or signing the
Emancipation Proclamation _ until political circumstances
permitted. These skills are best acquired in mediating the demands
of the legislative and executive branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   The military would seem to be an exception to that rule, but not
really. Speaking of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman predicted
that ``poor Ike'' would arrive at the White House and order
everyone around, only to find none of them doing what they were
told. But Eisenhower proved to be an effective and popular
president precisely because of the political skills he had acquired
in rising to the top in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura is a case in point for the importance of extended
experience approximating the pressures of governing. His
attention-getting gifts as a wrestler served him well in an
insurgent gubernatorial campaign. But his vulgarities and clumsy
trashing of organized religion have revealed a self-destructive
tendency that it is better to know about before putting someone in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Lippmann once derided FDR as having nothing particular to
recommend him for high office except that he really wanted to be
president. But at least he had run for office many times. The
coming year will be livelier if there are candidacies by Ventura,
Beatty, Trump, Cybill Shepherd, Oprah Winfrey or whomever. But in
the end, the voters usually choose to be governed rather than
entertained.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE METS' GOOFY TRADITION AT SHEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf and second-to-last graf with Mets winning
Saturday.) 
 (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the Mets at Shea Stadium in October, it's never
just baseball. It's been shoe polish and pine tar, a brawl at
second base, a box of scuffed balls. It was all those fans ripping
up chunks of grass in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's an ``inflammatory response'' to Mike Piazza's
sprained left thumb that benched their cleanup hitter and catcher
this weekend against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Still, the Mets won
Friday night, 9-2, and again Saturday, 4-3, on a 10th-inning home
run by none other than Piazza's replacement, Todd Pratt, to roar
into the National League Championship Series against the Atlanta
Braves
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known as gatekeeper's sprain,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in October in the House That Truth Built _ the
awful truth that New York needed a NL team to replace the departure
of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants after the 1957
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' tradition in October is being anywhere but Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 40 years since the Mets were organized, they have
qualified for the post-season only five times. But when the Mets
are at Shea in October, things happen. Goofy things that never seem
to happen anywhere else. Such as Piazza's inflammatory response. Or
the pitch in the fifth game of the 1969 World Series that Mets
leftfielder Cleon Jones claimed hit him on the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Lou DiMuro disagreed, but when the ball bounced into the
Mets' dugout, Gil Hodges inspected it, walked up to DiMuro and
showed him the black smudge on the ball from the shoe polish on
Jones' spikes.
</P>
<P>
   DiMuro waved Jones to first base, then Donn Clendenon hit a
two-run homer. When the Mets won, 5-3, they were World Series
champions and thousands of fans suddenly decided to study agronomy.
Thanks in part to the smudge of shoe polish on a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1973 NL Championship Series with the Cincinnati Reds,
Pete Rose objected to shortstop Buddy Harrelson's hard tag and soon
they were rolling in the dirt at second base.
</P>
<P>
   In the brawl that emptied both dugouts and both bullpens, Pedro
Borbon, a Reds' reliever, slugged Buzz Capra, a Mets' righthander.
Duffy Dyer, a Mets' catcher, then slugged Borbon who, in the
confusion, grabbed a cap he thought was his. When he realized it
was a Mets' cap, he chewed it apart with his teeth as he stormed to
the Reds' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose later trotted to left field, he was pelted with
garbage. So much so that Sparky Anderson, the Reds' manager, took
his team off the field and the umpires threatened a forfeit until
Yogi Berra (then the Mets' manager), Tom Seaver, Willie Mays and
Rusty Staub hurried to left field, pleaded with the fans and
restored the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Those Mets went on to upset the mighty Big Red Machine in that
NLCS before losing the World Series to the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1986 NLCS with the Houston Astros, Mike Scott, once a
Met, struck out 14 in the 1-0 opener. When the Astros evened the
series at 2-2 with a 3-1 victory, he induced 14 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets believed that Scott's success was due more to
scuffing the ball than to skill. During that fourth game, Davey
Johnson, the Mets' manager, had the batboy collect foul balls and
any other discarded balls whenever Scott was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fifth game, the Mets displayed a box of the allegedly
scuffed balls to Chub Feeney, the NL president, but Feeney judged
Scott to be not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Mets are such big fans of Mike Scott that they save his
used baseballs,'' said Hal Lanier, the Astros manager, ``they ought
to bring `em over to our clubhouse so he can autograph `em.''
</P>
<P>
   To avert another confrontation with Scott in the seventh game,
the Mets had to win both that fifth game at Shea and a memorable
16-inning sixth game in the Astrodome. Which they did.
</P>
<P>
   Those Mets went on to win the World Series remembered for Mookie
Wilson's grounder that bounced through Red Sox first baseman Bill
Buckner's legs in the sixth game at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In the third game of the 1988 NLCS that the Mets eventually lost
to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, the Dodgers' reliever,
Jay Howell, was ejected for using pine tar to help grip the ball in
the raw chill as the Mets took a 2-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth game Dwight Gooden took a 4-2 lead into the ninth,
but Mike Scioscia hit a tying two-run homer, then Kirk Gibson hit a
homer in the 12th. The next day Gibson's homer triggered a 7-4
victory, the last post-season game at Shea until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows that whenever something goofy happens at Shea
in October, the Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   They won the World Series with shoe polish, they won the
pine-tar game with Howell, they won after collecting the allegedly
scuffed baseballs, they won the NLCS with the Rose-Harrelson brawl.
</P>
<P>
   And now, they have moved into the NLCS despite Piazza nursing an
inflammatory response.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have mastered the unexpected, become
practitioners of the surprise. Will the Mets ever do anything the
easy way again? And how much more fairy &UR;  &LR; tale can their season get?
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt, Mike Piazza's little-used backup who was playing
because the superstar's thumb was badly swollen, slugged a home run
with one out in the 10th inning to help the Mets continue to spin
their through-the-looking-glass tale with a 4-3 victory over
Arizona that propels them into the National League Championship
Series that begins Tuesday against _ oh, no _ Atlanta. The Mets
skipped onto the field as Pratt's ball sailed over the center-field
wall and then Shea Stadium erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tried everything from saying novenas to blowing smoke
on their bats in an attempt to pull their season together after
their recent encounters with the Braves and it worked. They are the
first Mets team to win a playoff series since 1986, when the Mets
won the World Series. Now, with the dreaded Braves on the horizon
yet again, the Mets can hope that the karma has turned in their
favor. Consider: The last wild card team to advance out of the
division series was the Florida Marlins in 1997. The Marlins won
the World Series with _ you can practically see the planets lining
up, can't you? _ Al Leiter pitching Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Four outs away from a trip to the NLCS, Armando Benitez, the
fireballing closer who had not allowed a hit in his previous four
appearances, gave up a two-run double to Jay Bell that boosted
Arizona to a 3-2 lead. Then, Edgardo Alfonzo scored to tie the game
on a Roger Cedeno fly ball in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was assisted by Tony Womack, who had just moved from
shortstop to right field (a move he had made seven times during the
season), when he dropped a John Olerud fly ball. But after the Mets
loaded the bases against Arizona's spectacular closer Matt Mantei _
a process interrupted by third-base coach Cookie Rojas' furious
argument that a Darryl Hamilton shot had dropped fair rather than
foul in left field (it was barely foul on the replay) _ Rey Ordonez
struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for Pratt's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, a player so hyperkinetic that he rarely stands still on
the mound, wove his second straight superb outing Saturday. He had
shut out Cincinnati in the game that won the wild card for the Mets
and Saturday held Arizona to three hits. But he left the game after
putting runners on first and second with two outs _ Womack reached
first when Alfonzo could not backhand a grounder that would have
ended the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter tipped his hat to the roaring crowd of 56,177 and watched
Benitez give up a rare hit to Bell to score the two runs that put
Arizona ahead. Only an outstanding throw from leftfielder Melvin
Mora on a Matt Williams shot into left field that got Bell at the
plate prevented worse damage and gave Alfonzo the opportunity to
tie the score and send the game to extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wanted desperately to avoid a return to Arizona for
Game 5, where Randy Johnson awaited. But, for the first time in at
least three weeks, there was little pressure on the Mets and in the
upside-down world in which they have thrived for the last week,
that was not the best news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you gave me a choice or anybody on on the team a
choice, we don't want to have to face Randy,'' Pratt said before
Saturday's game. ``The pressure is all on them. We are up. They
have to win. We don't have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets have played their most inspired games during their
comeback from a seven-game losing streak when the situation seemed
most dire. When the pressure abated _ as it did in Game 2, when the
Mets had already beaten Johnson in Game 1 _ the Mets faltered,
scoring just one run off Todd Stottlemyre. Saturday, the Mets again
struggled early to generate runs against Brian Anderson, whom
Arizona manager Buck Showalter had chosen to start, rather than
bring Johnson back on short rest.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was 8-2 with a 4.57 ERA, but over his last four starts
of the regular season, Anderson had an ERA of 1.98. Part of the
reason for his success was his ability to limit home runs, a
problem that had plagued him earlier in his career. He tied for
most home runs allowed (38) in the National League last year and he
gave up 16 homers through 18 outings this season. But in his last
13 outings, Anderson gave up just two, a stretch of 641/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, though, after having just one base runner through the
first three innings, Alfonzo opened the fourth inning with a blast
to left field off a 2-2 pitch. It rose quickly and the crowd gasped
as Luis Gonzalez went back and then up on the wall to try to
retrieve the ball. Instead, it landed in the first row of seats for
a 1-0 lead. It was Alfonzo's third home run of the division series.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were having no better luck against Leiter. He
had been superb in his two previous starts, beating Atlanta by
holding the Braves to two runs on five hits, and then pitching a
two-hit shutout of Cincinnati last Monday in the playoff game.
Leiter seems to thrive in spotlight games, and his teammates had
joked about trying to convince him that Game 4 was do or die. And
he did again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a handful of spectacular defensive plays,
including a sliding, shoetop catch by Hamilton of Bell's fly ball
in the fourth, Leiter took a no-hitter into the fifth inning. He
got Williams to fly out to Rickey Henderson to start the fifth. But
then he fell behind Greg Colbrunn, 3-1. Leiter had already walked
two batters, and he had to throw a strike here. He did, and with
that one pitch, which Colbrunn blasted over the left field wall and
Henderson's leap, Leiter had lost the no-hitter and the lead. It
was the first run Leiter had given up after working 17 consecutive
scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets regained the lead when Benny Agbayani, batting in the
cleanup spot for the second straight day in Piazza's absence,
stroked a double to the gap in right center that scored Henderson
with one out. But groundouts by Robin Ventura and Pratt ended the
inning with Olerud, who had earlier hit a single that he could not
stretch into a double, standing on third base. That set the stage
for the wild eighth inning, when the Diamondbacks took the lead,
then were tied by Alfonzo's run.

 &HT;    Hawks' Mutombo a happy man
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ In troubled times, Dikembe Mutombo would go
home to Africa, to his family in Kinsasha, in the former Zaire (now
Congo) and the visit would be brief, maybe three days, and furtive.
Neither he nor his family nor the people of his country were
comfortable under the dictatorship of the late dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
   But these are increasingly better days.
</P>
<P>
   Last August when Mutombo went home to push harder for the
establishment of a new hospital in Kinsasha, he was in the company
of a TV crew from CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' by American doctors and
members of the U.S. government. He was so well received, the
emotional Mutombo said, that in recounting the story of his visit
tears spring to eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welcoming I got this year I never had before when I went
home. The way the people welcome me, ministers, people from the
government, people in the street were crying just to see me. Crying
when they were shaking my hand. I wondered to myself, I never
thought I have such major impact on my country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Ed Bradley will tell the story this
fall and Mutombo looks forward to that. ``Ed Bradley couldn't
believe what he saw _ that I'm going to build a hospital. I'm the
first person to bring this money together, to bring so much
medicine together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal fund-raising campaign, Mutombo has learned
a hard lesson. ``I'm not raising really so much from individuals as
I thought I would. But there are corporations who want to help me.
Turner, Chevron, Mobil. Other companies that have business in
Africa. They want to be represented. By contributing to this
hospital they send the word to the rest of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many ambitious projects, Mutombo's hospital for 250 beds
is actually getting less expensive to construct, simply because he
is building out, not up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about building a high-rise hospital. But I been
doing a study and we find that when they build a high-rise in
Africa, including two in Kinsasha already, they have problems with
maintenance. Elevators don't work, things like that, so now we are
going to build on one level. There's no problem moving a patient
from one building to another and that cuts cost. The more you build
flat, the more you save. We have two architects. One says it will
cost no more than $30 million, the other says no more than $50
million. So I told both of them to do their feasibility study and
we'll see. We thought it would cost $55 million, but now we believe
it will be less.''
</P>
<P>
   So, things are going well for Mutombo's hospital and after one
week of training camp, things also are going well for Mutombo's
basketball. ``I am very comfortable with the new people around
me,'' he said. ``I have to contribute as much as I can to make the
club successful, but I know what I have to do: rebound, block
shots, crash the offensive boards. If I can accomplish those three
things, my team is going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not your father's Hawks. The game is decidedly
uptempo, wild, but fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are running and although Mutombo often dawdled in his
early years with the club, he is as eager as any rookie to get up
and down.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent autobiography, Larry Bird recounts the trials of
Robert Parish. When he first joined the Celtics under Bill Fitch,
Parish could not keep up. Soon, he was out in front on the break,
dunking, getting quick jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo can see himself in that role. ``Things get better when
you have a big man who can run. For myself, I've never had any
complaints from any coach I've played for in my eight years that
the big fellow cannot get up and down the floor. I always give of
myself.'' But if they are tuned into a running game, don't think
the Hawks will cheat on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the aggressive style of defense Lenny (coach
Wilkins) wants us to play, it's still going to be hard for a team
to score 100 points against us,'' Mutombo said. ``If they do, we
will tell ourselves we didn't do our job. I don't care, if you have
a guy who can block a shot, a guy can box out, a guy who can
rebound, you will not give up a lot of points.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also true when players are happy.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo says, ``Me? I'm a very happy man.''

But the real heat, the farmers say, comes from a $206 billion

will keep climbing and escalating excise taxes will further
diminish domestic demand. That means Kentucky farmers will need to
grow less tobacco. Their toil has made Kentucky the state most
economically reliant on tobacco and helped generate the country's

SOME ANXIOUS MOMENTS AS BRAVES OUST ASTROS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ By holding off a late Houston rally, the Atlanta
Braves moved on to the next round Saturday in the last game ever
played at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   After building a 7-0 lead in the sixth inning, then watching the
Astros fight back, the Braves advanced to the National League
Championship series against the Mets with an emotional 7-5 victory.
By winning the best-of-5 series, 3-1, the Braves advanced to face
New York in a best-of-7 series starting Tuesday night in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Houston refused to go quietly in the ninth inning. Stan Javier
opened by drawing a walk off the relief pitcher John Rocker, then a
wild pitch by Rocker moved Javier to second base. But Rocker got a
big strikeout against Jeff Bagwell, who finished just 2 for 13 in
another disappointing playoff series for him. Bagwell tried to
check his swing on the third strike, but the home plate umpire,
Dana DeMuth, ruled that Bagwell had swung.
</P>
<P>
   With his adrenaline rushing, Rocker, throwing extremely hard,
struck out Carl Everett, bringing the dangerous Ken Caminiti to the
plate with a chance to tie the score. But Caminiti was retired on a
deep fly to center field that was run down by Andruw Jones, and the
Braves, who led the major leagues with 103 regular-season
victories, began to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who will move into a new downtown stadium next year
after playing at the Astrodome since 1965, were eliminated in the
first round for the third consecutive year; they have never won a
postseason series. The Braves advanced to the NLCS for the eighth
time this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros showed tremendous character in the eighth inning with
a four-run rally that cut Atlanta's lead to 7-5 and knocked John
Smoltz out of the game. Bagwell started the surge with a single,
then Smoltz hit Everett with a pitch. Caminiti, Houston's best
player in the series, cleared the bases with a three-run home run
to center field that brought the fans to their feet, hoping they
might witness a stunning comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta manager Bobby Cox had seen enough of Smoltz at that
point, and replaced him with Terry Mulholland. With nobody out, the
fans were still on their feet, looking for more runs. Chris Spiers
flied out to center field, but Tony Eusebio followed with a single.
That brought Tim Bogar, who had two hits, to the plate. Bogar
delivered again, this time crushing a line-drive double to the
left-center-field gap to score Eusebio all the way from first base.
Now the Astrodome was really rocking, with Houston bringing the
potential tying run to the plate and still only one out.
</P>
<P>
   Cox made another pitching change, turning to Kevin McGlinchy to
face Daryle Ward. McGlinchy got Ward on a ground ball to first
base, while Bogar went to third base. That brought up Craig Biggio,
who has struggled mightily in the postseason throughout his career.
Biggio had a dismal career.130 postseason average before this
series. Saturday, Biggio was 0 for 3 in his first three at-bats,
making him 2 for 17 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox took no chances, replacing McGlinchy with Rocker to face
Biggio. And Biggio continued to fail under pressure, as he struck
out swinging to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta threatened to rout Houston with a five-run sixth inning
to go ahead by 7-0. The Braves sent 10 batters to the plate, and
they whacked seven singles, chasing Shane Reynolds from the game
and also manhandling relief pitcher Chris Holt. Brian Jordan, the
offensive star of the series, opened the rally with a single,
followed by a single by Ryan Klesko. At that point, Astros manager
Larry Dierker replaced Reynolds with Holt, but that was like
throwing gasoline on a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Holt surrendered three consecutive hits and three runs. Jones
hit a single to left-center field that scored Jordan, and when left
fielder Spiers bobbled the ball in the outfield, Klesko moved to
third base and Jones moved up to second. Eddie Perez knocked in
both runners with a single that made the score 5-0, then Jose
Hernandez singled Perez to second base. Holt was relieved by Scott
Elarton, but Smoltz sacrificed the runners to second and third
base, and Gerald Williams singled to drive in Perez and Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves grabbed a 1-0 lead in the first inning on a sacrifice
fly by Chipper Jones. Williams had lined the first pitch of the
game into left field past a diving Spiers, and the ball rolled to
the wall for a double. Bret Boone moved Williams to third base with
a fly ball to right field, and Jones' fly ball scored Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz helped himself with his bat, as Atlanta added another run
in the third inning. Smoltz led off the third inning with a double
over the head of right fielder Javier, who was playing shallow.
After Williams sacrificed Smoltz to third base, Boone ripped a
single to left field that scored Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Houston finally scored in the seventh inning on a leadoff home
run by Eusebio, but it seemed too little, too late. When the Astros
needed a timely hit this weekend, they rarely got one. Before the
eighth inning, Houston continued its pattern of wasting scoring
opportunities, leaving a combined five runners on base in the first
two innings while failing to score. In the first inning, the Astros
loaded the bases with two outs, but Spiers grounded out to second
base. In the second inning, Houston had runners on first and third
with two outs, but Javier grounded out to third base.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Astros never recovered from Friday's crushing
12-inning loss in Game 3, in which they failed to score in the 10th
inning after loading the bases with nobody out. They will have all
winter to reflect on that loss, while the Braves will be looking
forward to the next series.

possible use of DeLay aides in campaign.)  
 A POLITICAL PUZZLE OF 2 TEXANS:   BUSH AND DeLAY  
(mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are a couple of leading theories about the
relationship between the Texas Republicans who may soon be running
the country:
</P>
<P>
   A.) That the party's presidential front-runner, Gov. George W.
Bush, and the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, R-Texas, are closer
than we know, ideological kindred spirits who like to play good
cop/bad cop but then share the double-secret conservative handshake
when nobody is looking.
</P>
<P>
   B.) That these two guys from opposite sides of the tracks have
little to nothing in common and if Bush was elected president,
would enjoy roughly as easy a relationship with DeLay as the
governor's father did with Newt Gingrich, the firebrand who later
became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to both men suggest yet another possibility: that
while they are not unfriendly and are at least somewhat
like-minded, they are also similarly tough and competitive _ enough
so to be willing to win at the other's expense, if need be. And
smart enough to recognize, too, that they need each other, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Bush certainly seemed to go out of his
way to poke DeLay and all House Republicans in the eye a couple of
times. First, he accused them of trying to ``balance their budget
on the backs of the poor.'' Then, in a speech on education, he
portrayed his party as fixated on affluence _``focused on the
national economy, to the exclusion of all else.'' But aides to Bush
insist that his later remarks, which had been written before the
first flap occurred, were not intended to cut congressional
Republicans a second time, and seemed harsher in light of the
earlier criticism.
</P>
<P>
   After initially lashing out that the governor ``does not know
how Congress works,'' DeLay is said to be over his pique (or
facsimile of pique, in the alternative view). DeLay, who is
commonly viewed as the real power in the House, volunteers that he
and the governor have ``never had dinner. We aren't social
friends.'' But his comments do advance the theory that the two are
ideologically much closer than their stylistic differences might
suggest. And, of course, no one in the Bush campaign has ever
hinted that their candidate is anything other than a credentialed
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's a whole lot of difference between us,''
DeLay said in a recent interview, before Bush's unflattering
remarks. ``I'm not sure there's a dime's worth of difference
between us, philosophically. I don't know of any moderate Texas
Republicans, if you really want to know. It's conservative and more
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In his quest to put a friendlier face on the Republican Party,
Bush has more reason to put some distance between himself and the
majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, another fellow Texan, and DeLay,
also known as ``the Hammer,'' whom Democrats are trying to make
Bush's de facto running mate. (``Just remember B-A-D,'' said Chris
Lehane, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore. ``Bush-Armey-DeLay:
Bad policy, bad politics, bad for America.'')
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist said that because Bush would be
jettisoning the House Republicans' confrontational style, the
members of Congress hurrying to board the Bush bandwagon seemed to
be catching on only belatedly to the fact that their instant
affection for the governor might not be reciprocal. Most House
Republicans rushing to support him ``never calculated that it was
an act of self-immolation,'' the strategist said, adding that most
were still ``as oblivious to what this means for them over the next
two to four years as a 6-year-old is to the workings of a jet
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   But not so DeLay, who seems both reconciled to the fact that
some distancing is probably inevitable and willing to return the
favor and speak out against the governor, if necessary. ``Bush has
to do what he has to do to win his presidency,'' he said at the end
of last week. After making the critical remarks about fellow
Republicans in last week's education speech, one adviser to the
governor said that Bush had acknowledged that House leaders knew
the score, saying, ``Those guys understand.''
</P>
<P>
   And the governor, in turn, understands that he needs
congressional support _ 152 House members have endorsed him so far,
along with 25 senators _ and so must keep DeLay at least relatively
happy. ``For House Republicans, DeLay is the most important figure,
and within the campaign there's a recognition that we need to be
working with him,'' the Bush adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress have already pitched in with fund-raisers back
home, and will help to turn out the Republican vote in their
districts, where many of them are quite popular. If Bush is
elected, a working relationship with House Republicans would
certainly make life easier, even if they fail to hold on to their
majority. But it is also generally understood that if he has to
sacrifice the House to get elected, he will.
</P>
<P>
   Relations do not seem to have been permanently chilled by the
recent criticism. Aides to the two men socialize, and a couple of
people in DeLay's office have been under serious consideration for
senior positions in the Bush campaign, which already includes
plenty of Capitol Hill veterans. The governor's official liaison on
the Hill, Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who says he talks to the
governor's staff nearly every day, is also DeLay's chief deputy
whip.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bush formally announced his candidacy, he and some
House Republicans had begun meeting informally to discuss an agenda
for 2000. Bush needed their early support, and House Republicans
needed a strong presidential candidate, one with the potential to
help them preserve their slim majority despite some pretty iffy
poll ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' Blunt said recently, ``a lot of our members
endorsed him before they met him,'' but have only become more
enthusiastic as they have gotten to know him, he added. When asked
to name Bush's closest friends on Capitol Hill, he thought for a
while and said, ``I think he and Tom DeLay are friends'' _ again,
not golfing buddies, but political allies with an understanding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In background, bearing and basic style, the two men are
obviously worlds apart: Bush is an Ivy League-educated former owner
of a professional baseball team who was born into a political
dynasty _ a sunny, big-picture guy's guy who likes to get along and
seemed to enjoy governing Texas alongside his good friend, the late
Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, on the other hand, is the son of an alcoholic wildcatter,
a man DeLay describes as ``like something straight out of
`Giant.''' The House whip is a former pest exterminator who made
his own way, got into politics to cut red tape and became a
true-believing, i-dotting and t-crossing, fight-to-the-finish
conservative, the ultimate partisan, and proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush does the forest, DeLay does the trees,'' said Ed
Gillespie, a Republican strategist, with a laugh. ``Bush is
passive-aggressive, DeLay is aggressive-aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by all accounts, seems to regard DeLay with a respect
exactly commensurate with the power he wields in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They first met in 1980, ``when I was first starting,'' DeLay
remembers, ``and his daddy was running with Ronald Reagan.'' Their
first encounter was at a fund-raiser in Houston, where DeLay said
the younger Bush made an impression. ``He was, what's the word I
want? Passionate is too feminine, but he was gung-ho for his daddy.
He was kind of oil field trash _ that's an endearing term, by the
way. And when I first met him he was trying to find himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ``He's certainly smoothed over the edges. Probably
the best thing that ever happened to him was getting involved with
the Texas Rangers, because he focused and learned from that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when President Bush abandoned his no-new-taxes pledge,
DeLay was front and center among House Republicans who opposed him.
And the younger Bush did not enlist DeLay into his gubernatorial
campaign against the incumbent governor, Ann Richards, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay does seem to get along better with the governor than
he ever did with President Bush, referring to the younger Bush as a
fellow Christian and ``much more of a people person'' than his
father. Typically, he likes to position himself as the benefactor,
rather than the supplicant, in the relationship. ``When he needs
something, he calls, and we try to take care of him,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if in truth the balance of power is probably in Bush's
favor, DeLay does have the power to hurt the governor, and those
who know Bush say that means he will try to keep him as close as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   As one Bush supporter who knows them both put it, ``They're
different guys, but at the end of the day, they're both just a
couple of pols. And I can see them now, on the Truman balcony with
their boots up, trading war stories.''

(ATTN: S.C.)  
 COAST GUARD RESCUE ABILITY IS LAGGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the stormy early hours of Dec. 29, 1997, after an ill-fated
decision to abandon the protected waters of the Intracoastal
Waterway and head out to the open sea, the captain of the 34-foot
sailboat Morning Dew set a course for safe harbor in Charleston,
S.C. Neither he nor his three young crewmen would live to see the
coming new year.
</P>
<P>
   What happened that day has been the subject of intense scrutiny
and investigation. Last Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety
Board released a summary of its long-awaited report on the
incident. The board concluded that the 49-year-old skipper, Michael
Wayne Cornett _ whose crew included his two teen-age sons and a
nephew _ and personnel at U.S. Coast Guard Group Charleston played
contributing roles in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Cornett was blamed for his ``failure to assess and respond to
the known risks of the journey that culminated in the vessel's
collision with the jetty at the entrance to Charleston Harbor.''
The Coast Guard was cited for ``substandard performance in
initiating a search-and-rescue response'' _ an SAR in Coast Guard
parlance _ ``to the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Coast Guard, the report comes on the heels of recent
public pronouncements from two high-ranking officials regarding the
service and its overall SAR capability. In his State of the Coast
Guard address last May, Commandant James Loy admitted to ``very
real readiness shortfalls'' across the ranks and likened his troops
to a knife dulled from overuse.
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech at a marine trades show in August, Rear Admiral
Terry Cross said: ``Our distress communications system is
equivalent to what local police and fire departments were using in
the 1950s. I think most recreational boaters would be alarmed to
learn how fragile this weak link in our search-and-rescue system
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulty communications were central to the Morning Dew case. At
2:17 a.m. on that December morning, the Coast Guard received a
distress call that was later confirmed, via computer enhancement,
to be a mayday from the stricken vessel. Unable to re-establish
contact, the Coast Guard ignored the call. Hours later, a
commercial vessel reported hearing voices in the water. But the
Coast Guard did not initiate a search until bodies washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview last week, Cross suggested that, had
available technology been used, the catastrophe could have been
averted. ``The watch-stander did not have the ability to play back
and immediately enhance the transmission,'' he said. ``We think
that equipment should be part and parcel of all our ops centers. If
he'd heard the word mayday, it would've elicited a different
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross listed additional flaws with what is known as the National
Distress System. ``Theoretically, you should be able to make a call
via VHF radio anywhere along the continental coast within 20 miles
and this system would be able to hear you and initiate a response
from us,'' he said. ``The fact is there are numerous gaps,
including some places between New Jersey and Virginia and on the
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``And very few of these stations have any kind of
direction-finding capability,'' he added. ``So even if we hear you,
if you can't in a calm, rational manner tell us where you are and
what your problem is, it's going to be very difficult to find
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard received some promising news when Congress
appropriated $16 million for fiscal year 2000 to begin upgrading
the distress system in what is expected to be a five-year project.
But Cross acknowledged that there are other problems within the
service that must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Due to budget and work-force streamlining, he said, today's
Coast Guard is the same size as it was in 1963, with roughly 35,000
active-duty members. But with drug and fisheries law enforcement,
search and rescue, and other responsibilities, the overall mission
has expanded. With fewer people standing longer watches, there has
been a marked increase in work-related injuries and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average experience of our small-boat crew members, the
ones that primarily interact with the recreational boating public,
is 11.4 months,'' Cross said. ``That's not a lot in a boat crew,
the ones who go out and recover those folks who find themselves in
trouble. I'm not saying those people aren't technically qualified,
because they are. But that's not where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In launching his own personal distress flare, Cross said: ``You
probably haven't heard Coast Guard officers come out and talk like
this in the past. I'm not overly concerned with where we are today,
but I am with the trend. And it absolutely needs to be turned
around.''

SPANISH SOCCER TEAM EXCELS ON SHOESTRING BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN VINOCUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Life is fashioning one of its sweet parentheses
in Spain these days, bracketing out money, power and arrogance for
a long, dreamy moment.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer team from a throwback of a working-class neighborhood,
its president a woman, its budget a pittance, its goalkeeper an
American, has hiked to the top of the first division from its end
of the subway line. Rayo Vallecano, with no practice field, no gym,
no official Web site, subsists with an annual operating budget of
about a third of the $35 million it cost this summer for Real
Madrid, European soccer's eternal rich guy, to buy Nicolas Anelka
from Arsenal in the English Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   But there is Rayo, a corner grocery in the world of Big Soccer,
promoted from the under-leagues, ahead of Real, and tied in points
and won-lost record at the front of the Spanish Liga, more than a
month into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde holes out of the water hazard and actually
wins the British Open. The Toledo Mud Hens, up from Class AAA, take
the lead in the American League. And if fantasy digs in, and Rayo
keeps going and going over the next 33 league matches and actually
wins it all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' said Kasey Keller, the American goalkeeper, looking
both delighted and lucid on a brilliant early autumn day. ``Nah.''
</P>
<P>
   Logic, in all its brutality, insists that Rayo will falter, and
that the symbols of profligacy and disdain, teams like Real, or FC
Barcelona, which shares the league's best record with Rayo, will
run over the little guy. Their deep rosters of millionaire
manpower, in the end, never surrender a point to sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral of Rayo's experience, if you insist, is that money
is very important,'' said the team's spokesman, Fernando Lopez,
with a laugh, before moving quickly away from discussions about
what wealth cannot buy or what Rayo cannot win. In a league where
Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium holds 106,000, Rayo drew 6,000, 8,000
and then 12,000 to its Estadio Teresa Rivero in its first three
home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's insufficient,'' Lopez said. ``The reality is that our
ambition stops with staying in the first division.'' But with
soccer embedded so deeply in Spain's national consciousness, Rayo's
success and Anelka's failure so far for Real _ the 21-year-old
Frenchman has collected no goals and hoots of derision since the
season began _ provide an antithesis too gaping not to create
comment about the meaning of all the money thrown into soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Clemente, a former national team coach, said last week
that Anelka's cost to Real Madrid ``looks to me like an insult to
society. In a modest country, with a lot of cultural, political and
social deficiencies, those millions could do a lot. I think Madrid
has enough social problems so that modest people are not asking
themselves, above all, if Anelka is going to score 25 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those millions,'' Clemente said, ``you could take care of
everybody who's hungry in Madrid.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, some of the hungry actually lived in Vallecas,
the Madrid neighborhood where Rayo Vallecano _ the Vallecas
Thunderbolt _ has been at home for 75 years, climbing into the
First Division for seven of them, and then usually heading right
back down again. The neighborhood has a strong left-wing,
working-class character, and red brick apartment houses crowd to
the edge of its 19,500-seat stadium, so fans leaning on window
sills, as at Wrigley Field in Chicago, can look out and watch. In
stark contrast, Real's roots are steeped in a Fascist past; Real
Madrid was Franco's team.
</P>
<P>
   When Keller, the U.S. national team goalkeeper who came to Rayo
this year from Leicester City in England, was introduced as an
American to local supporters at a get-to-meet-the-players function,
they shouted, ``Viva Castro!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Keller, amused, ``it's a very interesting
place for an American to be. It's a socialist area, bordering on
communist. I feel I'm liked by the crowd. And I guess I'm about as
non-communist as you can be. I'm a guy who likes Steve Forbes'
flat-tax idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the armies of players, suits and p.r. men at Real
Madrid, Rayo's operations are very, very small beer indeed. Lopez
says the club has 15 employees, including three groundskeepers. Its
fans, he said, had become accustomed over the years to splitting
their affections, backing Real or Atletico, Madrid's second
super-rich team, regardless of their swank, as beloved Rayo
scuffled in the lower depths.
</P>
<P>
   While FC Barcelona has 100,000 socios (supporters' club-paying
members with season ticket rights), and Real 60,000, Rayo has
5,700. The biggest advertising sign on the stadium walls is for a
mattress company, and the souvenir shop has a handwritten poster
taped to its display window offering cut-rate prices on club
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Rayo's payroll is essentially provided by the company of Jose
Maria Ruiz Mateos, a businessman cleared two years ago of
falsifying documents while he was head of the Rumasa conglomerate,
expropriated in 1983 by the then-Socialist government. Ruiz Mateos'
wife, Teresa Rivero, after whom the little Vallecas stadium was
renamed, was made the club's president five years ago, and she has
become its main cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   What Rayo has done this year, after winning promotion from the
second division, is to play extremely well, with the kind of
generousness known mostly to poverty. Its victories have included
two against international heavyweights, Atletico and Celta Vigo,
and it dominated Zaragoza before missing a penalty kick for its
first loss, 1-0, last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all of Rayo's affecting modesty, Luis Cembranos
has emerged as a rising star who could be a national team
selection.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Anelka, Keller said, Real might have got itself a
Mike Tyson type, with ``an entourage standing around shouting, `You
the champ, you the man!' and cutting him off from any kind of
reality.''

FLEURY CAN PASS TOO, IN THE STYLE OF GRETZKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theo Fleury is primarily known as a goal scorer. But
on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, Fleury showed how well he
can pass the puck, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury was so effective in the New York Rangers' 3-1 victory
over the Carolina Hurricanes _ their first triumph of the season _
that Rangers coach John Muckler had to restrain himself from
comparing Fleury to Wayne Gretzky, indisputably the greatest passer
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theo really sees the ice,'' Muckler said. ``He's really a
super passer. He did that in Calgary when he was playing against
Edmonton. Those little short passes he makes under pressure, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler was speaking after Fleury had scored his first goal in a
Rangers' uniform. And that came after Fleury had set up the first
two scores with beautiful feeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably don't know how good he passes the
puck,'' said center Petr Nedved, who figures to reap the benefits
of Fleury's passes all season.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury is a prolific scorer, but he is definitely not
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 40 goals last season. The 5-foot 6-inch right wing has
scored 40 or more goals four times in his career, which is entering
its 12th year. In 810 National Hockey League games, Fleury has 375
goals.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has 482 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Fleury can pass the puck, too. It's just that
his passing ability is usually overshadowed by his scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes that's been the case,'' said Fleury, who
often was Calgary's only true scoring threat in his later years
with the Flames. ``But I'm playing with two shooters now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, however, those two shooters _ Nedved and Adam
Graves _ had not scored a point. On Friday night, the line broke
out.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury (a goal and two assists), Nedved (three assists) and
Graves (power-play goal plus an assist) combined for eight points.
Nedved and Graves were good. Fleury was great.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear Rangers President Neil Smith heave a sigh
of relief.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, this was the Fleury that Smith spent $28
million for over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury admitted late Friday night that he had been putting
pressure on himself to produce. Perhaps that was one reason he did
not tally a point in the Rangers' first three games. It also could
have been a reason that the Rangers went 0 for their first 15 on
the power play, while scoring a goal a game over their first three
outings, until they exploded for three goals (including one on the
power play) on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And Fleury had a hand in each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theo took a lot of pressure off himself playing the game he
played,'' Muckler said. ``He was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury was artistic, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a world-class player and a world-class talent,'' Graves
said. ``Those are things you can't teach. He can do basically
everything. When you're playing with him, you just try to give him
the puck and go to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fleury will usually find you, if he doesn't find the net
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does everything,'' Rangers captain Brian Leetch said.
``That's the type of player he is. He's been one of the top five,
six or seven forwards in the league for a long time. And he
competes hard, too. He's got the elite skills.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Fleury was buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told you guys,'' Fleury said late Friday night. ``It
was just a matter of time.''

IN NEW YORK'S FLOWER DISTRICT, A CROP OF HIGH-RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven years ago, Manuel Castedo moved his
architectural practice into a 24-story loft building at 307 Seventh
Ave., near 27th Street, that was filled with furriers.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, he has been watching the fur flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first office tenant in this building,'' Castedo
recalled. Now there are telecommunications and computer companies
and other architects. Only a half dozen furriers remain.
</P>
<P>
   Change is engulfing the old fur, fashion, flower and flea market
districts along Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas in the
West 20s. Castedo himself is contributing to the trend as the
architect of a project at 291 Seventh Ave., a block from his
office, a loft building that is being turned into nine
floor-through apartments by Houlihan-Parnes Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   And that is one of the smaller undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   In an area that has seen little new building since the Fashion
Institute of Technology completed its Seventh Avenue megastructure
in 1976, 2,100 housing units in seven projects, ranging from 10 to
37 stories and representing an investment of over $600 million, are
under construction or planned to begin within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring the transition are rezonings along Seventh Avenue and
Avenue of the Americas that permit residential development in what
used to be manufacturing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Developers like to say that they are expanding the boundaries of
Chelsea northward, transforming unsightly parking lots into needed
homes and amenities. But to those who live or work in the
neighborhood, it feels more as if the high-rise, high-rent contours
of mid-Manhattan are being extended south, threatening daylight,
small businesses and lower-income residents.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond dispute is that another urban frontier, resistant to
change even in the robust market of the 1980s, is at last being
breached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were these parking-lot sites lying fallow on the avenues
and there's clearly a great residential demand,'' said Joseph Rose,
the chairman of the City Planning Commission. ``The zoning changes
to permit residential development on those avenue sites made sense.
And now, after a long wait, it is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rose said the commission would guard the side
streets where so much small industry still exists. ``The commission
has been on record as vehemently opposing any zoning variances for
the mid-blocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that ``one could engage in an interesting debate''
on whether tall towers suited the area, Rose said their setbacks
were meant to bring light and air to the mid-blocks.
</P>
<P>
   What the planning chairman envisions is a mixed-use neighborhood
in which apartment buildings, stores and light industry coexist.
</P>
<P>
   Some local leaders are not nearly as sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Christine Quinn said she fears that ``we've now
taken 23rd Street and, in our minds, decided that's where midtown
begins, which means that it's OK to have really large buildings and
it's not a place for small, family industries'' like sewing-machine
shops, printers, mannequin makers, furriers and flower dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will businesses be forced out but residents will see
housing costs soar beyond their reach, said Kevin Finnegan,
co-chairman of the land-use and zoning committee of Community Board
5 in mid-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that what's under development is going to have
significant impacts on nearby neighborhoods,'' he said. ``Already
in Chelsea, if you're not in a rent-stabilized apartment, you know
you're going to have to move when the lease is up. This is going to
accelerate the same pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing costs are on the rise in the area from 22nd to 28th
streets, Seventh Avenue to Avenue of the Americas. According to the
Corcoran Group, average sales prices to date this year were
$282,000 for one-bedroom apartments, up 101 percent since 1996, and
$525,000 for two-bedroom units, up 119 percent. The median rents
were $1,650 for studios, up 34 percent since 1996; $2,800 for
one-bedroom units, up 70 percent, and $3,650 for two-bedroom units,
up 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given the demand, Rockrose Development Corp. has repeatedly
raised prices at Chelsea Mercantile, an enormous loft building on
Seventh Avenue, between 24th and 25th streets, that it is
converting into a 354-unit condominium. The architect is Avinash
Malhotra, with public spaces designed by Gruzen Samton.
</P>
<P>
   Penthouse C, a 2,246-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex with a
commanding a view, was offered in May for $1.56 million. In June,
it was priced at $1.88 million; in July, $2.05 million. Today, the
price is $2.15 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Rockrose is having no trouble finding buyers. Last month,
with the building still under construction, 205 units were under
contract, said Kevin Singleton, vice president and general manager
of Rockrose.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor, Whole Foods Market Inc. of Austin, Texas,
plans to open a 40,000-square-foot Fresh Fields Whole Foods Market
next summer. The company calls itself the ``largest purveyor of
natural foods in the world'' but does not have a New York City
outlet. (It is not connected with Whole Foods of SoHo, 117 Prince
St., or Whole Foods-Uptown, 2421 Broadway, at 89th Street.)
</P>
<P>
   ``As we're developing a mini-neighborhood, this use is ground
zero,'' Singleton said. Rockrose is poised to do for lower Seventh
Avenue what it has already done in the West Village: transform the
area with a mix of new and renovated buildings, condominiums and
rental units, some of them subsidized for lower-income tenants.

</P>
<P>
   It came on the scene last year by winning a sealed bid for what
is now Chelsea Mercantile, a U-shaped structure built in four
phases from 1906 to 1914. Long ago, the building housed National
Cloak and Suit Co. and more recently the federal Department of
Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Rockrose also owns the lots between Chelsea Mercantile and the
Fashion Institute of Technology, where it plans a 356-unit
``80-20'' rental project, designed by Costas Kondylis &AMP; Associates.
Thomas Elghanayan, the president of Rockrose, said the project was
made possible by the rezoning of a large swath of Chelsea earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially two buildings on an L-shaped parcel, the project
will face the avenue with a bay-fronted structure of 10 stories,
rising to 17 stories. An 11-story wing on 26th Street could be used
as a dormitory, Elghanayan said. Rockrose will seek tax-exempt bond
financing for one or both parts of the project, which would oblige
it to set aside 20 percent of the units for lower-income tenants,
with 80 percent at market rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rockrose does not think small and Elghanayan allowed that he is
pursuing other projects nearby. ``I can't disclose what,'' he said,
``but we're interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Institute of Technology is similarly circumspect
about its future. But Jacqueline Venable, the vice president for
institutional advancement, said there is a master plan, within the
existing boundaries of the campus, ``to renovate, modernize and
expand our facilities to respond to the growth in our student body
and the changes in the industries we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   FIT will offer weekend courses in decorating and refinishing
next year. ``I want to serve the people who want to live around
here,'' said Elaine Stone, the acting dean for continuing
education, ``and make them feel that this is a community.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Stone began teaching at FIT 22 years ago _ in a Quonset
hut _ furriers still filled numerous buildings along Seventh
Avenue. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of consolidation in the fur industry,'' said
Vincent Terranova, executive vice president of Bernstein Real
Estate. ``They are not occupying as much space as they used to.''
The company, which owns and manages lofts in the fur district and
elsewhere, was founded by Sidney J. Bernstein, now 95, whose father
was a furrier. The industry has not entirely vanished, however. For
example, 150 West 30th St. is still ``100 percent fur,'' Terranova
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The side streets are really remaining the same,'' Ms. Stone
said. ``I think it will stay a mixed neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a different place from what it was in the early
1970s when a self-described ``neophyte broker'' named Harry
Macklowe of Wolf &AMP; Macklowe began selling property to a menswear
executive, Leonard Adell.
</P>
<P>
   Adell had an office at Avenue of the Americas and 31st Street.
Where others saw a streetscape that had been badly stunted by
decades under the Sixth Avenue el, Adell saw solid infrastructure,
good transportation and high visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s, Adell painstakingly assembled small
parcels along Avenue of the Americas into three sites, including
the Coogan Building at 26th Street, which was built in 1875 as the
Racquet Court Club but had long been used as loft space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This recent wave of activity is testimony that he was right,''
said Leonard's son, Matthew Adell, who is president of Adell Corp.
``We were alone in our vision for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adells failed in their efforts to obtain a rezoning in the
late '70s and early '80s. Then, in 1989, the Coogan was designated
a landmark as ``one of the oldest surviving club buildings in
Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the Board of Estimate overturned the
designation. And a rezoning of Avenue of the Americas was enacted
in 1995. But the real estate market was not yet ready, Matthew
Adell said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in partnership with Steven Witkoff, president
of the Witkoff Group, the younger Adell bought the three sites
assembled by his father. The parcels will be developed in phases,
as the market warrants, Adell said. The working title of the
project is ``Center Six.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Construction is to begin early next year of the first ``Center
Six'' building, between 26th and 27th streets: a $120 million tower
with 387 rental apartments. Because it will be conventionally
financed, Adell said, all the units will be market rate, probably
ranging from $1,700 to $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a mid-block plaza to the east of the building,
which generated a 20 percent zoning bonus. The faceted facade steps
up from a four-story commercial base to a 37-story turret.
Kondylis, the architect, said that the turret would serve as an
``urban signal,'' akin to the campaniles and domes of Europe, and
that the rounded corners echoed older buildings in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But the tower is also replacing the Coogan Building, which Quinn
and others would like to save.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Raab, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said
her predecessors ``did absolutely the right thing in designating
the building'' but that the ``political process reversed the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you refight those battles?'' she asked. ``We decided not to
do that. The political process has spoken and there is no reason to
believe the politics would be any different'' _ especially since
the city subsequently rezoned the site to encourage the kind of
development Adell envisions.
</P>
<P>
   Landmarks and planning officials had more influence on the
design of the Caroline, a 440-unit, ``80-20'' rental building on
Avenue of the Americas, between 22nd and 23rd streets, in the
Ladies' Mile Historic District. Fraydun Manocherian, who leads a
partnership known as Whitehall Properties in the development of the
site, said he hoped construction might begin in a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   True to its setting in the historic shopping district, the
building will have a lot of retail space _ almost 100,000 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Richard Cook &AMP; Associates and Kondylis to complement
the old dry-goods stores nearby, the Caroline will rise 10 stories
on the avenue, doubling in height along 23rd Street. ``It's
completely counterintuitive to the standard statement as to how
Manhattan blocks develop,'' Cook said, ``but this was a very
careful insertion into the urban fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's such a critical site in terms of the character of the
area that it deserved a building that paid attention to its obvious
context,'' said Rose, the planning chairman. And Ms. Raab believes
that ``the materials and the design took a historic motif and
turned it into 21st-century language.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is unpersuaded. ``Sometimes in land use,'' she said, ``we
lull ourselves into thinking that what we've made better is in fact
good.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Manocherian said the result of the long
negotiations was a ``very unique building.'' Having bought the site
in 1984, he has been waiting almost as long as the Adells to begin
development.
</P>
<P>
   It is a couple of newcomers to the area, Albanese Development
Corp. and Arbor National Commercial Mortgage, who have become the
first to build on Avenue of the Americas under the new zoning.
</P>
<P>
   Their 30-story tower at 750 Ave. of the Americas, between 24th
and 25th streets, will have 300 studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom
apartments, plus 15,000 square feet of retail space. It is an
``80-20'' project and is scheduled to open next May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we broke ground there was nothing going on'' in the way
of new construction, said Christopher Albanese, executive vice
president of Albanese Development. ``We're very excited that other
residential projects will follow us.''
</P>
<P>
   Macklowe, who returned to the area a few years ago with a
condominium conversion called the Chelsea Atelier, at Seventh
Avenue and 24th Street, sees the neighborhood taking form. ``This
is a logical, sequential development from Houston Street straight
up Sixth Avenue,'' he said. ``You're going to have a concentration,
which I think will really be beneficial in creating what they refer
to as a critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Macklowe Organization is planning a 31-story tower at 777
Ave. of the Americas, between 26th and 27th streets. There are to
be 291 rental apartments in this $80 million project, which will
take advantage of a zoning bonus that rewards the construction of
lower-income housing elsewhere in the community board district.
Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron are the architects of the
Albanese and Macklowe towers.
</P>
<P>
   With the construction of these projects, Alan Boss' Annex
Antiques Fair and Flea Market Inc. has lost two parking lots on
which it conducts its well-attended weekend markets.
</P>
<P>
   Boss expects to operate for the foreseeable future in the lot on
the west side of the avenue, between 24th and 25th streets; in the
lot to the west and paralleling the avenue, between 25th and 26th
streets and in the lot on the east side, between 25th and 26th
streets. Ultimately, he might consolidate the market elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Boss is less certain than the developers that luxury housing is
the salvation of an area he has known for 23 years. ``What happens
when the cycle goes down?'' he asked. ``People can't pay $2,500 for
a one-bedroom if they don't have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also sounds resigned to the construction going on around
him. ``I always knew it would be developed,'' Boss said. ``After
all, it's New York.''

WALTER BERGMAN, 100, CHAMPION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Pa., Ill., Ala.)  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Bergman, an indefatigable civil rights advocate who
was savagely beaten by members of the Ku Klux Klan in 1961 as one
of the first Freedom Riders and won compensation for the attack
from the FBI more than two decades later, died on Sept. 29 in a
nursing home in Grand Rapids, Mich., his wife said. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a stroke 10 days after the beating and used a
wheelchair for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after an informant for the FBI had testified that the
agency had ignored warnings of the impending attack, Bergman won a
damage suit against the federal government, though he was awarded
only $35,000 of the $2 million he had sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit righted the essential history of the period,'' said
Howard Simon, who was executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Michigan when the suit was tried. ``It proved
the federal government was not an ally of the civil rights worker,
but in fact was in league with local law enforcement and the KKK.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack and its aftermath were emblematic of a life lived at
the barricades of social activism. By profession an educator,
Bergman over the years took such controversial stands as declaring
in a public debate in 1935 that the New Deal was too timid in its
attack on poverty, and that the United Auto Workers was wrong to
bar officials from claiming their Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination when asked about communist leanings. He was a
founder of both the Michigan chapter of the ACLU and the Michigan
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, the State Department seized his passport while he was
teaching at the International People's College in Elsinore,
Denmark. His wife, Patricia, said the reason was a trip he had made
to the Soviet Union to study that country's educational system.
After protests by civil liberties groups and education
organizations, the passport was quickly restored.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, the son of a Swedish immigrant farmer, was the third of
three siblings born in Youngsville, Pa. He graduated from high
school at 15, and attended Greenville College in Greenville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted into the Army during World War I and served in
the Signal Corps, where he learned to fly. The war ended before he
could participate in combat, and he was sent to Germany to help
administer the Allied occupation. Seeing the devastation, he became
a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to a factory job in Youngsville, and then began
teaching in Cherry Creek, N.Y. He moved to Detroit, where he taught
high school classes and studied at night at the University of
Michigan to earn a master's degree and then a doctorate in
education. He rose to research director of the Detroit school
system and taught education at the system's universities, which
were later merged into Wayne State University.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he received conscientious-objector status,
but later enlisted to participate in what he had come to believe
was a moral war against Hitler. He participated in the Normandy
landing. After the war he stayed in Germany to work with the United
Nations in helping refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On his return home, he continued working for the Detroit schools
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued to act on social and political beliefs. He was
the first white to join a black Unitarian church, which then
gradually became integrated. He formed a pacifist American Legion
post.
</P>
<P>
   When the Congress of Racial Equality began its Freedom Rides,
with blacks and whites riding buses through the South to test the
efficacy of a Supreme Court ruling that desegregated interstate
transportation, he joined up. He and his first wife, Frances, were
two of three whites in the first group of 14 to travel to the
South, Simon said. Both were brutally attacked as the bus was
parked in Anniston, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Bergman suffered a severe stroke. He
retained most of his speech, but had to learn to write and feed
himself again. He never regained the ability to walk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Gary Thomas Rowe, an undercover informer for the FBI
who joined the Klan, testified before the Senate Intelligence
Committee that he had told the agency about the planned attack on
the Freedom Riders but that the agency had done nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   While testifying, Rowe wore a cotton hood that resembled a Klan
headpiece without the point, to protect his identity. He died in
1998, his death initially reported under another name.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, now the ACLU's executive director in Florida, said Rowe's
testimony prompted Bergman to sue the FBI, and he won in 1983.
After ruling in Bergman's favor, Judge Richard Enslen of U.S.
District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich., limited his award to $35,000
because Bergman's condition might have resulted in part from an
appendectomy he had four months after the beating.
</P>
<P>
   The estate of Frances Bergman, who had died in 1979, was awarded
$15,000. All proceeds were donated to the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman remained active in social causes until he entered the
nursing home less than two years ago, said his second wife, who, as
Patricia Verdier, met him and his first wife at a peace
demonstration in 1970. They were married in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   From his first marriage, Bergman had two surviving daughters,
Margaret Dickson of Detroit and Barbara Boyd of Galesburg, Ill., as
well as 10 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and two
great-great grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Years after he was beaten by Klansmen, Bergman revisited the
Anniston bus station. He noticed four nail holes that had once been
used to hold a sign segregating two drinking fountains; now both
black and white people were drinking freely from the fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a part in pulling out those nails,'' he said.

NO WARRICK, BUT FLORIDA STATE STILL DEFEATS MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Heisman Trophy candidate Peter Warrick,
freshly suspended for grand theft, asked his Florida State
teammates before Saturday's game against Miami to focus on the
Hurricanes, not on his problems.
</P>
<P>
   They took his advice, especially the team's wide receivers, and
came away with an emotionally charged 31-21 victory before 80,976,
the third-largest crowd in Doak Campbell Stadium history.
</P>
<P>
   The victory allowed 6-0 FSU (ranked No. 1 by The Associated
Press and No. 5 in The New York Times computer rankings) to move
significantly closer to the school's first unbeaten season under
coach Bobby Bowden. The Seminoles have a record 12 straight
Associated Press top four finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Weinke's 332 yards passing featured
completions to 11 receivers, including seven filling the spots
vacated by Warrick and his accused fellow offender Laveranues
Coles, who was dropped from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have been crying the whole year about not getting
enough playing time,'' senior wide receiver Ron Dugans said at a
Friday night meeting of the team's receivers. ``Well, this is
gutcheck time. You're getting your chance.''
</P>
<P>
   What replacing Warrick and Coles boiled down to, according to
flanker Germaine Stringer, is spelling two fast receivers with two
just as fast. Stringer caught one touchdown pass and Dugans led the
parade with five catches for 80 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells FSU fans and the world,'' Stringer said in a
jubilant FSU locker room, ``is that we have more than one or two
guys who can catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick watched the game on the sideline, wearing a garnet
T-shirt and jeans and waving a white towel throughout, as
Saturday's renewal of one of FSU's most intense rivalries kept most
people in suspense until halfway through the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reminded me of those old FSU-Miami games about 10 years
ago,'' Bowden said. ``This was a shootout of quarterbacks, and
Weinke won. But boy, was it tight!''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Kenny Kelly threw for 370 yards, which included three
touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have won this game,'' Kelly said. ``We were in
position to win, if we could have made a few more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Weinke, he said afterward: ``I really don't want to talk
about Peter at all, because that's over and done with. This
football team showed up today, and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, there was the usual bluster that this rivalry
generates. Miami's players trotted en masse to a giant FSU logo at
midfield. Sensing some encroachment to their home field, the
Seminoles also rushed to midfield, and coaches had to restrain both
sides from making contact.
</P>
<P>
   The game was just as spirited, and the first half ended tied at
21-21. The Seminoles took a 24-21 lead with seven minutes 59
seconds left in the third quarter on Sebastian Janikowski's 38-yard
field goal. Travis Minor's 2-yard touchdown run with 9:55 left in
the game gave FSU a 31-21 lead and a little breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Hurricanes were not out of it. But FSU's defense
continued its dramatically improved second-half play, allowing
Miami just eight first downs in seven second-half series.
</P>
<P>
   The first half definitely favored those who were partial to
offensive football. The teams combined for 78 plays and a whopping
529 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles opened the game's scoring in their second series,
and it came like a lightning bolt _ a 48-yard pass from Weinke to
the wide open Stringer.
</P>
<P>
   The teams then traded touchdowns until the game reached 14-14.
</P>
<P>
   Miami went 80 yards to score on split end Reggie Wayne's
eight-yard catch from Kelly. Then the Seminoles countered by going
65 yards in 13 plays, with running back Jeff Chaney's 3-yard run
ending it.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, Kelly found Santana Moss free at midfield, and
the speedy flanker outmaneuvered both rover Derrick Gibson and
cornerback Reggie Durden to complete a dazzling 80-yard play.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 14-14, there was still 4:03 left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   FSU was on the verge of scoring again late in the quarter, but
Miami cornerback Al Blades wrestled the ball out of fullback Dan
Kendra's hands at the Seminoles' 11.
</P>
<P>
   Miami seized that opportunity to put together its best drive of
the game and take its only lead. The drive lasted 13 plays and
covered 89 yards, with Moss slipping behind several Seminoles in
the left corner of the end zone for the 14-yard payoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' lead lasted less than four minutes. Weinke
completed four passes for 64 yards on Florida State's next drive,
including an 18-yarder for the first touchdown for tight end Ryan
Sprague and a 21-21 tie.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, FSU had a little too much of everything for Miami _
Weinke, receiving talent and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said afterward that he had found himself pleading for a
misdemeanor in Warrick's case, although he is not used to pleading
for misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to lose the talent,'' Bowden said. ``It's
funny how things work out, but our guys came together today and
played a gutty game in a critical situation.''

   Former Justice Morris Pashman of the New Jersey Supreme Court,
whose opinions touched on areas from freedom of the press to the
rights of the mentally handicapped, died on Oct. 3 at a hospital in
New York City. He was 87 and lived in Clifton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Pashman served in the state judiciary for 23 years, 10 of them
as a member of the state's highest court. He resigned in 1982 when
he turned 70, the age of mandatory retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Pashman drew notice when he dissented from a majority
decision to send M.A. Farber, a New York Times reporter, to prison
for refusing to release his sources for articles concerning Dr.
Mario Jascalevich, a physician on trial on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Pashman was deeply concerned about the First Amendment
in the case,'' said Eugene Scheiman, a lawyer who defended Farber
and The Times. ``When Farber was about to be imprisoned, we asked
the New Jersey Supreme Court for an emergency stay. It was on a
weekend. Judge Pashman came in wearing his golf clothes and granted
the stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when the full New Jersey Supreme Court upheld a
lower court and ordered the state to proceed with imprisoning
Farber and fining The New York Times Co. $100,000 plus $5,000 a day
until they complied with a court order to release the files, only
Pashman dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The following September, when the state Supreme Court reaffirmed
the action of the lower court, Pashman again dissented; he was
joined by Justice Alan Handler.
</P>
<P>
   When Jascalevich was acquitted, Farber was released after 40
days of incarceration. In 1982, Gov. Brendan Byrne of New Jersey
pardoned both Farber and The New York Times on their convictions
for criminal contempt and returned $101,000 in fines to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Pashman was known for his defense of the rights of the underdog,
and he affirmed the equal citizenship rights of the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Pashman was born on Sept. 27, 1912, in Passaic, N.J., and
received his law degree from Rutgers Law School. He was elected
mayor of Passaic in 1951 and served until 1955. In 1959, he was
appointed to the bench in Passaic County by Gov. Robert Meyner.
</P>
<P>
   Pashman is survived by a daughter, Linda Blair-McCrohan of
Clifton; a son, Louis Pashman of Upper Saddle River, N.J.; four
grandsons, and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Pashman decided in favor of the Passaic County Bar
Association in a suit against the County Freeholders claiming that
lawyers had been put at a disadvantage by poor conditions at the
courthouse. As a result of Pashman's decision, a new courthouse was
built within four years. Chiseled into the wall of the building is
a quotation from his opinion: ``A lawyer's obligation is perpetual;
he needs no motivation beyond his sense of duty and his pride.''

PLAYER FOR FC NUERNBERG IS SUSPENDED FOR DOPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a hot week last May when FC Nuernberg was preparing for
the game that would determine if it remained in German soccer's
first division. The team needed at least a tie against SC Freiburg
in the season finale that Saturday to avoid finishing third-to-last
in the league, grounds for automatic relegation to the second
division.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nuernberg midfielder Thomas Ziemer, he and his
teammates sought an extra edge for the game. When the team's
nutritionist, Helmut Brand, suggested they try an organic substance
called Tribulus terrestris, all but two agreed. Only Ziemer, 30,
was tested for drugs after the game, however. The results of the
test showed he had anabolic steroids in his system. Last week, the
German Soccer Federation, known as the DFB, suspended Ziemer for
nine months, the longest suspension of any kind handed down to a
player by German soccer's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   With the suspension of Ziemer, the first given to a German
soccer player found to have taken a performance-enhancing
substance, the DFB joined other European sports federations that
have increased their vigilance against doping. The Italian Athletic
Federation will soon consider a possible four-year suspension for
the marathon runner Giuliano Battocletti, who also tested positive
for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first real doping case in German soccer,'' said
Rainer Koch, the disciplinary committee chairman. ``We had to act
in order to preserve the credibility of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The role played by Brand, the nutritionist nicknamed Miraculix
by Ziemer and his Nuernberg teammates, remains unclear. A German
biochemical institute testified that the Tribulus terrestris
administered by Brand could not alone have resulted in Ziemer's
testosterone count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only speculation that Brand had something to do with
this case,'' Koch said. ``The fact is that players are still
responsible for their own negligent actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziemer's suspension has resulted in debate in the international
soccer community about how doping should be monitored and punished.
A doping study published last week by the International Olympic
Committee indicated that soccer returned the lowest number of
positive tests of all sports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these good marks, the International Soccer Federation,
known as FIFA, decided on Wednesday in Belgium to adopt random
out-of-competition doping controls during next year's European
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these measures, FIFA shows its commitment to fight
against the scourge of doping,'' FIFA president's, Sepp Blatter,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions leveled against a player who tests positive remain
undefined. The DFB has no set rules determining how long a player
should be suspended for doping. While Koch's verdict is viewed by
many as harsh, it fell short of the mandatory two-year suspension
endorsed by the sport ministers of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had opted for that long of a suspension, we would have
certainly faced legal problems,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of Ziemer comes at a time when doping has
received renewed legal attention in Germany. In September, the
Berlin State Prosecution Office indicted the two men most
responsible for the systematic doping of athletes in eastern
Germany. Manfred Ewald, former president of the country's sports
federation, and Manfred Hoeppner, who was the head doctor in the
sports medicine service, are accused of ``aiding and abetting the
bodily harm'' of 142 female athletes, most of them minors.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments of Ewald and Hoeppner are based on the
systematic nationwide doping of athletes. Representatives of FC
Nuernberg believe a distinction should be made between willful and
systematic doping and what happened to Ziemer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player can be punished so severely for taking an illegal
substance without his knowledge, his life will be very
restricted,'' said Wilfried DeBuhr, managing director of FC
Nuernberg. ``Even dinner in a restaurant becomes problematic if the
food isn't prepared right before his eyes.''  &QL;

MALAYSIAN DRIVER BLAZING TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NURBURGRING, Germany _ The jagged roar of race-car engines
circled the paddock, while Alex Yoong, Malaysia's greatest driver,
sat dejected in his team's motor home.
</P>
<P>
   For the second race in a row, the Formula 3000 race before the
European Grand Prix on Sept. 26, Yoong was pushed off the track by
the same rival driver. But he was lucky this time. In Spa, Belgium,
in August, Yoong's car went off the track at 160 mph and he was
knocked unconscious for nearly 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I had a broken elbow, broken knee, broken ribs,''
Yoong said. ``My body was contorted and, apparently, I was
screaming like a stuck pig.''
</P>
<P>
   He got away with only an injured ligament in his knee, but while
medical opinion differs on the severity, Yoong said it doesn't
affect his driving.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the worst was feared. Mahathir bin Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister, wished him a quick recovery. As one of
only three Southeast Asian drivers with Formula One potential
racing in Europe, to lose him would be a blow to a region that is
both struggling to produce drivers and about to play host to its
first Grand Prix, in Malaysia, on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of Malaysian drivers must still rise from
go-karts through a shaky racing hierarchy, but Yoong, 23, was
privileged. His father, Hanifah Yoong, raced sedans in the 1970s.
He was a director of the Shah Alam circuit near Kuala Lumpur, then
the country's leading track, where he introduced international
motorcycle racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My earliest memory,'' Yoong said, ``is being at one of my
father's races. I remember the excitement of the start and the cars
going off. I couldn't be more than 2, but I understood what it was
about.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was born in Malaysia of Chinese parents, and his
mother is a British expatriate. His sister is a top water skier,
and Yoong, too, skied in competitions, rising as high as the top
five in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, he began racing Proton sedans, and won two of five races
in his first year. The next step was Formula Asia, a single-seat
open-wheel series that raced in Malaysia, Indonesia, India,
Thailand and China. Several podium finishes were followed by
victory in the last race, in Zuhai, China. The next year, he won
six of the 14 races and the Malaysian championship, but he lost the
international title by two points to a British driver.
</P>
<P>
   He was noticed by Paul Stewart, the son of Jackie Stewart, a
three-time Formula One world champion. Yoong dropped school and
water-skiing, came to Europe and tested Paul Stewart's Vauxhall
series car, but then raced in Formula Renault.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shown that he has talent, and a lot of determination to
come back after that accident in Spa,'' said Paul Stewart, whose
Formula One team won at the Nurburgring on Sept. 26. ``Now he has
to be a front-runner in Formula 3000 before he is seriously
considered to be invited for tests in Formula One.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Yoong finished frequently in the top six in British
Formula Three, and drove in the legendary Macau race _ previously
won by Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher _ along with only 30 of
the world's 130 to 150 Formula Three drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macau is the most daunting circuit around,'' Yoong said.
``It's challenging, it's long, it's dangerous, and it's a heck of a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoong finished ninth _ the best result ever by a Southeast Asian
_ but said he could have done better if not for financial problems.
The Asian economic downturn cost him his sponsors, and his father
started pouring in the family's money until they were deeply in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally this year, the Malaysian government and other local
sponsors provided bank loans and insurance. By then, however, Yoong
only had time for part of both the Formula Three and the Formula
3000 seasons. He now hopes that the Malaysian Grand Prix will help
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this Grand Prix comes and they see how exciting it can be
and the possibilities for sponsorship,'' he said, ``it will open up
more doors for me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Japanese drivers in Formula One, sponsorship has rarely been
as much of a problem as the cultural and language barriers. Yoong
feels Malaysians have an advantage, since English is widely used in
Malaysia. But cultural barriers still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to Europe,'' he said, ``I had a really Asian
way of thinking. `Yes,' means `yes' in a different way in Asia and
in Europe. `No' means `maybe yes' in Malaysia. `No' is `no' here.
But I understood what was going on because of my English side, my
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sees himself first as a Malaysian, then part Chinese and
part English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself exactly as the ratios dictate,'' he said.
``There's only half a Chinese who has ever raced in this world
competitively, and that's me. In China, they are first-generation
car owners, so it's going to be a while before anyone comes racing
from China.''

1899 SEWANEE TEAM HAD COLLEGE FOOTBALL'S GREATEST ROAD TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The South)  (mk)

<P>
   It would be impossible today, and one would think it would have
been impossible 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the University of the South football team did it.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the likes of Notre Dame, Michigan, Alabama, Oklahoma
and Florida State ruled the college football world, the team better
known as Sewanee remarkably navigated the toughest road schedule
the sport has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of six days in 1899, Sewanee knocked off Texas, Texas
A&AMP;M, Tulane, Louisiana State and Ole Miss. Five of the 21 Tigers
were law students and four were medical students. The average age
was just over 21, the average weight 169 pounds. Along with the
players, coach Billy Suter, manager Luke Lea and the trainer, Cal
Burrows, made the 2,500-mile, 77-hour train trip that resulted in
five shutouts and the respect of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee paid tribute to the 1899 team on Saturday, sandwiching a
pregame tailgate party and a postgame celebration around a game
against Division III rival DePauw.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are some who would swear to the contrary, I did
not see the 1899 Sewanee football team play in person,'' Penn State
coach Joe Paterno said recently. ``One can't help but marvel,
however, when reviewing the accomplishments of that splendid
undefeated squad.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Tuesday, Nov. 7, a century ago, Suter, Lea,
Burrows and the Tiger players caught a train out of Cowan, Tenn.,
and traveled through Memphis toward Texas. The train arrived
Wednesday evening in Austin, where the Tigers topped the Longhorns,
12-0, the following day before a crowd estimated at 2,000. The
captain, Henry ``Diddy'' Seibels, a halfback, scored two touchdowns
(worth five points apiece in those days) for the winners.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee then traveled to Houston and dumped Texas A&AMP;M, 10-0,
before roughly 600 fans a day later. Fullback Ormand Simkins and
quarterback Warbler Wilson scored touchdowns for the Tigers, as
both extra-point attempts failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M went down in honorable defeat before the mighty Sewanee
team in what proved to be one of the fiercest and most brilliant
contests ever seen on the Southern gridiron,'' reported Texas A&AMP;M's
campus newspaper, The Battalion, in a burst of hyperbole. ``They
are unmistakably the champions of the South this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 350 miles separated Houston from New Orleans, but that
didn't faze the Tigers. They pummeled Tulane, 23-0, on Saturday
night. Halfback Rex Kilpatrick scored twice in a game eventually
called for darkness.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sewanee rested.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Tigers ventured to Baton Rouge and demolished
Louisiana State, 34-0, before another throng of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a trip back to Memphis, Sewanee completed its
stamina test with a 12-0 defeat of Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the most amazing thing about this trip is how these
guys lasted,'' said Larry Dagenhart, a former Sewanee sports
information director. ``Football once a week is rough, but these
guys played five games in six days. And let's face it, there wasn't
a whole lot of expertise in athletic training back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Locating grandchildren or great-grandchildren with any knowledge
of the 1899 Tigers was next to impossible for Dagenhart, but one
person who kept abreast of that team is the retired Birmingham
journalist Wendell Givens. Seven years ago, Givens wrote
``Ninety-Nine Iron,'' a book about Sewanee's momentous week and
indelible team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started my research, I wanted to know why on earth they
would play five games in six days,'' Givens said. ``Luke Lea was
the key figure. He was the student manager of that team and was
also kind of an athletic director without the actual title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sewanee and Vanderbilt were the big rivals at that time, but
they didn't play in 1899 because they couldn't agree on gate
receipts. Lea didn't want to be an ordinary student manager, so he
started setting up a trip. Sewanee had played at Texas in 1898 and
had beaten them, so I think Lea went from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to the administration for approval to play two or
three games, but then he decided why not add more on the way back
home. The administration didn't worry about playing five games in
six days They just wanted to make sure they could pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, they approved the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1899 Sewanee team had a tremendous advantage, Givens
suggests, in that the Tigers were able to practice all summer. Back
then, Sewanee students took the winters off due to harsh conditions
on Sewanee Mountain, more commonly known as Monteagle, and instead
went to school through the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee finished 12-0 in 1899, outscoring its opponents by
322-10. Only Auburn, which faced the Tigers two weeks after their
successful train trip, could put points on the purple-clad defense
when the two met Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Following its undefeated season, Sewanee posted winning records
from 1900 through 1918 and eventually joined the Southeastern
Conference in 1932. It didn't take long _ as evidenced by 37
consecutive SEC defeats _ for Tiger officials to realize their
athletic programs could not keep pace with growing powers like
Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Louisiana State and Tennessee, so Sewanee
withdrew from the league in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Sewanee had additional undefeated seasons in the smaller College
Athletic Conference in 1958 and 1963 before entering the Division
III ranks in 1972. But there's no argument as to the greatest team
in Sewanee history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bowl Championship Series had been in effect in 1899,
there seems little doubt Sewanee would have played in the title
game,'' Paterno said.

GORE, BRADLEY TRADE JABS WHILE COURTING IOWA VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ On a warm autumnal day as the dry leaves crunched
underfoot, Al Gore and Bill Bradley took their campaigns to the
neighborhoods of this capital city, exchanging jabs over their
commitment to elevate politics to a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president stood at the dead end of East 40th Court and
challenged Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, to a series of
weekly debates on issues ranging from farm policy to health care.
Bradley rebuffed Gore, accusing him of lashing out for lack of
confidence in himself.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates for president came here for the
annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, the state party's major
fund-raiser. It was the first time they had appeared in the same
room during the campaign, and it came as Gore is trying to
rehabilitate his candidacy and increase pressure on Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In a low-key, but pointed response to the recent slings and
arrows from the Gore campaign, Bradley said Saturday that a
candidate who is not confident ``resorts to darts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley walked away from the Democratic Party when he
resigned from the Senate in 1996 at a time when working people
needed him most. As Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took over the
Congress, Gore said, Bradley left others to fight for the minimum
wage, abortion rights, and support of farmers.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour's walk knocking on doors in the Beaverdale section
and asking people for their support, Bradley said he did not
believe voters would hold his resignation from the Senate or his
declaration that ``politics is broken'' against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can talk about the future in a way that's compelling
enough. I also have always been a Democrat since I first cast my
vote in 1964,'' Bradley said. ``I am simply not going to get into
dealing with the darts that are being thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is concerned that his unwillingness to respond to
specific charges by Gore would hurt him, Bradley said he was not,
and would continue to be himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people want to have a positive vision of
the future, and to the extent that someone is confident in their
own vision of the future, they don't need to resort to the darts,''
he said. ``There's been an awful lot of partisanship and
negativism, and I think people really want to have a politics
that's more positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley is resisting Gore's calls to debate, he said
the two-man race is good for both candidates. ``I think competition
is what America is all about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bradley was suggesting that Gore's attacks on his
record were a sign of old, negative politics, Gore was saying the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not use this campaign as a way to elevate the election
process to make it worthy of our democracy?'' Gore asked, pressing
for debates. ``The best way to elevate campaigns is to have
debates, and to focus on what's really significant and important.
</P>
<P>
   ``And is it fair to debate the impact of Reaganomics on America
at a time when the Republican majority in the Congress is trying to
go back to Reaganomics? Sure it is,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said again, as he has the last couple of weeks, that
Bradley left the Senate at a time when he was needed after Gingrich
and the Republicans took over the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us was called upon to fight against it with everything
we had, or not,'' Gore said. ``And he did not. That, again, ought
to be discussed and dealt with in the context of debate.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Bradley had described him as ``timid,'' Gore
reached for his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh, a dart,'' he exclaimed, pulling an imaginary dart from
his green cotton shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't walk away from the fight when Newt Gingrich
took over the Congress,'' Gore said. ``I didn't walk away from the
fight when Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I didn't
walk away from the fight when farmers needed farm credit, when
farmers needed loan-deficiency payments for conservation
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley walked through Beaverdale, he encountered people of
every stripe, including his own fans, Gore supporters, and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Lienhard, a Democrat and a former social worker, had nothing
but kind words for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's electable and he's solid, sincere, common-sense,
down to earth, personable,'' he said. ``It's like you're meeting a
friend rather than a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jongewaard was up on a ladder, caulking the windows on his
Tudor home, when Bradley walked up. After chatting for a couple of
minutes and wishing Bradley well, Jongewaard told reporters, ``I'm
a committed Gore supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't back somebody I didn't think could beat any
Republican,'' he said.

   CHICAGO _ Wrapping up a trip that often had the air of a
farewell tour, President Clinton on Saturday shared fond memories
with Hispanic leaders and blasted Senate Republicans for a
``shameless'' refusal to confirm minority judges.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before thousands of Hispanics, Clinton blamed
partisanship for the refusal to back his judicial nominees, and did
not suggest the opposition was based on race.
</P>
<P>
   But he pointedly mentioned only minority judges whose
appointments were rejected or are languishing ``somewhere in the
dark recesses of the calendar of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's rejection of African-American Judge Ronnie White, a
Missouri judge nominated to the federal bench, ``was wrong. It's
the kind of thing that's going on up there that ought to stop,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's treatment of Judge White and its failure to vote
on the outstanding Hispanic nominees that are pending creates a
real doubt about their ability and their willingness to perform
their constitutional duties to advise and consent,'' Clinton told
the gathering of the US Hispanic Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The president's three-day swing through New York, Canada, and
Chicago brought him back to his roots of support as a first-time
presidential candidate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In tones that often sounded as though he was preparing to pass
the torch to the next president, Clinton spoke passionately about
his commitment to gay rights, labor struggles, and the issues
facing America's fastest-growing minority group, Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than lay out a future political agenda, Clinton recounted
what he saw as his legislative and policy successes in office,
including the booming national economy and such initiatives as the
Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke freely about his support for issues that often
brought him controversy during his presidency, including the
``awful battle which I waged and didn't win'' to allow gays to
serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In reflective tones, the president recalled his fights to create
unity among Americans, and tied them to the greater issue of
ethnic, racial, and religious strife domestically and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried about social division,'' Clinton told a group of gay
rights activists in New York Friday. ``And every campaign, it
seemed to me, was yet another example of how we could sort of carve
up the electorate and make one group resent another, and hope that
your group was a larger group of resenters than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Hispanic Conference Saturday, Clinton spoke
emotionally about the human division that has led to overseas
conflicts that he has dealt with as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around this old world Sunday, the biggest problem
I have faced as your president in my responsibilities around the
world is dealing with the racial and the ethnic and the religious
and the tribal conflicts where people occupy the same land and
cannot get along, where they continue to believe what is different
about them is more important than their common humanity, where they
fear people who are different from them and get to the point where
they look down on them and in some places, God forbid, they think
it's OK to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is the oldest problem of the human heart:
the fear and hatred of people who are different,'' Clinton said,
drawing loud applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The president barely mentioned his wife or his vice president in
his addresses. But the president's remarks are sure to reflect on
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for the
US Senate in New York, and on Vice President Al Gore, seeking the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As a lame-duck president, Clinton can openly woo such voting
blocs as Latinos, gays, and labor unions with less concern for the
political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these groups are expected to make a difference in the
coming elections. Hispanics make up only 5 percent of the voting
population, but they are heavily respresented in delegate-rich
states, including Illinois, Florida, Texas, California, and New
York _ where Mrs. Clinton and Gore both face tough challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists believe the Hispanic vote is their best
chance to regain control of the House of Representatives. And both
Democrats and Republicans agree that neither party has a lock on
the Latino vote.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's Hispanic nominees _ California judges Richard
Paez and Marsha Berzon _ have been waiting 3 1/2 years and 18
months, respectively, for a full Senate vote on their nominations.
``I think the treatment of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon is
shameless,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Capitol Hill have long fought over the
alleged politicization of judicial and diplomatic nominees, with
Democrats complaining that the Republican Senate has held up the
confirmation of qualified nominees for political reasons that have
nothing to do with the candidate.

YELTSIN CHECKS INTO HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin checked into the hospital
Saturday with what the Kremlin described as a case of the flu, but
press reports here are suggesting that his illness may be more
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the president's illness as minor, Kremlin spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin did not feel well on Friday and had
agreed Saturday to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's unexpected hospitalization follows by just a day the
Kremlin announcement that the 68-year-old president _ who has only
rarely appeared in public over the past two weeks _ was overworked
and needed a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for him to work long, taking into account
the age of Boris Yeltsin and other factors,'' said Yakushkin, in
televised comments on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Moscow's media, citing anonymous Kremlin sources,
have been reporting that Yeltsin is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In whose hands is Russia's nuclear suitcase?'' read a headline
in Saturday's edition of the influential daily newspaper Segodnya.
The newspaper reported that Yeltsin has not been in the Kremlin for
four days and that he was preparing to have heart surgery in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know in the next few days whether or not this is
true,'' the newspaper reported, adding that Yeltsin was also
considering resigning and turning power over to his prime minister
and anointed successor, Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has denied the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand the president is in very bad shape,''
said Andrei Piontkovsky, a Moscow-based political analyst. ``The
events of the last few days _ the media reports, Yakushkin's
announcement _ were designed to prepare the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's hospitalization occurs as Russia is embroiled in war
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. With Yeltsin absent from the
political scene over the past several weeks, Putin has been taking
an increasingly high public profile, specifically regarding
Chechnya and other matters usually reserved for the president.
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled media have been trying to boost the prime
minister's standing, making much of a recent rise in his
popularity. Putin was shown repeatedly Saturday during a televised
soccer game he attended between Russia and Ukraine. At one point,
the camera focused on the prime minister for nearly two minutes as
he cheered Russia's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has had health problems for years, including heart
trouble that led to multiple bypass surgery in 1996 and recurring
bouts of pneumonia and respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
   He has also suffered from back pain and a recurring ulcer in the
past year.

ON BASEBALL'S HALLOWED GROUNDS, BLACK YOUTHS WORSHIP BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Eliminates photo note.) (bl) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium,
atop some of baseball's most hallowed ground, Michael Franklin, 13,
leaned against a black metal fence, largely unmoved by what others
were calling the magic of October baseball. He lives in Polo
Grounds Towers, an upper Manhattan housing project built on the
remains of the legendary home of the New York Giants, and later the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Yankees,'' Michael said Thursday with a grin. ``But
basketball is my game.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, on the blocks where once stood Ebbets Field, home
of the Brooklyn Dodgers, another housing project now dominates. The
only indication of its previous incarnation is a small granite
plaque under a fading ``Renting Office'' sign. There, on a day much
of the city was swept up with the fates of the Mets and Yankees in
the playoffs, Shawn Tyson, 23, said he had even less use for
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch like everyone else, but I don't catch it
anymore,'' said Tyson, who lives in the Ebbets Field Houses.
``Baseball is boring, it's too slow. Basketball has much more
action. I honestly can't see the appeal of the game at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Franklin and Shawn Tyson, who are black, were both
standing on ground steeped in baseball history _ ground where Bobby
Thomson hit his home run heard round the world and Jackie Robinson
broke baseball's color barrier. And they both gave voice to a
certain disconcerting truth about baseball. Among many American
blacks, it is a sport in decline.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is reflected in the shrinking number of blacks in
the major leagues and in the primacy of basketball as the sport of
choice among black youngsters in the inner city, and it is not
likely to be halted by the excitement and nostalgia surrounding the
first simultaneous World Series playoff appearances of the Mets and
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, a group of black teen-agers at the Polo
Grounds Towers, asked to rank their favorite sports, spoke in what
amounted to a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball, football, baseball and hockey,'' said Maurice
Burgess, 18, who acted as a spokesman for the group. ``And soccer?
You've got to interview some Australians about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, plenty of black residents at the two housing
projects, children and grandparents alike, have watched, and will
cheer for, the Mets and Yankees as they make their way through the
playoffs. Not all blacks have lost interest in baseball. But still,
black residents of the buildings express a certain sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Giles, 81, a retired truck driver and ``devout Yankees
fan'' who lives at Polo Grounds Towers, said he vividly remembers
trips to the Polo Grounds and can recall where he was when Bobby
Thomson's home run won the pennant for the Giants in 1951. ``It was
a short home run,'' he said, eyes alight. ``But it was a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles acknowledges that things have changed. ``During my time,
no black man was allowed to play,'' he said. ``Then Jackie Robinson
did it, and all of a sudden there were so many blacks you couldn't
count them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in next breath, he added, ``Now, there are so many
Latinos, you can't count them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bear him out. According to the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, the percentage of
blacks in the major leagues dropped to 15 percent in 1998, the
lowest number of the decade. In the same year, the percentage of
Hispanic players rose to 25 percent, a decade high.
</P>
<P>
   And the representation of blacks in baseball pales in comparison
to their numbers in football (nearly 70 percent) and basketball (80
percent). Also, nearly 90 percent of Little League programs
nationwide are located in mostly white suburban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern about the number of blacks declining,
certainly,'' said Ricky Clemons, vice president for public
relations in baseball's National League. He said one major concern
was that ``a lot of inner-city high schools have eliminated
baseball. It's the first to go. It takes a lot of equipment and a
lot of space.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, Major League Baseball has supported Reviving
Baseball in the Inner Cities, an organization that aims to develop
fans and players in the hearts of the nation's larger cities. The
organization counts more than 30,000 participants in 50 cities.
</P>
<P>
   But developments at Ebbets Field Houses and the Polo Grounds
Towers illustrate baseball's urban decline. At Ebbets Field, an
adjacent playground was recently renovated to make more room for
basketball courts, eliminating a cement softball diamond. Baseball
players must now drag their equipment to diamonds in Prospect Park,
about a mile away, to play.
</P>
<P>
   At the Polo Grounds housing project, a central playground known
as the Willie Mays is the domain of basketball players, with
baseball shoved to the periphery; at nearby Holcombe-Rucker
Playground, a nicely groomed baseball diamond is used principally
for ``cookouts and such,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess pointed to his Yankees cap. ``This stands for New York,
New York, not New York Yankees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the younger blacks interviewed said they enjoyed
basketball and football more because the games were faster, more
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that loose action,'' said Mike Kelly, 15, who lives at
the Polo Grounds Towers. ``It's swifter than people standing around
with bats.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of suggestions for improvements, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nine-inning game is too long,'' said Shawn Maynard, 19,
who lives in the Ebbets Field Houses. ``Maybe they should shorten
it to five innings.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Leshawn Swea, 17, said baseball should consider
adding flashy sideshows, loud music during games or time limits.
``Or cheerleaders,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball has its passionate curators among black New Yorkers
who live on the grounds of the old ball parks, they are usually the
older residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to sneak over the fence here,'' said Clinton Collins,
71, of Ebbets Field Houses, who wore a New York Knicks cap. ``But
you could get a $2.50 box seat if you wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off the names of players he had seen _ Pee Wee Reese,
Don Hoak, Jackie Robinson. Then, as if to make a point, he pulled
out a picture of his 13-year-old grandson, Farouk, dressed in a
football uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the love of baseball the older residents hold has been
embraced by some young blacks. The more talk about the prospect of
the Yankees or Mets, or both teams, in the World Series, the more
excitement bubbled up. Some youngsters could give a glowing review
of Derek Jeter's stylish play and Mike Piazza's clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love watching baseball, especially when a player hits a home
run,'' said Rogelio Henry Jr., 13, an eighth-grader at Jackie
Robinson Middle School, behind his home in the Ebbets Field Houses.
``I'm living on history. Right here is history.''

<P>
   OTTAWA, Canada _ Canadians on both sides of the nation's deep
linguistic divide say they were stunned by President Clinton's
unexpectedly passionate appeal here for national unity and
federalism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traveled to the flashpoint of separatism in North
America and, without once mentioning Quebec nationalism, argued
Friday that ``the United States and Canada are among the most
fortunate countries in the world because we have such diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   If every major ``racial and ethnic and religious group'' won
independence, ``we might have 800 countries in the world and have a
very difficult time having a functioning economy,'' Clinton said,
addressing a forum on federalism that earlier in the week had
become a platform for complaints by Quebec separatists. ``Maybe we
would have 8,000 _ how low can you go?
</P>
<P>
   ``The great irony of the turning of the millennium is that we
have more modern options for technology and economic advance than
ever before, but our major threat is the most primitive human
failing _ the fear of the other,'' he said at Mont Tremblant, north
of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must think of how we will live after the shooting stops,
after the smoke clears, over the long run,'' the president said.
National independence, he warned, is often ``a questionable
assertion in a global economy where cooperation pays greater
benefits in every area than destructive competition.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. leaders traditionally sidestep the hornet's nest of the
separatist aspirations of many Quebecers, the central political
quandary of Canada for the last three decades. In turn, Canadians
put extraordinary weight on the words of the president of the
United States, the nation that dominates Canada's foreign trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's widely read weekend papers, English and French, viewed
the speech as a strong argument for Quebec's remaining inside
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made ``a powerful argument in favor of federalism, which
he describes as the political regime of the future,'' Vincent
Marissal wrote in La Presse, a Montreal daily that bills itself as
the largest-circulation French newspaper of the Americas. ``But his
message on the merits of federalism went much further, questioning
even the usefulness of the nationalist projects in the era of
globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The English-speaking media were less restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton Sings Praises of United Canada,'' read a banner
headline in The Montreal Gazette, one of only two surviving English
language daily newspapers in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The National Post, a conservative newspaper, hailed Clinton's
``historic speech'' with a banner headline, ``Clinton Takes a Swing
at Separatists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail, Canada's other nationally circulated
newspaper, declared, ``Clinton's speech was the most powerful and
subtle argument in favor of the federal idea heard in Quebec in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec separatists sought to make the best of the speech, noting
that Clinton had praised the European Union, a relationship they
see as a model for future ties between an independent Quebec and
``English Canada.'' Separatists also noted that after the speech
Clinton met with Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, the first such
meeting between a U.S. president and a separatist premier.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not allow photographs, kept the meeting to 15
minutes, and then rushed off to a photo opportunity and golf with
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1995, Quebec voters came within a whisker of
approving a third nation for North America. In a referendum with a
huge turnout, the yes vote for an independent Quebec was 49.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But austerity policies adopted by Bouchard's Parti Quebcois
government seem to have contributed to a fall in separatist
support, currently said in opinion polls to be around 40 percent.
Consequently, Bouchard has been vague about holding what would be a
third referendum on the issue since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of Quebec voters do not want another
referendum, according to a Sondagem poll conducted for Le Devoir, a
separatist daily in Montreal, in early September. This position is
shared by Quebecers opposed to independence and by nationalists who
fear they would lose for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, the Bouchard government was hit with the
resignation of its top secession strategist, Jean-Francois Lisee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a departure that says out loud what everyone in Quebec
City is whispering and doesn't dare say yet,'' Michel C. Auger
wrote in September in Le Journal de Montreal. ``Unless there is a
miracle, there will not be a referendum on sovereignty during the
PQ government's current mandate.''

   (NYT12) ROCK HILL, S.C. -- Oct. 9, 1999 -- S.C.-GAMBLING-VOTE,
10-9 -- A strip of gaming parlors in Rock Hill. Video poker is
everywhere in the state of South Carolina. Some 34,000 of the
machines have now taken root across South Carolina, far more than
in any other state, and many people have had enough. South
Carolinians will vote Nov. 2 on whether to ban video poker
machines. The latest newspaper poll shows that a sizable majority
of likely voters, more than 60 percent in one poll, want the
machines permanently unplugged. (Donna Bise/New York Times Photo)

welfare deadline. Arguing she could gain new clerical skills, Y-W
Works, a private agency in Milwaukee that handles her welfare case,
asked the state for another six months of benefits for Ms.
Triplett. The state gave her three. Wisconsin's tough work rules

the state is now grappling with the ultimate symbol of the new

 LEE RICHARDSON, 73, AN ACTOR NOTED FOR HIS ENGLISH ACCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lee Richardson, an actor whose career spanned more
than four decades of stage, film and television work, died on Oct.
2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest after complications from a
perforated ulcer, said his daughter, Rachel Richardson Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, Richardson was a fixture on the New York
stage and in regional repertory roles. He appeared in so many roles
requiring an English accent that he was widely assumed to be
British.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who was born in Chicago, read the works of
Shakespeare and Noel Coward as a soldier in the Army Air Corps
during World War II. After his discharge from the Army, he briefly
took prelaw courses at Loyola University before moving to the
Goodman Theater School in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   One of his early New York performances was off-Broadway in the
Circle in the Square production of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and
Smoke'' with Geraldine Page. He was 24 at the time and caught the
attention of the artist Al Hirschfeld, who eventually depicted him
in four drawings.
</P>
<P>
   By 1954, Richardson was appearing regularly on the television
drama anthologies ``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One,'' tallying
more than 250 appearances. He also performed with George C. Scott
in the 1962 production of ``The Merchant of Venice'' in Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he became a founding member of the Guthrie Theater in
Minneapolis, where he worked with Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Zoe
Caldwell, Douglas Campbell and Rita Gam.
</P>
<P>
   After four years with the American Shakespeare Theater in
Stratford, Conn., he returned to Broadway in productions of ``Find
Your Way Home,'' ``The Texas Trilogy'' and ``Father's Day.'' He was
nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for his performance in ``Vivat!
Vivat Regina!''
</P>
<P>
   He was a favorite of the director Sidney Lumet, who cast him in
the films ``Prince of the City,'' ``Daniel,'' ``Q &AMP; A'' and ``A
Stranger Among Us.'' He also appeared in John Huston's ``Prizzi's
Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson performed voice-overs for more than 100 commercials.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 35 years, Elaine Rower Richardson, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by a
son, Jonathan, of the Bronx, and a sister, Dolores Levine of
Anaheim, Calif. &QL;

 &HT;    Diamondbacks can't get glove on Mets
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the improbabilities compounding by the inning,
all of Shea Stadium came to a halt for an instant late Saturday
afternoon, allowing Steve Finley the opportunity to check his glove
out there some 410 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   He found it empty. Next came bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt, thrust into the void left by injured superstar Mike
Piazza, won the National League Division Series for the New York
Mets, his one-out homer off Arizona relief ace Matt Mantei in the
10th inning clearing by the wall by an estimated four feet in dead
center for a 4-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   Having now taken seven of their last eight games, the Mets renew
what has become a nasty little relationship with the Atlanta Braves
in next week's NLCS. The Braves left New York on Sept. 30 having
taken five of six from the Mets and taunting them for a season run
amok.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a good effort to stop us,'' said Mets
manager Bobby Valentine, still dripping from a champagne shampoo.
``The team that we're playing is going to be playing against some
ghosts, because they said we were dead. I don't know if they've
ever played people who have come back from the grave before.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, Valentine had coached third base for an
ejected Cookie Rojas. Arizona had twice erased New York leads, the
second on Jay Bell's two-run double in the eighth that gave the
Diamondbacks a 3-2 advantage. Arizona MVP candidate Matt Williams
missed the last three innings, pulled in a pitching change. New
York managed to put eight men on base in the last three innings on
just two hits.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Pratt's heroic swing fit an unlikely day. Having gone
0-for-6 subbing for Piazza, who sat out a second game with a sore
left thumb, Pratt determined to take a full cut at the first good
fastball he saw, instead of choking down, as he customarily does
against pitchers who reach the mid-90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After watching a wasted curveball, Mantei's next pitch was where
Pratt likes it, a little up and out in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the ball and kind of paused,'' said Pratt, who nearly
came to a stop between first and second while Finley leaped vainly
at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw me stop and I thought he had the ball until he put his
head down. I didn't see the umpire but as soon as I saw him put his
head down, I knew we won the game right then.''
</P>
<P>
   That ended a remarkable Arizona season in which the Diamondbacks
make the biggest turnaround in baseball history, improving by 35
victories in one year. Then after taking seven of nine from New
York in the regular season, it ended on one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vocabulary's not that good,'' said manager Buck Showalter.
``It's just a tough situation. You win 100 games and then,
suddenly, you're a spectator.''

TOWNS COLUMN: CAN FOOTSTEPS FLATTEN A SHOWROOM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAUVELT, N.Y. _ Movie idea: We see a steaming jungle. It is the
Lower Jurassic period, in an area that will one day become the
Hudson River Palisades. To the east, the Atlantic coast is just
forming, but Manhattan's sparkling armature is still 195 million
years distant.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the sound of footsteps. A coelophysis, a dinosaur that
resembles an ostrich, plashes through the fronds. See how its
three-toed feet imprint the boggy ground. Now fast-forward to the
present. The bog has hardened into sandstone, and the prints left
by coelophysis (pronounced seel-o-FY-sis), looking like an odd
leaf, or Donald Duck's feet, are embossed in the rock. Some high
school students poking around in the woods discover the prints, and
they are cut out of the rock and hauled off to the State Museum in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Now there are more people poking around in the
underbrush where the footprints were found. Will a coelophysis, a
prehistoric revenant, suddenly jump out and bite them? What a silly
idea. These are the New York City suburbs, after all. The people
just want to stop another developer from moving into their area,
and they will seize any straw, whether an endangered species, a
historic event or the legacy of a passing dinosaur, in their
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if there are more footprints there or not,''
said Elayn Armaniaco, whose house on Greenbush Road is up the hill
from the site. ``Dinosaurs are exciting, and to have this link to
our history here is exciting, and it ought to be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-acre lot where coelophysis once trod is now owned by
Palisades Volkswagen-Audi-Volvo, which wants to put a new
dealership on the land, with the entrance on state Route 303. But
the rear parking lot of the dealership, while 40 feet below
Greenbush Road, would come within 100 or so feet of Greenbush
horizontally. With the rumble and hiss of Route 303 already in
their ears, members of the Greenbush Road Coalition, which Ms.
Armaniaco heads, have seized on coelophysis as a weapon in a
lawsuit seeking to overturn a zoning permit granted to the car
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired a lawyer, and he charged us to pursue any piece of
any information anywhere that we could present,'' Ms. Armaniaco
said. ``We found out about the dinosaur tracks, which is
significant, but what is more significant is that we have a letter
from the state paleontologist who says that these were the only
dinosaur remains in the state of New York, and that is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting natural history to undo the work of the zoning board
is hardly unique in the suburbs these days, and examples abound in
the town of Orangetown, of which Blauvelt is a part.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, residents persuaded the Town Board to revoke
a permit for an industrial park on Route 303, citing the importance
of trees to the ecosystem. The developer sued and won an $8 million
judgment, which the town is still paying.
</P>
<P>
   Residents also objected to the new IBM training center in
Palisades, south of here, on the grounds that the project would
disturb a pair of bald eagles. And then there was something about
an endangered species raised in the effort to block a developer who
has acquired 50 acres on Clausland Mountain, overlooking the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's called the Eastern wood rat,'' said Thom Kleiner,
the Orangetown town supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbush Road Coalition does not like the suggestion that
coelophysis is only a three-toed stalking horse for its campaign.
But when the politicians seem powerless against property owners who
want to develop their land, coalition members say, people must
seize any slender reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for someone to say, `Well, I've got to fight
and this is the only weapon I could grab,' '' said Danforth W.
Toan, vice president of the Historical Society of Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   But to Donald Brenner, a lawyer who represents the auto dealer,
the story of coelophysis is like the 10th sequel to a horror movie
he has to watch over and over. ``We're dealing with an ostrich type
of dinosaur that could travel 50 miles per hour,'' he said. ``So
there are going to be tracks everywhere. Does that mean we just
stop everything?''

CRIME-RING _ Potential witnesses against an Arizona crime syndicate

squelching an indictment against the suspected ringleaders. At
least four men are dead, including a key witness. The homicide
victims all were associates of Luis A. and Felipe ``Porky''

 &HT;    Bobby Labonte has Gibbs up front
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Joe Gibbs knows all about Super Bowl trophies,
but getting close to NASCAR hardware is another story.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of Winston Cup racing, the former coach of the
Washington Redskins finally has a title contender in Bobby Labonte.
The No. 18 Pontiac driver is the pole sitter in today's UAW-GM 500
at Lowe's Motor Speedwaynear Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is second in the Winston Cup points standings with six
races left in the season. Rookie sensation Tony Stewart, who also
drives for Gibbs, is fourth in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Joe Gibbs Racing) has been working since (1992) trying to get
in a position where we could make a run for a championship,'' Gibbs
said. ``We were expecting to turn the corner with Bobby at some
point. In the past, we have been a team with Bobby that could win
races, but we weren't the team that could step to the next level
and be consistent every week to run for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is finally the year where we did that. Bobby has
been good almost every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has won four races, which is tied for third-best on the
circuit, and has posted 18 top-five finishes. He was eighth at
Martinsville, Va., last weekend to move ahead of Mark Martin in the
point standings. Labonte trails leader Dale Jarrett by 251 points.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing the points race, Labonte is optimistic but
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could put it that way (that we are running out
time), but we might have run out of time six weeks ago, too''
Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deal where with every race that goes by, mathematically
it gets harder (to catch Jarrett). I'm not really worried about
that because I'm glad where we are. We're lucky we are in second,
because as many times as I have messed up, it could have been a lot
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, 35, has brought acclaim to Joe Gibbs Racing, which in
turn has given stablity to the low-key driver. Labonte has been in
Winston Cup racing for eight seasons, including the last five for
Gibbs. Labonte finished a career-best sixth in the point standings
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Motor Speedway seems to bring out the best in Labonte.
With Wednesday night's effort, he has won the pole position for all
three races this season at the 1.5-mile oval. He nearly captured
the Coca-Cola 600 last May, but was edged out by Jeff Burton. His
first Winston Cup victory was at the '95 Coca-Cola 600, and he has
been worse than sixth at the Concord, N.C., track only once in the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte will be driving the same race car he won with at
Michigan and finished runner-up with at The Brickyard in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come to Charlotte everybody is pumped up,'' Labonte
said. ``For whatever reason, when we come here we know we have a
better shot than maybe we do at other places.''

WEST: SHAQ WILL WIN MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ Jerry West doesn't fancy himself much of a
prognosticator.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers executive won't guess how many games his team should
win this season. Won't even say how long it might take for the
Lakers to gel under new coach Phil Jackson. But when it comes to
Shaquille O'Neal, West speaks with the boldness of a professional
handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make a prediction regarding him,'' West said
Saturday. ``I think he's going to be the most valuable player in
the league this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The MVP trophy has eluded O'Neal in his seven pro seasons
despite his perpetual rank among league leaders in scoring and
rebounding. And West makes this prediction even as Jackson projects
a scoring decline for O'Neal, who must function as more of a passer
in the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that might be what O'Neal needs to become an MVP _ a
requirement to broaden his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille O'Neal is going to touch the ball a lot, but he's
going to be asked to do some other things with regard to passing
the ball, a little bit different kind of a movement,'' West said.
``I see a tremendous enthusiasm on his part. I mean, he's as happy
as I've seen him since he's been here in Los Angeles. And I have to
believe an awful lot of that is he believes in what this coach is
trying to do. And more importantly, he feels that this system will
allow him to reach his goal, and that's to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who already has a scoring title on his resume (1994-95),
said he is willing to score less, pass and rebound more and push up
his blocked-shots average. But as for the MVP title?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more focused on the team this year, I'm not really worried
about individual accolades,'' he said. ``I know if I do my thing,
my name will always be up there in the running. I never knew how
they (reporters) pick that . . . but I'm not going to be going city
to city kissing people's (butts) trying to get some votes. . . . As
long as my team does well, then I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson likes Jordan: Jackson praised his current starting five
_ O'Neal, A.C. Green, Glen Rice (alternating with Rick Fox), Kobe
Bryant and Derek Fisher _ for its effective play in Friday night's
fullcourt scrimmage, the first of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   He was also pleased with the play of his rookie/free-agent team,
particularly 6-10 forward Gerald Jordan. The rookie team led by
Jordan and first-round pick Devean George outplayed the Lakers'
veteran second unit, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will play in front of the public and media for the
first time tonight, in a 7 p.m. scrimmage at UC Santa Barbara's
Thunderdome.

By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ The Big Man is practicing free throws, and he
makes the art for which he's so notorious look so simple as he
makes one after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never misses during these workouts,'' says Chris Bodaken,
long-time video coordinator of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour morning practice of the Lakers has ended, but The
Big Man continues his free throw accuracy under the watchful
guidance of one of the team's new assistant coaches, Tex Winter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Big Man, draped in perspiration, an imposing
physical specimen at over 7 feet and over 300 pounds, shambles
regally to the sidelines for a few moments of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much weight have you lost?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm about the same as I was last year,'' replies Shaquille
O'Neal, meaning the Lakers' center still is in the 340 vicinity.
``But I'm in much better shape. I've worked out hard all summer,
lifting weights, running, gearing myself up for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in good shape at the start of last season, but there
was that lockout and it threw everybody off. It seemed like we
always were going to start in 30 days. November came, 30 days.
December came, 30 days. January came, 30 days. We didn't start
until February, and by then I wasn't in the shape I should have
been. But that won't be the case this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning his seventh season in the NBA, Shaquille O'Neal finds
himself under wide-spread scrutiny because he's a $15 million a
year superstar attraction who's never played on a world
championship team and never played for a coach as demanding as his
new one, Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damned right I have a burning desire to win an NBA title,'' he
says. ``What else to I have left to prove? I have shown I can
score, rebound, block shots. Sure, it's been frustrating. I want to
win as badly as anyone, but it just hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Shaquille O'Neal dramatically change his game at this late
juncture in his career? Can he forgo offense and concentrate on
defense? Can he and Kobe Bryant co-exist? Will he dutifully follow
Jackson's instructions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do what Phil Jackson wants me to do,'' says O'Neal, who
hasn't always done what previous coaches wanted. ``I call him
Father Phil because he reminds me so much of my father, who is a no
nonsense type of guy who demands you do what he says. Father Phil
has the resume with six world titles. How do you argue with him?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Phil Jackson is in total command of the
Lakers, right down to even closing off to the media all but the
final 15 minutes of these innocuous training camp sessions at the
UCSB gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no arguing between coaches and players as I've seen in
the past,'' says O'Neal, who himself had words with Del Harris last
season. ``I like what I see here so far. I like the triangle
offense. It gives you a lot of options, and gives me the
opportunity to show off my passing skills. I'm a good passer, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that we're going to be a major
force this season, and that Kobe Bryant and I can bring home a
title to L.A. I'm really looking forward to this season playing
with a new coach in a great new arena. It's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you willing to commit to playing more defense?'' I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man nods his head gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I can play defense as well as any center,'' he says.
``If I tried to, I could block as many shots as Dikembe Mutombo and
Alonzo Mourning. It's just that I don't want to get in foul
trouble. You gotta understand, they (the officials) will call me
for anything. I get hammered routinely, and they'll let it go. Guys
constantly flop against me, but I still get stuck with the foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double standard I've had to live with, and it makes me
a little more restrained on defense. But no center dominates me at
the defensive end. If Father Phil wants me to pick it up
defensively, I certainly will. But it might come with a
price---foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Shaquille O'Neal why he never mastered the sky hook
perfected by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I did a long time ago when I was a kid,'' he relates.
``But the sky hook was old-fashioned, and I'm from the hip-hop age.
It's just something that my generation never related to. So I
stopped using it. I once saw Danny Manning do a jump hook, and I
liked that. I use that sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man is in an expansive mood, and why not?
</P>
<P>
   He might not be wearing any championship rings, but his annual
income dwarfs even Kevin Brown's from his earnings as an athlete, a
rap singer and movie actor.
</P>
<P>
   As if he needs to concern himself about securing his financial
future, O'Neal reveals he's doing just that---or perhaps
endangering it---by giving serious consideration to going into the
restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting to that age where I have to start thinking
corporate,'' he says. ``My people are looking to buy 10 Taco Bells
down in Houston and also some IHOPs (International House Of
Pancakes).''
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that Phil Jackson is keeping his fingers crossed
that this particular O'Neal venture falls through, since the last
thing Jackson wants is more culinary venues available to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it has been an irritant for O'Neal not having won an
NBA title, but it's doubtful he's had any sleepless nights over
such a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you were in Little League and your team lost, you'd cry
because you knew you might not have another chance to win a title
again,'' says O'Neal. ``And it was the same in high school and in
college. But in the pros, you don't cry because you know there will
always be another season when you'll be given an opportunity to win
the title. You just have to keep trying hard. And, believe me, I'll
be trying extra hard to win a title this season. . .''

IS THIS BISON EXTINCT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Detroit Pistons signed Brian Williams, for better or
worse, for seven seasons and enough loot to purchase seven percent
of an NFL franchise, they probably didn't realize their man in the
middle would end up in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   They also didn't think he was on the cusp of changing his name
to something that stirred visions of a lunch destination with
alternative meat welcome to Bison Dele, now take a number.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is the same rascal who without compensation
kissed an NBA official. So the Pistons must be more angry than
stunned that Dele would rather do business in Beirut than play
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a thousand times no.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source much closer to the Pistons than Lebanon,
Dele has become the most unpopular teammate on the Detroit scene
since the Pinto had a falling out with the Mustang and the LTD.
</P>
<P>
   What bugged his cronies the most was Dele's commitment to
mediocrity. This approach didn't exactly thrill his bosses, who now
view his ambivalence toward hoops as future salary-cap relief. With
Dele, the Pistons didn't seem prepared for a deep playoff run,
anyway. With cap room and creative thinking, they may be able to
re-sign their hero, Grant Hill, by hiring more help with that
spending cash.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is the former Magic-Nugget-Clipper-Bull up to in
Beirut? Well, we don't know what he weighs, but have been told Dele
owns a company in that land of paradise. According to legend, Dele
does have a pilot's license and if he shows less inertia at Middle
East business than on a low post in the NBA, he could be the only
human to play with and own Air Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But despite giving the Pistons far less than they bargained for,
we have to salute someone who's honest enough with himself to
forfeit $36 million in future salary ... someone with the chops to
irritate ex-Clipper coach Bill Fitch by taking helicopter trips
during free time on the road ... someone who jumps out of planes
when they're not on fire ... someone who treated a friend from the
team's support staff to impromptu Vegas excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who took time out from celebrating his role in the
Bulls' fifth NBA championship to phone Clipper equipment manager
Pete Serrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been 3 or 4 a.m on the night they won the
championship,'' Serrano said. ``It sounded like he was almost in
tears. He kept saying, `I got a ring, Pete. What an unbelievable
feeling this is.'''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Bison Dele to act as unencumbered by
conventional thinking as former teammate Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Dele, it should be pointed out, isn't acting.
</P>
<P>
   sub UF5 A Ming's ransom
</P>
<P>
   While Dele continues to elude captivity, another internationally
known center who remains at large is 19-year-old Yao Ming.
</P>
<P>
   Ming, who checks in at 7-foot-6 and an egg roll or two about 280
pounds, first stirred the imagination of American basketball
addicts at the 1998 Nike Camp. But his NBA dream continues to tread
water while he performs for the Shanghai Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bay Area-based agent Bill Duffy, Ming shouldn't be
expected in the NBA Draft until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most unbelievable, exhausting, circuitous
dealing I'll ever have,'' said Duffy, a graduate of Damien High in
La Verne, whose client list includes Clippers center Michael
Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Ming attempted to circumvent the red-tape required to leave
China several months ago by agreeing to be represented by a
U.S.-based agency that wasn't registered with the NBA. The deal was
voided, and Duffy worked his way back into the action.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, he said, is extended because several Shanghai
big-timers including the mayor have to issue their blessing. His
current team also could block the move unless it's given a piece of
Ming's NBA action.
</P>
<P>
   How good is this kid?
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, whose subjective view is salved a bit by his pedigree as
a former player (Santa Clara), believes Ming like Olowokandi could
be the No.1 pick in whatever NBA Draft he is eligible for.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the worst,'' Duffy said, ``he's Rik Smits.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll put our money on Duffy, who convinced the Toronto Raptors
to reward Michael Stewart (1.5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game)
with a six-year, $24 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations When Shaquille O'Neal reported to the
Lakers' training camp at 340 pounds, local wiseguys thought he'd
prepared for Phil ``Zen Master P'' Jackson's triangle offense by
studying wedges of pizza. Not to worry; the Diesel reportedly is
dragging around 340 pounds of muscle. But if he doesn't tuck in
that elbow, or stop jerking the release, or start thinking of St.
Louis (Arch, baby!), that 340 could be his free-throw percentage.
... Draft 2000 sleeper: Introducing 7-0 Mamadou N'diaye of Auburn,
an active, springy, shoot-last center from Senegal, who according
to witnesses was the best college prospect at Pete Newell's famed
Big Man Camp. ... A snoop who's taking in the Charlotte camp says
the skills of rookie point guard Baron Davis seem to translating
quite nicely to the NBA. ... A source close to new Indiana Pacers
backup center Zan Tabak said the Clippers' initial interest in the
7-0 Croatian was almost sabotaged when they weren't allowed to pay
for his flight from Europe to L.A. But after finding out Tabak had
auditioned in Indiana, the Clips were permitted to spring for that
half-continent hop. ... Sworn-to-be-future-ex-Clipper Maurice
Taylor, perhaps the league's foremost fan of Comedy Central's
``South Park,'' gives the movie version 3{ stars out of a possible
5. ``They had two hours to work with,'' Taylor explained, ``but
only killed Kenny once.''

   IOWA CITY _ Penn State looked hot and bothered. Hot because its
game here against Iowa was played in 70-degree weather, nothing
like the cool breeze it had left back on its Eastern campus.
Bothered because the Nittany Lions kept slipping early and because
Iowa kept bouncing back, making them sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State led by only 7-0 for the game's first 29 minutes 51
seconds. And then in the second half the Nittany Lions rode their
crew of banging running backs and their rigid defense to a 31-7
victory before 66,398 fans at Kinnick Stadium. Penn State, ranked
third by The New York Times and second by The Associated Press,
improved to 6-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Ten. Iowa fell to 1-4
and 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa lost, 49-3, at Michigan State last week. Penn State had
enjoyed two weeks off since its last game. Well maybe ``enjoyed''
is not the right word, according to James Boyd, a Penn State
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we practiced really hard during that time,'' Boyd said.
``Guys had a lot of cuts and bumps and bruises coming into this
game. And then we went out there today and it felt like a heat
wave. Our guys were suffering. It took some time to get used to the
heat, but that's no excuse for the way we started.''
</P>
<P>
   They started slowly. Iowa, though, was excited, leaping for an
upset that would make their season. Penn State took advantage of
that emotion. On its second possession, with 7:32 left in the first
quarter, it ran a reverse to receiver Eddie Drummond, who hopped,
skipped and then sped past all 11 overpursuing Hawkeyes for a
68-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were chasing us a lot,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State
coach, explaining the call and the play. ``They were emotional.
They were really flying after everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa continued to take chances on defense and play inspired
football. Twice in the half it intercepted Penn State passes, both
times ending drives deep inside Iowa territory. Finally the
Hawkeyes gave in, with only nine seconds left before halftime, when
Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey kept the ball and kept his
balance, darting into the end zone on a 6-yard scramble to give the
Nittany Lions a 14-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty pleased with the effort,'' said Kirk Ferentz, the
Iowa coach. ``But I'm not happy with the loss. We showed that we
can play pretty well with a good football team. We were still in it
in the fourth quarter, so hopefully this will be a learning
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa scored on a 40-yard pass from Randy Reiners to fullback Rob
Thein with 9:31 left in the third quarter, making the score 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the game was decided by Penn State's ability to run
the ball passionately and by a fourth-and-goal Iowa play that
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Eric McCoo led Penn State with 130 rushing yards, but five of
his teammates gained at least 20 rushing yards each. Penn State's
fierce foursome of backs _ McCoo, Aaron Harris, Omar Easy and Larry
Johnson _ differ in size and speed, but all run hard. So does
another backup, tailback Kenny Watson, not to mention the other big
fullbacks. This group helped Penn State account for 341 rushing
yards and 19 rushing first downs. The Nittany Lions ran the ball 51
times, averaging 6.7 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa managed only 48 rushing yards and three rushing first
downs.
</P>
<P>
   McCoo nearly matched the Hawkeyes' total on one play. With 4:36
left in the third quarter, he burst free for a 47-yard touchdown
run to make it 21-7. Iowa was finished on the first play of the
fourth quarter when it could not convert a fourth-and-goal from the
Penn State 2. Reiners tried a keeper run outside and then turned
inside. Linebacker Brandon Short was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play meant a lot,'' Short said. ``It showed the defense
we can still make the big play when needed.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10:05 left Penn State added another rushing touchdown, its
fourth, on a 10-yard run by Harris, and it scored a field goal six
minutes later. Once it was over it looked easy, but Paterno said it
had not been.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't commit a turnover and when you don't get turnovers
it can be tough,'' Paterno said. ``We ran well. All of our backs
are strong and they all block well. We've been fortunate. We've had
groups of great backs before, but this group doesn't have that
great one yet. Our line and especially our tackles are doing the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   When a team rushes for 300-plus yards, it ought to get 60
points, some of the Nittany Lions said. They can try next Saturday
when Ohio State (unranked by The Times; No. 21 A.P.) visits them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Penn State players remained hot. Others were cool _
they are confident this team will run over all comers.  &QL;

RED SOX WIN, BUT IT RAISES QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now the real fun starts at Fenway, the guessing games
and praying of the faithful for the healing of the hurting players.
Will Pedro Martinez be back from his injury, and if so will he
pitch Game 4 on Sunday instead of waiting for a possible Game 5 on
Monday in Cleveland?
</P>
<P>
   As the fans and players filed out into the streets of old Back
Bay Saturday night, after a 9-3 Red Sox victory over the Indians,
there were many other questions. Will Nomar Garciaparra's injured
wrist recover enough to allow him to swing the bat and play
shortstop? Can the Red Sox win two more from a Cleveland team that
still seems far superior? When should Martinez and Garciaparra
return? And even, what time will Game 4 begin?
</P>
<P>
   Because of television considerations, Game 4 on Sunday was to be
played either in the afternoon or the evening. The starting time
would be determined at the conclusion of the Yankees game at Texas
later Saturday night. A Yankee victory to end the series would mean
a night game in Boston. A Rangers victory to prolong the series
would mean a day game in Boston. Either way, some of the customers
would have time to attend church and meditate over Saturday's
heroics that cut Cleveland's lead to two games to one in the
best-of-5 first round of the American League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox won it with a six-run explosion in the seventh inning,
which included a three-run home run by designated hitter Brian
Daubach and a two-run double by third baseman John Valentin, who
had also hit a solo home run in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The teams took turns leading, and the Indians tied it at 3-3 in
the top of the seventh on a throwing error by Valentin, whose
throwing error was a major factor in Cleveland's victory in Game 1.
This set up his redemption under the bright lights of this quirky
old edifice.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, Cleveland reliever Jaret Wright
was replaced by Ricardo Rincon after Wright began the inning by
walking Lou Merloni and hitting Jason Varitek. After retiring the
next two batters, Rincon walked Jose Offerman to bring up Valentin
with the bases loaded and two out.
</P>
<P>
   On a 3-2 pitch, Valentin ripped a ground-rule double to left,
scoring two runs and giving the Sox a 5-3 lead. Daubach, the next
batter, accidentally hit the home plate umpire, Tim Welke, in the
head, when he lost his bat while swinging and missing. On the next
pitch, Daubach kept the bat and hit a three-run homer to make it
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Boston starter was Pedro Martinez's older brother,
Ramon Martinez, who joined the roster in September after
rehabilitation from shoulder surgery. Merloni took the place of
Garciaparra at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was hit with a pitch on the right wrist a week
before the season ended. Although he missed the final games, he
started in Game 1 of this series in Cleveland, hitting a home run
on his first trip to the plate and a double on his second. But he
went 0 for 3 in Game 2 and skipped a workout Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't start,'' manager Jimy Williams said before Saturday's
game. When someone asked if Garciaparra would be available to
pinch-hit, Williams responded: ``If he can't start, then he can't
pinch-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second serious injury to the Red Sox in this series.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Pedro Martinez left after four innings with muscle
pain in his back. Martinez, who led the American League with 23
victories, is considered the probable winner of the Cy Young award
as best pitcher in the league. His recovery and return is
uncertain. Under his normal rotation, his next scheduled start
would be on Monday in Cleveland, if Game 5 is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra won the league batting title with a .357 average and
is a candidate for the league's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez and Garciaparra are the two best players on a
flawed team that reached the playoffs as the wild card. To some Sox
supporters, the injuries will add another page to the bitter lore
of the franchise. The team has not won a World Series since 1918,
and it came into Saturday's game having lost 18 of its previous 19
postseason games. Although some New England fans are tired of
discussing the legend, it is often said here that the team suffers
under a curse against the franchise for selling Babe Ruth to the
Yankees before the 1920 season.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez got off to a good start, allowing one run in the
fourth inning and setting down the side in order in the fifth. In
the bottom of the fifth, the Indians' starter Dave Burba, could not
continue because of tightness in the underside of his right
forearm. Burba had given up only one hit but appeared to be in some
distress on the mound in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Burba was replaced by Wright, who was greeted by a line drive
off his shin hit by Troy O'Leary. Although O'Leary was thrown out
by third baseman Travis Fryman, the liner was a sign of things to
come. The Red Sox took a 2-1 lead on three hits and a sacrifice
fly. Darren Lewis knocked in the first run with a single, and Trot
Nixon got the next one with the sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez began to struggle in the sixth, giving up a leadoff
double to Roberto Alomar, who scored on a fielder's choice when the
Red Sox could not make a tough double play on Harold Baines'
grounder to first.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the bottom of the sixth, Valentin hit a 2-0 pitch
off Wright over the center-field fence to give the Red Sox a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians manufactured an unearned run to tie it in the top of
the seventh, as Kenny Lofton singled, took second on a ground out,
stole third, and scored on the throwing error by Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was time for the Red Sox to bat, and put the game
out of reach.

   1. WHY THE PRESS LOVES JOHN MCCAIN, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is miles ahead in the very first contest of the 2000
campaign: the press primary. Journalists go weak in the knees
around the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the hacks love McCain? You could start with our
admiration for a quality not many of us possess: physical courage.
McCain isn't just a war hero, he's a Faulknerian character, in a
very different sense than Bill Clinton is. And I think that at this
point, even those of us who think Clinton has been a good president
hunger for a successor more deserving of our respect.

   2. AMERICA IS A LOT LESS WHITE THAN IT LOOKS, by Brent Staples
</P>
<P>
   Outside of recent African immigrants to the United States, there
are virtually no black Americans of purely African descent, which
is to say no black people who lack white ancestry, left in this
country. Four centuries of race mixing have had a similar impact on
Americans who define themselves as white. Convincing estimates show
that by 1950 about one in five white Americans had some African
ancestry. How did so much ``black'' blood get into so many
``white'' people?

   3. THE BUSH TRIANGULATION STRATEGY, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   The media's understanding of George W. Bush's
``triangulation''--that he is trying to ``distance himself from the
GOP's right wing'' and ``stake out the middle ground'' between two
extremes--oversimplifies the game. Bush isn't positioning himself
on a straight line between Bill Clinton and the congressional GOP.
He is venturing into a third dimension, rejecting the whole
Washington debate, and defining his contest with Al Gore along a
new axis.

it veered off course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere. NASA
revealed the cause: One part of the orbiter's navigation system was
speaking in English units and another in metric. Why hasn't the
U.S. adopted the metric system?

 &HT;    Braves dispose of Astros, face Mets in NLCS
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Ken Caminiti put a charge into a John Rocker
slider in the bottom of the ninth inning Saturday and the Braves
clinging to a 7-5 lead, Rocker looked at catcher Eddie Perez with
fear in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't realize center fielder Andruw Jones was camped under
the ball a few yards shy of the warning track. He didn't realize
the Braves were about to wrap up their eighth consecutive trip to
the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed my hat, like `Gah, ball, please come down,''' Rocker
said. ``I didn't get a chance to celebrate. I was still gasping for
air when Andruw caught that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' catch provided the final out of another nerve-racking
victory over the Houston Astros, who battled valiantly but lost the
best-of-five series 3-1. The Braves will open the NLCS on Tuesday
night at Turner Field against the New York Mets, who also wrapped
up a 3-1 first-round win Saturday by beating Arizona 4-3 in 10
innings.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, the Braves didn't hug, jump around or make
a human pile when they gathered on the mound. They just let out a
collective breath and did their usual high-fives down a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relief,'' echoed Perez, Rocker, manager Bobby Cox and any
other Brave who was asked to express his post-game sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been this tired after a four-game
series,'' Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lost Game 1, but came back to win Game 2 on Kevin
Millwood's one-hitter, Game 3 with the help of a 10th-inning escape
from a bases-loaded, nobody-out jam, and then Game 4 with four outs
from Rocker to kill a serious last-gasp effort from the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   For this, they get the Mets, who come back to Atlanta for an
NLCS many anticipated in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people knew we were a force (before this series),''
Chipper Jones said. ``I don't know if people have really taken us
seriously as far as being a contender. With a little luck now,
maybe we can contend.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine line between winning championships and heading
home. Just ask the Astros, who just lost their third consecutive
Division Series in the most excruciating of ways.
</P>
<P>
   After losing Friday night's 12-inning heartbreaker and trailing
7-0 against John Smoltz on Saturday, the Astros should have been
finished. But they had something left for the final game in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's three-run home, his third of the series, cut the
Braves' lead to 7-4 in the eighth inning. Another RBI hit by Tim
Bogar, and the Braves were begging Rocker for some more heroics.
Outside of a walk to Stan Javier, he was perfect.

IN BATTLE OF UNBEATENS, SPARTANS PULL A STUNNER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN U. BACON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ The rivalry between Michigan and Michigan
State usually produces a lot of trash talking, unimaginative
football and, 23 of the previous 29 years, a Michigan victory. But
the intrastate rivals broke with all three traditions Saturday in a
thrilling 34-31 Michigan State triumph.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1961, the two teams entered the contest
undefeated. And for the first time since 1995, the Spartans won,
thanks to a defense that held Michigan's running attack to 42 yards
on 21 carries, and to the offensive combination of quarterback
Billy Burke and split end Plaxico Burress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt more confidence in my team today than I ever have,''
said Spartans coach Nick Saban, whose team improved to 6-0 and 3-0
in the Big Ten. ``This is the best feeling I've ever had. This is
the happiest I've ever seen the players, the happiest I've ever
seen our fans. I know how much this game means to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans derailed Michigan, now 5-1 and 2-1 in the
conference, by scoring three touchdowns on three consecutive
second-half possessions to build a 34-17 fourth-quarter lead. Burke
completed 21 of 36 passes for a school record 400 yards, and
Burress, who buried the Wolverines with a school record 255 yards
receiving, caught 10 of the passes.
</P>
<P>
   On defense the Spartans held Michigan's running game to just two
yards on 19 carries in the third quarter, forcing the Wolverines to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said last week that if the Spartans
``keep doing what they're doing, they'll be one of the great
defenses of all time. There isn't any question, this is the best
wide receiving corps we've seen. I can say clear cut it's the best
Michigan State team since 1987, and that was a great football team.
They've got a lot of weapons, and no weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr's analysis seemed vindicated on all counts Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In each of Michigan's games this season, Carr has played senior
quarterback Tom Brady in the first quarter and sophomore Drew
Henson in the second. Like a basketball coach with two shooting
guards, Carr then has the luxury of playing whoever has the hottest
hand that day.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, that initially seemed to be Henson, the summertime
Yankee farmhand, who connected on 6 of 9 first-half passes. But he
gained no net yards throwing in the second half, suffering an
interception and two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   With Michigan down by 27-10 with 2 minutes 56 seconds remaining
in the third quarter, Carr turned to Brady, who led the Wolverines
to three consecutive touchdowns. The third, which capped a 96-yard
drive fueled by pinpoint, 8-for-8 passing, brought the Wolverines
to within 34-31, with 2:47 left in the game. Michigan's poorly
executed onside kick, however, gave the Spartans the ball back for
good.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to imagine a sweeter victory for the
Spartans. The Wolverines actively resisted the Spartans' admission
to the Big Ten in 1953, and vowed to refuse the newly created Paul
Bunyan trophy for state supremacy if they beat their younger
brothers that year. They didn't, losing by 14-6, but Michigan State
never forgot the slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame and Ohio State were rivalries, but Michigan State
was a war, almost a civil war, a real hatred,'' said 1992 Michigan
captain Chris Hutchinson. ``We out and out didn't like each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But both schools have recently made a conscious effort at
civility. ``First of all, give credit to Michigan State,'' Carr
said after the game. ``They are an outstanding football team, a
well-coached, physical team, and that was evident in their play
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that you win, you know that you've done something.
And the ones that you lose, it's miserable. You put so much into
this game, it's always a difficult loss _ and yet, you have to put
it behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Saban was equally diplomatic. ``I think Michigan has the
firepower to beat anyone in this league,'' he said. ``They can
still win the Big Ten championship. I still believe it.''

SENATE WEIGHS WHETHER NUCLEAR TEST BAN WOULD ERODE U.S. DETERRENCE
</HEADLINE>
 
(CORRECTS ``Armed Services'' to Foreign Relations in 9th graf)  (With TEST-BAN-ASSESS) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In debating the historic treaty that would ban all
underground nuclear testing, the Senate is reliving one of the most
divisive arguments of the Cold War: Do international arms control
treaties enhance or imperil America's nuclear deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   To its supporters, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as it is
formally known, would lock in American superiority achieved from
more than 1,000 nuclear tests since 1945, and curb the spread of
advanced atomic arms.
</P>
<P>
   But to its critics, the ban would freeze an accord-abiding
United States dangerously in place while states like North Korea
and Iran, or even China or Russia, cheated and conducted
clandestine tests that eroded America's advantage and set off a new
global arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago, the U.S.
atomic arsenal has been a hedge against not only a resurgent Russia
or hegemonic China but also a growing number of nuclear nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deterrent has never been as important to the security of
Americans as it is today with rogue states developing the capacity
to attack our cities and our population,'' said Jeane Kirkpatrick,
the U.S. delegate to the United Nations under President Reagan.
Kirkpatrick opposes the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives express fears that the test ban treaty is a
dangerous first step toward weakening America's nuclear deterrent
and preventing the United States from building newer and deadlier
weapons in the future. These critics note with alarm that the
treaty's preamble says the cessation of all nuclear weapons tests
``constitutes an effective means of nuclear disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he thinks that ``in the White
House they honestly believe that if we all stand in a circle and we
all hold hands and we all disarm, everyone is going to be happy.
I'm not at all satisfied with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters dismiss such concerns as unfounded hyperbole,
saying the United States has no intention of giving up its nuclear
shield. While the pact cannot prevent countries from building crude
nuclear devices or from conducting militarily insignificant nuclear
explosions, supporters say the pact can restrict a nation's ability
to develop and field the most advanced atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is potential proliferators who need to test. We do not,''
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee last week. ``The treaty will make it more
difficult and dangerous for countries to develop and modernize
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this debate over deterrence is the safety and
reliability of a national nuclear weapons inventory that has
steadily shrunk from 12,000 strategic warheads in the late 1980s to
about 6,000 warheads now. Under the Start 2 treaty, now pending
approval by the Russian Parliament, the American arsenal would
decline to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads _ a marked reduction that would
nonetheless leave the United States with by far the world's most
formidable nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed a moratorium on underground nuclear
tests in 1992, complementing a treaty banning atmospheric tests
adopted in 1963. The underground tests were used to try out new
designs and check for safety flaws in existing bombs. To maintain
the safety of the aging arsenal now, the government employs a
series of sophisticated computer models and non-nuclear explosive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, physicists at the nation's three nuclear weapons
laboratories _ Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore _ must
certify that the stockpile is safe and reliable. If problems are
detected in a weapon, the whole weapons class could be recalled,
effectively drawing down the nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Under a condition President Clinton attached to the test ban
treaty, the laboratory directors' failure to certify the stockpile
would be grounds for the United States to pull out of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   The government spends $4.5 billion a year on the sophisticated
test program, but in testimony last week, the laboratory directors
said it would not be fully operational for at least five to 10
years. In giving the treaty a highly conditional endorsement, the
scientists said the arsenal is safe and reliable now, but they
warned about inadequate financing, shortages of trained experts and
aging weapons in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program
will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent
without nuclear testing,'' said John C. Browne, director of Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. ``However, I am concerned
about several trends that are reducing my confidence level each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even staunch arms control advocates like Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., express reservations about the science-based substitute for
actual testing. ``The bottom line is that the Senate is being asked
to trust the security of our country to a program that is unproven
and unlikely to be fully operational until perhaps 2010,'' said
Lugar, who opposes the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were to lose its nuclear edge, critics
contend, allies now under the American umbrella might feel
compelled to develop their own atomic weapons, a scenario that
treaty supporters say is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican Policy Committee, chaired by Sen. Larry
Craig of Idaho, last week issued an analysis of the pact saying,
``Today's nuclear arsenal is adequate for current threats, but this
may not always be the case. The CTBT will limit our ability to
tailor a nuclear defense to meet unexpected threats or new
missions.''
</P>
<P>
   But under the accord, most of the 4,000 components in a nuclear
weapon can be modified, including the casings, detonators,
batteries and arming systems, nuclear physicists say. Parts that
wear out can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, the weapons laboratories modified the
B61-7 nuclear bomb into the B61-Mod 11 earth-penetrating weapon by
hardening the outer casing, improving the bomb's ability to destroy
deeply buried targets.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Pentagon has determined that it is not always
cost-efficient to incorporate the latest safety devices in all
weapons. In 1992, the Navy opted not to replace its W88 Trident
missile warhead with a new version that had a less sensitive
explosive, said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher at the
Natural Resources Defense Council's nuclear program. Instead, the
Navy devised a cheaper way to improve safety by changing the way it
loaded the warhead onto the missile, Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   Actual nuclear tests have been more important for perfecting new
types of weapons than correcting flaws in existing arms, nuclear
weapons experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the three weapons laboratories that reviewed
problems detected in the arsenal determined that of 830 specific
defects found from 1958 to 1993, fewer than 1 percent were
discovered through nuclear tests. And virtually all of the
problematic weapons have been phased out of the stockpile.

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS' EXIT DOESN'T ALWAYS DOOM A COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY and SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Southwestern Bell Corp. rooted its
headquarters in St. Louis for 113 years. Then, one day in 1992, the
company issued a news release.
</P>
<P>
   So long, St. Louis. Howdy, San Antonio _ ``the gateway to
Mexico'' as Southwestern Bell called its new home. And just like
that, its executive connections to St. Louis were no longer in
service.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing has happened in Omaha, Neb., and Wichita,
Minneapolis and San Francisco: A major corporate citizen gets
hitched to another community.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears to be happening in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week of a pending buyout of Sprint Corp.
by MCI WorldCom threatens to rob the area of something every
Chamber of Commerce covets _ a headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cities tend to share the same initial reactions to news that a
headquarters could be lost: anger; helplessness; a sense of
betrayal; panic. How could you take those high executive salaries
elsewhere? Who will sit on our community boards? What benefactors
will fund our symphony?
</P>
<P>
   If other cities offer a lesson, it's that the consequences are
not so awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we wish Southwestern Bell were back,'' said Russ
Signorino, a labor analyst and consultant for the United Way of
Greater St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in trying to make up for that loss in civic involvement,
lots of times you can find new opportunities and new players that
you didn't know existed. You can make it up with medium and small
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis lost not only Southwestern Bell _ now known as SBC
Communications Inc. _ but also in 1997 bid adieu to McDonnell
Douglas Corp. headquarters in a merger with Seattle-based Boeing
Corp., although St. Louis has kept most of the 23,000 manufacturing
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Together the departures cost St. Louis more than 1,500 executive
and managerial jobs. Still, the region has gained 84,000 jobs since
1994 and moved up the national ranks of cities with Fortune 500
headquarters, from eighth place to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   And civic endeavors are finding new caretakers. Support for pro
sports has come from Columbia _ home to E. Stanley Kroenke,
minority owner of the Rams football franchise, and to Bill and
Nancy Laurie, who put up $400 million to acquire the St. Louis
Blues hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the exit of a big corporate player can have lasting
effects. Without a well-known chief executive officer leading the
cheers, charitable giving may suffer, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of mergers and headquarters shutdowns flattened
fund-raising for Wichita's United Way of the Plains in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The charity clearinghouse received more than $308,000 from Pizza
Hut and its employees in 1993, but only $101,000 in 1997 after
Pizza Hut's base shifted to Texas. Thorn America and its workers
gave more than $114,000 in 1997; its donations disappeared this
year following a headquarters move. Community lifeline
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, few institutions chip in on civic
projects as much as Sprint does.
</P>
<P>
   Its $9 million contribution for the Union Station refurbishment
was the third-largest. It donated $4 million to the Royals
Succession Plan Fund. And when the Kansas City Zoo needed a new
attraction, the company backed the Sprint IMAX Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The company opened a call center to kick-start the 18th and Vine
restoration project. Friday is not just Friday here: At the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, it's Sprint Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hallmark tops the $2.75 million that Sprint and its
employees donated to the Heart of America United Way agencies last
year. Of the nearly $7 million the Sprint Foundation gave away in
1998, roughly $5 million went to area organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint officials have said they intend to remain a large
employer here and continue their corporate citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   People who study the effect of America's increasingly transient
companies note that hand-wringing won't change the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have control over this anyway,'' said Auburn
University researcher Danny Lam. ``You might as well be
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Internorth Inc. was a corporate citizen
without peer in Omaha. It had adopted Central High School and
helped redeveloped Omaha's inner city and downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Then a series of mergers swallowed the homegrown natural gas
company. It changed its name to Enron Corp. and, in 1986, moved its
headquarters to Houston. Most of Enron's 2,200 jobs and its top
executives left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very much a feeling of panic,'' said Vicki Krecek, a
vice president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. ``This
made it clear that you cannot count on even the most loyal
corporate citizen to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders say that most everything _ the arts, charities,
downtown retail _ would be healthier had Enron stayed. Yet the void
has largely been filled.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Joslyn Art Museum. Its three most important
collections in 1986 were all on loan from Enron. Upon moving, Enron
donated one to the museum and sold it another. The museum couldn't
afford, and so lost, the third.
</P>
<P>
   Enron also followed through on a fund-raising campaign that
delivered an additional $2 million to the museum. While it
continues to give gifts, they are smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's forced us to go out to other people in the community who
used to say, `You've got Enron; why do you need my support?' &UR; ''
said Audrey Kauders, museum deputy director. ``It has been a net
loss, but it's not the end of the world.'' Filling the voids
</P>
<P>
   Some places can weather corporate departures almost without
notice, especially in the 1990s economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years San Francisco has lost the headquarters of
Pacific Telesis Group, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, TransAmerica
and AirTouch Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for every Class A company moving out, 10 smaller ones are
moving in,'' said Michael Sigala of the city's economic development
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, closings of military bases and large manufacturing
plants gave some cities chances to spread their economic risks
among smaller replacement businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point to the redevelopment of the steel-plant district
in Pittsburgh, the rebirth of Baltimore's industrial waterfront and
the mix of small manufacturers in the mammoth plant that Chase
Brass Co. left behind in Waterbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said he suspected that even with the Sprint merger, many
jobs would stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a technical staff that is very happy in Kansas,
you would be very foolish to tell them to move,'' Lam said. ``They
probably have family there, their network of child care, schools,
you name it. You could have a lot of them quitting on you if you
tried to force them to move.''
</P>
<P>
   A symphony or a museum that depends heavily on a few corporate
sponsors, he said, is vulnerable to the fortunes of those few
firms. One big corporation, Lam said, ``shouldn't be a magnet for
solutions for all of a community's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing the headquarters of Honeywell Inc., Minneapolis is
concerned about also losing an inner-city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Honeywell's executives have worked in a campus in
the Phillips district, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. The
company has pumped millions of dollars into developing housing
there.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell's headquarters and 800 administrative jobs will move
to New Jersey pending regulatory approval of a merger with
AlliedSignal Inc. But the company has pledged to keep 7,500 jobs in
Minneapolis and to support the Phillips neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company of Southwestern Bell says it, too, strives to
be a good civic partner in places far beyond its San Antonio
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty simple, profound ideal,'' said SBC spokesman
Kevin Belgrade. ``We live in the communities we serve. We work in
those communities, and we want our workers to be happy whether
they're in St. Louis or San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC _ which still employs thousands in St. Louis _ recently made
a sizable donation to the St. Louis Zoo's $55 million capital
improvements campaign. What cannot be known is what SBC would have
meant to St. Louis had it stayed. That potential, instead, is all
San Antonio's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, only six months after Southwestern Bell announced the
move, the company joined a group of San Antonio investors that paid
$75 million to keep the Spurs basketball team in town. SBC
donations also have helped keep the San Antonio Symphony afloat and
will provide new lecture halls and a high-tech library for a small
college.
</P>
<P>
   Said Mario Hernandez, president of the city's economic
development group: ``The brainpower a community gains by having a
major headquarters, that's priceless.''

MISSOURI TOWN ONE OF MANY MARKING A DAY FOR PUMPED UP PUMPKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REPUBLIC, Mo. _ Last Saturday, Dan Westfall's pride and joy sat
for hours smack dab in the middle of North Main Avenue and West
Grant Street here _ the hub of this Greene County community.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was blocked off for a fall celebration, one of many that
animate small-town Missouri in the fall. Thus North Main was
essentially a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   What Westfall had wrought was a crowd magnet. Thousands circled
it slowly, eyed it, pointed at it, took photographs and videos and
touched it, murmuring.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a pumpkin. Albeit it a big one. It took nine men to
load Westfall's pumpkin onto his pickup. Once in Republic at the
Pumpkin Daze Festival, it took a forklift to place it on a feed
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The pumpkin weighed in at 647 pounds, easily a Missouri record.
The old record _ set in 1997 _ was 503 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Westfall just grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here in 1992 with a pumpkin that weighed 72 pounds,''
he said. ``Finished dead last. But I made up my mind. I was going
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be easy. All up and down North Main, 300-pounders
were common. A few rested on sturdy tables. Others were in the
backs of pickups. The big guys rested on carpet-covered pallets,
necessities for the forklift.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing what was on North Main to ordinary pumpkins was like
equating giants to Lilliputians, redwoods to redbuds, or whales to
minnows. Here was the Great Atlantic variety of Cucurbita Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was similar at 16 other places in the United States
and five in Canada last Saturday for the Great Pumpkin
Commonwealth's annual ``weigh-off.''
</P>
<P>
   The North American winner _ meaning the biggest in the world _
was Gerry Checkon of Spangler, Pa., with a 1,131-pound pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   The rival World Pumpkin Confederation also had its weigh-off
last weekend. Bill Bobier of Windsor, N.Y., had a 986-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   Westfall's entry seemed, well, spare.
</P>
<P>
   A matter of latitude, explained Leon Medlin, a grower and
weigh-in official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down here between the 37th and 38th parallels,'' Medlin
said. ``For really big pumpkins, you'd better be up around the 42nd
and 43rd parallels _ the northeast and southern Canada. There they
get warm days and more hours of sunlight. But the key there is
their cool nights. Pumpkins love cool nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Medlin said bigger Missouri pumpkins would come with better
seeds and by educating growers in the subtle pumpkin arts.
</P>
<P>
   Although pumpkins have been cultivated for 10,000 years, giant
pumpkins are a relatively recent phenomenon. An Ontario farmer
named William Warnock stunned the 1900 Paris World's Fair by
entering a 400-pound pumpkin. In 1903 he grew a 403-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   That record held until 1976, when a Pennsylvania pumpkin hit 451
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, dairy farmer Howard Dill was
hybridizing pumpkin seeds on his Nova Scotia farm. To giant-pumpkin
growers, the name Howard Dill is akin to that of Microsoft's Bill
Gates in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, propelled by Dill's seeds, pumpkin weights went
into the stratosphere. By the mid-1990s the first of what the
pumpkin-obsessed call ``kilo-pounders''_ which can grow 35 pounds a
day _ had been authenticated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play for keeps in the Northeast,'' said Westfall, who
lives just north of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes growers try a little skulduggery to add pounds to
their pumpkins. In past years there have been charges that growers
slathered auto body filler into cracks in the sides of pumpkins or
injected silicon gel or water into them.
</P>
<P>
   Westfall's seeds came from Dill _ $10 got three of the little
rascals measuring roughly an inch by a half-inch. Getting three
gold doubloons couldn't have been more exciting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Westfall, a warehouse worker, started them in individual pots
and then transferred them to his 25- by 50-foot patch.
</P>
<P>
   When the best vine sprouted, he pollinated it with an artist's
brush. He filled soda bottles with water, froze them and put them
near the blossom to keep it cool. He built sunscreens. He used
insulation, Plexiglas, even bed sheets for various enclosures. He
fertilized continuously. His wife, Wanda, helped throughout,
especially making sure that watering occurred precisely at 5 a.m.,
1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ackerman, a grower from Marshfield, said he knew one grower
who became so fixated that he set up banks of lights around his
patch in an attempt to replicate the longer daylight hours of
southern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he got was a $400 light bill,'' said Ackerman. ``But
that's how this stuff gets to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth offered a $15,000 prize for this
year's champion. In Republic, Westfall received $300. Figuring the
cost of his seeds, fertilizer, water, supplies, and more, he said,
he had laid out close to $100. But that doesn't even start to count
the labor and time he and Wanda put in.
</P>
<P>
   For Westfall, the payoff is down the road _ specifically the 200
or so seeds inside the pumpkin's 8-inch-thick walls. He's already
making plans for the 2000 growing season.
</P>
<P>
   As for his pumpkin's immediate fate, Westfall said he would put
it on display at a local business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, around Halloween, I'll take it home and carve it into a
jack-o'-lantern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you're supposed to.''

   NEW YORK _ When Behrens, the leading handicap horse in training,
meets Lemon Drop Kid, the leading 3-year-old in training, in
Sunday's $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park, the
advantage for both Horse of the Year and 3-year-old male honors
will be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Grade I, 1 1/4-mile contest is doubly important for Lemon
Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont Stakes and Travers at Saratoga Aug.
28, his last outing. Not only is the talented son of Kingmambo
chasing Behrens for the most important Eclipse Award, but also he
is chasing the now-retired Charismatic, winner of the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness, for the sophomore title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behrens is the top horse,'' said Hall of Famer Scotty
Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid. ``He's an excellent horse,
and he's done well. I'm not confident that I can beat him, but I'd
like to try. Lemon Drop Kid is a very competitive horse. He likes
to run, and, if we get a good, fast track, he'll prove he's a good
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the weather may not cooperate with Schulhofer, as
there is rain in the forecast. It's not that Lemon Drop Kid can't
stand up in the mud, but he hasn't won in it, with two seconds and
a third in three tries. Also, Vision and Verse, a 3-year-old who
was second to Lemon Drop Kid in the Belmont and Travers, hates mud;
his trainer, Bill Mott, said Vision and Verse will be scratched if
the track is off.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat Behrens would be a feather in Lemon Drop Kid's hat,''
said Schulhofer. ``To me, he's already done enough to win best
3-year-old. But if he beats Behrens, that will help a lot. He's
coming to the race as good as a horse can. He's much more mature.
He's grown up and filled out. He's a man now. He's got his mind on
what he's doing, and he's much more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about Behrens. He looks good. Whoever beats
him in the Gold Cup will be the winner. Hopefully, it will be Lemon
Drop Kid. Lemon Drop Kid is one hell of a good horse. He's got a
lot of talent and a lot of sense to go with it. It would be great
if he could be Horse of the Year. If he can beat Behrens, and win
the Breeders' Cup, then he could do it. He'd have a big edge on it.
When you come against older horses, and a horse like Behrens,
you're going into unknown territory. Lemon Drop Kid is going to
have to move up to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, a 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, has been first or
second in all seven starts this year (7-4-3-0). He captured the
Gulfstream Park Handicap, the Oaklawn Handicap, the Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk Downs, and the Suburban at Belmont, in
succession. His win streak was stopped only when the now-retired
Victory Gallop beat him by a nose following a furious stretch drive
in the Whitney at Saratoga Aug. 1, the last time he raced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing awesome,'' said Jim Bond, who trains Behrens.
``He's been up at Saratoga training well, and, hopefully, he's
ready. He's telling me we've done right by him, and he's done
everything right by us. I'm not going to holler at him because he
got beat a whisker in his last race. He's a great horse, and has
overcome everything, including his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behrens has been very consistent all year, and I want to be
the last one left standing in the winner's circle. I would like to
win Horse of the Year with Behrens, but he has to earn it.
</P>
<P>
   ``By winning the Belmont and Travers, Lemon Drop Kid proved that
he is a top 3-year-old, a very nice horse. We can't take him
lightly, but he's going to have to run an A+ race to beat us. He
can't just run an A race, he's got to be A+ to beat an older horse
like Behrens. I think he is the horse to beat in the Gold Cup, but
it's a tough thing for a 3-year-old to beat an older horse at this
level. We'll see if Behrens is up for the task of holding him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behrens just makes you look good. He's always been a good
horse, now he's a great horse. Hopefully, after the Gold Cup and
Breeders' Cup, everybody will be talking the same way about him.''
</P>

PACIFIC IS DEEP IN TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time again for the annual division previews, and this year
we're going to work our way East instead of West. For starters, all
_ and we do mean all _ of the behemoths are in the Western
Conference. Right now, the top eight teams in the West would be
favored to win a series against any team in the East. Is it too
late for the Board of Governors to revamp the playoff system and
get rid of the mandatory Eastern finalist?
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Division houses three legit championship contenders
in the Lakers, Trail Blazers, and Suns. It houses America's Team,
the Sacramento Kings, who this season are must-see TV. It houses
the hapless Clippers, who, to no one's surprise, will remain ever
thus, Chris Ford's wizardry notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are easily the most intriguing, thanks to the arrival
of Phil Jackson, now working for another set of Jerrys (West and
Buss). There's also the quixotic journey of Shaquille O'Neal to win
a meaningful game and the Lakers' internal makeup, which last year
was roughly the same as plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, meanwhile, has added Scottie Pippen to an already
obscene arsenal, losing no starters in a six-for-one transaction
with Houston. The Trail Blazers have what the Lakers don't: a power
forward and a point guard. They also have the best team plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have brought Penny Hardaway west in a true heist (Danny
Manning and Pat Garrity) from the donation-minded Magic and will
put points on the board, maybe even more than they allow. Their
games with Sacramento could actually produce a combined 200 points!
</P>
<P>
   Here's a team-by-team preview of the potent Pacific with teams
listed in predicted order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 35-15, first. Lost to San Antonio in conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith, Detlef
Schrempf, Joe Kleine.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Isaiah Rider, Jim Jackson, Walt Williams,
Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, assorted flotsam.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``And The Money Kept Rolling In (And Out).''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Wow. Wait till Pippen takes his first ride on the
team plane and the flight attendant asks him how he likes his Ruth
Chris steak prepared. The Blazers have mind-boggling depth, talent
everywhere, with the one possible weakness being creaky Arvydas
Sabonis and backup Kleine. Mike Dunleavy can throw out a
Pippen-Brian Grant-Sabonis-Damon Stoudamire-Smith starting five and
still have Rasheed Wallace, Schrempf, Greg Anthony, and Jermaine
O'Neal available. With Pippen, Schrempf, and Sabonis, this has a
chance to be a highlight-film passing team. Wanna get picky? OK,
they could use another shooting guard, but Pippen could play there
in a pinch. The time is clearly now and Portland has loaded up
big-time.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX SUNS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 27-23, tied for third. Lost to Portland in the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Penny Hardaway, Rodney Rogers, Shawn Marion,
Corie Blount, Oliver Miller.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Danny Manning, Pat Garrity, Chris Morris.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``We'll Sing In The Sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: How would you like to be the guy back on defense
when Hardaway and Jason Kidd come down the floor? How do you defend
them in the halfcourt? The Suns could be an offensive colossus,
especially with the new rules. They have scoring up front with
Cliff Robinson, Tom Gugliotta, and the newly signed Rogers to go
along with their powerhouse backcourt. But will they be able to
stop anyone? Last season, opponents shot 45 percent against the
Suns, the sixth-worst defense in the league. Phoenix may get some
help there from the underrated Blount, but the rest of the group is
going to have to step up defensively, even though the Suns have the
capability to win most shootouts. This will be a fun team to watch,
even with Luc Longley in the middle. And rookie Marion should
prosper in their high-r.p.m. tempo.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES LAKERS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 31-19, second. Lost to San Antonio in second
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: A.C. Green, Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Derek Harper, Sean Rooks, J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Dog and Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Well, we're all going to see how much Phil misses
No. 23, aren't we? Actually, the ever-shrewd Jackson walked into
the ideal setting: a talented team with a superstar unable to win
and plenty of talent around him. Sound familiar? ``I've won
everywhere I've been except college, the pros, and the Pacific
Division,'' says Shaq. It's true. This is his fourth year in Los
Angeles and the Lakers still haven't won a division title with him
there, let alone anything else. For that to change, Jackson is
going to have to get these guys to like each other and play
defense, no easy tasks. It also wouldn't hurt Shaq to start
rebounding and try to be civil with Kobe Bryant (and vice versa).
Jackson has enviable offensive might in O'Neal, Bryant, and Glen
Rice, but the team is still too iffy at point guard (Derek Fisher)
and power forward (Green, Robert Horry) and got no decent offseason
help to be given a free ride at this point.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO KINGS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 27-23, tied for third. Lost to Utah in first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Nick Anderson, Tony Delk, Ty Corbin, Bill
Wennington, Darrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Tariq Abdul-Wahad, Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Ye Rambling Boys of Pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: This team was one well-defended pick-and-roll
away from eliminating Utah in the first round last year. It grew up
a lot, picked up fans along the way (including NBC, which didn't
even know where Sacramento was), and now has a chance to build on
this. The Kings added backcourt depth to help Jason Williams and a
couple of veterans, Corbin and Wennington, to help up front and in
the locker room. More important, they added a decent shooting guard
in Anderson, part of the Magic razing. The Kings were the only team
in the NBA to average 100 points last season and barely made that.
They also were one of two teams to allow more than 100 per game, so
we have a little work to do on the defensive end. (Do we sense a
trend here?) The Kings are now on everyone's screen. The days of
the automatic W at Arco Arena are over.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 21-29, sixth. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Mookie Blaylock, Tim Legler.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Bimbo Coles, Duane Ferrell, Tony Delk, Muggsy
Bogues.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Easy People.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Could this be a mirage? Well, maybe. But the
Warriors were actually in the playoff hunt last season until the
final week. The downside? Their most reliable, dependable player
was Terry Cummings, who turns 39 in March. Still, the Warriors
appear to have improved with the addition of the streaky but savvy
Blaylock. Golden State was desperate to get a point guard, and
Mookie was available. He comes and goes on offense, but if he still
has the defensive passion, that's a huge benefit. P.J. Carlesimo
also needs Antawn Jamison to continue his upward path; he came on
strong last year with increased playing time. But the center
position will be a problem now that Erick Dampier is out for a
while. Former No. 1 pick Adonal Foyle has done basically nothing in
two seasons; we expected far more from a Colgate man.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE SUPERSONICS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 25-25, fifth. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Horace Grant, Brent Barry, Chuck Person,
Greg Foster, Ruben Patterson, Lazaro Borrel, Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Olden Polynice, Detlef Schrempf, Hersey
Hawkins, Dale Ellis, Billy Owens, Corey Maggette, Cheri Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Long, Long Time.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Only one player, Gary Payton, remains from the
Seattle team that made it to the Finals in 1996. Schrempf and
Hawkins are the latest vets to go as GM Wally Walker tries to
rebuild and contend at the same time. That's hard to do. He did
re-sign Vin Baker, who is promising to be the Vin Baker of old. If
he is, that will help. If he isn't, we're talking freefall. But
even beyond Payton and Baker, there's not much here here, Cuban
defector Borrell notwithstanding. Grant is going to have to play
center, which, out West, means he'll have to contend with Shaq,
Hakeem, David, Arvydas, and others who know how to play the middle.
He's also about 300 years old and has a lot of miles on the tires.
Patterson could end up starting at small forward for lack of anyone
else, and Barry is the starting shooting guard _ and he can't
shoot! Even Hanson, the upbeat, irrepressible media relations
czarina, bolted for Milwaukee. It all adds up to a depressing year.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 9-41, seventh place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Lamar Odom, Derrick Anderson, Eric Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Lorenzen Wright, Lamond Murray, Rodney Rogers,
Pooh Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Dying In The Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Plus ca change . . . Over the summer, the
Clippers actually did two things that real NBA franchises do: They
signed their own free agent (Eric Piatkowski) and managed to sign
and trade two others (Wright, Murray) just before they left town.
Anderson, who thinks he's better than he really is, is what they
have to show for Murray. A couple of draft picks from Atlanta were
deemed sufficient compensation for Wright. (At least they kept him
from going to the Lakers.) But Rogers still left without
compensation and now their best player, Maurice Taylor, is poised
to do likewise next summer. Until he does, however, Ford can field
a front line of Odom, Taylor, and Michael Olowokandi, which is
passable. The backcourt is, well, Anderson and the point guard du
jour. It could be Murdock. It could be Anderson. It apparently
won't be Sherman Douglas, who manned the position last year. The
one noticeable upgrade is that they won't be playing in that
horrible Sports Arena anymore. They now share the dazzling downtown
Staples Center with the Lakers, which is as close as they'll get to
the real NBA this season.

CONSERVATIVES IN KC TAKE AIM AT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three conservative presidential candidates
speaking Saturday in Kansas City ripped Republican front-runner
George W. Bush as ``Clinton lite,'' a mushy-mouthed, unprincipled
leader destined to lead the GOP to defeat next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes took turns swinging at
Bush and tossing applause-generating rhetoric at a convention of
conservative Republicans known as the National Federation of
Republican Assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was at the Music Hall in Municipal Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, did not attend the gathering. Assembly
officials said they felt snubbed because Bush was in Missouri on
Saturday for a Springfield fund-raiser for U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, yet
did not come to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know quite how we win the White House back for the
Republican Party when on every major issue he's in agreement with
the likely Democratic nominee,'' Bauer, formerly of the Family
Research Council, said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan, Forbes said, comes across ``as someone who is
embarrassed by the basic principles of this party, which can be
summed up in the words `more freedom, less government.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bush did not return telephone calls Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was an obvious target because of comments he made last week
criticizing GOP conservatives. He upbraided the Republican-led
Congress for a plan he said would have balanced the budget on the
backs of the poor. And he scolded the party for what he saw as
pessimism about America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of
America slouching toward Gomorrah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention crowd roared at many of the anti-Bush comments
and appeared eager to hear him taken to task.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, officials at the gathering announced
the results of a straw poll conducted while the candidates spoke to
a crowd estimated at 500. Anyone who paid $25 to attend the
afternoon rally could participate.
</P>
<P>
   The vote showed the lack of enthusiasm for Bush. Forbes won with
380 votes, or 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the field were 172 votes for Buchanan, 149 for
former Ambassador Alan Keyes, 86 for Bauer, 35 for Bush, three each
for Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, and one for former Vice President Dan Quayle, who
recently dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Today the convention will conduct its main order of business,
which is to endorse a GOP candidate for president. Convention rules
require that two-thirds of the delegates agree on a candidate
before an official preference is issued. The straw poll taken
Saturday is not binding.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1996, the assembly is a grass-roots group of GOP
activists who pride themselves on being ``Ronald Reagan
Republicans.'' One catalyst for their formation was 1996 Republican
presidential nominee Bob Dole's disdain for the party platform,
which was decidedly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the group opposes abortion and says the
family is the cornerstone of society and that all human rights are
granted by God, not government.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly claims 8,700 dues-paying members in 43 states.
Among its members are David Miller, the Eudora insurance agent who
was defeated by Bill Graves in the 1998 Republican primary for
Kansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft was the only congressional member from Kansas
or Missouri to show up Saturday, but he said he was not an assembly
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the science of good politics is unity and to work
with people and to try to bring them together,'' Ashcroft said in
an interview. He is in a re-election battle next year with Missouri
Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking Saturday were Kansas Board of Education member
Steve Abrams of Arkansas City, who led the fight to de-emphasize
evolution in state teaching standards, and Gary Aldrich, a former
FBI agent who wrote a book that alleged White House corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Although the event Saturday attracted three major presidential
contenders, as well as the long-shot Keyes, the gathering attracted
little national media attention. Even the candidates downplayed the
significance of today's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to win to keep going,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers said Forbes had poured the most money into
winning the endorsement. He is seeking to establish himself as the
top alternative if Bush stumbles in the early 2000 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who was the first to speak, set the tone by emphasizing
themes that were repeated by the other candidates. In emphasizing
his anti-abortion credentials, Forbes said he would appoint federal
judges who believed the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will choose a running mate who also believes in the sanctity
of life,'' Forbes said to sustained applause.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents should have their pick of schools for their
children and that federal education money should be returned only
to states that offer school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes advocated more money for the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuit of happiness means we have to be safe and secure in
the world,'' he said. ``That means we must stop hollowing out the
military of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes received his biggest applause for his trademark call for
a flat-tax system that would ``drive a stake'' through the heart of
the current tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who may bolt the GOP for the Reform Party, drew
perhaps the loudest ovation of the afternoon when he suggested that
President Clinton was unfit to command the military.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who once worked for Reagan, skipped a morning news
conference and declined to meet with reporters after his 20-minute
speech. But in his address he again hinted that he was close to
leaving the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we're headed right now,'' he said in
closing. ``But I do know that some months from now and some years
from now we'll be fighting for the same cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hear we are engaged on another front, we are in
battle,'' Buchanan said. ``Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
Mount up and ride at the sound of the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer called Bush the pessimist in the race. ``He is running as
a Bush Republican, and I am proudly running as a Reagan
Republican,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes advocated elimination of the income tax with revenue
replaced by sales taxes, tariffs and duties.

EATON'S ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Football players change. They grow. They mature.
They flame out. They fade away.
</P>
<P>
   What they seldom do is reinvent themselves. Madonna has
reinvented herself. Several times. Garth Brooks is trying it now.
Jesse Ventura did it.
</P>
<P>
   But football players? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sage of the Meadowlands, Bill Parcells, has always
maintained, ``You are what you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why what Chad Eaton has done in a two-year span is
amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, you know Chad Eaton. No. 90. Starting defensive tackle
for the Patriots. Outspoken. Wild and crazy. Dyed his hair, put
tattoos on his body the way women put on lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who as a member of the Patriots practice squad was
so out of touch with his team that he came to work Monday morning
not even knowing whether his team had won or lost the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about the doings of Mulder and Scully on ``The
X-Files,'' however, and Eaton could cite you chapter and verse
about what had happened the night before.
</P>
<P>
   But that was another lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went through the emotional trauma of seeing his mother
Nancy lose an eight-month battle to liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Before he and his wife Tina celebrated the birth of their son
David Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was plucked off the Patriots' practice squad in
November 1996 by Parcells and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick
and learned that life in the NFL was more than practicing football
Monday through Friday, with Tuesdays off as well as most of your
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   That Chad Eaton is a distant relation to the one you will see
Sunday afternoon when the 4-0 Patriots face the 2-2 Chiefs at
Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he's still media-friendly, which is how he got his first 15
minutes of fame a couple of years ago. You can hear him on the
radio each week on WEEI's ``Dennis and Callahan.'' Look around the
Patriot locker room during any given media session and Eaton will
be giving a state of Patriot Nation assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it went to his head,'' said his friend and former
college teammate at Washington State, Drew Bledsoe, with a smile
and a laugh when asked to describe the difference in the
6-foot-5-inch, 300-pound Eaton. ``He used to be a a nice guy. Now
he's a media whore.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bledsoe got a little more serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a dominant player in college and it took him a while to
get adjusted in the NFL,'' said Bledsoe. ``He's come on in the last
two years, and I expect him to prove to be a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton doesn't disagree with the assessment or the prediction.
The tattoos are gone, the hair is back to a more natural sandy
blond, and conversations around the locker room with Eaton reveal
what he is: a funny, outgoing professional football player who is
serious about his job, without being overly serious about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about the switch, about the toning down of his outer
self and he shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to switch gears,'' he said. ``What I was doing wasn't
working for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton wasn't sure what he wanted or who he was.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up a small-town kid in Washington and went on to a
small-town atmosphere in Pullman, Wash., the outpost in college
football known as Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even then, he recognized reality when he saw it. Like the
time a bungee cord was set up from the top of a crane just off
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Eaton who chose to dive through the air?
</P>
<P>
   No, it was Bledsoe, the thrill-seeking quarterback, who made the
jump _ a fact unbeknown at the time to Cougars coach Mike Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there with him,'' said Eaton with a laugh. ``I said,
`Oh, no, there goes our season, we're going to be 0-11.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That Eaton was even part of a team amazed him. He grew up with a
noninterest in sports that still exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the grunge scene around Seattle,'' he said. ``I hated
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But a friend mentioned Eaton to his father, who then talked to a
friend who was a football coach at Puyallup High School.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Eaton liked football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the physical part,'' he said. ``I liked being part of
a team. I felt like a warrior. I pictured myself as a knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years of high school football and three more of college
turned him into an NFL prospect, although the first steps were
uneven at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals made him a seventh-round draft choice in 1995, but
he was released in training camp. He was signed by the Jets, cut 13
days later, and signed with the Cleveland Browns. He was on the
practice squad until the final two games of the regular season. He
was not activated for either of those last two games.
</P>
<P>
   He was hurt, angry, and ultimately . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bored,'' he said. ``What I did was practice football.''
</P>
<P>
   After Belichick rejoined Parcells with the Patriots in 1996,
Eaton took his practice squad routine to New England.
</P>
<P>
   But again football was not the first priority. His mother was
dying and Eaton couldn't do a thing about it. Eaton had to refocus.
Football became an escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have football, I would have gone out of my mind,''
said Eaton, who was finally activated by the Patriots in December
1996, playing in each of the last four regular-season games and
three playoff games, including the Super Bowl loss to the Green Bay
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Eaton has emerged as a different player, a different
person. But he's still having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never absorbed it as a business,'' he said. ``I try to
take out the business part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the business has gotten better. Once buried in the depths of
the practice squad, Eaton is now in the middle of a three-year $1.5
million contract. Not the megabucks of the NFL elite, but hardly
chump change.
</P>
<P>
   And while football occupies his days, he has a plan beyond he
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get into broadcasting when this is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His brashness is toned down, though not to the point where he is
as reclusive as some teammates, who regard media interviews with
the same anticipation as root canal work. But he is no longer
someone the media turn to for outlandish statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was irritating,'' said Eaton, when asked about the
perception. ``I felt I needed to prove myself as a football player,
not just someone who was outspoken or wild.''
</P>
<P>
   His persona has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him that well,'' said tackle Bruce Armstrong.
``But sure he's changed from a couple of years ago. The hair and
the tattoos, all of that's gone. But he's got a family now, right?
That changes you. It matures you.''
</P>
<P>
   Support also has come from the coaching staff, particularly head
coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be comfortable as a second-string player,'' Carroll told
him. ``Don't accept that role. You've got a chance to make
something of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a starter, however, has raised the bar of expectation.
Eaton concedes he has not played as well this season as he did a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success I had last year isn't there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows things are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are coming to the line of scrimmage now and pointing me
out,'' he said. ``Now I know I have to do more things. But I feel I
have some kind of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got that. But he's also still changing, still in the
process of reinventing and redefining Chad Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still figuring what works for me,'' he said. ``So far it
seems to have worked, so I'm sticking with that recipe.''

INDIANS ALREADY HAVE ACE IN PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with a night's rest to put Game 1 in perspective, Cleveland
general manager John Hart could hardly contain his excitement. His
speech picked up speed Thursday afternoon as he praised the
previous night's starter, Bartolo Colon. Hart talked about the
impressive development of the 24-year-old staff ace over the last
two seasons. He carried on about Colon's competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the man-in-charge described the righthander's
performance as dominant. ``We've been on the other end,'' said
Hart. ``We've been 0 for 8 in first games of the postseasons that
we've been in, too. I think the best thing that we took out of last
night was the fact that we were able to take a young man that we'd
been grooming to be a guy that could go out in a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   That big game is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Red Sox' 9-3 win Saturday, Colon will come back on
three days' rest and start Game 4 at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the first time I'm pitching with three days
rest. My arm feels good. I'm going to try to do everything,'' Colon
said through the Indians interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have the same approach and try and throw the kind
of game I always pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland GM said there's never been a question about
Colon's makeup as a stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power arm. Great kid. Hard worker. He's emerging as that
guy,'' Hart said Thursday. ``To actually see him go out in a big
game with a tough matchup and pitch the way he did, that's good for
this franchise and it bodes well for years to come. We've got a
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With Colon's commanding performance and the injury to Boston ace
Pedro Martinez both occurring in Game 1, the teams switched places.
Suddenly, the Indians knew the pleasure of having a dominant
pitcher win a series opener.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Cleveland's 3-2 win Wednesday, the dominance of
Colon and his 100-mile-per-hour fastball seemed almost too good to
believe for the Indians. The boost of confidence and burst of
momentum he provided his mates was immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bartolo has always pitched great against Pedro, but we
haven't always given him a lot of run support,'' said Cleveland
second baseman Roberto Alomar. ``We have to realize that Bartolo is
younger and he's still learning. I think Bartolo did a great job.
It's always nice to win the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngster's education may not be finished, but the Indians'
search for a pitcher capable of controlling the outcome of key
games appears to have ended. While the injury to Martinez took some
of the attention away from the 11-strikeout effort of his Dominican
countryman, nothing was lost on the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Bartolo's point of view, I think he woke up  &UR; today &LR;  and
felt he pitched a pretty good game,'' Jim Thome said Thursday. ``He
didn't necessarily beat Pedro, but he beat the Red Sox. That was
huge for us. It seems like when Bartolo faces Pedro, he brings his
game to another level.''

CELTICS SAY PICKS ARE NO IMPEDIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ The regionalized cover of Street &AMP; Smith's Pro
Basketball Yearbook has a picture of the captain of the Boston
Celtics with the headline: `Walking Tall: Antoine Walker Leads The
Resurgent Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn to Page 62 and you'll find out just how ``resurgent'' the
Celtics are projected to be: They are picked dead last in the
Atlantic Division, even behind Orlando, which may be the
fourth-best team in Florida this season after the Miami Heat,
University of Miami, and University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Other preseason previews are surfacing, each with similar
expectations for Rick Pitino's team. Athlon Sports picks them to
finish fifth in the Atlantic, ahead of Washington and Orlando.
ESPN.com's initial power poll has the Celtics 21st, 11th in the
East and ahead of Orlando, Washington, Detroit, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting the Celtics to do much of anything, except,
of course, the coach and the players. Pitino has predicted they
will make the playoffs, and they believe there's no reason they
can't. They pay no heed to the predictions, pointing to the
wide-open East (Orlando and Chicago already have packed it in) and
to a lot of teams already in injury/personnel trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Dismiss them at your own peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our attitude that's refreshing. No one expects a lot, but
we expect a lot,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics believe there are some built-in advantages as they
attempt to crack the top eight. In no particular order, they are:
</P>
<P>
   --The schedule: The team plays 12 of its first 18 and 15 of its
first 25 at the FleetCenter. Two years ago, the Celtics turned home
court into an advantage. Last year, it was the opposite. Pitino
wants that first-year feeling again, and Kenny Anderson believes
the season could be made in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how you come out of the gate, that first
month,'' said Anderson. ``You establish what you're about, your
team, your character. If we win, teams will come to the FleetCenter
saying, `We got a game.' If we're losing, they'll come in
nonchalant.''
</P>
<P>
   --The rule changes: On the surface, they appear to favor the
style of play that the Celtics like. Last year's division
champions, Indiana and Miami, preferred a slow-down style that may
not work this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting,'' Anderson said. ``Who's
smarter? Who's going to adapt to the new rules? It won't be a
cakewalk for New York, Miami, or Indiana. All those slow-poke teams
that want to set it up, there's no room for that. This is a new
year. We all start with a clean slate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't begin to tell you who would be a favorite in this
division,'' he said. ``I'm sure people will pick Miami, because of
their veterans, but outside of that . . . with the problems New
York is having right now, I don't think you could pick them.''
</P>
<P>
   --The muddled Eastern Conference: Thirteen of the 15 teams have
legitimate playoff aspirations. Try getting a consensus on the
eight qualifiers. New York and New Jersey have centers with
injuries. Detroit has a center on the verge of retirement. Atlanta
has a new backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wide-open race,'' Anderson said. ``Everyone in the East
is right there. It depends on who's in shape, who plays a team
concept. We're going to be all right, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pitino, ``The competition is going to be ready because
everyone is so close. With our division the way it is, you can't
sneak up on anybody. We're all so close that the days of the 60-win
season in our division are over.''

QUINN, JOHNSON PUSH TO MAKE SWEET 15 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been opportunities to make things easier on
themselves, but then again, they are so accustomed to the toughest
of roads that nothing fazes them anymore. Both Kevin Johnson and
Fran Quinn have learned to grind away in the gut-wrenching
occupation of touring golf professional, and the fact that the
calendar has turned to October means they are running out of
chances.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, they don't need many chances. They need one
more tournament, which conveniently enough is all that remains to
the 1999 Nike Tour schedule. The Tour Championship will be held in
two weeks, after which the top 15 players on the money list
automatically receive PGA Tour cards for 2000. Johnson currently
ranks 12th, with $114,167. Quinn is 16th, with $101,498.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity to strengthen their positions was wasted this
weekend as both Johnson (78-67) and Quinn (77-70) missed the cut in
New Mexico. When the money list is updated Sunday, both could slip
down, but it won't change the focus of the moment, which is to play
well at the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about the
situation,'' said Quinn, the former Mass. Open champion from
Northborough, ``but it comes down to this: If you play well, it
will take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Quinn, Johnson has a victory on the Nike Tour this season.
Like Quinn, what he really wants is that PGA Tour card, something
that has eluded him since he turned pro nine years ago. The
32-year-old from Pembroke would like nothing more than to dance
around that most brutal of all challenges _ Qualifying School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to panic,'' said Johnson, who was as high as
fifth on the money list in April, after his victory at the South
Carolina Classic, which was followed by four top 10s in the next 10
events. But since August, Johnson has missed four cuts and been
outside the top 20 in six other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been playing that good,'' he said. ``Actually, I
haven't been playing that badly, I'm just not scoring. I had it
going real well (at the Oregon Classic late in September) and was
just a few shots off the lead through three rounds. But I played
badly on the last nine, made two doubles, and fell from second or
third to 21st.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a tumble is crucial on the Nike Tour, since the fall-off in
pay is substantial. But looking at the money list and trying to
figure out what you need to do can drive you crazy, said Quinn. You
start to pay attention not only to your game, but to what those
behind you on the money list are doing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not playing well, those are the breaks,'' said
Quinn, who has slumped since his victory in early August, missing
six cuts and finishing in the top 10 just once. He's at the end of
a 13-week stretch in which he has played 12 times. Though his wife,
Lori, and 14-month-old son, Owen, travel with him, the life is
tough, and this off week couldn't come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll work with Shawn Hester (an assistant pro at Charles River
CC and one of Quinn's closest friends), do a little bit of
maintenance, and take a break,'' he said. ``I am tired, but I keep
reminding myself that I'll have a lot of time off until January.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 50 players in the field for a $400,000 purse, the Nike
Tour Championship affords plenty of chance for players from outside
the top 15 to jump up. It also gives those inside the magic number
the opportunity to secure their status. So both Johnson and Quinn
have plenty riding on the event.
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnson appears to be losing ground, he refuses to treat
this year as a negative. After all, he wasn't fully exempt at the
start of the season and had to do some Monday qualifiers just to
get into a few events. It led to a third-place finish at the second
event of the season, then his victory six weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm close, and if anyone had told me at the beginning of the
year that I would be in this position, I would have taken it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Happier days
</P>
<P>
   Competitive golf returned to a more civil environment _ thank
goodness _ with the Dunhill Cup, which concludes Sunday at St.
Andrews. The competition features golfers playing for their
countries (16 three-man teams), but without the flag-waving and
histrionics. The first day, for instance, saw Craig Parry bail out
Australia, which was in danger of getting stunned by Japan. Down by
two shots to the unheralded Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, who was safely on in
regulation at the par-4 closing hole, Parry needed a birdie to
perhaps force a playoff. From about 45 yards, Parry did even
better: He chipped through the Valley of Sin and ran his shot up
the slope and into the hole for an eagle to earn a victory and give
Australia a 2-1 win. Parry deserved to celebrate, though his
reaction was far more sporting. He shook Yoneyama's hand and said,
``I'm sorry.'' . . . In Spain's opening victory over France, there
unfolded a scenario that had to be a nightmare revisited for
European followers. Ahead by two shots playing the 17th, Jose Maria
Olazabal made a triple-bogey in his match with Jean Van de Velde.
(Collapse? 17th-hole drama? Sound familiar?) As he did at
Brookline, however, Olazabal made birdie at the 18th; but unlike
The Country Club, where he had blown a 4-up lead on Justin Leonard,
that closing birdie got him into a playoff and the two-time Masters
champion converted a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 1 to edge the
Frenchman . . . Speaking of Van de Velde, he earned a flock of
admirers for the way he handled himself after the British Open at
Carnoustie, and he's sure to win over even more after he spoke out
against European Ryder Cup captain Mark James. Said Van de Velde,
who qualified for the team but played in only one match: ``Everyone
has been focusing on the Americans' bad behavior, but to me the
result had nothing to do with that. We lost because we asked too
much of most of the guys and because we didn't put enough trust in
three.'' . . . The American contingent at the Dunhill Cup _ Mark
O'Meara, Tom Lehman, and Payne Stewart _ had police escorts on
course, for fear they would be targeted by hecklers in the wake of
the Ryder Cup. But there were no incidents, and the police had to
concern themselves only with watching great golf. No surprise to
those who understand Scottish golf fans . . . It wasn't the best of
weeks for Lehman. The airline lost his luggage on the trip over,
then he missed the opening ceremonies because he overslept. On
Friday, Lehman was shocked by Emanuele Canonica, as Italy upset the
United States, and to make matters worse, the American had to be
asked back to the 18th green to tap in for his par. Apparently
thinking the match was over when Canonica tapped in for his par,
Lehman had left the green, forgetting that in medal match play,
nothing can be conceded. Though it was a moot point, Lehman was
penalized one shot for the slip-up . . . Quick, which of the
following names does not fit? O'Meara, Olazabal, Colin Montgomerie,
Ernie Els, Nick Price, Sergio Garcia, Carlos Franco, Craig Parry,
Paul Lawrie, Retief Goosen, Padraig Harrington, and Notah Begay.
Obviously, it is a cast of world-class golfers, most of whom have
proven themselves for years, and others (Garcia, Lawrie,
Harrington) who have only recently stepped upon the international
stage with noteworthy play. Then there is Begay. Why? Sure, he won
a PGA Tour event this year, the Reno-Tahoe Open, and has a solid
money-list ranking (59th), but the key to his inclusion is the fact
he is in the IMG stable. Guess who runs the World Match Play?
That's right, IMG. It's a shameless move to include Begay in the
field, particularly at the expense of, say, Darren Clarke. When Lee
Westwood asked out of the event, it would have been a natural move
to replace him with Clarke, but instead Begay got picked . . .
Things must be interesting with the ABC golf team in the aftermath
of Peter Alliss's stinging criticism of certain Americans and his
TV colleague, Curtis Strange. Regarding the Ryder Cup controversy,
Alliss was quoted in the London Telegraph as saying Americans are
``bad winners; their exuberance seems to be less gracious than our
exuberance and I have no idea why.'' When the Ryder Cup resumes at
the Belfry in 2001, the American captain, it has been rumored,
could be Strange. ``(He's) a Jekyll and Hyde,'' Alliss is quoted as
saying. ``I know him very well. We've worked together on ABC and
he's a real redneck at times; very stubborn and vitriolic when the
mood takes him.'' All this from an event that was intended to
foster goodwill and spirited competition.
</P>
<P>
   Out by a neck
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bates, who grew up in Manchester, learned to play golf at
Essex County Club, and went on to win the Mass. Open, is recovering
from surgery to repair a ruptured disk in his neck and just
recently started hitting balls again. His Nike Tour season lasted
just five events before he injured his neck in the simplest of
fashions _ giving his 1 1/2-year-old son a ride. ``He was on my
shoulders and I bent over fast,'' said Bates. ``It was a serious
blowout.'' The surgery went fine, said Bates, but things were rough
right afterward. He will not even attempt to go to Qualifying
School; instead, he will accept a full medical exemption and play
the Nike Tour again in 2000. There were bright notes to being on
the disabled list, said Bates, noting that he and wife Kristine
(daughter of Doug Tewell) welcomed daughter Kendall to the family
six months ago. There has been plenty of time to spend with the new
baby and older brother Spencer . . . You may have missed this
morsel from the Senior PGA Tour's stop in Clemmons, N.C., a week
ago. Fred Gibson, a 52-year-old former club pro who had but six top
10 finishes in 63 events, became the 11th first-time winner on the
Tour this year. A surprise? You could say that, given the fact that
Gibson earned a mere $704 in his PGA Tour career, that from a low
finish at the 1980 Kemper Open . . . Surely you can relate to Cindy
McCurdy. In the final round of the New Albany (Ohio) Classic last
Sunday, the LPGA Tour veteran took a 14 _ that's fourteen _ on the
par-5 13th by hitting four balls into the lake fronting the green.
Her back-side 50, in a round of 85, left her last among those who
made the cut. She had started the tournament 70-71 before a weekend
of 77-85.

RED SOX HOLD OFF INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Already down two games to the Cleveland Indians and winter one
loss away, the Red Sox Saturday spotted the Tribe their last
healthy superstar, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who sat out because
of his sore right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Wait till next millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. With Garciaparra's stand-in, Lou Merloni, jump-starting
two rallies and John Valentin alternating between committing
another ghastly error and delivering big hits (tie-breaking home
run in the sixth inning, tie-breaking two-run double in the
seventh), the Sox extended summer for at least another day with a
9-3 swatting of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brian Daubach, who had promised there was still a little
magic left in the Belleville Basher, followed Valentin's
bases-loaded double with a three-run home run to make the seventh a
five-run inning, Boston's biggest in the postseason since scoring
six for Luis Tiant against the Big Red Machine in Game 1 of the
1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who trail the best-of-five-game series, 2-1, will send
Kent Mercker to the mound against Indians ace Bartolo Colon in Game
4 in Fenway Park. If the Yankees beat Texas Saturday night to close
out their Division Series, the Sox game will be played at 8 p.m. If
the Rangers are still alive, the Sox and Indians will play at 1.
</P>
<P>
   A scenario unfolded at Fenway Saturday that was all too familiar
to Sox fans: A starting pitcher, spinning a shutout, is forced to
leave after four innings because of an injury. But unlike Game 1,
when the victim was Boston ace Pedro Martinez, this time it was
Indians righthander Dave Burba, who set down the first nine Sox
batters, allowed only a bloop single by Butch Huskey in the fourth,
but departed after the inning with a 1-0 lead because of what was
announced as tightness in the underside of his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   A Fenway Park gathering that already was taking a more animated
interest in this game than do the usual postseason assemblages of
pampered and privileged ticket-holders let out a bloodthirsty roar
at the sight of the new Indians pitcher: Jaret Wright, the
23-year-old with a hothead's mien and villain's reputation because
of a beanball-induced brawl in April.
</P>
<P>
   With a singsong ``Jaaa-rrrettt'' resonating through the stands,
Wright gave the revenge-seekers the satisfaction they were seeking
by allowing the Red Sox to seize a 2-1 lead in his first inning of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni got things going by punching a ground ball through the
right side for a one-out single. Catcher Jason Varitek, hitless in
his first nine at-bats in the series and playing with a bad right
hand about which he has said nothing, lined a double off the
Monster, Merloni stopping at third.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis, another member of the wounded wrist club, fought
back from an 0-and-2 count to 3-and-2, then lifted a soft line
drive just over the head of second baseman Robbie Alomar, scoring
Merloni with the tying run. Rookie Trot Nixon followed with a fly
to right field deep enough to score Varitek with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 23 innings that the Sox had scored more
than a run.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, as calm as Pedro the Younger is passionate, had
given up a run in the top of the fourth on singles by Jim Thome and
Harold Baines and a sacrifice fly by David Justice. He left to a
standing ovation in the sixth that would have been sweeter had he
been able to hold onto the lead. But the Indians first pushed
across the tying run on a double by Alomar, an infield out, a walk,
and a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who struck out six and allowed just five hits while
throwing 96 pitches, was saluted as much for his gallantry and
grace as he was for his excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The game then turned into a question of who would prevail:
Johnny Val the slugger or his evil twin, Johnny Val the slinger.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who was hitless in his first 10 postseason at-bats but
had driven center fielder Kenny Lofton to the track in the fourth,
came up in the sixth and launched one that even Lofton couldn't
retrieve, a 409-foot home run into the triangle to give the Sox a
3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Indians' next at-bat, in an uncanny imitation of his
disastrous misplay in Game 1 _ same Sox pitcher on the mound (Derek
Lowe), same Indians batter (Manny Ramirez) _ Valentin bounced
another throw to first in the dirt, allowing Lofton to score the
tying run. Lofton had singled, taken second on an infield out, and
stolen third without drawing a throw. After a walk to Alomar, he
scored on the error by Valentin, who fielded a Ramirez grounder and
inexplicably threw on the run when he had enough time to have taken
a seat on a Jordan's sofa.
</P>
<P>
   But this was clearly a night when Wright's stuff was wrong for
the Indians. He walked Merloni to open the Sox seventh and hit
Varitek in the arm with his next pitch. Indians manager Mike
Hargrove then went to lefthander Ricardo Rincon, who induced Darren
Lewis to bunt into a force play, then struck out Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Out of danger? Hardly. Jose Offerman drew a walk, loading the
bases for Valentin, who scorched a liner just inside the third-base
line. The ball was headed for the corner before being touched by a
fan, but two runs scored on the ground-rule double. Then Daubach,
one pitch after clocking plate umpire Tim Welke in the head with
his backswing, cleared the bases with a blast over the camera well
in center.
</P>
<P>
   The Belleville Basher, benched for the second straight start,
had entered the game in the sixth as a pinch hitter for DH Butch
Huskey and had whiffed for the fourth straight time in this series.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Mike Stanley, a single by Troy O'Leary, and another
hit by Merloni made it 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were alive to play another day.

GORE QUESTIONS BRADLEY'S PARTY LOYALTY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Vice President Al Gore drew his sharpest contrasts
yet with former Sen. Bill Bradley Saturday, casting his rival for
the Democratic presidential nomination as one who went along with
the Reagan budget cuts and fled Washington after Newt Gingrich and
the Republicans took over the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley cast Gore as a captive of the
establishment and the entrenched powers of the party and the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates were campaigning here Saturday and both spoke
Saturday night before 3,000 people at a state Democratic Party
dinner. In Iowa, which will hold the campaign's first caucus, now
scheduled Jan. 31., Gore is ahead in polls. But Rob Tully, the
chairman of the Iowa Democratic party, said the race was fluid and
very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, during a campaign walk through neighborhood
streets, Gore portrayed Bradley as a disloyal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 budget vote, Gore said, was ``the single most defining
vote for the Democrats in the last 20 years,'' and the
determination to counter Gingrich was second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us was called upon to fight against it with everything
we had or not, and he did not,'' Gore said of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his attempt to pressure Bradley into engaging him,
the vice president also said he wanted to debate Bradley once a
week, up from his earlier call for debates once every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates so far plan another joint appearance at a
town-hall meeting in New Hampshire on Oct. 27, and a debate on Jan.
8 in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sidestepped mentioning Bradley by name Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's intention all day was clear _ to appeal to the core
of loyal Democrats who will vote in caucuses and primaries and to
raise doubts about Bradley's perseverance and reliability in the
face of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic base is a crucial segment that Gore needs to nail
down as Bradley's support swells, particularly among independents.
</P>
<P>
   To try to interest that base in his campaign, Gore has taken to
telling his audiences, as he did Saturday, that the next president
could appoint three or four new justices to the Supreme Court and
that if a Republican is president, any new justices would be vetted
by religious conservatives like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and
Ralph Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore portrayed himself as an unswerving Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't walk away from the fight when Newt Gingrich took over
the Congress,'' Gore said. ``I didn't walk away from the fight when
Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I didn't walk away
from the fight when farmers needed farm credit, when farmers needed
loan deficiency payments and conservation programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not directly respond to Gore's comments, but he
portrayed Gore as the establishment candidate and a captive of vice
presidential trappings, which he has been trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we are up against an entrenched
power.'' Bradley said. ``When a candidate has the president of the
United States standing by his side, loyally, as he has stood by his
side, and he has the Democratic National Committee, most of the
large Democratic fund-raisers, arrives in Air Force II, and is
ahead by 15 points nationally, well, that's entrenched power. All I
have is the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not run for re-election to a fourth term in the
Senate in 1996. He did vote for the Reagan budget cuts but he
simultaneously supported tax cuts, saying that if that combination
of proposals had passed, the nation could have avoided the ensuing
budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was already vice president when Gingrich became speaker of
the House in 1995 and had little choice but to stay as he and
Clinton headed into a re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the Reagan budget had raised child poverty, hurt
public education and limited access to health care. ``I voted
against it,'' said Gore, who served in the Senate with Bradley. ``I
fought against it. Some felt that in order to survive politically,
they should vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Bradley's loyalty to the party come as Gore is
trying to energize his campaign and show that he is ready and able
to fight for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore remains somewhat cautious. In a kind of minuet with the
media, he hesitated to criticize Bradley until he was egged on by
reporters. But his campaign also uncharacteristically gave
reporters the opportunity to do so, staging a rare ``media
availability'' with Gore a few hours before Saturday night's joint
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The timing virtually guaranteed that the main topic would be
Bradley. Conducted on a leafy suburban street here, where Gore was
backed by a throng of cheering children, the session with reporters
lasted only a few minutes, and Gore largely joshed his way through
it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind of Democrat would vote for the Reagan budget and
leave the Congress after Gingrich took over, Gore initially said,
``I see some hungry quotation marks eager to be filled with a
pungent quotation.'' He then added, ``I don't know. Maybe the kind
that would announce he was considering running as an independent
against President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley never made such an announcement. In November 1995, he
said he had ``not ruled out'' an independent candidacy although he
said he was not laying the groundwork for a ``formal third-party
challenge to the two-party system.''

JETS MAY CLIMB OUT OF TAILSPIN YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of you who thought Rick Mirer was a stiff, well, you
may not be right about that one. Mirer is beginning to ``get it,''
in the words of Bill Parcells, and the Jets coach is beginning to
think he can pull a rabbit out of a hat and make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep advising everyone not to make too many evaluations
until about the 10th week, because then the pressure is on and the
schedule is pretty clear for everyone,'' said Parcells. ``To be
judgmental at this point, you know, one thing happens to the wrong
team, and all of a sudden the whole thing has changed. If we could
just play well this month . . . then starting the second half you
might have a chance to get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is on the money. He realizes that at some point New
England, Buffalo, and Miami all will have their little problems to
contend with. He's already had his. What he has to do is get Mirer
to be consistent, get Wayne Chrebet back on the field (maybe as
early as next Monday night), and move on through the season with a
different group of players than the ones he started with. This week
he placed linebacker Chad Cascadden and cornerback Otis Smith on
the injured reserve list, joining Vinny Testaverde and Leon
Johnson. He did that for a reason, not wanting to linger with
players who may not be in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when he made the moves, he got a call from Marty
Schottenheimer, the former Chiefs coach who is now an ESPN
commentator, who told Parcells that he understood completely what
he was doing and how Parcells was going to approach the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has in no way, shape, or form given up on the season.
He seems to sense that he can pull this off.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two games, Parcells has taken over the play-calling
duties from offensive coordinator Charlie Weis. He wanted to create
a new balance on offense between the run and the pass. After all,
he doesn't want Mirer throwing as much as Drew Bledsoe used to and
as much as Testaverde threw it last year in New York. He wants his
offensive line to control the line of scrimmage and he wants Curtis
Martin to finally step up and be a star.
</P>
<P>
   With a play schedule in hand on the sidelines, Parcells has run
66 run plays and 59 pass plays the past two games. In the first two
games, the Jets ran it 42 times and threw it 64 times. Monday
night, Parcells will be up against his old friend Tom Coughlin, who
coincidentally took over the Jaguars' play-calling this year
because he lost Chris Palmer to the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has always liked Mirer (there's no need to revisit the
Mirer-Bledsoe story of 1993), and he acquired Mirer believing he
could flourish if something happened to Testaverde. A few weeks ago
in this space, Mirer's former offensive coordinator at Seattle,
Larry Kennan, said Mirer eventually would win the admiration of
Parcells and his teammates because ``he's a born leader and a guy
who can throw the ball down the field more effectively than he's
shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre echoed that feeling about Mirer last week, saying,
``I think he has the potential to be a great quarterback. That's
why he was drafted early. I don't think that was a mistake. As you
can tell, no one has been able to turn Seattle around in the last
10-15 years, so it wasn't Rick's fault out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said, ``I'm trying to learn about the player. I saw
improvement in his downfield throws from the second to the fourth
game, a change in his demeanor. It's a very difficult thing to
know. It took me half the season to know Vinny Testaverde.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is feeling more comfortable with the Jets' scheme and is
starting to understand what Parcells wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to teach the team how I think we have to play to be
successful so that everybody gains an understanding of that,'' said
Parcells. ``I'm putting more emphasis on how I think this team has
to behave to play to be successful _ under the current
circumstances we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is again doing a masterful job in motivating certain
players. He's not using the ``she'' tactics as he did to Terry
Glenn and Vincent Brisby at one time, but he has expressed
dissatisfaction with 32-year-old free agent tight end Eric Green.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells signed Green to a four-year, $7.5 million deal last
winter after Kyle Brady went to Jacksonville as a restricted free
agent. But he has been a dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he'd be the player we were competing against the
past couple of years, but it hasn't gone the way I expected,'' said
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Green has had a pinched nerve, but Parcells is obviously trying
to tell him, in his own unique way: Get with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells will have Jason Ferguson back at nose tackle this week,
Chrebet soon should give Mirer another target, and Keyshawn Johnson
is buying into Parcells's thinking hook, line, and sinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no clear-cut team out there,'' said Johnson. ``We're
right in the middle of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Green in Brown's future
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brown has a great outlook on his NFL career: ``You have to
play harder than the next guy. This is your paycheck. You have a
family to feed. I'll get motivated to feed my son.'' Brown won't
have to worry about food next year, when he becomes a free agent .
. . On the subject of money, the Patriots certainly have the
prerogative to make Lawyer Milloy a franchise player and pay him
the average salary of the top five safeties in the league, which
would be in the $2.5 million range. But if the Patriots want to
avoid the first ``franchise'' tag in their history, they'll
probably have to meet Milloy's asking price of $4.5 million-$5
million . . . To gear up for the free agent season, Shawn Jefferson
has fired his agent, Phil Williams, and signed on with Gary
Uberstine, who also represents Chad Eaton, Steve Israel, Willie
McGinest, and Pete Carroll . . . By the way, if the Patriots
continue to succeed, will Bob Kraft tear up Carroll's contract and
give him a new one, much like the 49ers did with Steve Mariucci
last year? If Carroll wins the division and gets into the playoffs,
he would be underpaid at $1 million . . . Could you imagine the
town of Foxborough letting the Patriots leave town over an access
road? . . . There'll be more money coming to the Patriots in the
form of a $23.3 million slice of the Houston expansion
franchise-fee pie. The Patriots got a similar slice when Cleveland
came into the league. The only team not getting a piece was the St.
Louis Rams, who forfeited their share as part of the relocation
deal from Los Angeles. It's still amazing that LA doesn't have a
stake in the nation's most popular sport . . . Old friend Lovett
Purnell got a tryout with the Jets last week, but Parcells didn't
bite . . . The NFL will realign in 2002 into eight divisions of
four teams each. Which AFC team will have to switch to the NFC when
Houston enters the AFC? The consensus seems to be Seattle, but you
can expect a few battles before anything is etched in stone.
Currently, the popular alignment would look like this: AFC East _
Patriots, Jets, Dolphins, Bills; AFC Central _ Steelers, Bengals,
Browns, Ravens; AFC West _ Chargers, Broncos, Chiefs, Raiders; AFC
South _ Houston, Jaguars, Titans, Colts; NFC East _ Giants,
Redskins, Cowboys, Eagles; NFC Central _ Vikings, Packers, Lions,
Bears; NFC West _ 49ers, Rams, Seahawks, Cardinals; NFC South _
Buccaneers, Falcons, Saints, Panthers . . . This reporter wrote
before the season that going with Brian Griese over Bubby Brister
at quarterback might disrupt the chemistry of the Broncos. How did
Mike Shanahan not see this coming? Now Brister is back as the
starter with the Broncos 0-4 and with Terrell Davis out for the
season . . . Brady keeps a picture of Parcells in his locker in
Jacksonville. The Tuna wasn't one of his personal favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Giant opportunity for Collins
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Collins finally will get the chance to prove why he's the
Giants' best bet as a starter. He is a pure passer, something the
Giants haven't had since Phil Simms. Coach Jim Fassel is looking
for something to jump-start a very stagnant offense . . . Steve
Young will miss Sunday's game with post-concussion syndrome, and
Buffalo's Rob Johnson hasn't been activated the past two weeks
after suffering headaches following a concussion he suffered
against Philadelphia. Johnson sees limited playing time as Doug
Flutie's backup but has had concussions the past two seasons, which
is not a good sign . . . Eagles coach Andy Reid will start Doug
Pederson at quarterback over Donovan McNabb Sunday vs. Dallas
because McNabb is still not picking up blitzes as he should. Reid,
a former quarterbacks coach with Green Bay, believes McNabb needs
to look at blitzes from the sideline to see how they develop and
how he can deal with them. Palmer made a similar comment about Tim
Couch, that his young quarterback might have to watch from the
sideline at some point . . . When a Kansas City reporter told
Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, ``Thanks a million,'' for his returning
his call on the Houston expansion story, Hunt retorted, ``No,
thanks to $700 million.'' . . . The Patriots were one of the teams
who considered bringing Errict Rhett into the fold last winter. He
is now a bargain in Baltimore after re-signing for the $400,000
veteran minimum, with incentives. He's overtaken Priest Holmes as
the Ravens' No. 1 back and has three consecutive 100-yard games . .
. Nothing new in Washington. The Redskins' defense is among the
worst in the league, so Norv Turner is trying to tinker with it.
Two years ago, he made current Patriots secondary coach Ron Lynn
the scapegoat by firing him as defensive coordinator. Now he's
bringing in 72-year-old Bill Arnsparger to assist defensive
coordinator Mike Nolan, who worked for Arnsparger at Louisiana
State. The Redskins are 3-1 but have allowed 29.5 points per game .
. . Bengals No. 1 pick Akili Smith will face the Browns' killer
``UFO'' defense in his first NFL start. The Browns sacked Bledsoe
four times last week, and they should do even better against a
worse offensive line and a rookie quarterback. The Browns basically
put all seven linemen and linebackers up, and when the ball is
snapped, some rush the QB and some drop back. Smith, incidentally,
believes that Palmer wanted to draft him over Couch as the No. 1
pick but was overruled by the Browns' upper management . . .
Whether it was psychology or not, Jimmy Johnson's harsh critique of
Dan Marino after last Monday's loss was unnecessary. There was no
respect shown to Marino, who doesn't deserve to be dressed down in
the media. Marino showed his class by not lashing back, as a lesser
man would have done . . . Favre, on facing the Bucs' Warren Sapp:
``I shouldn't say I'm looking forward to playing him. You know,
he's a hell of a player, but God, I get tired of him hitting me and
telling me about it.''

AUSSIES GET JUMP ON THEIR CHOICE EVENTS

   What events are already sold out in Sydney? Anything the host
Aussies are likely to win gold medals in: swimming (at a $455 top),
rowing, cycling, field hockey. As usual, tickets for the opening
ceremonies (at a $1,382 top), track and field finals, and
basketball medal rounds are already oversubscribed. The Australian
public gets to buy more than half of the 9.6 million tickets. The
rest will be sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed response
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
says he'd be delighted to be grilled by a bunch of Yankee
congressmen _ anytime after Dec. 12. That's when the Lords of the
Rings are expected to approve the laundry list of reforms coming
out of the Salt Lake bidding scandal. ``I'm ready to go, but only
in the right moment,'' says Samaranch. ``I have to walk into the
House with the changes in my pocket.'' Those changes, which range
from the makeup of the membership (likely to include 15 active or
recent athletes) to age limits to host city selection, will be
rubber-stamped by the IOC 2000 commission at month's end, then
forwarded to the full IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the IOC to switch its scheduled February executive
board meeting from Salt Lake City/Colorado Springs to an
un-American site. The reason: The Lords don't want to be questioned
by FBI agents about what they did or didn't know about ski trips
and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC has turned over to its ethics commission the
recent Atlanta report on its bidders' lavish gift-giving, odds are
that no members' heads will roll. The quid pro quo element that
marked Salt Lake's largesse is weaker (or subtler) in Atlanta's
case and many of the members involved have already been booted out.
</P>
<P>
   NHL making plans
</P>
<P>
   It's all but certain that the NHL will be back for the 2002
Winter Games in Salt Lake. The league and players have agreed on a
12-day shutdown and a 10-day Olympic tournament and resumption of
the World Cup in 2004. Formal deal should be struck by year's end .
. . Back on the Grand Prix skating circuit after a year's absence
is UCLA freshman Michelle Kwan, who'll be competing in both Skate
America and Skate Canada. Kwan, who's living in the dorms with a
randomly assigned roommate, has scheduled her classes from Monday
through Thursday so she can juggle both school and sport. And since
next year's world championships were pushed back a week when they
were moved from Brisbane to Nice, Kwan will be done with exams when
she goes overseas. The field for Skate America (in Colorado Springs
at month's end) includes Kwan, Sarah Hughes, and Russia's Yulia
Soldatova on the women's side, and Michael Weiss, Tim Goebel,
Russia's Alexei Yagudin, and Canada's Elvis Stojko on the men's . .
. Heavy medals in the field for the 30th ``Evening With Champions''
skating benefit Friday and Saturday at Harvard's Bright Center.
Besides 1992 Olympic runner-up (and newlywed) Paul Wylie, the
roster includes Russian world medalists Irina Slutskaya and
Soldatova plus former world pro dance champions Maia Usova-Evgeny
Platov, US titlists Danielle and Steve Hartsell (pairs) and Naomi
Lang-Peter Tchernyshev (dance), and 14-year-old wunderkind Naomi
Nari Nam. Call 617-493-8172 for ticket details . . . Bad luck
continues to dog US pair Laura Handy and Paul Binnebose. First,
they had to withdraw from their debut worlds with illness last
season. This month, Binnebose fell during a practice lift and
fractured his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Making do
</P>
<P>
   Modest expectations for the US gymnasts at this week's world
artistic championships in China, which is hosting for the first
time. None of the ``Magnificent Seven'' from Atlanta are competing
on the women's side; Dominique Moceanu is recovering from knee
surgery and Amy Chow didn't make the team. Vanessa Atler and
Kristen Maloney are the best medal hopes for the Americans, who
finished sixth last time and haven't had an individual make the
podium since Shannon Miller won in 1993. Blaine Wilson and the
eternal John Roethlisberger lead the men's team, which hasn't
produced a medal since 1979. The Romanian women and Chinese men,
who've won the last three global titles, are odds-on to repeat. The
Russians won the team and individual crowns at the recent rhythmic
world championships in Japan. Jessica Howard (32d) was the top US
finisher . . . No medals for the US at the recent world greco-roman
wrestling championships in Athens, but the Americans did qualify
for Olympic slots in two classes _ 213.75 pounds (Jason Klohs) and
286 pounds (Dremiel Byers, who beat Olympic runner-up Matt Ghaffari
to make the team) and just missed at 187.25 (Quincey Clark). As
expected, the Russians won the team title and superheavy behemoth
Alexander Karelin won his 12th straight global gold medal. Better
prospects for the Yanks at this weekend's freestyle championships
in Turkey. The squad, which placed third last year, has former
champs Terry Brands (127.75) and Les Gutches (187.25) plus
returning bronze medalists Cary Kolat (138.75) and Lincoln McIlravy
(152). If form holds, the US could qualify in six of the eight
Olympic classes . . . Great leap for the US men's volleyball team,
which knocked off the Cubans to win the regional title for the
first time since 1985. They'll compete in next month's World Cup in
Japan along with the US women, who placed second to Cuba. Top three
teams there make it to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth sailing
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging showing by the US sailors, who won five medals in 11
events at the recent Olympic shakedown regatta in Sydney. Bob
Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I., took a silver with Paul Foerster in
the men's 470. With Tom Olsen of East Dennis and Eric Doyle winning
the recent Star world title, the Americans have qualified for the
Games in all but two classes (Finn and men's Mistral) and still
have final chances in both . . . Want a definition of domination?
All 10 finalists in the five categories at the recent world table
tennis championships in Holland were from China. It's the third
time the Chinese have managed that. The Americans, as usual, were
nowhere near the medals. Best effort came from Gao Junchang, who
reached the round of 32 in both singles and doubles . . . The
inaugural winter Goodwill Games, slated for Lake Placid next
February, will be compact (four days) and decidedly
made-for-Turner. No biathlon, no long track speedskating, nothing
longer than a sprint in cross-country skiing and only one Alpine
event (men's downhill). The program includes figure skating (pros
only), snowboarding, jumping, freestyle skiing, short track
speedskating, and the cement-and-ice trinity of bobsled, luge, and
skeleton . . . Olympic champion Justin Huish will be the sole
returnee on the US men's archery team in Sydney. Vic Wunderle, who
won the recent trials, and Shane Parker supplant Atlanta veterans
Butch Johnson and Rod White. Janet Dykman made the women's team
again, along with two-time Olympian Denise Parker (who missed
Atlanta) and 17-year-old Karen Scavotto of Enfield, Conn. Geena
Davis (yes, the actress), who finished a respectable 29th after
taking up the sport only two years ago (at 41), says she'll try
again. She did make it to Sydney, though, as a wild-card entrant
for the recent pre-Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Luge, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Got a buddy willing to ride feet first with you on a sled? The
US Luge people can use you for a few months. With Chris Thorpe and
Gordy Sheer sitting out the first half of the season and Chris
Niccum banned for doping, two of last year's top three men's
doubles teams are off the screen . . . No, the Lords of the Rings
won't be adding ``practical shooting'' to the Olympic program. Once
known as combat shooting, the ``run-and-gun'' version involves
firing at human-shaped targets with assault rifles,
semi-automatics, and shotguns from behind windows and doors. No
chance, says the IOC, which already has three gun-related sports
(shooting, modern pentathlon, biathlon) in the Games.

NO SURE WAY TO POLICE BRUTALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Modano will make $6 million this season and has pay days,
if he wants them, that will last until April 2004 _ an additional
$32.5 million. So why was the slick Stars centerman talking with
such resignation last week, pondering a walkaway at age 29?
</P>
<P>
   For once, folks, this is not a league problem, not the owners'
fault, not the product of some miserly general manager. It's not
because an agent placed him in a bum deal. It's not even the last
possible scapegoat, the fans (see various recent Ryder Cup
stories). If he leaves, he won't be able to say the devil made him
do it.
</P>
<P>
   It is, quite simply, because of the way the game is played, and
for that players have only themselves to blame. They are the
problem. No one else.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, of course, is one of the lucky ones. He can afford to
hit the road, although the bet here is that he will play at least
through '04, perhaps with the current deal extended in the spring
of '02 or '03. That's just the way the negotiating game goes, which
has nothing at all to do right now with his contemplated early
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I things continue,'' Modano said last week while recovering
from a mild concussion, broken nose, and strained neck ligaments,
``I'm not going to play anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano was one of the Stars who last weekend were roughed up by
the overly aggressive Mighty Ducks (not an oxymoron). Ruslan Salei,
one of the game's nastier blue liners for his three-plus NHL
seasons, hit Modano from behind, spilling him awkwardly into the
boards. As he crash-landed headfirst on the ice, Modano's neck took
a frightening Exorcist-like twist, and one can only wonder what
might have happened if the slightest bit more torque had been been
exerted on his neck. The outcome could have been catastrophic, be
it life-threatening or paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   There was another vicious hit in the same game, by Ducks
defenseman Pascal Trepanier, a battering elbow-first slam on Joe
Nieuwendyk. Oh, and just to make it real hockey, ex-Whaler whack
job Jim McKenzie entered a scrum flailing and kept swinging until
he broke Darryl Sydor's eye socket.
</P>
<P>
   I am not going to waste one word here blaming the officials. The
NHL's guys in stripes do, by far, the best job of policing in all
of professional sport. The fact that linesmen are paid, in part, to
break up fights is a sad statement about the sport and the men who
play it. Too many trees already have perished, used to carry the
written debate over why fighting should or shouldn't be tolerated
in today's hockey. No doubt someone in the days ahead will make the
point that vicious hits and violent play are the outcropping of
putting a cap on these fights. To which there is only this
response: Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Look, if Player X goes out with the intent to injure Player Y,
there truly is nothing anyone can do about that. That's true of
every professional sport worldwide (hello, Jack Tatum), just as it
is on the playground, in the supermarket, on the highway, and
anywhere else evil creeps into our society. Hockey only increases
the odds for nitwits to take aim because it arms them with the
tools of the game, sticks and steel blades. Late-night convenient
stores have been terrorized with far less.
</P>
<P>
   What can hockey do to prevent it? That's the wrong question.
Folks looking to NHL headquarters for the fix are the same ones who
call Channel 7 looking for weatherman Harvey Leonard to answer for
the 18 inches of snow in the driveway. The league handed out
suspensions, took pay out of players' pockets, and can only hope
that the current punishment _ and the implied promise to increase
such penalties _ diminishes future crime. What else do you want,
handcuffs with official NHL logos?
</P>
<P>
   The frightening truth is that there is no fix. What, ask owners
not to sign guys like Salei and Trepanier? OK. But who makes up the
cull list? How are potential perpetrators identified? Impossible.
</P>
<P>
   How about this for a preposterous suggestion: Tell fans to stay
away until these goons are gone. Don't bet on that. In today's
society, there's a better chance that crowds would drop if the
threat of bodily harm were reduced. Who do you suppose is filling
the stands of auto racing tracks around the country? There are more
meatheads than motorheads out there, guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that puts a stop to intent-to-injure incidents is
the conscience that fills the helmet. The league can keep
ratcheting up the penalites, and perhaps eventually issue a
lifetime ban to someone (get Judge Judy a black-and-white striped
robe for that one), but even then there would be no guarantee of
eradication. A victim's paralysis or death also wouldn't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is a dangerous game, made more so by the likes of Salei
and Trepanier. None of that is news. The game is unquestionably
more violent that it was 10 years ago, and there are many reasons
for that, such as lower skill level brought on by expansion, and
better equipment that leads to what is sometimes a false sense of
security. None of that is news, either.
</P>
<P>
   If Modano or another high-profile athlete quits to make a
statement, now that will be news. For now, he is only stating the
obvious, that it's a dangerous and sometimes ugly, frightening
world out there.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is only one answer: Proceed at your own risk. And
just hope that the raving lunatic with the stick in his hand, his
emotions charged, tiny licks of flame dancing in his pupils, at
least has a thread of conscience holding him back.
</P>
<P>
   Economics lesson
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dafoe's agent, Ron Salcer, says the Bruins' unwillingness
to negotiate a more generous deal for his client _ more in line
with Dafoe's requested $12 million over three years _ is an outward
show of contempt by club management. ``The only conclusion I can
make,'' he said, ``is that the franchise is not concerned about
winning, and that they're not concerned about the players or the
public. That is their cynical attitude. I feel it shows contempt,
and as long as the fans keep showing up, it will last, I guess.
It's this attitude: `We don't pay it because we're the Boston
Bruins.' Well that just shows contempt _ to everyone.'' It shows
that Salcer truly understands the most basic black-and-gold
equation: The club's perennial healthy attendance keeps ticket
prices high and payroll suppressed. Will losing change that?
Absolutely not (witness: 1996-97). Now, if losing leads to empty
seats, then big money might be spent on players. But don't count on
that. Ticket prices would come down slightly at first, and if that
failed, the club's Buffalo-based ownership might consider selling
before making outlandish free-agent signings. And, remember, one
need only look at the ongoing train wreck that is the Rangers to
realize spending alone doesn't carry a guarantee . . . Loved this
one last week by Flyer chairman Ed Snider: ``It amazes me,'' he
told the Philadelphia Inquirer, ``that we can be so stupid as
owners, all of us _ me included.'' He was bemoaning the Flyers' $47
million-plus payroll, second in the league to the Rangers, who came
in just under $60 million. Snider &AMP; Co. have been among the
league's biggest overspenders, not to mention underperformers . . .
In case you missed it, ex-Bruin Dave Reid hooked on last week with
the Avalanche, who need veteran protection up front while Peter
Forsberg heals. Reid made $700,000 last year and won a Cup with
Dallas. Now 35, he took about a 30 percent pay cut to stay in the
game _ and perhaps win another Cup with the talented Avalanche.
Reid would have been a nice fit in the Hub, at about one-third the
price the Rangers paid to steal away defensive forward Tim Taylor.
Asked this summer about bringing Reid back, Boston management said
it wasn't interested, that younger players could do the job. That
was weeks before the horrifying, back-to-the-'60s 0-3-0 start . . .
Phoenix general manager Bobby Smith was none too pleased to read
this comment by St. Louis GM Larry Pleau: ``What I can't understand
is how a coach can get everyone to dive in front of an Al MacInnis
slapshot and then get fired.'' Pleau was referring to ex-Coyote
coach Jim Schoenfeld, given the gate after the Blues rubbed out the
Coyotes in Round 1 last spring . . . World renowned architect Frank
Gehry, born in Toronto in 1929, years ago designed a line of
laminated maple furniture, naming some of the pieces the ``Cross
Check Chair,'' the ``Hat Trick Chair,'' and the ``Power Play
Chair.'' Makes you wonder what Canada's answer to Frank Lloyd
Wright could do with the conventional penalty box bench, doesn't
it? Maybe the ``Trap Door Chair'' or perhaps the simple ``Electric
Chair.'' Gehry, who grew up in Timmins, Ontario, still plays pickup
hockey and is working on a new building at MIT. Downtown you can
spot his handiwork at the corner of Newbury Street and Mass. Ave. _
the renovated Tower Records building.
</P>
<P>
   The Richter scale
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens were quiet in the offseason, not adding much to
the payroll after deleting the likes of Mark Recchi and Vincent
Damphousse at the March trade deadline. They did pick up ex-Bruin
Barry Richter for short money, and he put up a large debit in the
opener _ a giveaway to Mats Sundin that was converted for a
shorthanded strike . . . No father-son act ever played net for the
same NHL club until John Grahame followed Ron Grahame in the
Bruins' cage last week (21-plus years between family appearances).
The other father-son acts, but with different clubs, included
Dennis and Pat Riggin (the latter an ex-Bruin) as well as Sam and
Pete Lopresti . . . The sight of Patrick Lalime starting in the
Ottawa net Thursday night against the Bruins served as yet one more
reminder how precarious a goalie's life can be. Lalime had a
fabulous season in '96-97, filling in for the injured Tom Barrasso
in Pittsburgh and rattling off the best start by a rookie netminder
in league history. He couldn't settle on a contract with the
Penguins the following season, though, and began a two-year odyssey
in the minors (IHL stops in Grand Rapids and Kansas City). His
obstinance took him out of the NHL market for two years, and he
might have been out longer if not for the Senators grabbing him in
a swap with the Ducks in June for ex-Bruin Ted Donato . . . Leafs
defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich, who made $1 million last year, ended
his holdout Friday, signing a three-year pact that will bring him a
shade under $2 million a year. Only a week earlier, the Leafs
handed Woonsocket's Bryan Berard a two-year pact for an average
$1.65 million a year . . . The Lightning swung a great deal over
the summer, picking up top goalie prospect Dan Cloutier from the
Rangers, and now have the luxury of not needing to press the kid
into action because veteran Daren Puppa is healthy after three
years of various back and groin ailments. It all turned around for
Puppa when the Bolts' new management hooked him up with the Detroit
Vipers (IHL) medical staff, leading to treatment for a previously
undetected hip injury . . . Tough start with the Rangers for
Taylor. He missed the first two weeks of training camp after an
appendectomy, then suffered a concussion and took eight stitches
above the right eye when Vancouver defenseman Ed Jovanovski lined
him up with a check and drove him to Palookaville . . . Look for
the Rangers soon to deal ex-Canadien Mathieu Schneider. He's making
around $3 million this year, and though he has a heavy shot from
the point, he became an expensive spare part when the Blueshirts
picked up Kevin Hatcher from the Penguins . . . He's a little too
soft to project for greatness, but ex-Leaf Fredrik Modin has the
kind of blistering slapper that could bring 40 goals or more.
Toronto dished him to Tampa in order to bring big block Cory Cross
(6-5, 220) to the Maple Leaf blue line. Good deal for both sides,
but Modin has that Stephane Richer kind of big-strike potential . .
. Can anyone out there remember so many Original Six clubs looking
so shabby? . . . The Red Wings have concluded that 23-year-old
Mathieu Dandenault is a defenseman. And that's final, you know,
until maybe there are a couple of injuries up front, enough
defensemen to go around (literally), or heck, if the offense could
use a booster shot . . . The Stars were the victims of no fewer
than five boarding penalites in their first two games _ more than
some teams endure over the course of 2-3 seasons . . . The Stars
committed nearly $20 million in the combined deals for Richard
Matvichuk (four years, $7.8 million) and Eddie Belfour (two years,
$11.5 million) . . . In Sweden, the Elite League's top scorer now
wears a yellow helmet into game action. ``Imagine the target you'd
be in the NHL, wearing that?'' said Sundin.

PATRIOTS WILL BE ON RED ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There's Red Skelton, Red Auerbach, Red
Buttons. There's red meat, red blood, red eyes, and the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn likes seeing red.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an Ohio State player, and that color red can be
intimidating a little bit, especially when you see just all red,''
said Glenn. ``For me, I'm kind of used to red. As a matter of fact,
red is my favorite color.''
</P>
<P>
   What the 4-0 Patriots have to avoid is being red-faced with
embarrassment following Sunday's game at Arrowhead Stadium, where
rabid Chiefs fans dress in all red. Kansas City was humiliated by
the Patriots at Foxboro Stadium last season, 40-10.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots could be granted one wish, it would be to score
early. They've been outscored, 37-3, in the first quarter, and that
Adam Vinatieri field goal came on their first possession of the
first game, Sept. 12 vs. the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then they've been the Comeback Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team you really don't want that,'' said Glenn, who caught
13 passes for 214 yards in a 19-7 win over Cleveland last Sunday.
``We would like to score all of our points in the first quarter if
we could. We don't want to rely on (coming back), but we know we
have that capability if that should happen to us again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots would love to be able to spring Glenn for a
double-figure number of catches again, but nobody, including Glenn,
is expecting that to happen. The Chiefs have two very tough corners
in James Hasty and Cris Dishman. Both play a bump-and-run style, so
Glenn is going to get hammered at the line of scrimmage, the way
Jason Sehorn hammered him two weeks ago in a 16-14 win over the
Giants. Glenn cried foul in that game, believing Sehorn was hitting
him past the 5-yard allowed area. If that should happen again,
Glenn will make it known to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   If Glenn and Shawn Jefferson are blanketed by the corners, it
could mean that tight end Ben Coates finally gets the ball more.
Coates was shut out last Sunday and has caught only 10 passes in
four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to catch the ball,'' said Coates, ``but
whatever they give us, we have to take advantage of it, just like
we did with Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Drew Bledsoe wants to make sure Coates feels like
he's a part of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to get into what Ben has meant to this team over
the years,'' said Bledsoe. ``If Ben didn't catch a ball (last
week), that's got to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is more of a role-type player right now,'' said Glenn.
``We haven't been using Ben as much as Ben would like us to use
him, but we really haven't had to. It's going to come down to a
couple of games where _ maybe even in this game _ Ben is going to
catch his balls, and touchdown balls, and he will be back to the
same old Ben Coates.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is hoping the Patriots' running game starts to click to
take the pressure off Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more to come,'' said Glenn of the running
game. ``(Ours) has been a little suspect the past couple of years.
We have been relying heavily on the pass. As for Terry Allen, I
don't know right now. We are just waiting for him to break that big
run, that big game, that 40-, 50-, 60-yard gain for a touchdown. It
would definitely open up the pass a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn understands that after his 13 catches last week, he's a
marked man. The Chiefs aren't likely to play it the way the Browns
did and give Glenn easy catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first 10 catches they were still up, 7-6, on us at
halftime, so why would they change anything?'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``But on the 11th and 12th catches, that's when Terry did
hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn knows the Patriots must conquer the crowd _ and the noise
_ early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see on film that the crowd is a big factor,'' said
Glenn. ``We're 2-0 on the road, so I think our team responds pretty
well to crowds. This one might be worse than what we've faced
against New York and Cleveland, but winning this one would be very
satisfying considering what we're up against out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Red, all the time.

<P>
   VERONA, N.Y. _ Women's boxing took two shots in the nose this
weekend when what it needs is a shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   A fledgling sport that is barely on the edge of respectability
thanks only to the talented but too-seldom-seen Lucia Ryker and
public relations whiz Christy Martin, women's professional
prizefighting got more publicity staging sideshows than it has
gotten for actual bouts, and that is not good for the sport's
long-term health.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Laila Ali, the 21-year-old daughter of Muhammad
Ali, made her professional boxing debut in a hail of flashbulbs at
the Turning Stone Casino here against an Indiana waitress who
fought as though she were still working in a barroom.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress, April Fowler, described her only professional loss
before she met Ali this way: ``I got knocked down and I stayed
down. I wasn't going to be getting any more (money) for getting
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Ali, who is trained by former WBU cruiserweight
champion Johnny McClain, had worked a year for this moment and at
least was trying to box in the classic sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Day 1 to Day 2, I learned there was a lot more to boxing
than I thought if you want to be good,'' Ali said. ``That's if you
want to learn how to box. It's hard to deal with sometimes if
you're in the ring sparring with some woman just going wild,
swinging wild. That's not boxing; that's fighting. Anybody can just
go fight. What does that have to do with boxing?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, which is why the women's sport has evolved so slowly
and still meets with more skepticism than acceptance among fans and
promoters. For every skillful fighter like Ryker, there are 100
women like Fowler. Out of shape and unskilled, they fight with
their head down, arms windmilling, looking like a barroom brawler
after a long night tapping a keg.
</P>
<P>
   For women's boxing to ever approach acceptance, it must lose
that sideshow flavor and develop real fighters. Ali at least is
trying to do that, but there are so few like her that it's a
struggle to find worthy opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really wanted to bother with this,'' said veteran
promoter Mike Acri of the Ali fight. ``I don't really like women
boxing and I didn't anticipate this coming along, but her lawyer is
a friend of mine and her father was the greatest in boxing history,
so I said I'd help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered at first if this was just a kid using the name for
two or three fights or someone who wanted to make it in boxing. I
didn't know how dedicated she was until I talked to her trainers
and watched her. Now I feel there's something to it. She's
obviously an athlete. She takes it seriously. She has the right
attitude, and that's all you can ask from a young fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is so much more difficult than developing a male
boxer. At least with them you know what you can do. You can find
opponents and check records and know something about the styles and
bring them along as they improve. With Laila, finding opponents is
almost impossible. There were only about 18 girls in her weight
class (168 pounds), and there's no way of tracing the backgrounds
of these girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the skills, training, and experience of female fighters
have been minimal, and a conflict has evolved between those who
truly would like to help bring the sport along and promoters who
are willing to exploit the situation for a fast buck.
</P>
<P>
   A case of the latter came Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in Seattle, where
promoter Bob Jarvis made the first (and hopefully last) match
between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a freak show,'' wrote Seattle Times sports columnist
Steve Kelly, and who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   Always alert for a train wreck to cover, the media jumped all
over it. Sports Illustrated, which pays short shrift to real boxers
most of the time, arranged a photo shoot of Margaret McGregor and
her male opponent, Loi Chow. The magazine paid Chow to fly in early
from Vancouver and did the same for Hy Peskin, a veteran sports
photographer from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same magazine that didn't send a staff reporter to
the Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas fight in Tokyo a few years back
because SI felt it was going to be a circus act. So what's man vs.
woman, high art?
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Jarvis said, ``I go by the precept that most
women probably don't want to fight guys but Margaret wants to and,
hey, it's a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, McGregor was to have fought a kid named Hector
Morales, who would have been making his pro debut against a
36-year-old woman. Wisely he thought better of it and pulled out,
saying, ``My friends, you know, were kidding me about being a woman
beater, but then I started thinking if I lose, I jeopardize my
whole career. If I lost to a woman, what man is ever going to fight
me again? But for her, it's a different story. A big, big story.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but who wants to really read it? Or write it?
</P>
<P>
   Not Rick Kulis, who runs the International Female Boxers
Association and has been that end of the sport's biggest promoter.
Kulis realizes there is a danger in fight cards like this
weekend's, a danger of further marginalizing a wing of boxing still
in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's planning to write a book,'' said trainer Vern
Miller of Chow, who took on McGregor for $1,500 plus his photo fee
from SI, the $150 he charged the London Daily Mirror for his
picture, and the financial demands he made to appear on syndicated
TV interview shows. ``I'm pretty sure he's planning to use this
publicity for something.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is, what is women's boxing going to use it
for? And what does it say about the people who cover sports and the
people who watch it that a week ago two veteran professional
prizefighters put on a boxing war at the Icenter in Salem, N.H., a
classic 10-round battle that was a test of skill and will finally
won with 20 seconds to go by a bloody Lowell junior lightweight
named Micky Ward and only 1,801 people came to watch while Friday
night at the Turning Stone Casino 2,500 came out to see Laila Ali
fight a waitress?
</P>
<P>
   Worse, even more came to Seattle's Mercer Arena to watch a
36-year-old woman, who claims to have once bitten the legs off her
sister's Barbie doll, ``box'' a 34-year-old part-time jockey with
an 0-2 record. In that crowd were representatives of Sports
Illustrated, the New York Times, the London Times, the London
Mirror, and the Canadian Broadcasting Co., while representatives of
the ``Tonight'' show called to say they might want McGregor to be a
guest.
</P>
<P>
   If women truly want to box (and Lord knows why they would, and
that's not sexist, so don't bother writing, because anyone with an
ounce of sense wonders the same thing about men if they know
anything about the hardships of such a career choice), this is not
the way to push their sport.
</P>
<P>
   Ryker was recently dropped by promoter Bob Arum not because she
lost a fight, because she never has; he dropped her because he
believes he has a better shot at making money promoting a Playboy
model named Mia St. John.
</P>
<P>
   On some of the photos in Playboy, St. John is wearing boxing
gloves and nothing else. Those pictures are the sum total of what
she brings to a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Look at that magazine and this weekend's festivities, and you
can ask yourself one thing. Can you spell the word
E-X-P-L-O-I-T-E-D?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why should women fighters be treated any differently
than most of the men have been for generations?
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   Word is, the chief rival of International Boxing Federation
junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas, World Boxing
Association junior middleweight champion David Reid, is looking to
opt out of HBO's stable when his contract is up and jump to cable
rival Showtime. One reason? The apparent reluctance of his
promoter, America Presents, to follow through on a promise to end
that contract with a unification fight with Vargas. These days, all
Dan Goossen wants to talk about is a Reid-Oscar De La Hoya fight,
playing down any chance of a Reid-Vargas showdown next year . . .
Jay Larkin, Showtime's programming chief, has contingency plans set
for the Oct. 23 telecast of the Mike Tyson-Orlin Norris bout. That
is the night of the first World Series game and Larkin does not
intend to compete, even with Tyson. ``The first pitch is 8:10 p.m.
Eastern time and we don't go on with Mike until 11 p.m. or 11:30
p.m.,'' Larkin said. ``We have the undercard and then we can tap
dance until the game is over if we have to. When it is, we'll walk
Tyson in and try to catch the viewers. We'll do print ads and PR
work and on-air marketing to make the connection with sports fans
between the end of the game and the start of Mike's fight. We know
you could have a 4 1/2-hour baseball game, but realistically we
think it will work out.'' Originally, Showtime planned the fight
for Oct. 2, but Tyson's unwillingness to agree on an opponent and
other delays he imposed caused the problem . . . Once Roy Jones
made it official that he wasn't fighting Nov. 6 on HBO's ``Boxing
After Dark,'' the cable giant thought it had replaced him with
stablemate Smoke Gainer against World Boxing Council junior
lightweight champion Floyd Mayweather, one of HBO's rising young
stars. Enter Don King. Exit Floyd Mayweather. Mayweather's
promoter, Bob Arum, thought they'd agreed in principle to a
multifight deal with HBO that would have extended Mayweather's
contract for another 3 1/2 years while allowing him to remain a
pay-per-view free agent. But the papers were never signed and word
Friday was that King had convinced Mayweather he was being
underpaid. Mayweather refused to sign the deal or accept a Gainer
fight, leading his father, Floyd Sr., to rip him in a local paper
in Grand Rapids, Mich., while HBO was left scrambling to find a new
fight, possibly in New York, on that date . . . It appears Jones
will be in the first HBO fight of 2000 if he appears as scheduled
on Jan. 4, although it may not be against mandatory challenger
Graciano Rocchigiani . . . Anyone who watched the sad beating
once-great Julio Cesar Chavez took from journeyman Willie Wise last
weekend saw a perfect argument for mandatory retirement from the
ring. A bloody and battered Chavez looked like an old man getting
mugged by street punks as Wise battered him around for 10 rounds to
easily win a decision and derail Chavez's hopes of one last title
shot. ``I'm very surprised at how poorly I performed,'' Chavez
said. How come? No one else who's been paying attention was.

BC NOT WISE TO OWLS IN FIRST LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This was a loss that was four victories in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   After Boston College bumbled, stumbled, and fumbled its way to a
4-0 record against teams that had a collective 4-14 record, things
finally caught up to the Eagles in Saturday's 24-14 Big East loss
at Temple before a Veterans Stadium crowd of 15,067.
</P>
<P>
   It is now 45 years since the Eagles won their first five games
of a season, as they couldn't handle the lowly Owls (1-5, 1-1). And
the Eagles (4-1, 1-1) lost to Temple at The Vet for the second time
in three years. The Owls handed BC a 28-21 loss in the debut of
Eagles coach Tom O'Brien Sept. 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   BC's offense was outgained for the second game in a row _ this
time, 429 yards to 328 _ after showing signs of slippage in a 33-22
victory last week over Northeastern, which was throttled Saturday
by UMass, 77-0. After taking a 14-0 lead in the second quarter, BC
allowed Temple to score 24 unanswered points. Meanwhile, the
offense squandered three red zone opportunities when John Matich
missed a 35-yard field goal in the first quarter, backup
quarterback Brian St. Pierre threw an interception in the end zone
in the second quarter, and Cedric Washington fumbled at the Temple
19 as the Eagles were driving for a fourth-quarter score that would
have tied the game at 21.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck emerged
from BC's locker room after the game with his right (throwing) arm
in a sling. Hasselbeck suffered a slight separation in the first
quarter, but played the remainder of the game and completed 14 of
22 passes for 146 yards. His 4-yard pass to fullback Ryan Burch
lifted BC to a 14-0 lead with 14:55 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Temple a lot of credit, they hung in there
today,'' said O'Brien. ``As the game progressed, they got better,
and I think it's safe to say we got worse. We're not a very good
football team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With backup quarterback Devin Scott at the helm, the Owls
rallied to three scoring drives that netted 197 yards of offense.
BC's first three series of the second half resulted in
three-and-outs that netted a grand total of minus-8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance in the first half to put 'em away _ not
totally put 'em away _ but to get going,'' said O'Brien. ``All that
did was that it brought them back to life and we came out and
didn't meet their challenge in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   On Temple's first possession, Ralph Parent blocked a punt and
Jonathan Ordway recovered at the Temple 6. Three plays later,
freshman William Green crashed in from 2 yards out for a 7-0 Eagles
lead with 11:58 remaining. After Matich's 35-yard attempt missed
right, George White's second interception of the game set up a
four-play, 64-yard drive that ended with Hasselbeck's 4-yard toss
to Burch.
</P>
<P>
   Then Scott, who had suffered a rib-cage injury in last week's
55-24 loss at Pittsburgh, came on the scene, completing 17 of 23
passes for 169 yards. Temple, which had been largely ineffective
with starter Mac Devito (13 for 24, 104 yards) at the helm, seemed
to gain new life when Scott entered. Temple threatened from the BC
28 with 17 seconds remaining before halftime (aided by a
roughing-the-kicker penalty).
</P>
<P>
   On Scott's first play, he lofted a 27-yard pass to Greg
Muckerson (seven catches, 81 yards) which set up a 1-yard plunge
two plays later by Marcus Godfrey that cut BC's lead to 14-7. In
the second half, Scott completed 11 of his next 12 passes to rally
Temple to a pair of scores, hitting a diving Carlos Johnson (seven
catches, 87 yards) with a 9-yard pass that tied it at 14.
</P>
<P>
   Scott then put the Owls ahead to stay, 21-14, when he capped a
10-play, 73-yard drive with a 4-yard toss to fullback Jason McKie.
After Washington fumbled at the Temple 19, thwarting BC's only
legitimate scoring threat of the second half, Cap Poklemba
converted a 31-yard field goal _ which bounced off the right
upright _ to give Temple a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a total surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said last week, if I was at Temple, I'd be looking at the
people they've played and looking at the people we were playing,''
O'Brien said. ``They've been getting better the last two weeks
playing tough teams, and we've slipped in the last week or two, and
I think it has to do with the way we played and what we did a week
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of this setback were sown long before Saturday. This
was just the inevitable result.

ALOMAR IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has been the missing link for a ballclub that didn't know it
needed one. It wasn't like the Indians were a busted chain, not
after winning five straight division titles and reaching the World
Series twice.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbie Alomar made Cleveland even greater this season. Going
into Saturday's Game 3, Sandy's kid brother was looking like the
man most likely to get his mates another date with the Yankees in
the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous case that should be made for Robbie as
the MVP of the league this year,'' said manager Mike Hargrove.
``There are so many ways that he can help your team win. With his
glove. With his speed. With his bat. With his knowledge of the game
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians signed the 31-year-old Alomar for $32 million over
four years after he bailed out of Baltimore as a free agent. They
knew they were getting both performance and pedigree _ a 10-time
All-Star, career .300 switch-hitter, and a seven-time Gold Glove
second baseman, who'd picked up two Series rings in Toronto. What
they didn't realize was that they were also getting the invisible
glue that has bound them even more firmly together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks team all the time,'' said Cleveland general manager
John Hart, who says that Alomar is the best free agent the
franchise has ever signed. ``He started talking team the first day
he walked into our locker room in Winter Haven. Robbie will sit at
a little corner locker and talk when it's time. He'll go out to
dinner. All the old stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The old, low-key, subtle stuff. There was no need for Alomar to
impose his personality on a team that already knew how to get to
October. Besides, his catcher/sibling Sandy was already wearing the
unofficial captain's ``C'' on his chest protector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real quiet guy, but I like to help my people,'' said
Robbie. ``All the players here are like my family. We are here to
help each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar had a stunning regular season, becoming the first player
in club history to hit 20 homers, score 100 runs, knock in 100
runs, and steal 30 bases. He also hit .323. He went until June 9
without an error and made only three in his final 92 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you watch Robbie perform on a daily basis, you don't
truly realize that special talent he has,'' said Hargrove. ``He has
the ability to go out and play the game like nobody else I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in October. Before this year, Alomar had batted .333
with 29 RBIs in 50 postseason games. In the first two games, Alomar
had five of the Indians' 14 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a money player,'' testified Sandy. ``Just a great
postseason player.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the whole point of the kid brother's coming to Ohio in
the first place. It wasn't for a family reunion. ``The goal for our
family is to play in the postseason,'' said Sandy. ``This is the
whole enchilada right here. Playing in the postseason together and
trying to win the whole thing.''

   ``We're trying to fashion some reasonable restrictions,'' said
Councilman Mike Feuer, who's taken up the cause for residents, who
he said ``felt their proximity to the Playboy Mansion was causing
real disruption to the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Playboy Mansion presents its own situation,'' Feuer said,
as it attracts not only the partygoers' cars, but the commercial
vehicles of caterers and other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer suggested imposing the restrictions after he received the
latest petition from neighborhood residents last week, but fellow
council members were turned off. However, the council's
Transportation Committee will review the matter Oct. 19 in hopes of
coming up with a compromise. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Whenever she's gone there for fund-raisers, Goldberg said she
simply parked and walked to the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   She said she opposes street-parking restrictions in
neighborhoods where homes have driveways and garages available. She
said such rules make sense in places like Venice Beach, however,
where residents must battle to find street parking near their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm saying, No, I don't care about noise,'' she
sy8 {UU$.Z+ RK$,+..YKHZ$UY+$[KW$ZR.IZY]HH($.X;eSs%G|X7
nYZ-,K- &QC; M9::j$( The Playboy Mansion itself is a few twists and
turns away
from Beverly Glen, on Charing Cross Road. In the surrounding
neighborhood, long circular drives arc through expansive, manicured
lawns. At least one Mercedes or Lincoln sits in each one. But on
many of the streets fronting those estates, no parking is allowed
whatsoever _ those residents already have their highly desirable
parking restrictions. So the valets from the Playboy Mansion end up
queuing the cars on Beverly Glen, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the party's on Mapleton (Drive), park on Mapleton for
heaven's sake,'' said one neighbor on Beverly Glen, who asked that
his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner bought the mansion in 1971, and moved there full-time in
1975, Farley said. Since then, its very name has conjured images of
Playmates cavorting on the grounds with celebrities and stars, the
adventures of the glitterati titillating mortal men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way these people -- the jet-setters -- live.
That's Hollywood,'' said City Councilman Nate Holden, who also
opposes the parking restrictions. ``At the same time, the people
who live in the neighborhood want their peace and quiet. That's
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) to single out one property -- that's not the way
preferential parking works,'' said Holden, who said he would
investigate the situation personally, by attending a function at
the mansion Friday. ``If the place has become a nuisance, there's
another way of going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Weinberger said representatives at the Playboy Mansion
are always helpful when she calls with concerns, such as if their
driveway is blocked. But the couple said they wish they didn't have
to worry about such things in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made it sort of an unpleasant place to live, but we're
devoted to the neighborhood,'' Howard Weinberger said. ``We want to
preserve what's left of it.''

PARKING AT PLAYBOY PARTIES IRKS NEIGHBORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The story has all the makings of the ultimate L.A.
battle: rich people upset about their privacy, politicians taking
unpredictable sides, sexy all-night parties and ... parking.
</P>
<P>
   Along Beverly Glen Boulevard, the residents of the large,
stately homes once owned by Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman, Juliet
Prowse and Barbara Stanwyck are upset with their hedonistic
neighbor - Hugh Hefner and his Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, residents have petitioned City Hall to expand
parking restrictions, in hopes of stemming the crush of cars that
line their street every time Hefner throws one of his extravagant
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council deferred the latest request last week for
special parking restrictions on weekends, during prime party hours,
but promised the 14 residents who signed the petition it would keep
looking for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we can hardly get out of our driveway,'' said Pamela
Weinberger, 83, who has lived with her husband, Howard, in their
house on Beverly Glen Boulevard since 1958. They say the greatest
nuisance is the valet parkers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come roaring down the hill and screech their brakes and
stop and then roar off,'' said Howard Weinberger, also 83, a
retired physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they lay patches,'' Pamela Weinberger said. ``If we're
sitting here all we hear is squealing, squealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The upscale neighborhood dispute has created strange bedfellows,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, a staunch women's-rights
advocate, opposed the parking restrictions, which she called
exclusionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with Hugh Hefner. Please don't say I'm
fighting for Hugh Hefner. That's probably the last thing I would
do,'' she said. ``If it's a use I adore or a use I abhor, it
doesn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect it's mostly they don't like people they don't know
parking in their neighborhood,'' Goldberg said.``I'm sorry, that's
not a choice you get. You don't own that street.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The problem is that for Hugh Hefner, having a party can mean
about 700 for a summertime fashion show. The average attendance is
about 500 for the half-dozen or so charitable events held every
year inside the mansion's high walls and towering hedges, said Bill
Farley, director of communications for Playboy Enterprises
International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mansion has room on the grounds to park about 25
cars, for the small, more regular weekend gatherings. For larger
events, they ask guests to park at UCLA or a nearby Robinsons-May
store and they provide shuttles to the mansion, but many attendees
still hand over their keys to valet attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not considerate and it gets crowded and it's not safe
for children,'' said Bijan Raphael, 50, who has lived on Beverly
Glen for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very pleasant. It's just a bad situation,'' said
Raphael, a self-employed entrepreneur who said the problem seemed
to escalate about two years ago. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Parking on Beverly Glen is restricted to cars with permits from
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays. Residents hope to extend that to the
weekends, allow only two-hour parking weekend nights and ban
overnight parking on Saturdays and Sundays. The rules would affect
Beverly Glen only between Charing Cross Road and Comstock Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the restrictions go up, we'll live with them,'' Farley
said. ``We want to be a good neighbor.''

   NEW YORK _ The managers made the moves they make in their sleep
without losing a Z. When they had a one-run lead to protect, they
made the standard late-inning defensive switch. Except Bobby
Valentine's saved the game, while Buck Showalter's cost him the
season.
</P>
<P>
   On a tense October afternoon that conjured quixotic Shea Stadium
memories of championships past, here was a clear demonstration of
the arbitrary nature, the fragile polarity, between moving on as a
baseball genius and going home to a mournful hug.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's guy, Melvin Mora, cut down a huge eighth-inning run
from left field. In the bottom of the inning, Showalter's man, Tony
Womack, dropped a crucial fly ball in right.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we were reminded that the blue-collar appeal of the
sport has always been the ability of some anonymous soul to step
off the bench and into postseason lore. And its cruelty is the
sudden calamity an unsuspecting outfielder can innocently drift
under.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Showalter said of Womack's blunder that
redirected the game into extra innings, where Todd Pratt was the
last line in a storybook ending. ``A lot of guys wouldn't have got
to that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, meanwhile, basked in the glow of the 4-3 victory over
Arizona that sends the Mets back for yet another Atlanta joust,
like a battered boxer who just won't stay down. ``You get a lead
and you put in your best defensive outfielder,'' he said. ``Mora is
in there like a reliever, to save the game, and that's what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, stand-in for the star, proceeded to hit the game-winning
home run in the 10th inning. John Franco of New York City earned
his first postseason victory in relief. Al Leiter pitched a gem and
was treated by Sandy Koufax to a postgame chat. The day and series
came up roses for Valentine, who bested fellow chess master
Showalter and now moves on, plotting revenge against one of his
least favorite humans, Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, practically doubled over by now from all his recent
last laughs, could take from Saturday a few more strokes of
brilliance to bewilder the panel of peers he fantasized about this
week in a national magazine. He could begin with Mora, who was
inserted in left for Rickey Henderson as Leiter tried to nurse his
way through the eighth inning with a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter got two outs, walked Turner Ward and watched with
everyone else in disbelief as Edgardo Alfonzo botched Womack's
one-hopper near second. Armando Benitez came on to yield Jay Bell's
two-run double and Matt Williams' hard single through the hole
between third and short.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is 27 years old, a career minor leaguer who appeared in 66
games for the Mets this season. He plays infield and outfield, and
Valentine wanted him on the postseason roster _ at infielder Luis
Lopez's expense _ precisely because he could play both.
</P>
<P>
   Mora said his best positions are left field and center. People
who have watched him out there would not have been surprised that
he charged Williams' hit, straightened up and fired a true
two-hopper to Pratt, nipping the sliding Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how big that run was for them,'' he said. ``But my arm
is strong. I threw a couple of guys out at home this year in
Triple-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine wasn't surprised that his roster move and defensive
switch worked out. He was just, as usual, grateful for the chance
to say he told us so. ``I have said a couple of times that Mora is
our best defensive outfielder, and people have snickered at me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets came up in the home eighth, needing a run, with
Gregg Olson relieving Brian Anderson for the Diamondbacks. He
walked Alfonzo leading off, and then John Olerud lifted a high
drive to deep right.
</P>
<P>
   Womack, the shortstop for seven innings, had moved to the
outfield to replace Bernard Gilkey. There was no reason at that
point to raise an eyebrow, because Gilkey is not Roberto Clemente
and the speedy Womack had played right field for most of the
season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, I think, is one of the top two or three right-fielders
in the league,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   True or false, there was one element to the move that ultimately
invited a second-guess, besides that it turned out bad. The
outfield was drenched in sun while the ball was emerging from the
shadows. Darryl Hamilton, the Mets' center fielder, said the Shea
outfield in the afternoon sun is always an adventure. Roger Cedeno,
sent to right field for Benny Agbayani, had told Hamilton he was
praying Leiter would throw ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger said, `I don't want the ball hit to me,''' Hamilton
said. ``You can't catch what you can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Womack's predicament as he failed to pick up Olerud's
drive and stumbled back in a sun field he had not been in all day.
He seemed to locate the ball on the warning track. Up went the
glove. The ball never went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just dropped it,'' he said. ``I wish I could get it back,
but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pushed across the tying run. The game continued for
Pratt to settle. Soon champagne was being sprayed all over the home
team's clubhouse, Showalter ducking as he somberly made his
congratulatory rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, a few feet away, was hugging the co-owner, Fred
Wilpon, shouting: ``Ain't it great, with John getting the win?
Ain't it beautiful?''
</P>
<P>
   All a matter of which side you're on, and which standard
defensive switch worked out.
</P>

KOBE FORESAW WINTER COMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ To all Kobe Bryant's amazing attributes, you can
add prescience.
</P>
<P>
   In February Bryant telephoned Tex Winter in Chicago to pick his
brain about the Bulls' famed triangle offense. Winter couldn't have
been more surprised if Ed McMahon had been on the other end of the
line.
</P>
<P>
   It was months before the Lakers would begin wooing Winter's
cohort in NBA championships, Phil Jackson, and years since Winter
suspected the league's young stars had stopped caring about any
offense that didn't start and end with a one-on-one move.
</P>
<P>
   As with the startling love match of tennis stars Steffi Graf and
Andre Agassi, there were signs, looking back, that pointed to
Jackson and the Lakers someday hooking up. But Bryant swears he
didn't pick up on any of them.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, he can't say what _ aside from simple curiosity _
compelled him to call Winter, who is now a member of the Lakers
coaching staff, teaching every player the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaky, isn't it?'' Bryant said after a recent practice. ``I
called him just because I was interested in how the offense works.
Why? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's less of a mystery to longtime Lakers assistant coach Bill
Bertka, who is on the other end of Bryant's knock when the 6-foot-7
guard comes searching for videotapes of great players, past and
present, to wile away idle hours on the road.
</P>
<P>
   If you think Bryant's 21st birthday in August is going to alter
his nightly routine dramatically, think again. It turns out the
player who skipped college is a serious student of basketball. His
approach couldn't be more academic if he were a doctoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's unique in his pursuit of learning about the game,''
Bertka said. ``It's not unusual for him to come to my room and
request Pete Maravich tapes to see how he played. That's why the
story of him calling Tex is interesting. It wasn't just lip
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, recalling the conversation, said: ``I was just asking
him pretty general questions. I let him run off with it and I just
sat back and listened.''
</P>
<P>
   It warmed Winter to realize the future of the NBA was interested
in an offense that's a blast from the past. It can be traced all
the way back to Sam Barry's coaching days at USC in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It impressed me that he really thirsted for knowledge,'' said
Winter, who lettered at USC in 1947. ``He really wanted to know
about the game. He was particularly interested in knowing how
Michael fit into the triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan disdained the triple-post offense at first,
viewing it as too egalitarian for his talents. That was before the
offense helped carry the Bulls to the first of their six NBA
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has Jordan's number, but he won't need to ring him for an
endorsement. Bryant knows that which Jordan had to learn; namely,
he can get his points and win titles, too, with an offense that
amplifies, rather than isolates, his athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was a believer even before he hung up with Winter. Last
season he privately lamented the limitations of the Lakers'
offense, which consisted of dumping the ball inside to center
Shaquille O'Neal and making like a potted plant.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had studied enough videotape over the years to know there
was a better way for so much talent to bloom. If that made him
selfish in the eyes of his teammates, let's hope they had that
blurred vision checked over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Winter is not a witch doctor and the triangle offense is not an
elixir. It's only as good as the fundamentals of the least-sound
player on the floor. So the chest-pass drills Jordan and Scottie
Pippen did without complaint better be performed with gusto by
Bryant and O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the triangle offense and what it's going to
do for the Lakers,'' Winter said. ``In the final analysis, it's not
the triangle that's going to be the key to the team's success but
how well the guys can execute the skills (on which it's based).''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant likened learning the new offense to learning Italian when
he was a child. At first, he was tentative. He made mistakes. There
were awkward moments and embarrassing gaffes and lots and lots of
repetitive drills that seemed too specific to be of any general
help. Then one day something clicked and those strings of sentences
that had been indecipherable suddenly made sense.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if the Lakers don't see instant results from the
labor, they mustn't despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll come,'' Bryant said. ``We've just got to be patient with
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bryant says something's going to happen, believe him. He's
not Magic; the Lakers' next great guard is mystic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Bryant said, ``when I first came to L.A., I told
my father (Joe) I'd be playing for Phil and Tex someday.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and shook his head in wonderment. ``It's kind of
freaky how things have played out.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say it's flat-out fateful. &QL;

ON BASEBALL: AN UNDERSTUDY TAKES A TURN ON CENTER STAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fourth inning, the Mets had a runner at second
base and two out. Todd Pratt grounded out. In the sixth inning, the
Mets had runners at second and third and two out. Todd Pratt
grounded out. In the eighth inning, the Mets had runners at first
and third and one out. Todd Pratt grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could easily have been the goat today,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, his teammate, dismissed that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs,'' Hamilton said, ``you have to forget about
it. All you need is the big hit. He may get a lot of opportunities,
but you have to forget about the ones you didn't get through and
concentrate on what's at hand. The fact that he forgot about those
at-bats and came through with the big hit is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, the Mets' catcher Saturday for the second consecutive
game in place of Mike Piazza and his ailing left thumb, produced
the big hit all right, the one that sent the Mets soaring to
Atlanta for the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the 10th inning, Pratt crushed a pitch from Matt
Mantei over the center-field fence, over the glove on the right
hand of a leaping Steve Finley. The home run gave the wild-card
Mets a 4-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks and placed them
one step away from a possible World Series meeting with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not Mike Piazza, obviously,'' Pratt said on the
Shea Stadium field in the minutes after the game, ``but for one
swing I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Pratt had a moment to reflect on what he had done and
who he was, he became insufferably modest, refusing to take credit
for having done anything more than having given ``my team a chance
to go to the NLCS.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for Piazza's inflamed and swollen thumb, Pratt would have
played about the same amount of time in this postseason as he did
with Philadelphia in 1993, when he appeared in one game and batted
once (he struck out) in the league series and played not at all in
the World Series. But he played in two of the four division series
games here, distinguishing himself with a good at-bat Friday night
that produced an important walk and with the home run and a pivotal
play at the plate Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His diving tag of Jay Bell on a throw from Melvin Mora in the
eighth inning kept the Diamondbacks only one run ahead. His home
run put the Mets one run ahead for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, whose three home runs during the regular season came in
the space of six games and 16 at-bats in April when Piazza was
injured, did not forget how to hit one, fortunately for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat against the hard-throwing Mantei, Arizona's
No. 1 reliever, Pratt said he had choked up on the bat, an approach
he adopts against pitchers who throw fastballs in the high 90-mph
range. But when he went to the plate with one out in the 10th, he
held the bat at the end, gripping the knob with his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw me the first pitch, a curveball, that wasn't even
close,'' he related. ``I just said if it's a fastball anywhere I
can touch it, I'm swinging. I said I need to get out in front of
this one, and he actually threw it to where my favorite pitch is, a
little up and out over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pratt began running, he watched Finley, the remarkably
talented center fielder, go back to the wall and leap. ``I've seen
him make that catch a million times,'' Pratt said. ``When he came
down, I thought he still had the ball. Then I saw him put his head
down. I almost started crying right there.''
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, Finley thought he had caught the ball. It hit
the top of his glove, and when he came down and looked in his
glove, he thought the ball would be there. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a second to realize the game was over,'' he said
disconsolately. ``It was a long walk back to the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, Pratt became Bobby Thomson, Bill Mazeroski,
Bucky Dent, Joe Carter. No, the home run won't rank with those hit
by that foursome, but it will become part of Mets' lore. Last year
Pratt almost became part of the Mets' past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a very testing year for me,'' said Pratt, who
opened the season in the minor leagues and was returned there twice
more. ``Every time I got sent down I didn't deserve it. It was very
heartbreaking last year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so frustrating that Pratt said he nearly quit, once when
he didn't make the team in spring training, the second time around
mid-season when he was demoted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then,'' he said of the second instance, ``was the first
time I cried after being talked to by a manager. I stayed here
three days, once again contemplating asking for my release and
saying forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   But an injury quickly opened a spot for Pratt and he was
restored to the roster. Given all that he went through, he was
asked Saturday, why wouldn't he take credit loud and long for what
he had just done.
</P>
<P>
   Listing other players without whose performances the Mets could
not have won the game, Pratt said: ``It is very easy for a player
to get very high emotionally on himself and talk himself up. I'm
just not that kind of player. I'm arrogant, but I'm arrogant inside
because I know I can play this game.''

TURNABOUT FAIR PLAY FOR VALENTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hero, goat, hero.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if John Valentin couldn't decide whether he wanted to
be Bill Russell or Bill Buckner. Bob Cousy or Bob Stanley. Jim
Lonborg or Jim Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were on life support, playing without their two best
players and ready to go into that long, cold, ``what-if?'' winter
that's imprisoned every Sox team since World War I. And Valentin _
the only member of the Red Sox who played with Mo Vaughn, Roger
Clemens, and Wade Boggs _ was being measured for a bust in the
Boston Baseball Hall of Shame.
</P>
<P>
   Bad throws. No hits. It couldn't get much worse. The fans at
home were booing him, questioning his desire, and blaming him for
another quick playoff exit.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin was feeling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel (lousy),'' he said after his throwing error cost the
Red Sox the first game of their playoff joust with Cleveland.
``It's my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   It kept getting worse. Valentin went 0 for 4 in the Game 2
humiliation and hit into a double play. There were whispers
(actually there were shouts on sports talk radio) that the Sox
should have gone with rookie Wilton Veras instead of the
high-priced veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been busy,'' said Valentin. ``You get ground balls, you
try to make the plays. It's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's 9-3 Red Sox win was knotted at 2-2 when
Valentin walked to the plate in the sixth inning wearing an
0-for-10 doughnut. The number on his back (13) seemed appropriate.
Then, at 6:13 EST, he turned on a pitch by Jaret Wright (Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove should be slaughtered back home for staying
so long with the head-case righthander) and launched it onto the
black tarp that covers the triangle of Fenway's center-field
bleachers. The Red Sox led, 3-2. The crowd loved him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the boos) is part of the game,'' he said. ``No one likes
it, but the fans are very emotional. When you mess up, they let you
know. It was a 2-2 game when I hit the home run so obviously I was
pretty happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The adulation and happiness lasted less than a half hour. Back
in the infield for the seventh, Valentin committed another hideous
throwing error. With two on and two out, he came in and gloved a
Manny Ramirez grounder on the trap hop, took several steps, then
inexplicably threw to first while he was still running. His throw
was in the dirt. It was the same kind of throw that cost the Sox
Game 1. First baseman Mike Stanley, who'll never be mistaken for
Vic Power or George Scott, attempted to backhand Valentin's one-hop
toss and it clanged off Stanley's glove as Kenny Lofton crossed the
plate with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I underthrew it,'' he said. ``I always throw on the run in
that situation. Of course, I felt bad. I think my teammates
understood how I felt and they pretty much left me alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play this game, you try to be at an even keel. You
try not to go through that roller coaster after you make a mistake.
You don't try to atone. That's just the way it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The silly error might have broken a lesser man, but Valentin has
been doing this a long time. So when he came to the plate in the
bottom of the same inning with the bases loaded and two out _ game
still tied, 3-3 _ he knew this was a chance for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Fenway legions stood and applauded when the
beleaguered veteran walked to the plate. It was as if Valentin had
earned a line of credit through his years of good deeds in the
community. Fans were giving him a break, even though he'd just
blown the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot to concentrate on when I'm up there,'' he said.
``So I not really noticing if they're booing me or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The applause mounted as Cleveland lefthander Ricardo Rincon ran
the count to 3-and-2. Valentin fouled off the first 3-2 pitch, then
cracked a ground-rule double to left, giving the Sox a 5-3 lead and
setting the stage for Brian Daubach's game-breaking, three-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was basically trying to tell myself to get a pitch that was
up in the zone,'' said Valentin. ``On the previous pitch, he threw
a pitch that was inside,'' it might have been ball four, ``and I
hit it foul. I wanted to get something a little higher and hit it
hard. He ended up throwing me a strike, a fastball, and I hit it
down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he never worried about becoming Buckner Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in that stuff. I believe in destiny. If the
Red Sox are destined to win the World Series, they're destined to
win. If not, they're not. We won tonight and I had a big part of
it. But I've got to have a short memory because I've got to be here
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A short memory is handy if you play for the Red Sox. Or if you
watch them. When it comes to Boston baseball in October, too many
of us have long memories.

NFL'S McNAIR HAS ANOTHER WINNER IN CHILUKKI 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The NFL's newest owner had to sweat out
thoroughbred racing's version of an instant-replay review Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Bob McNair, watching the $200,000 Oak Leaf Stakes on
TV at his Kentucky farm, watched his 2-year-old filly Chilukki
remain unbeaten in six starts, but only after Santa Anita stewards
held an inquiry into her swerving stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   They ran back the videotape and quickly let stand the 1\-length
victory by Chilukki and jockey David Flores, dismissing as
``minor'' the incident in which she forced runner-up Abby Girl and
Chris McCarron to alter course about 100 yards from the wire.
</P>
<P>
   And so Bob Baffert-trained Chilukki passed her first test beyond
the sprint distances, hanging back in third before powering to a
1:36.12 clocking, more than a second faster than either previous
running of the Oak Leaf at 1 mile. The daughter of Cherokee Run
will be favored in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Gulfstream
Park near Miami on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she convinced a lot of people,'' said John Adger,
racing manager of McNair's Stonerside Stable, which has raced
notables Touch Gold and Strodes Creek in partnerships. ``It's
unbelievable to have an undefeated horse going into the Breeders'
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Chilukki's sudden drift toward the rail wasn't a
sign of fatigue, which would have been a reason for worry going
into the 1 1/16-mile Breeders' Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's never really gotten in a fight before,'' Baffert said of
the filly who has won five stakes by an average of 3{ lengths and
paid $3 Saturday while attracting $316,181 of the $348,875 show
pool. ``When she made the lead, you could tell she kind of shut it
down and drifted in.''
</P>
<P>
   Abby Girl's jockey, Chris McCarron, and assistant trainer, Nick
Hines, exchanged a high-five after their second-place finish, which
shows you nobody had much hope of beating Chilukki. Spain was a
distant third in the five-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   The fullest weekend of Breeders' Cup prep races started badly
for Baffert. He watched on TV as Joe Who and Chris Antley fell to
the soggy turf in traffic while Bobby Frankel-trained Kirkwall and
Victor Espinoza paid $52 in the Shadwell Keeneland Turf Mile in
Kentucky. Neither the horse nor the rider was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Antley then guided Baffert's filly Tout Charmant to an
encouraging second to Perfect Sting ($5.20) and Pat Day in the
Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's Forest Camp goes into today's Norfolk Stakes with a
chance to take over as the Breeders' Cup Juvenile favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, leading East Coast 2-year-old More Than Ready ran a
quitting fifth in the 1 1/16-mile Champagne Stakes at Belmont as
Greenwood Lake swept from 16 lengths back in last to tag
front-running Chief Seattle. The $15.60 winner, a son of
Meadowlake, was ridden by Jean-Luc Samyn for trainer Nick Zito.
</P>
<P>
   It was More Than Ready's second defeat after five straight
sprint victories.
</P>
<P>
   Later at Belmont, Val's Prince won the 1{-mile Turf Classic for
the second time in three years and will aim to improve on his
eighth-place finish behind Chief Bearhart in the 1997 Breeders' Cup
Turf at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year-old gelding trained by Jim Bond went over $2 million
in earnings and paid $8.10. He and Jorge Chavez tracked a slow
pace, went past Kentucky Cup Turf winner Fahris in the stretch, and
held off Dream Well in the 1997 French and Irish derby champion's
U.S. debut.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Isle de France and Russell Baze won Bay Meadows'
Hillsborough Handicap for Santa Anita-based trainer Ron McAnally. .
. . Son of a Pistol and Garrett Gomez ran second to Silver Season
in the Smile Sprint at Calder. . . . Santa Anita owner Frank
Stronach's Golden Missile came up a nose short of winner Supreme
Sound in the Hawthorne Gold Cup in Illinois. . . . Jockeys and

KNICKS WANT TO KNOW WHY SPREWELL WAS MISSING LAST WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Latrell Sprewell could use a good icebreaker
to cut the tension bound to fill the room when the Knicks' coach,
Jeff Van Gundy, and general manager, Scott Layden, meet with him on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They will want to know why Sprewell went days without contacting
the team and missed all of training camp, which broke up at the
College of Charleston Saturday without him. Sprewell was in
Westchester County, where he arrived Friday after what people close
to him say was a three- to four-day cross-country road trip from
Oakland, Calif., to his hometown of Milwaukee to the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what has happened,'' Van Gundy said Saturday.
``After we speak, everyone will have a better understanding. There
haven't been any whys given to me. I'm just going to take the
meeting and listen, say what I have to say, and hopefully we'll be
able to move on and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not wondering about anything. I'm just waiting more than
wondering. I'm waiting to hear what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Sprewell says that he had a personal matter to take care
of, or that he needed to clear his head after his trial in a civil
suit in California, or that he needed to get his affairs in order
before the season, the team would be hard-pressed to lift its
disciplinary action against him _ fining him for missed practices _
because he failed to communicate his plans with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he was missing. From Wednesday afternoon until Friday
afternoon, the team had no contact with Sprewell or his agent,
Robert Gist. Still, the only person the Knicks had talked to was
Gist, who on Friday afternoon finally returned one of numerous
messages left for him by Layden. Gist helped arrange the meeting on
Sunday that will include Layden, Van Gundy and Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   No one had spoken directly to Sprewell yet, not even his closet
friends on the team. All anyone knew was that he checked into the
hotel that he lived in last year on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen or heard from him, but he'll be in New York
when we get there,'' Marcus Camby said. ``We're really looking
forward to having him back. It's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   His absence from the team could be costly. After Sprewell was
excused from practice on Monday and Tuesday because of the civil
suit, the team began to fine him for each unexcused practice. While
Sprewell was apparently traveling the highways of America, he was
racking up fines that could amount to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone already knows what's expected,'' Van Gundy said.
``It's not like he didn't know he was supposed to come to training
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the player who had done so much image repair last year
_ following his return to the league after he was suspended for
choking Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo in December 1997 _ was
being seen as unprofessional and insubordinate. It's uncertain how
much good will Sprewell undermined with his behavior last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably defer that question until I get more
information,'' Layden said. ``But these matters don't help you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the team has to think carefully about its
desire to sign Sprewell to a contract extension _ which could be as
high as $70 million _ before the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Sprewell's image, the team was hurt. Over the six-day
camp, the Knicks had nine practice sessions without one of its
biggest stars. It was difficult enough without the injured Patrick
Ewing, but Sprewell's absence left a large hole in the team's
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, there's no doubt,'' Van Gundy said. ``Obviously
there's enough time, but you're not going to be as good as if you
have the whole time for the schedule we're facing to start the
year. It's definitely not what we would have liked considering
injuries and Latrell's absence.''
</P>
<P>
   What was behind the disappearance? That's what the Knicks intend
to find out in Sunday's meeting. Was his lack of communication
unavoidable? Or does he have a lack of commitment to the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one who can answer that question,'' Ewing said.

AND EVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Hal Holbrook's por trayal of writer Mark Twain is so
believable that a Twain scholar once mistakenly published a paper
using the actor's photograph instead of the writer's.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was embarrassing for the scholar, says an editor with the
Mark Twain Project at the University of Califor nia at Berkeley,
but understandable. As Mark Twain`s reincarnation, Hol brook stands
head and shoulders above all comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys who do this are not concerned with authenticity,''
says Robert Hirst, a general editor with the project whose
unfathomable mis sion is to publish all of Twain's writings.
``They're taking advantage of Mark Twain's appeal. They don't
hesitate to do things which are not genuinely what Mark Twain
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook, on the other hand, does not simply impersonate the
19th-cen tury sage. He becomes him.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1954 when Holbrook first became Twain, or Samuel L. Clem
ens, with his original one-man show at Lock Haven State Teachers
Col lege in Pennsylvania. When he pres ents Mark Twain Tonight on
Oct. 16 at Arizona State University's Gam mage Auditorium, he will
be ap proaching his 2,000th performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's around 19-hundred-some thing,'' the actor says from his
office in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 years of portraying the great American humorist,
Holbrook must certainly be weary of the role.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, he says. Constantly revising and rewriting his
material, which he gleans himself from the volumes that Twain
produced, Hol brook keeps his monologue fresh, year after year. In
fact, he's actually enjoying the work now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twain's material seems to be more pertinent and on the nose
than ever before,'' Holbrook says, inspired that a man dead for a
century could have such insights into contemporary soci ety. ``So
much going on in the world today taps into what Twain was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The author talks of the quest for power and greed, of the
corruption of politicians, the idiosyncrasies of the human race.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook reads off one bon mot that sounds decidedly 20th
century:
</P>
<P>
   ``(We must) get rich. Dishonestly if we can, honestly if we
must.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook, possibly the leading Twain authority outside academia,
cobbles his material from all of Twain's writings: the letters
(Twain was an inveterate correspondent), his essays, his
autobiographical material and his famous fiction _ The Adventures
of Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a quote from here, a quote from there . . . I move them
around like chess pieces,'' Holbrook says. ``Sometimes, they have a
life of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   New material surfaces all the time. A Nevada archivist recently
discovered an 1868 newspaper account of one of that state's first
public hangings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that stiff, straight corpse hanging there yet,'' the
newspaper reporter wrote, according to a Sep tember 1999 Associated
Press article, ``with its black pillow-cased head turned rigidly to
one side, and the purple streaks creeping through the hands and
driving the fleshy hue of life before them. Ugh!''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter: Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook is not surprised that one more historic nugget has
turned up, well aware that Twain writings are a seemingly
bottomless trove of litera ture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much material,'' he says, material that supplies a
diligent actor with a lifetime of scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this thing feeds you and drains you, you're submerged
_ you involve yourself from A to Z. It becomes an obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   For Holbrook, Mark Twain is a magnificent obsession. At age 74,
he's finding fewer film and TV roles for men his age. But he's
grown into the Twain persona. And with Hol brook as his own writer,
director and star, Mark Twain Tonight has be come a portable
career, his bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the venerable actor, who has won five Emmy awards (and
has an additional seven Emmy nomina tions), a Tony, an Obie
(off-Broad way) and a Peabody award, has more on his plate than
bread and butter. He is currently filming a movie in Portland,
Ore., that co-stars Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1952, it is the story of the first Black man to break
into the ex clusive club of Navy divers. Hol brook plays a
commandant in the diving school who is determined to keep the man
out. DeNiro, Holbrook says, plays a ``tough-drill-sergeant type''
trying to flunk him.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding plays the man, Carl Breash ear, who often visits the
movie set.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook's stature in Hollywood is unquestionable. But don't
look for his name to appear alongside Warren Beatty's and Cybill
Shepherd's on some presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, no,'' he snorts, calling the current spate of actors and
other celebrities considering a run for high office ``a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Holbrook doesn't have opinions about the state of
modern American society. Sounding rather crusty, he launches into a
polemic worthy of his alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   On politics: ``We're living in a world so corrupted. . . .
Presidents run the country by the polls. . . . What are we
electing, a man or a mouse?''
</P>
<P>
   On Hollywood: ``Too much sex, pornography and foul language. . .
. If our behavior is based on animals, where are we headed?''
</P>
<P>
   On someday returning to series television: ``You have to make a
living. I happen to be an actor. But this field is dealing in stuff
I don't like. It's a problem for me.''
</P>
<P>
   On society in general: `'We have totally failed in our
responsibility not only to our children but to our country. We
deserve to be swacked good.''
</P>
<P>
   You can almost picture him in a white suit and fluffy white
coif, knuckling a fat cigar. Where does the writer end and the
actor begin?
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call him cynical. Can't abide the word. Euphemism for
speaking the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And don't start in on the contro versy over Tom Sawyer or Huckle
berry Finn. Told that a school in Mesa recently banned a
performance of Tom Sawyer the play, Holbrook allows that Twain is
often dogged by censorship, usually regarding the tale of Huck
Finn, a vagabond boy beaten by a racist father before he runs away
and befriends escaped slave Jim.
</P>
<P>
   Huckleberry Finn ``is about racism,'' Holbrook says. ``You'd
have to be some kind of moron to believe it's racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook is not always in a pique about the state of the world.
His own five children, including two stepchildren by actress Dixie
Carter, his third wife, have turned out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of them,'' he says, although he takes little credit
for their successes.
</P>
<P>
   He sees them _ and his one grandchild _ often.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook and Carter likewise in tersect as often as possible,
between his Twain performances, stage and film roles that keep him
on the road half of the year, and her double duty in two new TV
series, Family Law and Ladies Man.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is kept hopping by the two roles, he says, but ``you want
to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, of course, had some thing to say about making a
living:
</P>
<P>
   ```Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. Play
consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping the Holbrooks have time for both. &QL;

MONTANA ROUTS NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ Linebacker Brennen Swanson shook his head,
then looked down at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know what happened. But he knew. It just
wasn't something he wanted to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Cal State Northridge has the worst defense in the
Big Sky Conference. That stat doesn't lie.
</P>
<P>
   Not when the Matadors could barely stop Montana in a 48-27
conference loss Saturday afternoon in front of 18,874 at
Washington-Grizzly Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' said Swanson, a candidate for the
Buchanan Award, given annually to Division I-AA's top defensive
player. ``We just didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' could have been any number of things, like crisp
tackling, or making big plays, or putting any kind of fear into the
Grizzlies and record-setting junior quarterback Drew Miller, who
had an easy time finding open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller picked CSUN apart, completing 25 of 37 passes for 404
yards and four touchdowns. Many of his completions were to
receivers who didn't have a Matadors defender within 2 or 3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their receivers were wide open,'' said Jeff Kearin, CSUN's
interim head coach. ``Our pass defense is in real trouble right
now. It's approaching a complete breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, who doubles as CSUN's offensive coordinator, said he
trusts defensive coordinator Foster Andersen, who has more than 30
years of college coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Miller work over the secondary, though, Kearin
knows something needs to be done. CSUN is playing a lot of zone
coverage, and it is getting burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't know if man-to-man is the answer,''
Kearin said. ``I defer to (the defensive coaches') better judgment.
Those are good kids, they're getting there, but we're playing some
good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana, which improved to 3-1 in the Big Sky and moved into a
first-place tie with Portland State for the conference lead, had
540 yards of offense, which is actually about 30 yards under the
Grizzles' per-game average.
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN (2-3, 1-2) entered this game with better team speed,
more athleticism and a psychological advantage coming from last
year's 21-7 upset of the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Montana didn't score until the third quarter last year. The
Grizzlies, ranked No. 8 in Division I-AA, needed only three plays
to go 73 yards and get the game's first touchdown on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies' first play was a 44-yard completion to Jimmy
Farris. Two plays later, Miller found tailback Yo Humphrey open and
Humphrey went in from 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Montana's scoring drives went just like that: 71 yards,
six plays; 53 yards, four plays; 67 yards, six plays, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore linebacker Cos Abercrombie, who had only four tackles,
said he's unsure of what adjustments are being made in the CSUN
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what's going on back there sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a transfer from BYU who has nine touchdown passes in his
last two games, credited his receivers instead of blaming
Northridge's defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were wide open because they were running the right
routes,'' he said. ``Everybody was doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller may get the Payton Award as the best player in Division
I-AA. Marcus Brady, CSUN's sophomore quarterback who may be a
leading contender for the award next year, didn't fare as well
Saturday, completing just 51 percent (26 of 51) of his passes for
282 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brady showed good mobility, but not when he was sacked on
fourth-and-13 on Montana's 35-yard line midway through the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-yard loss shifted momentum, got the noisy home crowd back
into the game, and the Grizzlies went on to score a touchdown on
their ensuing possession to take a 24-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take the blame for that,'' said Brady, who was
sacked five times. ``Fourth down, I should have thrown the ball
away. It was a big momentum change.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN still has a slim chance at the conference title; Montana
won it last year with two losses. But the Matadors play Sacramento
State this week, and the Hornets upset Portland State 41-14
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not hanging our heads on the season,'' said CSUN
tailback Jaumal Bradley, who had a career-high 116 yards. ``We're
not down on ourselves. Keep your eye on Northridge.''

NORTHRIDGE'S ARNOLD OUT 3-4 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ This was the dreaded worst-case scenario for
the Cal State Northridge football team.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Montana beat CSUN by three touchdowns, but the
Matadors lost top receiver Aaron Arnold in the fourth quarter when
Arnold separated his right shoulder on a 20-yard completion at the
Grizzlies' 2.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a senior who entered the game leading Division I-AA in
receptions per game, is expected to be out three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's worse, this loss or losing him,'' CSUN
interim head coach Jeff Kearin said of Arnold, the school's
all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards and receiving
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   After the Matadors' 48-27 loss, Arnold walked off the
Washington-Grizzly Stadium field with his right arm in a sling.
Statistically, he had his worst game of the season, with four
catches for 75 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Amerson and Terrence Jones, who are second and third,
respectively, on the team in receptions, combined for nine catches
and 96 yards Saturday. Neither scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got three `favorite' receivers,'' CSUN quarterback Marcus
Brady said. ``I've got 100 percent confidence in Drew and I've got
100 percent confidence in Terrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Slip-sliding away: Most of the game was played under a constant
rain, which made the footing precarious. Brady slipped a few times
and so did CSUN tailback Jaumal Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the rain played much of an issue,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Montana head coach Mick Dennehy, who said the Matadors are
the most athletic team in the Big Sky Conference, didn't complain
about the slick grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Mother Nature,'' Dennehy said. ``I love her to death.
At least I can't be accused of watering down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   No revenge: CSUN lost for the third time in four games all-time
against Montana, but until Saturday the series had been close, with
the Matadors outscoring the Matadors 71-70 in those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN beat Montana 21-7 last year, holding the Grizzlies to their
lowest point total in 78 games. But Montana had to play backup
quarterback Sean Davis, who was 17 of 33 for 172 yards in his only
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's game was not a factor going into this year's
game,'' Dennehy said. ``We didn't go down with a magnum, we went
down with a popgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark it down: Joe Gilliam, a freshman receiver, scored his first
touchdown as a Matador early in the fourth quarter. Gilliam's
11-yard score was the highlight of his three-catch, 27-yard day.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam entered the game with just four catches in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Making the call: Scott Himelstein, a Chaminade High graduate,
made his debut as the play-by-play announcer for KCSN, the
Matadors' flagship station. &QL;

BRODEUR DOESN ' T GET MUCH WORK AS DEVILS SHUT DOWN LIGHTNING, 1-0
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After allowing seven goals two nights
ago in their home opener, the Devils tightened up on defense
Saturday night and all they needed offensively was a goal by Brian
Rolston for a 1-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur faced only 14 shots to earn his first shutout of
the season and the 37th of his career. It came against a Tampa Bay
team that showed little coordination on attack, especially in the
first two periods, when the Devils took 28 of their 32 shots in the
game before a crowd of 13,982.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, now 2-1-0, were dominant in the first two periods,
limiting the visitors to just seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's most crucial moments came in the second half of the
third period, first during a penalty to Vadim Sharifijinavov midway
through the period, and then during a double-minor to Krzysztof
Oliwa for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning's best scoring chance came with just three minutes
left in the game and Tampa Bay on the power play. Chris Gratton hit
a hard shot from the blue line that handcuffed Brodeur, but he
recovered quickly to knock aside the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   None of the shots seemed to cause any concern for Brodeur, who
escaped suspension by the league for a blatant slash on
Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby on Thursday night in the 7-5 loss to
the Penguins in the home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur said there was no justification for a suspension because
his slash behind Barnaby's knees was not intended to injure and
Barnaby came back and played just minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get chills when you do something bad and I didn't feel any
of that,'' Brodeur said of the first period incident against
Barnaby that resulted in the first ejection of his career. ``It was
more of a check-swing than anything. There was no intention to
injure there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur is one of the critics of the league's new rule that
allows players to make contact with the goaltenders. He said
goaltenders must take action to protect themselves and he took his
first such action in the season opener in Atlanta when he was
assessed a double-minor for roughing Chris Ferraro of the Thrashers
late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the Devils had plenty of opportunities for a
goal in the first 40 minutes against the Lightning, but their only
score was 7 minutes 6 seconds into the middle period, when Rolston
leaped on a rebound from a shot by Petr Sykora and beat Dan
Cloutier from his left.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second goal in as many games for Rolston, who was
moved onto the team's premier line two nights ago as the left wing
with Jason Arnott his center and Sykora his right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston was a key player on the team's checking line the last
two seasons, but he is one of two or three players on the Devils
who have a chance to reach the 30-goal plateau, something no one on
the Devils has accomplished since 1994. His goal Friday night was
the only one the Devils needed for their first victory at home.

GIVING `VOICE' TO HER PAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BARBARA YOST 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  PHOENIX - As her befuddled driver
raced through the streets of Balti more, radio talk show host Diane
Rehm feared she would be late for her first book signing. The
driver was lost.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I was going crazy!'' Rehm says by telephone in that familiar
lilting voice tinged with just the touch of a quaver.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she did arrive at the Bibelot bookstore half an hour
late, only to be greeted by an overwhelming assembly of 300 patient
fans clutch ing copies of her new autobiography, Finding My Voice.
Despite her cha grin at having kept the crowd waiting, her spirits
were instantly lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you it was exciting,'' she says from yet another
stop on her current book tour, this time in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``This
is the fun part of it. . . . You get a chance to get out there and
meet the people listening to the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a heady experience for the little Arab-American girl from
Wash ington, D.C., child of immigrants from Turkey who physically
abused their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, she began volunteering at a Washington public radio
station and six years later took over the talk show she was helping
to produce. She now commands the broadcast booth of the Diane Rehm
Show, which went into national syndication in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The story Rehm tells in Finding My Voice is one of her troubled
child hood, a first marriage that ended when she was 21, a second
marriage to her beloved John ``Scoop'' Rehm, the birth of their two
children, voice problems that periodically banish her from the air
and, finally, content ment with who she was and what she has
become.
</P>
<P>
   She tells it all in a frank memoir that has alienated her from
members of her extended family, but that will satisfy her legions
of listeners.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, Rehm will appear at Changing Hands Bookstore at 6428
S. McClintock Drive, in Tempe, at 11 a.m., and then at Borders
Books &AMP; Music, 2402 E. Camelback Road, in Phoenix, at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Baltimore, her followers will make the pilgrimage to
see a guru most have only heard, worship ing at the altar of a talk
show host known for her on-air decorum when others fire canons at
guests and listeners alike.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Rehm might still be the good little girl trying to
escape Mother's wrath by being on her best behavior. But that
leaves the air waves with one less loudmouth to feed, and it has
earned Rehm acclaim and a place in 60 U.S. radio markets.
</P>
<P>
   If Rehm prides herself on the roster of celebrities she has
interviewed on her show _ Henry Kissinger, Carl Sagan, Gen. Colin
Powell, Hillary Clinton, Lauren Bacall, Maya Ange lou _ she is just
as delighted with the people who have recently inter viewed her.
</P>
<P>
   Early in September, she was the guest at the National Press Club
for an onstage interview by Nightline host Ted Koppel.
</P>
<P>
   Linton Weeks of the Washington Post profiled her and her book in
August, causing tremors in the Aed family as many of her relatives
learned for the first time she was spilling the family beans.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, her 63rd birthday, she was the guest of honor at a
Washing ton, D.C., gala celebrating her two decades on the air.
</P>
<P>
   But, no doubt surprising to many of her listeners, Rehm's life
has not been as easy as it might seem. Revealing that truth and a
desire to step down from her pedestal moti vated her to write her
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a huge sense of relief,'' she says, ``a huge sense of
having told the truth about what my life was . . . changing
people's perception of who I was and where I came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehm came from darkness. Her parents immigrated to the United
States in 1929, after her father, Wadie Aed, persuaded her mother,
Eugenie Zouekie, to break her en gagement to a man she loved and
move to America, leaving her family behind.
</P>
<P>
   Did that sacrifice leave the young woman embittered and abusive?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' is the only answer Rehm can offer, still baffled
by her mother's behavior after years of counseling that has allowed
her to move past the memories.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eugenie whose temper would flare at a moment's notice. As
children, Rehm and her sister, Geor gette, tried their best to
avoid confrontation that would trigger an outburst. Though Rehm
does re count happy times, devastating inci dents still haunt her,
the times when she displeased Eugenie and suffered the cruel
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful child, strikingly blond in an Arab family
characterized by dark good looks, little Diane at tracted the
attention of a prominent congressman who promised to make her a
movie star. It seemed the American dream. The dream died when,
instead of sending her on her way to Hollywood, the man hustled her
into his hotel room and molested her.
</P>
<P>
   Rehm confessed to her parents, who were outraged. Because that
was a time when accusing a respected member of Congress of such un
speakable crimes was unheard of, her abuser was never punished.
Still disturbed by the event, Rehm will not even say whether he's
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so scary for me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, she learned her mother was dying of cirrhosis of the
liver, be lieved to be the result of an old bout with malaria. Two
years later, Rehm became engaged to George Hamaty, an acquaintance
from Arab social circles who was eight years her senior. They
planned to marry in January of 1956, but moved up the date four
months as her mother's condition deteriorated, fearing she would
not live until the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   And then Mother was gone, dying the next New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the hospital too late, Rehm agonized at having no
chance to say goodbye. Guilt over her mother's death dogged her for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was my fault,'' she says. ``I thought if I had
only been a better child, if I had done more, she would not have
died.''
</P>
<P>
   In November that year, her father died of a heart attack. Rehm
strug gled to get past her grief, to be a good wife in a
traditional Christian Orthodox home. But a chasm was growing
between the man who ex pected his wife to be subservient and a
young woman who wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce in the Arab community was unthinkable, but by 1959, Rehm
was on her own, feeling an unfamiliar and heady sense of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   While working at the Department of State, she met boisterous
young lawyer John Rehm, born in Paris to American parents. As they
began to date, John introduced her to art, to music, to fine
cuisine. They were married in December 1959.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a sometimes rocky union, Rehm reveals, hitting a
particular bump in the road when she began working at WAMU. Still,
she charac terizes John Rehm as ``wonderful, a very loving man,''
and dedicated Finding My Voice to her ``lover, teacher, and,
finally, best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's title has many layers of meaning. Its most obvious is
a reference to the battle Rehm has waged over the past few years
with a vocal-cord disorder called spasmodic dysphonia, which
periodically leaves her voice with a marked quiver and spells of
dysfunction that require injections of medication.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering for years with voice problems, which went
undiagnosed except for explanations ranging from stress to improper
breathing, she was correctly diagnosed just after decid ing to
write her book, a task she had long avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Literary agent Ron Goldfarb had been nagging her for years to
tell her story. Her medical problems conven iently supplied not
only the title of her book, but its final chapters as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever would have written the book if I hadn't
been pushed,'' Rehm says. ``I kept saying I didn't have anything to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   But as her 20th on-air anniversary approached, she decided
``maybe the time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the frankness of her story might surprise some readers,
Rehm felt obligated to share even the most painful moments of her
childhood as well as those in her current marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started writing, I couldn't write the book and not tell
the whole story,'' she says. ``That wouldn't have been an honest
book.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare her relatives for the laundry she was about to air,
she broached the secret of her mother's abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brushed me off,'' she says, until the Post story became
her pre-publication Laundromat, anger ing and possibly alienating
many family members.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Rehm's sister denied the abuse. Though she
finally ac knowledged the reality of their child hood, she asked to
be left out of the book. Rehm compromised with only brief
references to Georgette.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was John Rehm. How would he react to the candor
with which his wife discusses the flaws in their 40-year marriage?
</P>
<P>
   Before submitting her manuscript, Diane asked him to read it,
promis ing, ``If there is one word you don't want in the book, I'll
take it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He changed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Now on a whirlwind book tour that has her out of town several
days, then back in town for non-stop local events, Rehm is pleased
with Finding My Voice and the warm receptions she has had.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she has rescued many fellow sufferers of spasmodic
dys phonia from their despair. Her hus band and children have
expressed pride in her accomplishments. And through therapy, she is
silencing the demons of her past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she now deserves that spot on a pedestal for her
inspiring story. Rehm has found not only her voice but her purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want people to get from the book,'' she says, ``is that
whatever challenges you face, if you keep putting one foot in front
of the other, you can get through it.''

MCCAIN DUPES THE DOPES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Among news junkies, the most dangerously addictive nar
cotic is something we call the ``exclu sive.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to get a reporter hooked, to alter his view of
reality, just promise him a story no one else has. I've seen it
happen lots of times, perhaps because the most successful
``exclusive'' dealer in the country operates right here in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   His name is U.S. Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's running for president, the senator has been
peddling his mind-altering material to dopes all over the nation.
The lastest media type to get strung out on a McCain ``exclusive''
is television's Jane Pau ley. &QL; 
`Candid interview'
</P>
<P>
   Tonight (Oct. 10) on Dateline NBC, in what the network describes
as ``a remarkably candid interview,`` Mc Cain and his wife, Cindy,
speak with Pauley about Cindy McCain's for mer addiction to
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are coming forward now, according to an Associated
Press report, ``rather than wait for (Mc Cain's) political
opponents to bring it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? It worked five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after a string of health problems, Cindy
McCain got hooked on the painkillers Percoset and Vicodin. She not
only had different doctors writing prescrip tions, but she stole
pills from the American Voluntary Medical Team, a charitable group
she headed.
</P>
<P>
   An employee fired from the team filed a lawsuit claiming Cindy
had ordered him to conceal ``improper acts.'' He tipped off the
Drug Enforcement Administration, which began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the McCains knew the story was about to go public,
the senator rounded up a few friendly reporters and offered them an
``ex clusive'' interview with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   One of the writers described the discussion in NBC-like terms as
``a candid, and often difficult, inter view.'' &QL; 
Facts downplayed
</P>
<P>
   The part about stealing from the medical team, which cared for
sick people in Third World countries, wasn't mentioned until the
16th paragraph, and was described as Cindy having ``dipped into
supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial articles also didn't report the interviews were granted
only after the McCains had worked out a deal with the U.S.
Attorney's Office that kept Cindy from being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter from The Republic tried to ask Cindy McCain
about what actually happened, her attorney answered, ``She has no
comment. You're not going to talk to Cindy. You're not going to
talk to me. You're not going to talk to anybody associated with us.
Have you got the message?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he hung up.
</P>
<P>
   In their interview with Dateline, the senator says of his wife's
problem, ``To this day, I feel partially respon sible . . . and
maybe I was wrapped up too much in Washington and my ambitions to
pay as much attention as I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   He began paying attention after Cindy's problem started
interfering with those ambitions, however.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's paying attention again, but not because his
opponents may try to use her troubles against him.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Any Republican presidential candi date who dared to criticize a
woman who, five years ago, bravely over came a potentially deadly
addiction would be committing political sui cide.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one person in America who could use Cindy's
addiction for his own benefit, and that's McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Already he's confessed indiscretions in his first marriage and
mistakes in the ``Keating Five'' scandals. Mc Cain says he's
learned from these crises and is a better man for it. And, once he
brings up these problems, no one else can use them against him.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest ``exclusive,'' McCain gets to play the
sympathetic hus band. In this age of the political confession, when
every negative from the past can be turned into a positive, Cindy
is a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   A husband hellbent on shoving his way to the front of the
presidential line has no problem shoving his wife to the back,
behind Betty Ford and Kitty Dukakis. &QL;

CRIME RING WITNESSES BEING KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - One by one, potential witnesses against a Phoenix area
crime syndicate have been shot down, derailing years of undercover
work and squelching an indictment against the suspected
ringleaders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least four men are dead, including a key witness who survived
one hit attempt only to be gunned down again after he moved out of
state.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, the homicide victims all were
associates of Luis A. and Felipe ``Porky'' Cisneros, both of whom
have served prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the killings were committed before the Cisneros
brothers were to stand trial last year on 14 felony charges
involving fraudulent schemes, possession of stolen prop erty and
operating a chop shop.
</P>
<P>
   The latest killing too place three weeks ago. The victim was a
Cisne ros associate who was being pressed to cooperate with police
and prose cutors. Damien Shawn Semus, 20, of Queen Creek, was found
in an east Mesa wash with bullet wounds in his face and chest.
</P>
<P>
   Luis and Felipe Cisneros, 29 and 25 respectively, are not
charged in con nection with the homicides or with any other crime.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Bullock, Semus' mother, said he was under pressure from
authori ties to turn against the Cisneros brothers. Her stepson,
Shawn R. Bullock, 22, was murdered under similar circumstances 14
months ear lier. Both young men were drug dealers with criminal
records.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping as she spoke, Amber Bull ock blamed the Department of
Pub lic Safety and Attorney General's Office for failing to protect
her sons. She noted that the Cisneroses were not jailed even after
a metham phetamine lab and stolen vehicles were found at their auto
body shop during a raid in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't understand why the hell they're walking
around,'' she said. ``Did you see all the stuff they (DPS) got from
them? Isn't that enough to put them somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (prosecutors and police) can't take care of it, I'll
take care of it. . . . I only have one son left, and I don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Cisneros said, ``This is crazy already. Anything that
happens, we get blamed for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He then referred inquiries to attor ney Alan Simpson, who
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors refused to talk about the slayings, related
investigations, or whether they failed to protect in formers and
prospective witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officials warned that publicity about the case might
endanger law-enforcement officers and others. They also expressed
fear that any prospective witnesses who remain might become too
terrified to speak with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Cisneroses were indicted with several other suspects in
1997. Most police reports and court documents in the case have been
sealed. How ever, available records describe a conspiracy involving
drug sales and falsified vehicle identification num bers. &QL; 
String of deaths begin in 1996
</P>
<P>
   The string of murders began while the Cisneroses were under
investiga tion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In November of that year, authorities seized a stolen pickup
truck from Shawn Bullock. According to court records, the vehicle
was acquired through a Cisneros intermediary named Aaron ``Guerro''
Romero, 26, of Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who was on probation for theft at the time, spoke with
Romero about the stolen truck, then listened as Romero called
someone to discuss the problem. Bullock gave Romero a business card
listing the name and phone number of his ``case agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Romero's bullet-rid dled corpse lay outside the
Cisne roses' Mesa auto body shop.
</P>
<P>
   According to a property forfeiture motion filed by the U.S.
Attorney's Office, Bullock told a government informer that ``Luis
Cisneros had Guerro killed, and that he also wanted to kill
Bullock.''
</P>
<P>
   The next homicide victim was listed by prosecutors as Axel
Samoyoa, the state's ``major civilian witness'' in the Cisneros
case.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 17, 1996, Samoyoa was wounded five times at a Phoenix
auto repair business, with bullets from the same gun that killed
Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surviving but fearful, Mr. Samoyoa was moved out of state,''
court records state. ``He had submitted to two days of a three-day
(interview with Cisneros defense lawyers). Hours before the
scheduled resump tion of the interview, Mr. Samoyoa was shot
numerous times in his car and killed.''
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive search turned up no public record on anyone named
``Axel Samoyoa.'' DPS investigators said the name is a pseudonym,
but declined to provide other informa tion. &QL; 
Car found, butbody never shows up
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bullock also was being urged by investigators to turn
against the Cisneros brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, days after Bullock received a government subpoena
to testify, his new Cadillac DeVille was found with the interior
spattered with brain matter.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Bullock appeared to be a successful young
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   He owned a luxury car and a $212,000 house in Val Vista Lakes, a
posh Gilbert community. Shortly before his death, he owned a
Harley-Davidson ``Fat Boy'' motorcycle and a 28-foot boat.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a life for someone who left Red Mountain High
School without a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Bullock made his money as an auto trader. But court
records say he and Semus, his stepbrother, were leaders in the
Cisneros organi zation.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, 1997, DPS investigators searched a Mesa pawnshop
owned by Bullock and Semus, as well as their homes and the
residences of two associates. Those raids netted weapons, cash,
narcotics ledgers, 3 pounds of methamphetamine, 24 ounces of
cocaine and 40 pounds of pot.
</P>
<P>
   Both men had been arrested before, and Bullock apparently hated
his stay behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   While serving nights in jail earlier during 1997, he wrote to
the court begging for probationary release and promising to clean
up his act. He claimed he had a scholarship to attend Mesa
Community College and was working 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleading with you to take a little time and see how far I
have really come,'' Bullock's letter to the judge says. ``Your
Honor, I will not even spit on the sidewalk wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say that on the night of July 21, 1998, Bullock told a
roommate he was going on an errand. A few hours later, his black
Caddy was found on East Atlanta Street, in south Phoenix, with the
passenger window missing and nothing inside except body fluids.
</P>
<P>
   DNA records confirmed the victim's identity, but coroners have
not issued a death certificate because they have no body. Family
members never held a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide investigators aren't sure what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those situations where we don't have a
body,'' Phoenix police Detective Randy Chapman said. ``There's a
cloud of mystery around his lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of 1998, the case was ruled a homicide. A
police report, which is otherwise heavily edited, lists this name
under ``suspect information'': Cisneros, Luis An thony. &QL; 
Case dismissed by prosecution
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Bullock's death, Assistant Attorney General
Warren Granville asked a Maricopa County Superior Court judge to
drop all criminal complaints against the Cis neroses because
charges ``can no longer be sustained in light of the murder of
three of the state's wit nesses.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the killings has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Granville would not disclose infor mation about Samoyoa's
homicide, whether he was a protected witness, or whether other
homicide victims were under surveillance when they were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Search warrants and lab tests are sealed by court order. The
Depart ment of Public Safety refused to release its records. But
DPS investi gators and the U.S. Attorney's Office stressed that
none of the homicide victims was a protected witness.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local authorities have repeatedly scrutinized
the Cis neros brothers, with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Corrections, Luis was convicted
of manslaughter in the 1990 gunshot slaying of a Glendale man. He
served three years of a five-year sentence. Felipe served five
months in prison for a 1993 theft.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, however, the brothers benefited from police
errors, good lawyers and witness deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, Chandler police raided Luis Cisneros' home
and found a cache of weapons, including a semiautomatic rifle with
a 100-round magazine, and a .50-cal iber pistol with slugs the
diameter of a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Although officers had a search war rant, they pried open a
screen door before announcing themselves to the occupants. As a
result, a judge threw out all charges. &QL; 
The lawyer defends his clients
</P>
<P>
   That court victory was obtained by Simpson, Luis Cisneros'
defense law yer for years.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson also represented Shawn Bullock, the potential witness
against Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's stepmother said she be lieves Simpson had a conflict
of interest. In an interview, Simpson insisted there was no
conflict because Shawn Bullock never agreed to testify against the
Cisneros brothers. If Bullock was being ``flipped'' by prosecutors,
Simpson added, ``they were certainly not doing it through me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Simpson argued in court papers that the unsolved
murders should not be attributed to his clients: ``No inference
should be drawn that Luis Cisneros or Felipe Cisneros bears any
responsibility for these homicides.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Romero was friends with the Cisneroses, so it's
``prepos terous'' to think they would take his life. Besides, he
said, Mesa police suspect the murder was committed by Carlos
Santillan, another man with a record for narcotics posses sion and
auto theft. Santillan was killed in a vehicle accident two years
ago. (Mesa police have not released records from the Romero
homicide.)
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Samoyoa was purport edly a confidential informer
for federal agents in unrelated cases, which means others had
motives to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he noted that Bullock was involved with large-scale
drug traf ficking, which might explain his assassination by parties
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not view my client to be a danger,'' Simpson said of Luis
Cisne ros. ``He has a wonderful family.''
</P>
<P>
   Granville, the prosecutor, declined to comment on Simpson's
comments or any continuing investigations. &QL; 
More raids at auto shop, homes
</P>
<P>
   But court records suggest the saga is not over.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, 1999, DPS investiga tors went after the Cisneros
brothers again. SWAT-style teams with search warrants raided their
Mesa auto shop, their homes and four other locations associated
with them.
</P>
<P>
   At the South Robson Street business, detectives found a ``huge''
metham phetamine lab, according to court records. They also seized
about $22,000 in cash, more than 20 allegedly stolen vehicles and
at least a dozen firearms, including a Tech 9 semiautomatic with 35
rounds in the magazine. In addition, they confis cated Bullock's
motorcycle and boat, which Luis Cisneros had obtained from him.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, investigators searched the Queen Creek home of
Damien Semus, who was awaiting trial on charges of aggravated as
sault, narcotics possession, arson and auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Bullock said DPS officers were pushing her son to testify
against the Cisneroses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we should convince Damien to come in there and tell
everything, to spill his guts to them,'' she said. ``And we said,
`Do you think we're crazy? Let them kill him, too?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Amber Bullock does not believe either of her sons would have
cooperated with authorities. It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Mesa schoolgirl riding the bus home saw something
in a wash near Usery Mountain Recre ation Area. Maricopa County
sher iff's deputies searched the area and found the body of Semus.
</P>
<P>
   There are no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Cisneroses have not been charged in the March 31 raids.
</P>
<P>
   The government still has property seized under forfeiture
statutes, but the brothers are trying to regain it.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros attorney Simpson com plains in court motions that SWAT
officers ransacked private offices, took money from a child's piggy
bank and confiscated items that were lawfully obtained. Because
search warrants are sealed, he noted, the Cisneroses cannot even
find out why their stuff was taken.
</P>
<P>
   As for the meth lab, Simpson said in an interview that the DPS
raid took place before Luis and Felipe Cisne ros arrived at work
that morning, so someone else could be responsible. &QL;

STRAWBERRY PROVES HE IS A WEAPON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas. _ There has been a calm demeanor about Darryl
Strawberry since he arrived in the Yankees clubhouse. Watch
Strawberry sneak into the showers to smoke a cigarette or dress
slowly and quietly near his corner locker or talk more honestly
about the Yankees than anyone other than David Cone. There are
never any moments in which Strawberry looks as if he is rushing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Strawberry does around the Yankees, he always
seems placid. Strawberry never acts like someone who is late for a
flight, never behaves like someone who wants to avoid attention,
never campaigns as someone who craves the endless attention. To
Strawberry, there are no reasons to be unnerved. Baseball is the
simple part for Straw, always has been and always will be.
</P>
<P>
   That is why he looked Saturday night like a carefree teen-ager _
not a sometimes troubled 37-year-old who has admitted his
addictions to drugs and alcohol _ after he had smashed Esteban
Loaiza's fastball in the first inning for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew the ball would leave the Ballpark in Arlington.
Eventually, everyone would know that Strawberry's homer and Roger
Clemens' spotless pitching over seven innings were primary reasons
the Yankees humbled the Rangers, 3-0, and swept the division series
again.
</P>
<P>
   As the white ball transformed into the size of a Tic-Tac and
kept soaring toward left center field, Strawberry furiously chewed
gum and kept gazing at it. When the ball finally vanished over the
fence, Strawberry stopped chewing gum and left his mouth wide open,
almost in awe of his own achievement, before resuming his chewing,
putting his head down and running.
</P>
<P>
   Then Strawberry went back to being the calm designated hitter
and the Yankees went back to beating the Rangers for the ninth
straight time in the postseason. Expect Joe Torre to ride
Strawberry like a new Harley-Davidson in the League Championship
Series against the Indians or the Red Sox. Who would have figured
that Strawberry would be such a central figure in this latest
Yankee tale? Strawberry, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my performance goes, I've been around this game a
long time,'' he said recently. ``I don't put pressure on myself to
perform. When I'm given the opportunity, I expect to perform. I've
done this before. It's really not a matter of worrying about
whether I can still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a humility about Strawberry when he discusses where he
has been and what he can do, but that humility does not totally
disguise the confidence, even cockiness, that he still has.
Strawberry created his own problems when he was arrested for
possessing three-tenths of a gram of cocaine and solicitation of a
prostitute in Tampa, Fla. last April, which he blamed on drinking
and on being depressed following chemotherapy treatments for colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry rejoined the Yankees when rosters expanded on Sept. 1
and spoke passionately about the errors that he had made. ``This
time around, when I looked in the mirror, I looked at the enemy,''
Strawberry said that day. ``It was me. It wasn't anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded riveting, but Strawberry almost sabotaged his tenuous
career and placed himself in the tricky position of having to prove
himself all over again when he was recalled from Triple-A Columbus.
His fourth comeback with the Yankees since 1995 looked as if it
might end with Strawberry in front of a television set in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is a weapon, we'll incorporate it into the club,'' Torre
said at the time. ``We pretty much have to figure out if he is a
weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, Strawberry showed that he was a weapon, and
the doubts about his status on the postseason roster were
eliminated. Now the defending World Series champions need
Strawberry, especially since Chili Davis' bat has been absent for
almost four months and since Paul O'Neill's rib injury might force
him to miss more games.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who scored the first run in Game 1, had the homer
and a single Saturday night. Until Strawberry struggles, Davis
should not budge out of the dugout against right-handers. A player
with Strawberry's experience and abilities suddenly is a much more
precious commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became more valuable to the team,'' said Strawberry,
``whatever situation I'm in.''
</P>
<P>
   He is in a splendid situation again, zooming toward another
World Series ring and providing the sort of power and presence that
September call-ups rarely provide in October. But Strawberry's
situation is different and he is different, always has been and
always will be. Watch him cruise through another postseason with
the Yankees, looking calm. By now, Darryl knows there is no reason
to rush.

A NEW WEAPON AGAINST  GANGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JUDI VILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - For years, only gang rules really mattered on 13th Place
in Phoenix.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents needed permission just to cross the street. Once, two
women got lost on the street and were robbed. Another time, an
elderly man was left standing naked in broad daylight after members
of Eastside Los Cuatro Milpas stole his pants and laughed at him.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Phoenix police are impos ing their own controversial,
and some say unconstitutional, rules on this beleaguered central
city neigh borhood.
</P>
<P>
   They are slapping gang members with civil injunctions that ban
them from hanging out together in public and whistling to warn each
other when police are coming.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 8 and 9, detectives served notice to 14 Los Cuatro
Milpas members that they are about to be prohibited from
``standing, sitting, walking, driving, gathering or ap pearing
anywhere in public view'' with any other gang member.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction, which will take effect after a court hearing
Oct. 20, is a laundry list of rules that includes imposing curfews
on younger Milpas members and banning loud music.
</P>
<P>
   It forbids drinking and fighting in public, carrying all
weapons, block ing anyone's path and even being on the premises of
any abandoned building. Gang members also cannot ride a bike if
it's for the purpose of buying or selling drugs, and they can't use
or possess marking pens, razor blades or spray paint cans if they
intend to deface property.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is the first city in Arizona to resort to civil
injunctions as a way to curb gang activity. But police in
California have been imposing them in gang-blighted areas since
about 1987. California courts have upheld injunctions in Los
Angeles and San Jose despite claims that they trample the civil
rights of gang members, mainly their right to peaceable as sembly.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates, such as the Arizona Civil Liberties
Union, threaten to challenge Phoenix's in junction, and they say
the restric tions unfairly target minorities and have no socially
redeeming value.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Peter Klahr, a Phoenix attor ney, called such injunctions
unneces sary and overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are intimidating people, mad-dogging them,
threatening them, then by all means arrest them,'' Klahr said. ``If
somebody's merely gathering with their friends, leave them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miranda has lived near 13th Place for seven years. And he
has the scars to prove it. Two years ago, two men grabbed him as he
went into his house, threatened his life and de manded money. One
kicked Miran da's ankle so hard that it shattered.
</P>
<P>
   There's a steel plate in his ankle now and, even after three
surgeries, Mir anda still limps sometimes. When the humidity hits
35 percent, he's in pain. And, if the weather's wet enough, he
needs his cane.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, Miranda installed a front gate, a security
door and bars on his windows. He bought a Ger man shepherd for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better because of the gates and security doors,''
Miranda said. ``I lock up the front fence, and I always try to have
company. . . . If I need something, it has to be before dark. When
it gets dark, I go inside and lock myself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gang members warn that residents ``better be'' afraid of them,
espe cially if they disrespect them, mess with them or get in their
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything could happen,'' one Mil pas member said. ``It ain't
heads up like it used to be. We used to fist-fight. It's killing
now. People find a sharp, hard stick and they're gonna shank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police moved into the neigh borhood, bordered by Seventh
and 16th streets, Buckeye Road and Interstate 10, last year after
hearing that dopers were paying drugs to Los Cuatro Milpas leaders
for protec tion.
</P>
<P>
   They found that gang members roughed up elderly residents for
their welfare checks. They robbed people, booby-trapped their drug
houses to slow down police and forced resi dents to keep out of
certain areas, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who complained or called police was beaten, police say.
Gun shots were fired into the air as warnings. One man started
walking around the block to get to a market that was just across
the street, and he bought a gun. Gang leaders even stole from
members of their own gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were getting away with it for a long time, and they
knew they were getting away with it,'' gang unit Detective Jeffrey
Nolder said. ``So, they kept doing more and being more open about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested four gang leaders at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, police targeted an additional 20 gang members
for an intervention program designed to help them find a way out of
gangs and drugs. The program offered jobs, educational
opportunities, fi nancial aid, life skills and self-suffi ciency
training and tattoo removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just throwing them in jail or slapping their wrists,
saying, `This is bad,' '' Nolder said. ``We're giving them
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the targeted gang members snapped up the offers, and
half continued to have repeated run-ins with police.
</P>
<P>
   Since the March arrests, residents are starting to see more
children in the park. The ice-cream trucks come through near dusk.
People sit out front, even if it is just until dark. Thirteenth
Place is clean.
</P>
<P>
   But police say Los Cuatro Milpas gang members still have their
stran gle-hold on the area. Graffiti is prolific on walls and trash
cans, drug houses keep popping up, and gang members congregate with
guns strapped to their sides.
</P>
<P>
   Some gang members continue to commit burglaries, thefts and
armed robberies, police say. The activity indicates they are
jockeying for positions, police say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do anything to prevent it, the next tier will step
up and assume the leadership positions we've taken out and again
gain control of this neighborhood,'' Sgt. Terrance Donegan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department has found that injunctions are
a good way to disrupt and control gang activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a company,'' said Los Angeles police Officer Jason
Lee, a gang expert. ``If I start taking salesmen away, the company
is not going to do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Violation of Phoenix's injunction is a Class 1 misdemeanor,
punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to sap the strength that comes from a gang's numbers
and re-create the social order of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can try and get a little more control of the streets,
and the gangs see that we're not going to tolerate this behavior
that has been going on, maybe they'll tread a little more
lightly,`` said Philip Haggerty, Phoe nix's chief assistant city
attorney. ``If they realize they've lost the cloak of
invulnerability they've been operat ing under because they're a
gang, then we've done something good.``
</P>
<P>
   But Carmen Hernandez figures there's really no way to stop the
gangs. At 6 p.m., she pulls her five children inside, and they
don't come out until morning. Sometimes, they see the gang members
driving down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's not afraid of gangs?'' she asked. ``How many innocent
people have they killed? How many kids have they killed? How can
you not be afraid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my kids to grow up like them.'' &QL;

`ALIEN' THREAT TO WILDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JOHN STANLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Aliens are among us.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They colonize our deserts, infest our waterways, swarm in our
skies and prey upon helpless natives.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking about winter visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of non-native animals and plants into Arizona
threatens the state's indigenous wildlife and costs the state
millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is one of the most biologi cally diverse places in
North Amer ica,'' said biologist Randy Babb of the state Game and
Fish Depart ment. ``And the impact non-native species are making on
it is horren dous.''
</P>
<P>
   The aliens crowd out natives, de crease biological diversity and
reduce wildlife habitats. They increase fire dangers in deserts and
flood damage along riparian areas, and they de crease forage
available for wildlife, including livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, alien species cost taxpay ers an estimated $122
billion a year, according to the Department of Agriculture. Exact
figures are not available for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the intruders would surprise you: the tumbleweed, the
wild burro, crayfish, house sparrows, pigeons, carp, Mediterranean
geckos and bull frogs.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the most damaging are a tree and an exotic grass,
according to officials: the tamarisk, or salt cedar, and red brome
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamarisk was introduced in the late 1800s as an ornamental
species, for wind breaks and an erosion stabilizer for stream
banks,'' said Gina Ramos, a natural-resource specialist at the
Bureau of Land Management. ``Now, a million acres of the South west
are infested with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rory Aikens, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Game and
Fish, said salt cedar has largely replaced native willows,
cottonwoods and mesquite along many of Arizo na's rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt cedar is now the primary plant around edges of Lake
Powell,'' he said. ``It has replaced many of the native trees
having value as food and shelter for animals.'' &QL; 
Increases flood damage
</P>
<P>
   Russ Haughey, a wildlife biologist for Game and Fish, said the
salt cedar is to blame for the increased amount of flood damage
done to private property across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It grows very densely. So, when a river spreads across the
flood plains, it doesn't drain out as quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Babb said red brome, an exotic grass introduced early this
century for cattle forage, is to blame for the intensity of several
Arizona wildfires, including the devastating 1995 ``Rio'' fire in
the McDowells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red brome is a real threat to the Southwest,'' he said. ``It
outcom petes native plants for moisture, food, sunlight and growing
space. It grows fast, dries out and creates an incredible fire
danger. Then, when fires damage native species, red brome is the
first to grow back.''
</P>
<P>
   Haughey said larger and more fre quent fires in the Sonoran
Desert in the past 50 years are believed to be due primarily to red
brome.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ramos, non-native plants are brought into the state
in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone may bring in an illegal plant because of its pretty
flowers,'' she said. ``But when they throw it out, its seeds could
still be active. Also, animals can brings seeds into the state in
their hooves or fur. Or people buy hay in another state and bring
it into Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos says the first step to control non-native species is to
get the cooperation of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything on BLM land if across the way is land
controlled by other agencies,'' she said. &QL; 
`Most wanted' species
</P>
<P>
   John Caravetta, associate director of the plant services
division of the Arizona Department of Agriculture, said there are
58 non-native species the department is particularly con cerned
about excluding from the state. Among those ``most wanted'' are the
Asian longhorned beetle, eucalyptus lerp psyllid, Japanese bee tle,
pink hibiscus mealybug and giant salvinia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Red imported fire ants have spread across the southern United
States since their introduction in the 1930s. Although the
aggressive, biting in sects are spotted in Arizona from time to
time, the state is not classified as infested, thanks largely to
the efforts of the state Agriculture Department.

   ``When we get a call about a colony, we go in and eradicate
it,'' said Lloyd Brown, a department spokes man.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Yuma's Cibola High School reported an infestation of
the im ported red fire ant. Brown said they found about 7,000
mounds at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a disaster area out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is working with city officials to eliminate the
ants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the department eradicated several hundred colonies of
red ants at a former nursery in south Phoe nix.
</P>
<P>
   The department operates four in spection stations at four
Arizona ports of entry. They are in Yuma, Sanders, Ehrenberg and
San Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``These serve as our first line of defense,'' Caravetta said,
``and we do intercept lots of pests at the ports of entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gehlker, a spokesman for the Phoenix branch of the Sierra
Club, summed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to heed the words of Aldo Leopold (an early
environmentalist and writer): `The first principle of intelligent
tinkering is to save all the pieces.' Too often species are brought
in for one purpose, but then unintended consequences make things
worse. We need to be careful about introducing non-native species
in a slapdash way because you never know what you might do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember,'' Brown said, ``none of these
things are evil in themselves. They're just out of place.'' &QL;

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Roger Clemens had missed this more than
anything else in baseball, pitching in a postseason vortex, his
teammates depending on him, needing him. The scrutiny thrilled him.
</P>
<P>
   And Clemens responded Saturday night, capitalizing on the three
runs Darryl Strawberry gave him with a first-inning home run by
throwing seven shutout innings, as the Yankees completed a
three-game sweep of the Texas Rangers in an American League
division series with a 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees pitchers held the Rangers to one run in three games
for the second consecutive year; after batting .141 against the
Yankees last year, the Rangers batted .163 (14 for 92) in this
year's series.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next Wednesday night in New York, the Yankees will play
the winner of the series between the Cleveland Indians and the
Boston Red Sox, which Cleveland leads by 2-1, in the AL
Championship Series. It is unclear whether Paul O'Neill will
participate. The All-Star right fielder missed Saturday night's
game because of bruised ribs and may be out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who allowed three hits, walked two and struck out two
before Mariano Rivera worked the final two innings, might have
aggravated a hamstring injury in his final inning.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, the Yankee catcher, had been prepared for Clemens
to go to the mound in an excited state, perhaps overthrowing,
trying too hard. If necessary, Girardi was ready to slow him down
as much as possible, go to the mound to remind him of how many outs
there were, remind him of the situation. Anything to calm him.
</P>
<P>
   For Girardi understood all the baggage that Clemens might have
carried to the mound with him.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been the winning pitcher in a postseason game since
Oct. 15, 1986 _ he had six starts in the interim, over the years _
and after the Yankees traded David Wells for Clemens before this
season, there was the expectation that Clemens had to be as
successful as Wells in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And Clemens, raised in Katy, Tex., and an alumnus of the
University of Texas, was pitching in his home state. He acquired a
sideline pass to see the beginning of the Texas-Oklahoma football
game earlier in the day, and his mother Bess and other family
members were here, having made the 4 1-2 hour drive from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his stage tonight,'' manager Joe Torre said of
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens prepared himself thoroughly, using part of his bullpen
workouts to simulate game action and the Texas lineup; he would
imagine he was pitching to Juan Gonzalez, Rafael Palmeiro and
others, and Girardi called balls and strikes. Clemens was crisp.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the groundwork helped him more than what Strawberry
provided before Clemens threw a pitch. One out into the first
inning, Derek Jeter smashed a line drive that bounced off the top
of the left-field wall, ricocheted against the facing of the stands
and fell back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Beckoning for an umpire to call this a home run, Jeter rounded
second and ran into the Texas second baseman Mark McLemore, who was
moving into position for a relay. Jeter returned to second and
although he lost his protest for a home run, he was awarded third
on McLemore's interference.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams walked, but the Rangers pitcher Esteban Loaiza
whiffed Tino Martinez on three pitches, exploiting the typically
large strike zone being called by umpire John Hirschbeck.
Strawberry was next, and Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez called for a
fastball, shifting his body behind the outside corner as he set his
glove for Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   But Loaiza missed the target, his fastball drifting over the
plate. Strawberry pounced, his drive carrying high to left-center,
10 rows deep into the stands. Players burst over the front steps of
the Yankees' dugout, trading high fives, yelling, and Strawberry
circled the bases with a small grin that broadened when he reached
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to dominate had been lifted off Clemens;
Strawberry's runs had given him a margin for error, had given him
room to relax and focus on Hirschbeck's wide strike zone. He stared
in for the signs from Girardi, his glove obscuring all parts of his
face other than his eyes, his arms tucked against his sides and his
upper back slightly hunched, the pitcher's fetal position. Clemens
was very comfortable in this place.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the Rangers on eight pitches in the first inning,
throwing his fastballs for strikes, striking out Mark McLemore with
a slider on the outside corner. Everything was working. Everything
was in order. Clemens was not rushing, he had tackled and pinned
his adrenaline, and there was no need for Girardi to calm him.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he fell behind in the count, Clemens simply
challenged hitters with his fastball; Strawberry's home run
afforded him this luxury. He threw first-pitch strikes to 9 of 10
hitters in one sequence, and all three of the Rangers' hits in the
first six innings were singles. Texas could not score.
</P>
<P>
   One out into the bottom of the fifth inning, Tom Goodwin smacked
a one-hopper off Clemens' right calf, and Clemens dropped to the
ground in pursuit of the ball and threw to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly he found himself surrounded by concerned teammates and
Steve Donahue, the Yankees' trainer. Donahue asked how he was, and
towering over the trainer, Clemens smiled and appeared to lecture
Donahue good-naturedly. From his expression, it was easy to discern
what he was thinking: If you think I'm coming out of the game
because of that little bruise, you've got to be crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens maintained his shutout into the seventh, Bernie Williams
aiding him with two running catches on deep drives. After covering
first base with one out, Clemens came away wincing, limping
slightly; all year, he has been bothered by a strained hamstring,
once going on the disabled list, and he might have aggravated the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens finished the inning, and for now he has put to rest
all the concerns and unfavorable comparisons, and met all the
expectations. It's October, Clemens pitched superbly, and the
Yankees are advancing in the playoffs.  &QL;
