<HEADLINE> GM To Unveil Truck-SUV Hybrid  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- Bidding to add some luster to a lineup of cars and
trucks that has lacked it in recent years, General Motors Corp. will offer two
new models that meld features of pickups, sport utility vehicles and minivans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pontiac Aztek, an all-wheel-drive SUV with some minivan elements, will
go on sale later this year. The Chevrolet Avalanche, a merger of the passenger
cabin of a full-size SUV and a truck bed, will go on sale in a slightly
different form early in 2001. Both will be unveiled at the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit next week.
</P>
<P>
	   GM officials are counting on the new vehicles to lure buyers who have been
shunning GM showrooms in favor of import brands and to break what has been seen
as a bland parade of new models from the world's largest automaker over the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first edge in what we think of as the reintroduction of
innovative thinking at General Motors," said Aztek Brand Manager Don Butler.
</P>
<P>
	   But industry analysts say while Aztek and Avalanche will likely find a niche
among buyers, they will face a bevy of competitors by the time they roll off
assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aztek gives GM its first all-wheel-drive SUV designed to ride and drive
like a car, competing against similar offerings from Japanese manufacturers,
notably Honda and Toyota. While the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 have proven
popular with younger, affluent customers, GM's aging line of mid-sized SUVs
based on truck chassis have suffered a sales slump and the company offers
sizable rebates on many models.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aztek is larger than the Toyota and Honda SUVs, with a V6 engine that
provides more power and towing capacity. Inside, designers adopted minivan seats
that can fold, flip, or be removed for more storage. A cargo tray behind the
second row of seats can be configured in a variety of ways or removed.
</P>
<P>
	   The interior offers suggestions of off-road toughness -- such as a large
passenger grab handle protruding from the dash, and rubberized surfaces. The
Aztek also takes cupholding to a new extreme with a portable cooler large enough
to hold 12 soda cans that locks into the center console.
</P>
<P>
	   Pontiac will sell the Aztek in front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive
versions, and will build about 65,000 in the first year of production. While
Pontiac officials wouldn't offer a price for the vehicle, its competitors
usually sell for $23,000 to $27,000.
</P>
<P>
	   To help defray the expense of developing the Aztek, GM will likely use it as
a base for other SUV models, including one for Buick named Rendezvous. Other
automakers, including Ford Motor Co., are working on similar SUVs to compete for
the same group of customers as the Aztek.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aztek "is important in that it will highlight GM's direction in next
couple of years in terms of all-wheel-drive vehicles," said Michael Robinet, an
analyst with CSM Forecasting. "It's certainly going to help Pontiac expand its
products. It moves them into some new buyers, and I think it will be relatively
successful."
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche is aimed at more traditional truck buyers, and will compete
head-to-head with products from Ford Motor Co., the Dodge division of
DaimlerChrysler AG and Nissan Motor Co. All have added extra doors and rear seat
space to their pickups in the past several years to meet customer demand; GM
says sales of extended-cab pickups have gone from 41 percent of pickups in 1994
to 70 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the Avalanche's passenger compartment is a shortened truck bed made
largely of a high-strength plastic. Between the bed and the second row of seats
is what Chevy calls a "midgate" -- a divider that folds down, making the bed
about three feet longer. A bed cover keeps air out, and the rear window can be
taken out for more open driving.
</P>
<P>
	   GM executives were not willing to disclose an estimated price for the
Avalanche or predict sales. Industry analyst Alan Baum with IRN Inc. said the
Avalanche should see measured, but not overwhelming success, thanks to the
arrival of large truck-SUV hybrids from Ford.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the case of the Avalanche, because of its timing, since it comes behind
Ford's product, it will suffer," he said. "This product is not going to gain
much share (for GM) in the pickup market. The good news for GM in part is that
they won't have to rebate them as much as they do their current products."
</P>
<P>
	   Robinet was more upbeat in his assessment, saying the Avalanche was the best
combination of trucks and SUVs so far.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chevy did an effective job in differentiating its vehicle from full-size
pickups and sport utilities, both in style and function," he said. "But it won't
take long for imports and Ford and DaimlerChrysler to move into the market more
assertively."

<HEADLINE> Arrests Hang Over Iranian Jews  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- At a synagogue in the heart of this ancient city's
Jewish quarter, worshippers end their Sabbath service with a solemn prayer for
13 loved ones jailed by Iranian authorities on accusations of espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We pray that those we love will be safely among us soon,'' the rabbi
murmurs, then hundreds of people shuffle into the Rabeezadeh Synagogue's
courtyard to exchange greetings and news and gossip about their small community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are never far from my mind,'' said Arman Goel, a teen-ager who knows
some of those arrested well. ``Even my grades have dropped since they were
taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spy case has cast a pall over the 6,000 Jews of Shiraz, the ancient
capital of the Persian empire whose wealth and tolerance were a magnet for
people of all faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 13 who are in prison are merchants, religious teachers, two civil
servants and a 17-year-old boy, said Eshaq Niknava, head of the Jewish Society
of Shiraz. Eleven are from Shiraz, two from nearby Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
	   The first were arrested one and a half years ago, while others were arrested
last March. They have been accused of spying for Israel and the United States,
Iranian authorities say, but formal charges have not been brought.
</P>
<P>
	   In another case in January 1997, two Jews were hanged at Tehran's Evin
prison on similar spying charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The plight of the imprisoned Jews has attracted attention from the United
States, Israel and several European countries that have demanded Iran free the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   The attention, though, especially from Israel, has created new pressures.
Relatives of those held fear that the more their loved ones are defended by the
West and Israel, the more adamant Iranian authorities are about pressing the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should let the issue solve itself quietly, that's the only way,'' said
the wife of one of the men in jail, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives said they had received hints at least some of the Jews would be
freed soon. They feared that speaking on the record, or saying anything more
about the plight of their loved ones, could jeopardize a release.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members get one 5-minute visit every Tuesday. They used to deliver
kosher food on each visit, but prison authorities banned that several months
ago, saying the food was rotting because prisoners had no refrigerators,
relatives said. The inmates now eat prison food.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman recounted how her husband was arrested about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some men knocked on our door at midnight and took my husband,'' she said.
``It took me three months to see him. Now I get to see him for five minutes
every week, with a thick glass wall between us, but that's all right.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said some Muslim neighbors who are close friends had taught her a verse
from the Koran that she recites every night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of our Muslim neighbors even went on pilgrimage to a shrine outside
Shiraz just to pray for my husband,'' she said. ``Before all this happened, we
all lived in absolute peace and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iran's Jewish community, although it has dwindled over the decades, remains
the Middle East's largest outside Israel. Iranian Jews are allowed to practice
aspects of their religion but are forbidden to teach Hebrew, the liturgical
language.
</P>
<P>
	   Several times a week Jewish boys and girls gather at Shiraz's House of
Jewish Youth at the Khorasaniha Synagogue for religious classes conducted by
Ebrahim Bassalla, a civil servant and volunteer teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   During a class on the Sabbath, Bassalla recited the biblical tale of Jacob
and Joseph to a group of 50 boys and girls aged between 7 and 17.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should respect your parents. Never question when your parents ask you
to do something,'' he advises in a fatherly tone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And you should never waste water, bread and electricity,'' he tells them
before passing out small boxes of cookies he has bought with his own money, and
sending them off. Sometimes, he also treats the kids to the movies.
</P>
<P>
	   The synagogue, one of 16 scattered around Shiraz, has its own library of
books, videos and audio tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Three butcher shops sell only kosher meat, and Niknava, the community
leader, supervises the slaughter at the municipal slaughterhouse, which provides
refrigerated trucks to transport the meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Niknava is negotiating with authorities for another Jewish cemetery because
the only one in Shiraz is nearly full.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Jewish quarter, which lies inside the main commercial district off
bustling Karim Khan Zand Avenue, nearly half the shops remain closed on
Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
	   At its height, Iran's Jewish community numbered about 100,000 and was still
around 80,000 just before Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. Now there are about
25,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Most who left went to the United States, Europe and, to a lesser degree,
Israel, said Dr. Manouchehr Eliasi, the single Jewish representative in the
270-seat Majlis, or parliament.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Nebraska 31, No. 6 Tenn. 21  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB BAUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Too much speed, too much strength. Just too much
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   With lightning-quick Eric Crouch at the controls of a relentless option
attack, the third-ranked Cornhuskers beat No. 6 Tennessee 31-21 in the Fiesta
Bowl on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Volunteers rallied from a 17-0 deficit to cut it to 17-14 early in
the second half behind the passing of Tee Martin, the Huskers (12-1) finished
Tennessee off with second-half touchdown drives of 96 and 99 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Wilson's 44-yard pass touchdown pass to Donte' Stallworth, his second
TD catch of the game, came on a Tennessee trick play that reduced the lead to
31-21 with 7:25 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Vols never got the ball again. Nebraska, which finished the game
with 23 consecutive rushing plays for 156 yards, drove downfield and Tennessee
(9-3) could do nothing to stop the clock from running out.
</P>
<P>
	   It was all-too-familiar for the Volunteers, who wore down in the second half
two years ago in a 42-17 loss to Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. The Huskers have
won their last 11 bowl matchups against SEC teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Crouch's quickness was the problem the Volunteers' expected, but he did
almost as much damage with his arm.
</P>
<P>
	   Crouch was 9-of-15 for 148 yards and a touchdown. Martin, who finished his
career with a 22-3 record as a starter, was 19-of-34 for 223 yards and a
touchdown. He was intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskers rushed for 321 yards and had 469 yards overall. Dan Alexander
gained 108 yards on 21 carries, Willie Miller added 87 yards on eight carries,
and Crouch had 64 yards on 17 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobby Newcombe, who started the season as Nebraska's quarterback, returned a
punt 60 yards for a touchdown to help his team to its early lead.
</P>
<P>
	   After Tennessee cut the lead to 17-14, Crouch threw a 13-yard touchdown pass
to wide-open tight end Aaron Golliday to boost the lead to 24-14 with 4:44 left
in the third quarter. The pass, Nebraska's first for a touchdown in 19 quarters,
capped a nine-play 96-yard drive that included a 17-yard pass from Crouch to
another tight end, John Bowling, on third-and-13 from the Nebraska 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Golliday and Bowling saw extra duty because Tracey Wistrom, the Huskers'
all-Big-12 tight end, was out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee pinned the Huskers at their 1 on their next possession, but
Nebraska went 99 yards in 10 plays, overpowering the tiring Vols defense.
Correll Buckhalter ran 27 yards to the Vols 19, then scored on a 2-yard run to
make it 31-14 with 12:01 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers, in their NCAA record 31st consecutive bowl game, needed
just four plays to score on their first possession. Crouch went 30 yards on an
option play on third-and-4 to set up Dan Alexander's 7-yard touchdown run on the
next play.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska made it 14-0 after the Huskers' defense stopped the Volunteers deep
in their own territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Newcombe, who switched to wingback after two games, took the punt and shot
through a hole on the right side of the field, then won a footrace to the end
zone with 3:21 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Crouch's 46-yard pass to Matt Davison set up Josh Brown's 31-yard field goal
that put the Huskers up 17-0 with 1:37 left in the first half. The kick hit the
right upright and bounced through.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers finally got their offense in gear just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin completed 6-of-7 passes for 66 yards, with the only incompletion an
intentional spike, as Tennessee scored on an 8-play, 65-yard drive that used up
just 1 minute, 19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Stallworth to make it 17-7 with 18
seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander fumbled on the first play of the second half and Tennessee's
Dominique Stevenson recovered at the Nebraska 25. Four plays later, Travis Henry
scored on a 4-yard run to cut the lead to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the only turnover of the game for the Cornhuskers, who led NCAA
Division I with 25 fumbles lost.

<HEADLINE> Report: Packers Fire Rhodes, Staff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers fired coach Ray Rhodes and his
entire staff after the team failed to make the NFL playoffs for the first time
in seven years, ESPN reported Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Phones calls by The Associated Press to team president Bob Harlan and
general manager Ron Wolf were not returned Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Two players, Vonnie Holliday and Anthony Davis, said they were unaware of
the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ESPN quoted sources as saying Rhodes, in his first season as coach of the
Packers, was informed of the decision following the team's 49-24 victory over
Arizona on Sunday. A win by Dallas over the New York Giants later Sunday
eliminated Green Bay (8-8) from postseason contention on a conference
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
	   An official announcement is expected Monday, ESPN said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes replaced Mike Holmgren when he left for Seattle. Rhodes was fired by
Philadelphia after last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody feels bad about the way things have gone this season," Rhodes
said after the Packers were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed that we didn't get the help we needed today from the
Giants. It's tough to have your season end the way it has, watching Dallas win a
game on television. But we have no one to blame but ourselves -- we got in this
situation by not taking advantage of some opportunities we had earlier this
season."

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Overmatched by Neb. Again  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- There were no happy returns for Tennessee in the Fiesta
Bowl. Not with an opponent like No. 3 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing on the same field where they won the national championship by
beating Florida State 23-16 last year, the No. 6 Volunteers fell to Nebraska
31-21 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers (12-1) moved the ball almost at will, clinching the victory
with touchdowns after sustained drives of 96 and 99 yards in the second half.
And, despite a 19-for-34, 223-yard game by Tee Martin, the Huskers controlled
the damage with breathtaking defensive speed.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin finished his career 22-3 as a starter and the fourth-best passer in
school history in yardage (4,592) and TD passes (32).
</P>
<P>
	   But he threw only one of two scoring passes for his team against Nebraska --
a 9-yard strike to Donte' Stallworth that cut the Huskers lead to 17-7 at
halftime -- and had two passes intercepted.
</P>
<P>
	   When Stallworth made his second scoring catch, with 7:25 left in the game,
it was thrown by wide receiver Cedrick Wilson after a lateral from Martin -- an
attempt to get away from the defensive pressure Nebraska applied early and late.
</P>
<P>
	   The game may have been the last in orange and white for tailback Jamal
Lewis, who was considering leaving school early for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   There was disappointment for Tennessee after the 1997 season, when Nebraska
won a share of the national title by beating the Vols 42-17 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The next year, a new formula for determining champions kicked in, and Martin
led the Vols to a 13-0 record and the second national crown in school history.

<HEADLINE> 5 Texas Teens Dies When Truck Flips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Five teen-age boys in the cab of a pickup truck
died when the driver lost control trying to merge onto a busy interstate Sunday
and hit another truck head-on.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash happened about 1 p.m. on Interstate 30 on the west side of Fort
Worth, said Fort Worth Police Department Lt. Ric Clark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It crossed the median and then started flipping in the air, side over
side,'' Clark said. ``It crashed into a green Chevy truck going east on I-30 in
the right-hand lane. Both vehicles were completely totaled. It was massive
damage.''
</P>
<P>
	   All five were pronounced dead at the scene. One had been thrown from the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver of the other truck was hospitalized in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified the victims as Hank
Gorman, 20; Edward Jennings, 18; John McDonald, 16; James McDonald, 15; and
Martin McDonald, whose age is unknown. Police said they didn't know how the
McDonalds were related to each other, but said all five lived in the Fort Worth
area.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pataki wants river research institute created on Hudson River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki wants the Hudson River to do for
river and estuary research what Woods Hole has done for the study of the ocean.
<P>
	   Pataki said his State of the State address this week will call for creation
of an international center for studying fish, plant life, pollution, water
quality, currents and other aspects of estuaries and rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are going to create on the Hudson River what will be equivalent to a
world-class research facility for rivers and estuaries," Pataki said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor, the institute would be modeled after the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, which has become an international
center for research.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think we have a tremendous opportunity to create that same type of
facility," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor will ask the Legislature to appropriate $1 million in 2000 to
get the institute project started. Pataki said he had no specific site in mind
for the facility, but envisioned it being a partnership between the state, the
State University of New York, private colleges and industries. The institute
would seek to fund its work largely through government, industry and foundation
grants, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said state officials hope to create a vehicle for high-quality
research into rivers in the same way the Rockefeller University in New York City
has become a center of internationally prominent medical research.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to sewer projects up and down the Hudson and more stringent chemical
discharge rules, the river is cleaner than it has been in decades. However, PCB
sediments north of Albany continue to keep contamination levels in fish elevated
throughout the river. There are other less severe chemical contamination worries
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the fact the river is not in pristine condition could be of
benefit to scientists studying how to overcome similar pollution problems in
rivers around the globe. The governor also said that if breakthroughs in
cleaning up contaminated sediments or river waters are made at the Hudson
institute, the river itself is likely one of the first beneficiaries of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, Pataki said an institute could have an annual budget of $50
million and employ 500 or more people.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the logical next step to the progress we have made," Pataki said
Sunday. "I think it is a very exciting concept that would really have an
incredibly positive impact."
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Jones of the Albany-based Environmental Advocates said a Hudson
institute "sounds like a great idea."
</P>
<P>
	   John Cronin, known as the Hudson Riverkeeper in the environmental
organization of the same name, called the proposal "breathtaking" and
"magnificent." He said that because of the river's recovery, plus its location
in the urbanized Northeast, it is the perfect waterway to study exhaustively to
glean ways of improving other rivers and estuaries. One scientist has called the
Hudson a "laboratory that could inform the world," Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cronin said it would make the most sense from a scientific standpoint to
site an institute in the lower half of the Hudson where the freshwater and
saltwater interactions are greatest in terms of their effects on fish and animal
life. He said that point is at about the river's 50-mile mark, or somewhere even
with northern Westchester County bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Ned Sullivan, executive director of Scenic Hudson, said the river has made
"tremendous progress," but still has "significant" problems. An institute would
provide far more extensive scientific monitoring of the waterway than is now
being done, with benefits sure to accrue to the river itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Cronin said the Hudson is facing a new generation of challenges
from power plants and other bank-side projects and they said a research center
might determine the ramifications of those initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   An estuary is a tidal inlet - typically a low-lying river - where seawater
merges with freshwater. The Hudson is an estuary where the "salt line" - the
point where freshwater and saltwater meet - is generally around Poughkeepsie
depending on the force of sea tides and of the rainwater that drains into
streams and creeks northward of that point.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said Sunday his State of the State will also outline plans to spend
$30 million more restoring the aquatic habitat of Long Island Sound. That will
include an initiative to improve the public's access to the sound from Long
Island westward to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   There are only four significant public access points to the sound throughout
that entire shoreline, Pataki said. Most of the waterfront property is held by
either private landowners or municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the state would be working with municipalities to try to get
them to free up more beaches, boat launches and other access points for the
general public.

<HEADLINE> Real test ahead for employees returning to work on Monday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After sweating out Y2K on New Year's Eve, officials
and business operators around the state are wary today of Y2K II: The Sequel.
<P>
	   The Y2K bug that struck fear into the heart of business over recent months,
even years in some cases, isn't squashed yet. Phase two beginning today may be
more of a problem when state and private sector employees return to work and
watch their computer monitors flicker to life.
</P>
<P>
	   "A major hurdle will be when people return to work after extended holidays
and try to reboot their computers, many of which were turned off to avoid
problems," said Julie Leeper, state Y2K project coordinator for the Governor's
Office for Technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Through today state workers will check 300 high-priority computer systems in
agencies like the state department of Criminal Justice, the Department of Mental
Health and the Department of Banking.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not anticipating any major problems in government, but problems could
occur in the private sector," Leeper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leeper and a reduced staff of state emergency workers continued to monitor
power lines, hospitals and other vital services at the state's underground Y2K
command center in Albany on Sunday, and there have been few reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A small number of food stamp recipients had difficulties at grocery stores
when they tried to use their electronic benefits cards used for purchasing food.
The electronic prompt said that the cards had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   In another incident, call boxes along the side of the Adirondack Northway
are not working because of a systems glitch. Most of those call boxes are not
likely to be fixed because of the systems' advanced age.
</P>
<P>
	   That said, about half of the staff at the Y2K command center have been sent
home, according to officials who said the center is now down to about 75 people
per shift.
</P>
<P>
	   "Much of the work to be done over the next few days will be completed by
technicians monitoring systems in individual agencies and their counterparts in
the private sector," said Leeper.
</P>
<P>
	   At 8 p.m. Saturday, officials closed down each of the 10 Y2K regional
command centers across the state, after all systems were determined to be
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Saturday, Gov. George Pataki proudly told emergency workers that New
York - after a tremendous amount of effort - updated its computer systems for
the 21st Century and passed the Y2K test with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were hoping for the most expensive non-event in history. That would be
good news," Pataki said. "And it was a non-event."
</P>
<P>
	   There were scattered power outages - including a temporary power loss to 966
customers Saturday in Eden in Erie County. But Gary Davis, state Y2K project
director, said those outages were ordinary occurrences unrelated to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless, the state's Y2K command center will remain fully activated
through Tuesday, when officials will decide if operations can be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
	   While state officials exulted in their initial success, others wondered if
maybe the Y2K wasn't quite the monster it was made out to be.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a lot of it was the media, it scares you more than anything," said
Chris Ericson, a North Carolina resident shopping in Albany's Colonie Center
Mall with her family. "I think they got people overly worried about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said the state will be on heightened alert for Y2K problems for a
while. He noted that this is a leap year, and Feb. 29 is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.

<HEADLINE> For Y2K warriors, today is middle of work week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - New Year's has been no holiday for millions of
workers swatting at the Y2K bug.
<P>
	   According to Y2K researcher Howard Rubin of Rubin Associates in Westchester
County, 3.2 million people were on the job New Year's Eve, with hundreds of
thousands more on call.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier Corp. spokesman Tor Constantino barely slept during the past few
days. He arrived at work at 8 a.m. New Year's Eve writing press releases,
breaking only for 30 minutes for a New Year's kiss from his wife. He headed home
at 2 a.m., only to return to work Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   He comforted himself by thinking he was helping others enjoy their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   As plant manager of Monroe County Water Authority's Shoremont Treatment
plant, Steve Gould put in many long hours during the past four months to make
sure residents had water after the rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife and two children celebrated at home without him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Part of working for the public is you have to give up things like this,"
Gould told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Boris Schmigel had double duties at Rochester General Hospital -
surgical medical director and chairman of the Y2K planning committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with nine other members of the Y2K command team, Schmigel arrived at
the hospital at 9 p.m. New Year's Eve to make sure its Y2K compliance plans were
in place. Fortunately, all systems were working at midnight but at 10 minutes
after midnight, a patient came into the emergency room with a gunshot wound.
Schmigel performed surgery on the year's first trauma patient.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a surgeon. I'm used to being up half the night," he said. "I'm more
pleased that everything went well."
</P>
<P>
	   At Heritage Christian Home in Penfield in Monroe County, resident counselor
Kelly Davies worked Friday night and Saturday. She stockpiled food and supplies
at the organization, which serves about 300 adults with mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Work is my priority, so I don't mind my life revolving around work," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Capital region slowest in state in recovering from recession  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - While much of the nation is thriving in an
economic recovery, parts of Connecticut are still struggling to emerge from the
deep recession of the early 1990s.
<P>
	   State figures show that statewide employers in November finally restored the
last of the 158,200 jobs lost during the 1989-92 recession. But the capital
region, which includes Hartford and 57 towns and cities around it, has regained
less than a third of the 75,600 jobs it lost in the downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   The region was slow to emerge from the recession and continues to creep
along. In the key category of finance, insurance and real estate, the Hartford
area slipped from 88,000 jobs in 1989-90 to about 70,000 today, a 20 percent
drop.
</P>
<P>
	   Upwards of 60,000 more people left the region than moved in during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   A problem for employers, including those in Greater Hartford, is the
shortage of people with the right skills.
</P>
<P>
	   "Employers are demanding more," said Laurie Colbourn, programs and services
coordinator at Connecticut Works, the state's umbrella job center. "People are
still struggling to get some kind of training."
</P>
<P>
	   Colbourn says the jobless rate in Hartford, while still above the state
average, is a fraction of its peak, and the Hartford area overall enjoys the
same low rate as the rest of Connecticut. But she said, "It's not like it was in
the late '80s. Everything was booming. . . . It's a strange market. It's very
ambiguous."
</P>
<P>
	   The loss of jobs in finance, insurance and real estate as well as
construction and manufacturing raises questions about the quality of jobs that
are being created. Those sectors typically have higher-paying jobs than others,
such as retail trade and personal services.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you can ignore the fact that there has been a hollowing of
the middle class,"' said Arthur Famiglietti, an analyst at the state Department
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
	   Buying power is rising slower than it was in the '80s and it's rising slower
in Greater Hartford than in the rest of the state because of the weak job gains,
said economist Donald L. Klepper-Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're better positioned to outperform the national economy when the next
recession eventually does roll around. We're clearly better off than we were in
1989."
</P>
<P>
	   The big three industries of the Hartford region - aerospace, insurance and
state government - have not replaced anywhere near as many jobs as they lost
between 1989 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are regions of growth elsewhere in the state. The Indian casinos
and booming tourism have brought the southeast back, despite defense cuts. New
York City's booming trade in stocks, with all that goes with it, has spilled
into Fairfield County. A corridor of small, high-technology firms is developing
between New Haven and Wallingford as well as in Fairfield County.

<HEADLINE> State, businesses defend spending on preparations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State officials insist the Y2K bug did exist, and
say the years of time and millions of dollars invested in finding and
erradicating it paid off.
<P>
	   No major problems from the computer glitch were reported worldwide or in the
state during the transition from 1999 to 2000. But officials said that if they
hadn't invested in preparation, things would not have gone so smoothly.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't have any choice," Gov. John G. Rowland said Saturday from the
state's emergency command post in Hartford. "We looked at the worst case
scenario and prepared for that."
</P>
<P>
	   Lou Marcoccio of the Gartner Group, a Stamford-based technology consulting
firm known as leading Y2K experts, said Y2K fears were more than just hype to
put money in the pocket of the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
	   If businesses and governments had waited or done nothing, the cumulative
effect of multiple Y2K failures could have been disastrous, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was justified and it got companies to move," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gartner analysts estimated that worldwide, $300 billion to 600 billion was
spent to ease the bite of the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut spent more than $100 million over the last two years to ensure
the state's 1,500 computer systems would not malfunction. None of the state's 21
key agencies and 169 municipalities have reported any Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government spent $8.4 billion - 10 times more than the $695 million
spent by Great Britain and as much as 100 times more than Russia, according to
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the price tag was worth it to ensure people remained
confident in the computers that run everything from banking to medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   FleetBoston Financial, the combined parent of Fleet and BankBoston, spent
about $225 million; People's Bank spent $10 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The payoff is people remained calm," said Roberta Burns-Howard, a
spokeswoman for Bridgeport-based People's.
</P>
<P>
	   If nothing else, getting ready for Y2K allowed some businesses to test and
upgrade routinely used equipment. General Electric Co., based in Fairfield,
devoted about $650 million and some 1,600 full-time employees to Y2K, and along
the way tested equipment involved in the production of everything from household
appliances to jet engines.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's an added benefit," spokeswoman Beth Comstock said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said Y2K preparations were a good lesson in interdepartmental
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel that our emergency-response capabilities are better than they've
ever been," he said.

<HEADLINE> Survey finds state's wealthiest give least  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut had the highest per capita income in
the nation last year, but ranked just 26th when it came to contributions to
charity, according to the Connecticut Council on Philanthropy.
<P>
	   Residents who made $100,000 to $200,000 a year ranked 49th in charitable
giving when compared with some with similar incomes in other states, the council
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd say that the average people in Connecticut are probably giving pretty
well - at least they've been at the medium level instead of being way at the
bottom," said Nancy Roberts, president of the Hartford-based council.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut residents have all the qualities of people who give - they're
older, well-educated, religious and tend to be volunteers, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't tell you why we are contrary to the indicators," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   An economy like Connecticut's - where business is booming and unemployment
is low - is usually good for charities, said Eugene R. Tempel, executive
director of the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
	   But when times are good, health and human service organizations have trouble
fund raising because people assume the prosperity is trickling down to even the
nation's poorest, Tempel said. People tend to give instead to educational,
environmental and arts programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those of us who are moving with the economy are assuming everybody's moving
with the economy - and we've forgotten who's left behind," said Tempel.
</P>
<P>
	   A good economy can also mean that charities that employ the needy lose their
workers to better paying jobs. The Salvation Army, for example, had trouble
hiring bell ringers to take collections during the holidays because many people
who normally fill the $6-an-hour jobs had found other jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those closest to poverty are often the most likely to do something about
it," said the Rev. Andrew Fiddler, rector of Trinity Church on the Green in New
Haven. "I'm just amazed at how big the pledges are from young people whose rent
takes up half their income, and from old people on fixed incomes."
</P>
<P>
	   The average American gave $898 to charity in 1999, up from $877 the year
before, according to an American Express survey of 800 consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   One factor driving contributions is convenience. The American Express survey
suggested people donated more when they could charge it to their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   High-profile contributions by celebrities like Microsoft founder Bill Gates
and media mogul Ted Turner have also inspired people to give, Tempel said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The role of philanthropy is much more visible than it has been in past
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About three-quarters of charitable contributions come from individuals and
their estates, rather than corporations or foundations, according to Giving USA.

Problems in Hong Kong May Be Related to Y2K
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Americans looked overseas for hints of Y2K trouble in
the world's earliest time zones, several government computers in Hong Kong on
Monday failed to show the correct date, though the problems did not damage
records or affect critical operations, said K. C. Kwong, secretary for
information technology and broadcasting. Ten private companies also reported
minor problems possibly related to Y2K, he said. But remarkably absent any
serious problems, companies and governments around the world also began
disbanding Y2K operations and sending workers home. Top experts, admittedly
surprised at computers' seamless transition to 2000, cautioned nevertheless that
countries and organizations that got a late start on repairs aren't out of the
woods yet.

behind. From coast to coast Sunday, the beginning of 2000 was a common theme in
religious services, with clergy using the opportunity to call for a fresh start
and a millennium of faith, peace and devotion. "Get into Y2J instead of Y2K --
Jesus 2000," the Rev. Jim Holley preached to members of Detroit's Little Rock
Baptist Church. "God was in the last century, and he's in this one," said one of
his congregation members, Sheila Whitlow. "I just hope for the future that man

along the lines of the array of tightly targeted proposals rejected by Congress
last year, his chief of staff said Sunday. The Republican-run Congress last year
passed, and Clinton vetoed, a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. This came after
Congress rejected the president's proposal for a package of cuts totaling about
$36 billion over five years. Podesta said the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut
proposal would be similar in scope to last year's package.

<HEADLINE> Democrats face fiscal mess as they take over Nassau Legislature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - When Judy Jacobs moved to Long Island in 1967,
there were still corn fields and cabbage patches in Nassau County.
<P>
	   "I thought it was always going to be that way," she recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   Then one morning she awakened to the sight of a four-story office building
going up in her Woodbury neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we said, 'Lo and behold, we'd better get involved in our own
community,"' she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting involved, it turns out, was just the start of it.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Sen. Charles Schumer and many of the state's top Democrats were to
join Jacobs as she was sworn in as the presiding officer of the Nassau County
Legislature - the first Democrat to hold such a powerful post in the
Republican-dominated county in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But the time for celebrating will be brief for Jacobs and her fellow
lawmakers, who need to immediately tackle a budget deficit that state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall says could rise as high as $190 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, we've inherited an absolute mess here," Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the budget shortfall, which fueled a voter revolt last November
that ousted five Republicans and gave Democrats a 10-9 majority, is "worse than
I think most people believed."
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been such ineptitude and such mismanagement and such a lack of
accountability and communication that it's beyond our wildest thoughts as to
what we were about to uncover," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs, a plainspoken, raspy-voiced mother of three grown children, first
ran for the Oyster Bay town board in 1977. She remained active in civic groups
and county politics but never won any race until she was elected to the county
Legislature four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   After decades of domination by one of the strongest Republican political
machines in the country, Jacobs admits she was as shocked as anyone when the
election results last November yielded a Democratic upset.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought we'd take the majority," she says. "I did think - and I've
been in politics long enough - I thought there was something happening."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs knows that with only a 28 percent voter turnout and a one-vote
majority, the Democrats can't exactly claim a mandate.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know what I think it is, it's a call for changing 'business as usual.'
And if the Democrats don't provide it, then we're going to be thrown out in two
years," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She vows to improve the Legislature's committee process and intends to seek
testimony from every department head in county government to examine where
budget savings can be found.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the first thing we owe to the people of this county is to truly do
some investigative work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The county has already seen its bond rating reduced to nearly junk level,
but Jacobs hopes Wall Street "will be willing to give us a month or two to get
our feet on the ground. Because they really have no way of judging what's about
to happen in Nassau County."
</P>
<P>
	   She noted this will be the first time Republican County Executive Thomas
Gulotta will have to work with a Democratic legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't know how effective he'll be," she said. "So a lot of good things
might happen."
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Gulotta says he is "optimistic that we can forge a bipartisan
effort that will benefit all the residents of the county."
</P>
<P>
	   Gulotta contends that despite the fiscal woes, Nassau is "still rated one of
the best counties to live in, according to national surveys."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the crime rate is at its lowest point in 30 years, the unemployment
rate is the lowest in the state, and welfare rolls have been cut 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Gulotta ... to his credit, didn't raise the general property tax for
eight of nine years," says County Comptroller Fred Parolla, also a Republican.
"So what you had was a shrinking or stabilized general property tax fund and
increasing burdens. Quite obviously, the way that we got here is that you have
escalating costs."
</P>
<P>
	   Only 19 percent of a Nassau homeowner's property tax bill comes from the
county, Gulotta said. The remainder comes from school, village and town taxes.
The county portion amounts to about $980 annually, Gulotta said.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest portion of the county levy goes for police protection. Parolla
said that with overtime, a police officer averages $110,000 annually. But
Gulotta noted that police salaries have risen because of binding arbitration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nassau refuses to give in during negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his party affiliation, Parolla thinks a Democratic takeover of the
Legislature may not be so bad.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people have spoken," he said. "They're angry. Nassau County is a joke.
It's one of the most affluent areas in the world to live, a wonderful place to
live, and yet you have this anomaly that the county government is in the red."
</P>
<P>
	   It remains to be seen how the Democratic victory in Nassau County will
affect the upcoming Senate race, but Jacobs agrees with those who think the
suburbs will be a key.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it throws us right into the ballgame," Jacobs said. "I think it
shows that the people of the suburbs have a very strong thought process. That
they will go either way. ... Nobody should be taken for granted, and nobody
should ever write us off."

<HEADLINE> Candidate Helps Chile's Right  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLA HUAPI, Chile (AP) -- Standing on an ox-drawn wagon in the heart of
Chile's Mapuche Indian region, presidential candidate Joaquin Lavin drew
applause from hundreds of potential voters as he promised to stand up for their
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will not forget you, the poorest of the poor,'' said Lavin, eliciting an
ovation from the Indians gathered about him. He went on in his trademark style,
promising to grant them subsidies so their children can finish high school and
pledging to back the price of their crops.
</P>
<P>
	   With such tactics, Lavin has become Chile's strongest right-wing
presidential hopeful in decades. He has posted gains in poor areas long
considered leftist domains, and his Jan. 16 runoff against socialist favorite
Ricardo Lagos is now too close to call.
</P>
<P>
	   With less than two weeks left to go before the election, Lavin is traveling
the length of this South American country, kissing children and women and
shaking hands with men.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the election's first round on Dec. 12, Lavin staged a number of
massive rallies, something alien to rightists in the past. The result: He pulled
off a shocker by holding Lagos, the center-left pro-government coalition's
candidate, to a virtual draw. That forced the runoff election to decide a
winner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know me,'' the almost boyish-looking candidate told residents of Isla
Huapi, an island in the middle of the Bidu salt lake, during a visit last week.
``I am not a man of words. I am a man of action and what I say I will do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Standing beside him, Mapuche chief Nicolas Paillan read a welcome speech --
mainly a litany of problems the poor community faces, from a lack of electricity
and running water to high unemployment and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
	   Quickly, Lavin asked Paillan for the handwritten pages of his speech. He
folded them into his pocket and said: ``I will take this with me to the
presidential palace and will come back here as president with the solutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin, 46, earned a reputation as a politician who gets things done while he
was mayor of Las Condes, a wealthy suburb of Chile's capital, Santiago. He
tackled problems ranging from pollution to crime. After a first term, he was
re-elected with an unprecedented 78 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   With Lavin, ``a new right is born,'' said backer Pablo Longueira, a Chilean
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos concedes he faces a formidable rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What people ask the most ... is about jobs, jobs, jobs,'' he said. ``The
right-wing candidate has assumed a correct position in that sense.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the runoff campaign, Lagos has followed his challenger's lead. Instead
of emphasizing political issues like changing the constitution inherited from
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, he has been talking about creating jobs
and curbing crime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, Lavin's foes called him a populist, a liar, a clown.
But he hardly answered, saying he doesn't have the time for ``small political
infighting.'' That strategy seems to have played well to Chile's voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chileans want to overcome the atmosphere of confrontation in which we have
lived for too long,'' said Francisco de la Masa, Lavin's campaign manager.
``People understand that fighting will not solve problems, and that knowing who
was wrong or who was right 15 or 20 years ago does not bring solutions.''

<HEADLINE> China UFO Sightings Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PUSALU VILLAGE, China (AP) -- Poor farmers in Beijing's barren hills saw it:
an object swathed in colored light arcing heavenward that some say must have
been a UFO.
</P>
<P>
	   They're not alone. People in 12 other Chinese cities reported possible UFO
sightings last month. UFO researchers, meanwhile, were busy looking into claims
of an alien abduction in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   At the beginning of the new millennium, China is astir with sightings of
otherworldly visitors. Such sightings are treated with unexpected seriousness in
this country usually straightjacketed by its communist rulers.
</P>
<P>
	   China has a bimonthly magazine -- circulation 400,000 -- devoted to UFO
research. The conservative state-run media report UFO sightings. UFO buffs claim
support from eminent scientists and liaisons with the secretive military, giving
their work a scientific sheen of respectability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of these sightings are real, some are fake and with others its
unclear,'' said Shen Shituan, a real rocket scientist, president of Beijing
Aerospace University and honorary director of the China UFO Research
Association. ``All these phenomena are worth researching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Research into UFOs will help spur new forms of high-speed travel, unlimited
sources of energy and faster-growing crops, claims Sun Shili, president of the
government-approved UFO Research Association (membership 50,000).
</P>
<P>
	   A foreign trade expert and a Spanish translator for Mao Tse-tung, Sun saw a
UFO nearly 30 years ago while at a labor camp for ideologically suspect
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was extremely bright and not very big,'' said Sun. ``At that time, I
had no knowledge of UFOs. I thought it was a probe sent by the Soviet
revisionists.''
</P>
<P>
	   For thousands of years, Chinese have looked to the skies for portents of
change on Earth. While China is passing through its first millennium using the
West's Gregorian calendar, the traditional lunar calendar is ushering in the
Year of the Dragon, regarded as time of tumultuous change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of that sort of millennial fear and trepidation fits in so nicely with
Chinese cosmology -- and also the Hollywood propaganda that everybody's been
lapping up,'' said Geremie Barme, a Chinese culture watcher at Australia
National University.
</P>
<P>
	   In Pusalu, a patch of struggling corn and bean farms 30 miles from Beijing,
villagers believe cosmic forces were at play on Dec. 11. As they tell it, an
object the size of a person shimmering with golden light moved slowly up into
the sky from the surrounding arid mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was so beautiful, sort of yellow,'' villager Wang Cunqiao said. ``It
was like someone flying up to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
	   What ``it'' was remains a topic of debate. Many villagers are fervent
Buddhists. But local leaders want to play down any religious overtones, fearing
that government censure may spoil plans to attract tourism to Pusalu.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some say it was caused by an earthquake. Some say it was a UFO. Some say
it was a ray of Buddha. I'm telling everyone to call it an auspicious sign,''
said Chen Jianwen, village secretary for the officially atheistic Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   State media ignored religious interpretations and labeled the celestial
events in Pusalu, Beijing, Shanghai and 10 other Chinese cities in December as
possible UFOs. But UFO researchers have largely dismissed the sightings as
airplane trails catching the low sun.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the military didn't chase it, it's because they knew it wasn't a UFO.
They were probably testing a new aircraft,'' said Chen Yanchun, a shipping
company executive who helps manage the China UFO Research Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating from a dingy three-room flat in a Beijing apartment block, the
Resource Center keeps a version of China's X-Files: 140 dictionary-sized boxes
of fading newspaper clippings and eyewitness accounts of sightings. The
collection has, among others items, accounts that the military scrambled planes
in 1998 in an unsuccessful pursuit of a UFO.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen said the center has had 500 reported UFO sightings in 1999, but after
investigation confirmed cases will likely number 200 or so. He's currently
checking on a worker's claims that aliens entered his Beijing home in early
December and, with his wife and child present, spirited him 165 miles east and
back in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The increase in flying saucer incidents is natural,'' said Chen, a former
Aerospace Ministry researcher with a Ph.D. in aerodynamics. He cited more
manmade aerospace activity and radio signals from Earth penetrating farther into
space.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun has another theory: He believes aliens may find China attractive for the
same reason foreign investors and tourists do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very possible that relatively rapid development attracts
investigations by flying saucers, and here in China we're becoming more
developed,'' he said. ``Generally, well-developed areas like the United States
have reported more sightings.''

<HEADLINE> Ivorians Line Up Behind Junta  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- It was supposed to be the oasis of stability in
volatile, coup-prone West Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   For more than 30 years, Ivory Coast's fondly regarded founding president,
Felix Houphouet-Boigny, presided over the tropical country rich in cocoa and
coffee. When he died in 1993, power passed nearly seamlessly to a subordinate,
Henri Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
	   Seemingly steadied against the political and economic upheavals rocking the
region, the nation of 19 million opened its borders to migrant workers and war
refugees from neighboring states. Thousands of nationals of the former colonial
power, France, also made their homes among Abidjan's skyscrapers, luxury
boutiques, four-star restaurants and leafy suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The comfortable complacency was shattered in three days of wild gunfire and
frenzied looting as former army chief Gen. Robert Guei seized power in a largely
bloodless Christmas Eve coup.
</P>
<P>
	   In the days that followed, Ivorians from all walks of life have lined up
behind the junta in hopes of regaining that lost sense of stability.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Bedie's own party, left leaderless when he fled to nearby Togo, has
offered its services in a transitional government until democracy is restored.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want Ivory Coast to become another banana republic,'' explained
Laurent Dona Fologo, secretary-general of Bedie's Democratic Party of Ivory
Coast. ``I am for stability.''
</P>
<P>
	   The takeover came during an economic decline brought on by falling coffee
and cocoa prices and a sharp rise in gas prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's credibility and coffers were dented even further when the
European Union and International Monetary Fund suspended aid this year over
corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Simultaneously, the country plunged into political crisis, with Bedie
attempting to silence opposition and block key rival Alassane Dramane Ouattara
from running in presidential elections promised for October.
</P>
<P>
	   News of the military takeover was greeted with jubilation in some Abidjan
neighborhoods, where dancing, cheering crowds took to the streets chanting, ``No
more Bedie!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He must just stay in Togo,'' said Azizi Ouattara, a trader at an Abidjan
market. ``He has ruined the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most call the coup a necessary -- and temporary -- step to get the country
back on the path of democracy and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bedie had to leave,'' said Maiq Ad, a university student. ``But if the
military holds on to power, it will be a bad thing. The worst civilian regime is
better than the best military one.''
</P>
<P>
	   One after another, all the major political parties went on national
television to declare support for the junta, which calls itself the National
Committee of Public Salvation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ivory Coast was built on freedom, dialogue and respect for republican
values,'' said Ouattara, who returned from exile after the takeover and promptly
offered his services in an interim government. ``It will manage to remain, I am
convinced, loyal to these principles.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guei insists he isn't interested in power and intervened only to save Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   He has promised a new constitution, an interim coalition government
involving politicians, and elections to return the country to civilian rule. But
he has yet to say when.
</P>
<P>
	   He has also taken pains to reassure the Baoule and Akan tribes, which had
dominated politically through the former ruling party since independence in
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Portraying the takeover as a return to the principles of peace, tolerance
and unity preached by Houphouet-Boigny, Guei even traveled to the capital,
Yamoussoukro, in the Baoule heartland to pay his respects at the founding
father's grave.
</P>
<P>
	   But Guei also detained more than a dozen former ministers and top military
officials, and he asked a Muslim religious council considered loyal to Bedie to
dissolve.
</P>
<P>
	   Western diplomats have cautiously praised Guei. The United States and
Canada, however, have suspended aid until civilian rule is restored. France is
scaling back its support.
</P>
<P>
	   Guei has acknowledged state coffers are empty and the country will need
foreign help.
</P>
<P>
	   More important, the country won't qualify for desperately needed foreign
debt relief until it can demonstrate a record of fiscal control and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the circumstances, at least some Ivorians -- and neighboring West
African leaders -- worry that one coup could lead to others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are entering an infernal cycle,'' said Collette Nguessan, an Abidjan
resident and supporter of Bedie's party. ``If they wanted change, it should have
been through the ballot box.''

<HEADLINE> 20th Century Spawned New Foods  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- It was the century that spawned Spam (marketed in 1937),
developed Dr. Pepper (1904), and produced Peter Pan Peanut Butter (1928).
Without the 20th century, we'd have no Marshmallow Fluff, no Hostess Twinkies,
and no lite beer.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the mass-marketed products that have filled our supermarket
aisles, the last 100 years have also brought us a world of cuisines to choose
from when we go out to eat. Health and balance also are bigger priorities than
they were in 1900.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Produce is better, selection is better, accessibility to good food is
better,'' said chef Julia Child. ``For people who like to eat, I think we've
made tremendous progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the 19th century, American food was strongly influenced by
European tastes -- heavy on beef and potatoes. But with the great influx of
immigrants in the early 1900s, all that changed, said Donna Gabaccia, author of
``We Are What We Eat'' and a professor of American history at the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans tend to take a kind of curious, open approach to eating,''
Gabaccia said. ``They might not like everything -- we eat burritos but we don't
eat menudo (which includes tripe) -- but that openness to eating seems
particularly pronounced in this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today Americans can choose from among myriad ethnic foods, from Caribbean to
Ethiopian, not only at restaurants in every state, but also at the corner
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberta Dowling, founder of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts, predicts
that fusion foods like French-Cambodian that blend exotic tastes together will
continue to be popular.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, it's become almost a status symbol to say `Wow, I ate at such and
such a place and do you know what I ate?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Such variety and quality in food wasn't always available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the '40s and '50s we had terribly strange foods -- just mounds and
mounds of Jell-O,'' said Child, who became a household name in 1963 with her
cooking show, ``The French Chef.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remember in the 1950s seeing a Jell-O aspic shaped like an upright
banana -- terribly phallic, you know -- with marshmallows, grapes and bananas,
then squirted with Reddi-wip. You don't see that anymore, thank heaven.''
</P>
<P>
	   Food products introduced throughout the last 100 years frequently reflected
the spirit of the time, according to a list Bon Appetit magazine compiled for a
recent issue dedicated to the century in food.
</P>
<P>
	   The first decade of the 1900s saw the introduction of Hershey chocolate bars
(1900) and staples such as French's mustard (1904) and Kellogg's Corn Flakes
(1906). The hamburger was introduced to America by German immigrants and became
popular in city diners.
</P>
<P>
	   The Depression created a need for cheap, practical foods. Spam was created
in 1937, the same year as Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese dinner. And in an effort
to convey style and elegance during a time that was anything but glamorous for
most people, the Ritz cracker was introduced simply as the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
	   As the U.S. economy rebounded after World War II, fast food chains cropped
up: Kentucky Fried Chicken was born in 1952 in Salt Lake City; Burger King in
Miami in 1954; Little Caesars arrived in 1959 in Garden City, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooking was made easier in the 1960s and '70s with the introduction of Shake
'N Bake (1965) and Hamburger Helper (1970).
</P>
<P>
	   In the self-conscious 1980s and '90s, healthy foods dominated the market.
Americans substituted chicken for beef and skim or low-fat dairy products for
whole-fat items. Lean Cuisine dinners were marketed in 1981; in 1998, Frito-Lay
produced WOW!, its fat-free potato chip.
</P>
<P>
	   Food experts predict the healthy eating trend will continue, but many hope
it doesn't get in the way of the enjoyment of food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a shame to adulterate foods just because of dietary
restrictions,'' Child said. ``Food should not only be the stuff of life, but
thoroughly enjoyable as well.''

<HEADLINE> Reunion Remembered 50 Years Later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Vt. (AP) -- One day in 1949, Glenn Skiff was talking to his
Cambridge High School science students about time and space.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He talked about the year 2000,'' said Louise Lafountain, then a
13-year-old ninth-grader named Louise Sanborn. ``I said, `What do you care; you
won't be here.' He said, `Excuse me, young lady.' I thought I'd soften it a
little and said, `None of us will be here.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The two then made a pact: At noon on Jan. 1, 2000, they'd meet on the front
steps of what was then Murray Noble's general store on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Lafountain was there Saturday with tears in her eyes. Skiff had
suffered a stroke and died just hours earlier. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   His son, Bill, said Glenn Skiff, known to most people as ``Pappy'' because
of his fatherly manner, had been anticipating New Year's Day 2000 for a half
century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, Dad had a wonderful life,'' he said. ``He went to sleep
(Friday) night looking forward to a reunion the next day. That's pretty nice to
think about.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion became a bittersweet tribute, with about 15 of Skiff's former
students sharing memories of him as they stood on the steps of the old general
store -- now an antiques shop.
</P>
<P>
	   Skiff worked as an insurance agent and farmer before getting into teaching
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Skiff said his lean, bespectacled father called himself the ``cleanup
man,'' because he taught everything at tiny Cambridge High -- science, English,
social studies, even physical education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He always kept your attention,'' said Peg Machia, who had Skiff as a
teacher in the 1950s and remembers that he always sat on the corner of his desk
closest to his students. ``He was just a part of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The school had no library, so the ``cleanup man'' and his wife, Marjorie,
cleaned up an old coal bin at the school and bought some books to fill it. Mrs.
Skiff died seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Skiff and Mrs. Lafountain stayed in touch through the years, occasionally
reminding one another: 20 years, 10 years, five years until the reunion.

	   Bill Skiff called Mrs. Lafountain at home Saturday morning to say his father
had died at about 7:30 a.m. She went to the old Noble's store anyway, to share
the news.
</P>

	   ``I didn't expect to be here,'' said Pat Bacon Gressitt, 74, of Atlantic
Highlands, N.J. ``I partied a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Gressit met up with Dotty Gray Zerzavy, Dottie Berlet Warfield and her
husband and Katherine Bunch Ginder and her husband. A fifth classmate from
Eastern High School came along as a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the women kept in touch over the years. For years, nobody knew what
had become of Ms. Zerzavy, until she showed up at the 55th Eastern reunion in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Warfield, who turns 72 this month, said that as a teen-ager, she could
not imagine the plan without imagining herself ``very, very old, infirm even ...
Dressed in old clothes, a black dress maybe and a little pink flower. In those
days, when you were 70, you were really, really old.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reality: ``much better than I anticipated,'' she said. I mean, we're
doing fine.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Party Again Jan. 1  </HEADLINE>
   By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- The tree-trunk bouncers in the black suits were
deployed and glowering appropriately. The bourbons and scotches and rums,
drained to the last drop the night before, were ready for action once more.
</P>
<P>
	   The music was pulsating, and Brian Rosenberg was ready -- weary, but ready.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenberg, general manager of The Dallenger, a club in the Garden City
Hotel, had a year to prepare for Dec. 31, 1999 -- the world's forever-ballyhooed
Party of the Century. But for Jan. 1, 2000, he'd had only about 12 hours to
recoup and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tonight,'' he said late Saturday in the club's VIP section, ``is when you
see your real clubgoer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thus begs the question: After you've partied like it's 1999, what could
possibly be next?
</P>
<P>
	   On the night after The Night, Americans re-emerged onto social scenes in
different ways. Sure, some crept tentatively from hangover beds. But some had
kept it low-key on millennium eve and didn't need recovery time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't like going out on amateur night,'' scoffed Kevin O'Neill, 37, an
X-ray technician from Pittsburgh's Monroeville suburb, mounting his Harley to
leave one bar for another. He celebrated a day late because he thought New
Year's Eve partiers would be too reckless.
</P>
<P>
	   There were football bowl games that provided party opportunities. And in
Philadelphia, the fabled Mummers Parade, a woolly daylong festival of dancing
and strutting and indulging, convened for the 100th time New Year's Day with its
usual zeal.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cleveland, arena rock made for some earnest Jan. 1 partying with
heavy-metal band Metallica, which played the Gund Arena. Some said they kept it
cool New Year's Eve to be fresh for the show.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't think of a better way to start 2000,'' Dave Kappa of Cleveland
said between sips of beer.
</P>
<P>
	   Garden City, a wealthy New York City suburb on Long Island, is hardly a
party town on regular days. The exception is The Dallenger, where people began
streaming in around 11 p.m. Saturday -- 50 in less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   They found a spotless club risen from the New Year's Eve ashes, thanks to
Rosenberg's staff, who holed up in the hotel to prepare. This isn't surprising
to hear; Rosenberg gives employees copies of Sun Tzu's Art of War'' when he
hires them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This day,'' he acknowledged, sipping spring water and checking his
walkie-talkie, ``was a real challenge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in town, it was even quieter than usual early Sunday. On Franklin
Avenue, the main drag, a handful of people milled around outside Leo's, the only
bar that appeared open. Another bar-restaurant, Maxwell's, was shuttered for the
night just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   At Leo's, a comfortable crowd of 20, many of them old high-school buddies,
drank and talked in mellow tones. Many regulars were absent. ``Everybody had
parties out in the Hamptons. Half of 'em are probably in jail,'' said bartender
Jack Agnew, laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the bar, a cluster of volunteer firefighters talked of being
told to ``take it easy'' on New Year's Eve, given the fears of Y2K chaos. New
Year's Eve ``just felt like another night,'' said Charles Cavarra, a contractor
and volunteer fireman. ``It's more relaxing tonight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Durand, a Manhattan trader who grew up in Garden City and still lives
there, spent New Year's Day partying at the Garden City Men's Club. By midnight,
he was closing out the millennium's first day at Leo's with his brothers,
pink-cheeked and collegial and pounding beers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm here now. That's what matters,'' he said. ``Forget about last night.''

<HEADLINE> Asia Markets Show No Y2K Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- As major Asian financial markets opened Monday for their first
trading of the new millennium, no Y2K problems were reported, and two major
stock exchanges in Asia quickly set new records.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trading has been fairly smooth so far," said John Yap, a dealer in
Singapore. "There's been no indication of any glitches. Trading has been as
smooth as we had hoped."
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark Straits Times index was up 22.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to
2,502.28 four minutes after opening, continuing the bullish trading of the past
two weeks. The index closed Thursday at a previous all-time high of 2,479.58
points.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first 15 minutes of trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped
183.44 points, or 1.1 percent, to 17,145.54, to reach another new record. The
index also had set an all-time high on Thursday, during the last trading of
1999, by reaching 16,962.10.
</P>
<P>
	   No Y2K glitches were reported on the stock exchange, which had conducted a
problem-free test run of simulating trading on Saturday, a move that left many
traders optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Local sentiment can't get any better," Alex Wong, research manager at OSK
Securities Ltd., said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's stock exchange, the other main one in Asia, will not reopen in the
new year until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board
of Trade also opened electronic trading on Sunday evening without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
	   Two smaller stock exchanges in Malaysia and the Philippines also opened
trading Monday with no reported Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysia's Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, surged to
830.65 points by midday -- up 18 points, or 2.3 percent, from Thursday's close
of trading for 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Phua Lee Kerk, head of research at Jupiter Securities in Malaysia, said
"overblown" concerns about Y2K glitches paralyzed many investors in Southeast
Asia last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now they fear they have to come back and catch the train and that's why the
markets have had quite a run today," Phua said.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Allies Keep Working  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM IRWIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Once known as ``Dr. Death'' in his passionate crusade for
physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Jack Kevorkian these days is Inmate No. 284797
in a remote Michigan prison where he serves time for murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevorkian's sentencing in April ended a saga in which the retired
pathologist sometimes left bodies at motels, coroners' offices and hospital
emergency rooms; burned state orders against him; showed up at court in costume,
and challenged authorities to make his actions legal -- or stop him.
</P>
<P>
	   But while assisted suicide's most visible advocate has been silenced,
activists on both sides say their efforts continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters point to legal and legislative efforts in several states to give
people the right to choose when and how their lives will end.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents, led by the medical establishment, say they are working to make it
easier to treat debilitating pain effectively and make suicide, with or without
a physician's involvement, less appealing.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides agree that Kevorkian sparked their efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevorkian ``had the very positive effect of galvanizing a lot of people,
making them see what horrible straits some people were in,'' said Estelle
Rogers, executive director of the Death with Dignity National Center, a
right-to-die lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Having Jack Kevorkian finally be convicted was a great success,'' said Cal
Montgomery, a policy analyst with Not Dead Yet, a Forest Park, Ill.-based
advocacy group for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
	   By Kevorkian's count, he assisted in 130 deaths since helping Alzheimer's
patient Janet Adkins die in his rusted Volkswagen van in 1990. Four felony
trials resulted in three acquittals and a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
	   Then in September 1998, Kevorkian videotaped himself injecting a lethal mix
of barbiturates into 52-year-old Thomas Youk, immobilized by Lou Gehrig's
disease. Kevorkian gave the tape to ``60 Minutes,'' which broadcast parts of it
two months later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got to force them to act,'' Kevorkian said on the CBS program. ``They
must charge me. Because if they do not, that means they don't think it was a
crime ...''
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities did act, charging Kevorkian with first-degree murder and other
charges. He insisted on serving as his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer?'' Kevorkian
asked jurors. ``... If you do, then you must convict.''
</P>
<P>
	   And so they did, finding Kevorkian, 71, guilty of second-degree murder and
delivery of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to 10 years to 25 years in
prison, time he is serving at the Kinross Correctional Facility in the Upper
Peninsula. He will become eligible for parole in May 2007.
</P>
<P>
	   He no longer wants to talk to the media. He shares a room with two other
inmates and passes his time reading.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if Kevorkian were not in prison, said his attorney, Mayer Morganroth,
``he feels that ... he would not assist with suicides any longer, and the courts
are now the appropriate place for the issue to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan's ban on assisted suicide is being challenged in court by Robert
Sedler, a professor of constitutional law at Wayne State University in Detroit.
Sedler's federal lawsuit claims that the 14th Amendment includes the right ``to
be relieved from unbearable pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suit was filed on behalf of a family practitioner in Pontiac and an
internist in Grand Blanc, neither of whom is treating patients with intractable
pain, Sedler said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to be allowed ahead of time to help end their (patients')
suffering if they think it's medically appropriate,'' he said. ``They can't do
it because if they did, they would end up like Dr. Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Michigan State Medical Society formed a Task Force on End of Life Care
after the 1998 defeat of Proposal B, a statewide referendum on whether to
legalize assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rather than say that's the end of the issue, a lot of physicians with the
State Medical Society felt that what the public was saying was that they were
concerned about end-of-life issues,'' said its chair, Flint pathologist Dr.
Cathy Blight.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force's mission includes educating doctors about more effective
ways to treat pain, and educating the public about hospice care, living wills
and other ways of dealing with terminal illness, Blight said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Oregon is the experiment for physician-assisted dying, she said, ``let's
have Michigan be the experiment in physician-assisted living.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assisted suicide has been legal for several years in Oregon. Right-to-die
legislation is pending in states including New Hampshire and California. The
issue will be on the 2000 ballot in Maine unless lawmakers legalize the
practice.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. House in late October approved the Pain Relief Promotion Act, which
would make it a federal crime to use suicide drugs to intentionally end a
patient's life. It also would provide a new legal defense for doctors who
unintentionally end patients' lives with large doses of pain relievers.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill has the American Medical Association's overall support, although
the group is lobbying for changes that it says would make doctors, not the
government, responsible for pain management.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Packers Fire Rhodes, Staff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers fired first-year coach Ray
Rhodes and his entire staff after the team failed to make the NFL playoffs for
the first time in seven years, according to reports Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ESPN and WFRV-TV, the CBS affiliate in Green Bay, reported Rhodes' firing.
Phones calls by The Associated Press to team president Bob Harlan and general
manager Ron Wolf were not returned Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Packers quarterbacks coach Mike McCarthy and tight ends coach Jeff
Jagodzinski both refused to confirm the reports late Sunday night, though
McCarthy indicated he had spoken with his "coaching colleagues" about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be able to talk about this at a later date," McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive line coach Larry Beightol was seen removing materials from his
office at Lambeau Field late Sunday night, and the Packers' public relations
staff could be seen working well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Two players, Vonnie Holliday and Anthony Davis, said they were unaware of
any firings. None of the coaches indicated they had any knowledge of their
firings when they left the stadium after Sunday's season-ending 49-24 victory
over the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure they'll sit down and evaluate the coaches and see if they can't
make some decisions," offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said before leaving
the stadium. "We'll just wait and see."
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes was hired almost exactly one year ago to replace Mike Holmgren, who
led the Packers to two Super Bowls and one NFL championship during the
franchise's return to prominence. In January, Holmgren left Green Bay after
seven seasons to become the coach and general manager of the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci was thought to be
Wolf's first choice for the job. A native of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and a
former Packers quarterbacks coach under Holmgren, Mariucci instead signed a
contract extension with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf then hired Rhodes, who was also a former Green Bay assistant under
Holmgren. With Lewis and defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas, the Packers
fielded the NFL's first coaching staff in which the three major positions were
filled by African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ESPN quoted sources as saying Rhodes was informed of the decision following
the team's win. A victory by Dallas over the New York Giants later Sunday
eliminated Green Bay (8-8) from postseason contention on a conference
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
	   An official announcement is expected Monday, ESPN said. Less than a month
ago, Wolf dismissed as "ludicrous" the idea that he would fire Rhodes after his
first season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody feels bad about the way things have gone this season," Rhodes
said after the Packers were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed that we didn't get the help we needed today from the
Giants. It's tough to have your season end the way it has, watching Dallas win a
game on television. But we have no one to blame but ourselves -- we got in this
situation by not taking advantage of some opportunities we had earlier this
season."

<P>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes beat Italy's
Prada by 1 minute, 7 seconds Monday to improve to 2-0 in the America's Cup
challenger semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes, which opened the semifinals Sunday with a 55-second victory
over Nippon, is the lone undefeated yacht after the first two rounds of the
six-boat competition.
</P>
<P>
	Each boat sails twice against the other syndicates, with the top two teams
advancing to a nine-race series. The winner will face Team New Zealand for the
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	In other races Monday, America True beat AmericaOne by 2 minutes, 23 seconds,
and Nippon edged Le Defi Francais by 38 seconds. America True, Prada, AmericaOne
and Nippon are 1-1, while Le Defi Francais is 0-2.
</P>
<P>
	After a lackluster opening to the Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals Sunday, strong
wind conditions returned to the inner Hauraki Gulf on Monday. The winds were
from the southwest steadily between 18 and 20 knots, with gusts to 25 knots, and
choppy seas.
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high winds and chop, the offshore breeze kept the seaway down, and
the powerful sloops rollicked in the conditions to produce three exciting races.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne was in control against America True until a problem with the
headfoil at the beginning of the last beat handed the race to Dawn Riley's
America True.
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Stars and Stripes will face Le Defi Francais. America True will
race Nippon, and Prada will face AmericaOne.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Freshmen Crucial in Fiesta Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG ALDEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Nebraska tight end Aaron Golliday thought Tennessee was
prepared, maybe too prepared, for the Cornhuskers' option offense.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers seemed to forget about Golliday and fellow redshirt freshman
Jon Bowling, who caught several key passes while filling in for injured All-Big
12 tight end Tracey Wistrom in Nebraska's 31-21 victory in the Fiesta Bowl on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "They prepared hard for our option. When the guys start keying on our I-back
or our fullback it's easy to slip a receiver down field -- especially a big fat
one who looks like a lineman," said Golliday, who caught a 13-yard touchdown
pass from Eric Crouch in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Golliday and Bowling gave Crouch an extra target when he needed it while
passing for 148 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The sixth-ranked Volunteers (9-3) scored two straight touchdowns to cut
Nebraska's lead to 17-14 and had the Huskers facing a third-and-13 at their own
23-yard line. Crouch found Bowling alone near the sideline for a 17-yard gain
and a first down.
</P>
<P>
	   Third-ranked Nebraska (12-1) got a 47-yard run from fullback Willie Miller
then Golliday caught a 13-yard pass from Crouch to put the Huskers up 24-14 with
4:44 left in the third. Golliday's catch capped a 9-play, 96-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska, which added a 99-yard touchdown drive on its next possession,
didn't throw another pass in the game after Golliday's TD.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had all the momentum," Bowling said. "It took all the air out of them.
They couldn't stop us."
</P>
<P>
	   Wistrom, who was third on the Huskers with 16 catches, has been out since
Nov. 29, after partially tearing a knee ligament during practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Golliday caught two passes for 45 yards, giving him five catches for the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowling, who didn't have a catch this season until making two while playing
for Wistrom in the Big 12 championship against Texas on Dec. 4, had two catches
for 25 yards. He caught a 28-yard pass from Crouch in the first quarter.
Nebraska didn't score on that drive, but pinned Tennessee at the 5-yard line.
The Volunteers went three-and-out and Nebraska's Bobby Newcombe returned the
punt 60 yards for a touchdown, giving the Huskers a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "The tight end is an important position in this offense, so we knew we were
going to have the chance to make some big plays," Bowling said.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Overmatched by Neb. Again  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- There were no happy returns for Tennessee in the Fiesta
Bowl. Not with an opponent like No. 3 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing on the same field where they won the national championship last year
by beating Florida State 23-16, the No. 6 Volunteers fell to Nebraska 31-21 on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers (12-1) moved the ball almost at will, clinching the victory
with 96- and 99-yard touchdown drives in the second half. And, despite Tee
Martin's 19-for-34, 223-yard passing game, the Huskers controlled the damage
with breathtaking defensive speed.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin finished his career 22-3 as a starter, and is the fourth-best passer
in Tennessee history in yardage (4,592) and TD passes (32).
</P>
<P>
	   He also ran for more scores (16) than any Tennessee quarterback. But he
threw only one of two scoring passes for his team against Nebraska -- a 9-yard
strike to Donte' Stallworth that cut the Huskers lead to 17-7 at halftime -- and
had two passes intercepted.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew it was big in their game plan to keep me in the pocket, not allow me
to get outside," Martin said. "It was good on their part for a game plan. I got
tripped a couple, grabbed a couple more times. Their guys just play hard,
crawling, scratching, whatever they have to do."
</P>
<P>
	   When Stallworth made his second scoring catch, with 7:25 left in the game,
it was thrown by wide receiver Cedrick Wilson after a lateral from Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   "First of all, we took the running game away from them, and they began
passing the ball a lot" Huskers cornerback Mike Brown said. "They had good
schemes where they were able to make some big plays, but we stopped some of
them."
</P>
<P>
	   The game might have been tailback Jamal Lewis' last for Tennessee. He is
considering leaving school early for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   Stallworth said Travis Henry, who had 31 yards on 10 carries, and redshirt
Travis Stephens could fill in if Lewis leaves.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a great leader," Stallworth said. "I kind of consider him a brother.
But If we lose him, that's where recruiting comes in. Whenever you lose someone
of Jamal's caliber, you've got to have someone step up, and Travis (Henry)
stepped up last year when Jamal went down."
</P>
<P>
	   There was disappointment for Tennessee after the 1997 season, when Nebraska
won a share of the national title by beating the Vols 42-17 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Phillip Fulmer said good things came out of the experience.
</P>

fine year," Fulmer said. "Maybe we can do the same thing."

<HEADLINE> Huskers DC Retires After Fiesta Bowl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- After 23 years as an assistant coach at Nebraska,
defensive coordinator Charlie McBride announced his retirement Sunday night
after the Cornhuskers' 31-21 victory over Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love my family very much, and I think it's time for them," McBride said,
his voice choked with emotion, "so I'm going to pull the plug. I just want to
thank everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   McBride, 60, tried to keep his decision from his team before the game, but
defensive back Mike Brown said he and a few other players found out about it.
After the game, McBride called his players into a huddle and told them he was
leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   "My first win was when I was coaching at Arizona State with Frank Kush at
this stadium," McBride said, "My last win was here too, and it meant so much to
me. If you could only know the players that I've had over the years, especially
this group.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a special group, folks. They're self-motivated. I honestly love
them."
</P>
<P>
	   McBride has spent 18 seasons in charge of the defensive unit known
throughout college football as the "Blackshirts" because that's what the
defensive players wear in practice.
</P>
<P>
	   His last Nebraska team ranked fourth nationally in total defense, second in
pass efficiency defense, third in scoring defense and fourth in total defense.

<HEADLINE> Crisis-Free Y2K Could Boost Markets  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stock market averages powered their way to record
highs as 1999 ended despite some lingering worries about the Year 2000 computer
conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with market officials around the world reporting no major system
troubles, many analysts expect stocks to soar anew.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could see a new wave of money coming into the market based entirely on
the good news about Y2K," said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for
equities at State Street Research and Management Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   All major U.S. stock market indicators ended 1999 at record highs, with the
Nasdaq composite index capping a spectacular rise of nearly 86 percent for the
year. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 all
completed an unprecedented fifth straight year of double-digit percentage gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Many major world stock market indicators also are beginning the new year at
all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
	   This weekend's smooth sailing on Y2K removed one obstacle to a continued
stock-buying binge.
</P>
<P>
	   Market analysts and Y2K gurus caution that the full impact of the computer
conversion isn't known yet, and may not be clear for days or weeks. But weekend
tests and early trading in Asia Monday showed little evidence of the problems
many had feared.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, banks, stock exchanges and other financial services companies
said their systems were fully operational on Saturday and will be ready for
business on Monday. The 48 organizations reporting to the Financial Services
Coordination and Communication Center also includes electronic communications
networks, which trade stocks online, and government securities dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore opened for trading
Monday with no problems reported from the Y2K bug. In Tokyo, a few brokerages
reported glitches in a record-keeping system over the weekend, but officials
expected the problem to be fixed before trading reopens on Japanese markets on
Tuesday. Tokyo markets were closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kuwait Stock Exchange offered one of the first true tests, opening for a
full trading session on Sunday. Safaak al-Rukeibi, deputy general manager, told
the Kuwait News Agency that "all trading operations were normal and there were
no problems whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
	   Market officials in Cairo and Rome also proclaimed their readiness for
trading this week. That's good news to market watchers in the United States, who
believe businesses and financial exchanges here are the best prepared in the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. and Europe have been aware of Y2K for far too long, and have spent
far too much money, to have left things unchecked," Weiss said. "Most big
systems have been subjected to three to six months of testing, and should be
more than ready."
</P>
<P>
	   With market enthusiasm running high, a smooth conversion could provide some
extra punch, Weiss added.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has been a bit of a cautionary approach in the way investors have
allocated new money," he said, citing an influx of money into more conservative
money market funds. That could change if investors perceive the successful
conversion to Y2K as reason to pour money into the buoyant market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the next few weeks, the market will also face a host of seasonal factors
that could be magnified in the wake of Y2K, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first couple of months of the year are generally good months for the
market as year-end bonuses and tax refunds are put into investments," said
Charles G. Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management. "This year,
the IRS may be working overtime to get refunds back to people early and prove
that they had no Y2K-related difficulties."
</P>
<P>
	   Year 2000 worries, however, aren't the market's only concern. The market's
course in early 2000 will be determined largely by the Federal Reserve. The Fed,
highly concerned about the scorching pace of economic growth, raised interest
rates three times in 1999 but left rates unchanged at their last meeting of the
year, saying they wanted to help ensure a smooth transition into Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   The glitch-free conversion could encourage the Fed to resume tightening
rates as soon as their next meeting, scheduled for Feb. 1 and 2, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The consensus is that they'll raise rates 25 basis points," or a
quarter-percentage point, said Crane. "There's a growing view that they could go
as far as 50 basis points."
</P>
<P>
	   An increase of 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, would be the
steepest increase in the federal funds rate since a boost from 5.50 percent to
6.0 percent on Feb. 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Another possible tightening of credit could come if the Fed, as expected,
starts draining billions of dollars from the banking system. The Fed had been
generous in providing banks with extra cash in advance of the year 2000 in
anticipation that consumers would be making bigger-than-usual withdrawals to
prepare for any problems with automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
	   With no big runs on bank accounts, that surplus money is expected to be
removed from the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expect the next few weeks to bring a modest reversal of
fortunes for U.S. stock sectors. Technology shares, which soared in the last
half of the year, may finally be ripe for some profit-taking, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors would have loved to have booked their profits in recent weeks,
but many held off to avoid tax penalties," he said. Selling now would allow
investors to pay capital-gains taxes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, many of the sectors neglected in the frenzy for
technology shares could rebound, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been in a very selective market," he said. "But we believe the market
is ready to broaden out."

<HEADLINE> Syrians Focus on Assad's Son  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA BRYSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QARDAHA, Syria (AP) -- A smooth, wide road leads from the Syrian coast to
the hills where the president was born, where his eldest son is buried, and
where many Syrians nurture their hopes for the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
	   Basil Assad, the son buried in the Qardaha hills, was widely believed to
have been President Hafez Assad's choice to succeed him to power. Since Basil
Assad died in a 1994 car crash, the heir apparent has become the next brother,
whom most Syrians simply call Dr. Bashar.
</P>
<P>
	   A 34-year-old with a neat mustache and a serious air, Bashar Assad gave up
an ophthalmology practice to enter the Machiavellian arena of Syrian politics
upon his brother's death. He brushed up on military training and became an army
colonel, began traveling the region as his father's envoy and took on several
quasi-official roles his brother had held.
</P>
<P>
	   His 69-year-old father has been the only president many here have known.
Hafez Assad ruthlessly put down any challenges for nearly three decades and
propounded a form of socialism that cemented the people's dependence on his
state. Now it seems few Syrians can imagine their country without an Assad in
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Recurring rumors that the president is in poor health increase the attention
once paid to Basil and now focused on Bashar. And with Israeli-Syrian peace
talks under way -- a second round starts outside Washington today -- Bashar
Assad will be watched even more closely.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run media carry constant praise of Assad and his sons, usually
referring to the late Basil Assad as ``the Hero'' and his brother as ``the
Hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Basil Assad's grave, perched on a hilltop with a view of the 70 or so
villages that make up Qardaha district, similar praise is heard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Syrian president has done so much for the Syrian people. Basil did,
too. And now Dr. Bashar is doing what Basil did,'' said Hadla Khaliji, who
manages a government-run sports club in Damascus and comes to the grave once a
year to pay her respects.
</P>
<P>
	   At least a quarter of the Syrian labor force works, like Khaliji, for the
government. The president ordered the building of roads to once isolated areas
such as Qardaha, as well as public works projects from stadiums to electrical
plants across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   When he was young, Hafez Assad had to descend to the coastal city of Latakia
to go to school. Every village in Qardaha now has an elementary school, and the
region boasts three middle schools, two high schools and a technical college.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad also is credited with bringing political stability to Syria. The
country saw repeated coups after independence from France in 1946; Assad's coup
in 1970 was the last.
</P>
<P>
	   The loyalty the president enjoys and the extent to which it embraces other
members of his family cannot be underestimated, said Yezid Sayigh, a Middle East
expert at London's International Center for Strategic Studies. If Hafez Assad's
successor is not his son, it is likely to be ``some other member of the family
... or of the wider clan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hafez Assad's younger brother Rifaat tried and failed to grab power in the
1980s and now seems sidelined. He broadcasts criticism of the government on a
television station his son runs in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Bashar Assad has three younger brothers. He also has an older sister whom
his father's biographer has described as the favorite child, but a woman is
unlikely to come to power in this tradition-bound region. In addition, Syria has
several powerful politicians -- including three vice presidents -- who might one
day decide to test their own popularity against the Assad family mystique.
</P>
<P>
	   Bashar Assad has a high public profile as head of an anti-corruption
campaign and a group promoting the use of computers in Syria. In November, he
was welcomed by French President Jacques Chirac as his father's envoy on Middle
East peacemaking. With Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa recovering from
heart surgery, Bashar Assad also has traveled extensively in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   He is clearly his father's choice, but it is less clear how he is seen by
other high-ranking Syrians. The government line is that it is up to the
hierarchy to decide whether Bashar Assad's role becomes official.
</P>
<P>
	   The constitution requires that a president be at least 40. Bashar Assad is
six years short of that, and he is not a member of the Baath Party command
council, another prerequisite to being president.
</P>
<P>
	   More importantly, he has had little time to build a following in the army,
the base of his father's support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not looking for a position, but if there were a designation from the
leadership or the party rank and file to be in some position, I am ready,''
Bashar Assad told the Lebanese newspaper Al-Kifah Al-Arabi earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Clergy Incorporate 2000 Into Sermons  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Standing before their congregations at a time of introspection and optimism,
ministers across the country called the year 2000 a fresh chance for peace,
compassion and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
	   From coast to coast on Sunday, the new millennium was a common theme at
church, with many of the clergy using the opportunity to tell parishioners to
forget about computers and think about God.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question should not be whether you are Y2K-ready, but whether you are
heaven-ready,'' said the Rev. Larry Davis, pastor of First Baptist Church of
Cold Spring, Ky., near Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   John Fiedler, senior minister at First United Methodist Church in Dallas,
told his congregation the growing fear of Y2K problems had reached a fever pitch
-- likely fueling misguided concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Perhaps you had a similar experience to mine on Saturday morning,''
Fiedler said at the start of his sermon. ``You got up early and went outside,
and you were just delighted to note that the trees and the sun and the clouds
were all Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fiedler added that the dawning of 2000 means Christians worldwide should
``get back to the business of waging peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Rick VanWey of the Beulah Church of the Nazarene in Beulah, N.D.,
said so much time and energy was spent preparing for Y2K ``that we've almost
missed the sense that the return of Christ is imminent, and it's far more of
importance than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Church of the Nativity in Dothan, Ala., choir member Sam Flowers said
a ``special awakening'' is beginning now that 2000 is here and most people are
through fretting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of technology, people are going to start looking at the spiritual
divisiveness which technology caused,'' Ms. Flowers said. ``Hopefully the
institutional church can keep pace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Across the country in Los Angeles, the Rev. Arshag Khatchadourian of St.
James Armenian Church said technology could work for the church in the new
century. Television and the Internet are uniting people and igniting a spiritual
awakening, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are finding out we have the same problems, we have the same concerns,
we have the same yearnings and we have to support one another,'' Khatchadourian
said. ``Our sufferings will make us come together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastor Jay Wolf at the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala., avoided
mention of the year 2000 or Y2K, but told his congregation to ``plug in'' to God
for a ``consistent power source.''
</P>
<P>
	   The church launched ``Y2Pray,'' a project to focus on the congregation's
prayer requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouncing around the church and wiping sweat from his brow, the Rev. John
Johnson encouraged churchgoers in Richmond, Va. to take advantage of the fresh
start of a new century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is the day, the beginning of the new year, to start off on the right
foot,'' Johnson said at the Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You need a spiritual boost now and then and a new millennium is definitely
that,'' said the Rev. Richard Ryan, who participated in services at the Catholic
Church of St. Joachim and St. Anne in Sun City, Ariz., where a foot-long
millennium candle was lighted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a reminder that things in the past are past. That includes guilt, sin
and the mistakes we've made. Psychologically it's a new start, a chance to do
things right,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Rev. James E. Victor Jr, assistant pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist
Church in Atlanta, the awe was in seeing what the world could achieve.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the world got its groove on the 31st and had a worldwide party ... we
saw no episodes of violence across the world. We got a sense of what could be,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Oklahoma City, thousands of Catholics gathered for a jubilee to renew
their faith in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
	   Rushing to meet a friend before the afternoon Mass, Gloria Schulte said she
believes the new millennium will be a time of spiritual growth. ``I think the
church is going to grow -- find more people,'' she said. ``It's a chance for
people to return to their roots.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of a Y2K catastrophe was reassurance from above for the Rev. Isaac
Wayne Stuart of the Friendship Baptist Church in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were rest assured that God is still God and would continue to be into
Y3K, Y4K and on,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Farm Policy To Be an Issue for 2000  </HEADLINE>
    By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chairmen of key congressional committees disagree on
whether farm policy should be overhauled, but some lawmakers predict at least
some tinkering with the market-oriented policies that became law in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's enough desire on the part of my farm-state colleagues to
make changes," said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., a member of the House
Appropriations agriculture subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   She applauded Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas, for
scheduling hearings on farm policy from February through March in Washington and
seven to 12 regions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrinking export markets have sent prices for wheat, corn, soybeans and
other crops plummeting, and the Agriculture Department forecast for 2000 is
bleak, too. Farm income is predicted to drop $7.6 billion next year to $40.4
billion, unless Congress takes the unlikely step -- because it is an election
year -- of another multibillion-dollar bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at the third year in a row of a disastrous ag situation,"
Combest said in a recent interview. "We've got to look at this. Something is not
working."
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman agreed, saying Congress has lurched from
one patchwork emergency bill to the next. His comments came in October on the
heels of an $8.7 billion emergency aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we shouldn't wait until the expiration of the farm bill in 2002,"
Glickman said. "The fact is, with two years of emergency payments to farmers,
Congress has already seriously amended the farm bill. What is needed now is a
thought-out, well-balanced farm bill that we can work on if we address it early
in the year -- before we are looking again at emergency farm legislation."
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble is, there's not much consensus in Congress or among the major farm
interest groups on what should be done.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest Senate counterpart, Agriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar,
R-Ind., has no plans for hearings because he believes there is no need to change
farm policy. Several farm-state Democrats, meanwhile, will be pushing to boost
U.S. farm subsidies as a tool in trade negotiations with the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said change in farm policy, even before the
current law expires in 2002, is inevitable. Citing statements by Glickman and by
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, Roberts said the question is not
whether Freedom to Farm will be rewritten, but when and how.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts, who as House Agriculture Committee chairman was chief author of the
1996 reforms, argues it is disingenuous to blame the farm bill for a failing
safety net when its components -- a crop insurance overhaul, aggressive trade
policies and regulatory and tax reforms -- were never put in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only the administration but GOP leaders in Congress have failed, he
said. This year, Roberts plans to introduce his own package that incorporates
those elements as an alternative to rewriting farm policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like Freedom to Farm was the horse you wanted to ride in the Derby,
but you hobbled him first -- there's no jockey, no saddle and all the rest," he
said. "We said these component parts had to be part of the policy or this
wouldn't work."
</P>
<P>
	   Many regard trade issues as having the best potential to shore up struggling
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the administration's top priorities in a new round of global trade
talks is to get the European Union to lower its farm subsidies. EU farm supports
are worth $324 per acre, compared with $34 for the United States, according to
the Agriculture Department. Canada and Australia are even lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest said his House panel also will consider proposals for bolstering
U.S. export programs to counter European crop subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Australia Comments on Nazi Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) -- The Australian government on Monday said a man
accused of Nazi war crimes who became an Australian citizen after World War II
would be treated fairly if he chose to return rather than face arrest in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said Latvian-born Konrad Kalejs, 86, had
every right to come back to Australia if he wished.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Australian government's attitude to any citizen is that they are
innocent of anything until they're proven guilty,'' Vanstone told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not say whether Kalejs would be prosecuted in Australia if he chose
to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs, who is living in a Latvian-run home for refugees at Catthorpe in
Leicestershire, central England, told London's The Mail on Sunday that he was
leaving Britain as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been hounded around the world for 15 years, and now I want to be
left alone,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. He did not say where he
intended to go.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has asked for a report into how Kalejs got
permission to enter Britain, and news reports said police expected to interview
him this week.
</P>
<P>
	   A government lawmaker, David Winnick, who is a member of the House of
Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee, said he had been informed that Kalejs
entered Britain on an Australian passport and that his six-month tourist visa
runs out Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Winnick said Kalejs could be deported on the grounds that his presence
threatens the public good. He also could be arrested and charged under Britain's
1991 War Crimes Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem says Kalejs already
had been deported from the United States and Canada for serving as a lieutenant
in the Arajs Kommando, a Latvian group that killed at least 30,000 Jews,
communists and Gypsies during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs denies any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Life of 110 Years Marked by History  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN FLESHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- She was born before the automobile and got
married the year the Model T arrived. She grew up and grew old with the 20th
century. And she nearly made it to the 21st.
</P>
<P>
	   Lillian Moore died a week before Christmas after a fall at home, just
missing the distinction of living in three centuries. Her 110-year life
contained the story of the 1900s -- the little things as well as the big. To
those who knew her, she embodied the neighborliness and generosity rooted in
Michigan's countryside and small towns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Extraordinary things happened in her lifetime -- the automobile, the wars,
man on the moon,'' said her grandson, Chuck Goodman. ``But when you think about
it, it's not the flamboyant stuff, the big news, that means as much as the plain
decency of ordinary people like her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lillian Moore, then Lillian Kerns, was 14 when the Wright brothers flew at
Kitty Hawk. She was 52 when the United States entered World War II, sending her
son into battle. One of her children died of meningitis at age 10; the other two
survived scarlet fever and whooping cough, illnesses medicine would all but
eradicate.
</P>
<P>
	   She was a faithful voter for 79 years after women got the vote in 1920, and
she went a step further by running for township treasurer and winning. She
helped keep the family farm going during the Depression, labored in a mill
during World War II and worked in a doctor's office in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   All the while, relatives say, she showed more interest in family, community
and faith than world-changing events.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess I'm a person that didn't get too excited about things,'' she said,
smiling, in a 100th-birthday video.
</P>
<P>
	   At a memorial service late last month at her Methodist church, people
recalled the elderly lady who baked rolls and cookies for fellow worshippers.
They remembered dinner invitations, gifts of flowers from her garden, calls and
visits to hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd give her rides to the church, and she wanted to do something to repay
me,'' said Muriel Peavler, a registered nurse. ``So she did my mending. I'd take
a bushel of clothes down to her house and she'd have it stitched up and sewn up
in no time.''
</P>
<P>
	   A collection of photographs on display offered glimpses of the younger
Lillian, a slender, smiling blonde.
</P>
<P>
	   She was born Aug. 17, 1889, the youngest of four daughters from a farm
family in Branch County, about a dozen miles north of the Indiana line.
</P>
<P>
	   In the video, Mrs. Moore reminisced about childhood frolics in the ice
house, where ice was buried in sawdust to keep it frozen. Perishable food was
stored on the basement's dirt floor; a wood stove provided heat in winter.
</P>
<P>
	   Her family grew vegetables and slaughtered hogs. As a child, she rose before
dawn to curry horses and feed pigs, then hiked to school. Winter nights were
devoted to checkers, dominoes, card games and dancing to harmonica music.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a trip required choosing trains or horse-drawn carriages. Daughter
Mildred Goodman, 86, recalls her parents buying their first Model T after the
horses stampeded and tipped over the buggy.
</P>
<P>
	   Helping out a friend once, Lillian played piano for a quartet that included
a young schoolteacher named Lewis C. Moore. The couple wed in 1908.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years later, they began farming 80 acres that his family had owned
since the 1830s, when President Andrew Jackson signed the initial deed. They
worked the land for a half-century, raising corn, wheat, sheep and pigs, among
other things. It was a typical family farm, the kind that was long the backbone
of rural America before big-time agribusiness came along.
</P>
<P>
	   Modern conveniences arrived gradually: a party-line telephone, a
coal-burning furnace that replaced the wood stove. Electricity came in 1936,
indoor plumbing even later. And politics? She didn't talk much about it, but she
was a staunch Republican and a careful voter.
</P>
<P>
	   After her aviator son returned from World War II, the postwar years were
happy ones. The Moore farm became a summer retreat for visiting grandchildren
who romped in its meadows and woods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I think of Grannie, I think of ... fresh-cut hay and rich sweet
corn,'' grandson Henry Moore of Austin, Texas, wrote on her 100th birthday. ``I
think three homemade quilts, stitched with love and patience, that adorn three
beds in my house. And ... I think of peanut-butter cookies.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis Moore died in 1965. His wife sold the farm and moved to Traverse City,
a Lake Michigan resort town. For the last two decades of her life, she lived
with her daughter and devoted herself to church, community and Scrabble, her
favorite game. She seldom lost.
</P>
<P>
	   Both of her parents made it into their 90s, but relatives also attribute her
longevity to her clean living -- balanced diet, no tobacco or alcohol -- and her
insistence on remaining active.
</P>
<P>
	   For years she made regular phone calls to check on homebound seniors, the
Rev. Dean Bailey said in his memorial sermon. Once, she called an 85-year-old
woman who unleashed a torrent of complaints about life's hardships before
pausing to apologize.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sorry, my dear,'' the woman said. ``You wouldn't understand this, but
you will when you get old.''
</P>
<P>
	   Charitably, Mrs. Moore didn't mention her age. At the time, she was 98.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With President Clinton mediating, Syria headed
into a fresh round of talks with Israel today with ``open minds and a truthful
desire'' for peace. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he felt the ``burden
of responsibility'' to reach an agreement this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000,
cleared his schedule to preside over the first day of negotiations at the
semi-secluded Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown, 70
miles northwest of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were expected to focus on
four key issues during the talks: security, the normalization of relations,
water rights and how much of the strategic Golan Heights Israel would return to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will be closeted with the
Israelis and Syrians throughout the negotiations, cautioned Sunday that there is
``no done deal'' yet between the two sides, who have fought three wars since
Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all understand how fateful the decisions are,'' Albright said in an
interview with The Associated Press in Washington. ``We are at the beginning of
a process here, not at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said there may have to be additional rounds of negotiations to
achieve a final settlement, knocking down any notion that all that remains is to
dispose of some details.
</P>
<P>
	   But she added that Barak and al-Sharaa, as well as Syrian President Hafez
Assad, were ``dedicated to making this work'' after 50 years of enmity.
</P>
<P>
	   As he left for Washington, Barak said Sunday he felt the ``burden of
responsibility'' to achieve an agreement within the year. ``We don't need to
wait for another millennium, another century or even another 10 years to find a
way to make peace with our neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel's Army radio during the
flight to Washington that there were signs that Syria would agree to Israel's
demands for trust-building measures.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said Israel would ask Assad to join the talks to prove
he was serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips abroad are even
rarer. Al-Sharaa is a close, trusted aide and has represented Syria in previous
negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian news media, which reflect government thinking, said Damascus pins
great hopes on the upcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Thawra newspaper said Syria heads into the talks with ``open minds and a
truthful desire to bring about a just and comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. The talks were revived in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border enclave that Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies. Security is
a prime issue for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Israeli and Syrian track, Clinton is pressing for a
resumption of talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to implement the Wye
River peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, residents of Shepherdstown prepared for the talks and the influx
of some 1,000 people -- mainly State Department staff and journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 people -- Christians, Muslims and Jews -- gathered for prayers
Saturday at Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church to bless the talks. The church
will open its doors every day at noon during the negotiations for special
prayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pam Berry, a bakery owner, made pastries, muffins, cookies and a couple of
apple pies Sunday for the participants.
</P>
<P>
	   And the town's small museum -- which usually is open only from April to
October -- planned to unlock its doors to educate visitors about the town's more
than 250-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry said a State Department official warned business owners at a meeting
last week to expect a lunch and dinner rush that will last all hours of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Shepherdstown Business Association decided it will be business as
usual, but with more volume,'' said Berry. ``There won't be a lot of hoopla.''

Asia Markets Set Records; No Hint of Y2K Trouble
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- As major Asian financial markets opened Monday for their first
trading of the new millennium, no Y2K problems were reported, and two major
stock exchanges in Asia quickly set new records. "Trading has been fairly smooth
so far," said John Yap, a dealer in Singapore. "There's been no indication of
any glitches. Trading has been as smooth as we had hoped." The benchmark Straits
Times index was up 22.70 points to 2,502.28 four minutes after opening,
continuing the bullish trading of the past two weeks. The index closed Thursday
at a previous all-time high of 2,479.58 points. Americans are keeping an eye on
overseas for hints of Y2K trouble in the world's earliest time zones.

Four of the 411 passengers, three of them pregnant women, were brought to shore

Chief of Staff: Clinton Plans Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a tax cut this year
along the lines of the array of tightly targeted proposals rejected by Congress
last year, his chief of staff said Sunday. The Republican-run Congress last year
passed, and Clinton vetoed, a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. This came after
Congress rejected the president's proposal for a package of cuts totaling about
$36 billion over five years. Podesta said the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut
proposal would be similar in scope to last year's package.

20th Century Spawned New Foods
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Without the 20th century, we'd have no Marshmallow Fluff, no
Hostess Twinkies, and no lite beer. Food products introduced throughout the last
100 years frequently reflected the spirit of the time, according to a list Bon
Appetit magazine compiled. The Depression created a need for cheap, practical
foods. Spam was created in 1937, the same year as Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese
dinner. As the U.S. economy rebounded after World War II, fast food chains
cropped up. In the self-conscious 1980s and '90s, healthy foods, such as Lean
Cuisine dinners and Frito-Lay's fat-free potato chip, dominated the market.

my family very much, and I think it's time for them," McBride said, his voice
choked with emotion, "so I'm going to pull the plug. I just want to thank
everybody." After the game, McBride, 60, called his players into a huddle and

<HEADLINE> Packers Fire Rhodes and Staff  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers fired first-year coach Ray
Rhodes and his entire staff after the team failed to make the playoffs for the
first time in seven years, a source close to the team told The Associated Press
late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Packers will
announce the firings at a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ESPN and WFRV-TV, the CBS affiliate in Green Bay, also quoted sources
reporting Rhodes' firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone calls to team president Bob Harlan and general manager Ron Wolf were
not returned Sunday night. ESPN said Wolf told Rhodes of the decision hours
after the Packers (8-8) learned they would not return to the playoffs despite
beating Arizona 49-24.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than a month ago, Wolf dismissed as "ludicrous" the idea that he would
fire Rhodes after his first season. Rhodes was under intense fan and media
scrutiny as the Packers struggled to their worst season since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes was hired almost exactly one year ago to replace Mike Holmgren, who
led the Packers to two Super Bowls and one NFL championship during the
franchise's return to prominence during the 1990s. In January, Holmgren left
Green Bay after seven seasons to become the coach and general manager of the
Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes has three years left on his four-year, $4 million contract. Though
most of his staff was new to Green Bay, offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis
completed his eighth season with the Packers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   When Holmgren left, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci was thought to
be Wolf's first choice for the job. A native of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and a
former Packers quarterbacks coach under Holmgren, Mariucci instead signed a
contract extension with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf then hired Rhodes, who was also a former Green Bay assistant under
Holmgren. With Lewis and defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas, the Packers
fielded the NFL's first coaching staff in which the three major positions were
filled by African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Packers quarterbacks coach Mike McCarthy and tight ends coach Jeff
Jagodzinski both refused to confirm the reports late Sunday night, though
McCarthy indicated he had spoken with his "coaching colleagues" about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be able to talk about this at a later date," McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive line coach Larry Beightol was seen removing materials from his
office at Lambeau Field late Sunday night, and the Packers' public relations
staff could be seen working well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the coaches indicated they had any knowledge of their firings when
they left the stadium after Sunday's season-ending victory over the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure they'll sit down and evaluate the coaches and see if they can't
make some decisions," Lewis said before leaving the stadium. "We'll just wait
and see."
</P>
<P>
	   Green Bay played one of its best games of the season in trouncing the
Cardinals, snapping a three-game losing streak. A victory by Dallas over the New
York Giants later Sunday eliminated Green Bay (8-8) from postseason contention
on a conference tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody feels bad about the way things have gone this season," Rhodes
said after the Packers were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed that we didn't get the help we needed today from the
Giants. It's tough to have your season end the way it has, watching Dallas win a
game on television. But we have no one to blame but ourselves -- we got in this
situation by not taking advantage of some opportunities we had earlier this
season."

<HEADLINE> Banks Expect Few Problems Monday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's banks got through the weekend with no major Y2K
glitches. Now they're rising to the next challenge: making sure everything runs
smoothly for customers when financial institutions reopen for the work week.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking officials expressed optimism that people won't experience problems
withdrawing cash from ATMs or making trades on Wall Street as banks, stock
exchanges and other financial companies resume business today after the New
Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve will continue to keep tabs on banks and other financial
institutions to see how their computer systems are performing, Fed spokeswoman
Rose Pianalto said Sunday. But she said the Fed expected "business as usual."
</P>
<P>
	   Kathy Searle, spokeswoman for Fleet Boston Corp., a large bank and financial
services company, echoed that comment and pointed out that none of its branches
that were open on Jan. 1 reported any problems. "This has played out so well,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, banks will be watching closely to see how their computer systems
perform this week, particularly today when weekend transactions are first
accounted for in massive computer databases.
</P>
<P>
	   "We won't have a complete picture until Tuesday," said Mary Rodrigues, a
spokeswoman at Wells Fargo in San Francisco. "Monday is when everything gets
posted."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, traffic at automated teller machines should pick up as Americans
return to work, but no problems are anticipated, said Kurt Helwig, executive
director of the Electronic Funds Transfer Association, which represents the
nation's major ATMs.
</P>
<P>
	   Major U.S. financial markets also were reopening at their normal time today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't heard anything about problems at financial markets either in the
United States or overseas," Margaret Draper, spokeswoman for the Securities
Industry Association, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. banking industry has spent an estimated $9 billion updating
computer systems so they would not misread 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
	   And, the Fed since October has delivered $80 billion in cash to banks to
meet unexpected demands.
</P>
<P>
	   While there had been concerns that banks in other nations could experience
problems that might have an impact in the United States, officials said that as
of Sunday no major problems had developed.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Set To Endorse Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three months after losing the race for campaign cash to
George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole plans to endorse the Texas governor this week to
bolster his bid for the GOP presidential nomination in the looming New Hampshire
and Iowa contests, say associates close to both politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunday that Mrs. Dole
was expected to endorse Bush on Tuesday during appearances in both states. Mrs.
Dole's associates have urged her for weeks to endorse Bush and said this is the
perfect time to help him. They hope an endorsement elevates her chances to be
Bush's running mate, though officials in both camps say no guarantees have been
made.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Dole dropped out of the race in October, her campaign nearly broke and
before any votes were cast. More than 100 fund-raisers had netted her only $5
million, less than one-tenth of Bush's record-breaking bankroll at that time.
Although in second place in many national polls -- she hovered around 10 percent
-- she trailed Arizona Sen. John McCain in New Hampshire and lagged well behind
Bush everywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's endorsement would help Bush attract women to his campaign. Married
suburban mothers especially are considered critical swing votes in the general
election and early polls show Bush leading all candidates among that group.
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted after Mrs. Dole dropped out Oct. 20
showed that Bush's support among Republican-leaning women jumped 13 percentage
points to 68 percent after her departure. She had the support of 14 percent of
women before leaving the race, though it's impossible to say his gains were from
her supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   As for her prospects for the GOP vice presidential slot, Bush is said to
favor prospects who have been elected officeholders. Mrs. Dole is a two-time
Cabinet member and former president of American Red Cross but had never sought
elective office before her failed 1999 bid.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the senator holds Mrs. Dole in high
regard and has attracted former Dole backers who like his stand on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Voters have been flocking to Senator McCain because of his message, not
because of his bank account or list of endorsements,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although her husband, Bob, remains close to McCain following his failed 1996
presidential bid, Elizabeth Dole's associates have long harbored suspicions that
McCain's camp spread rumors that she was going to drop out. McCain's forces
denied the charge, but the rumors hurt her campaign well before she finally
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing her lack of ``money, money, money,'' Dole in October abandoned her
effort to become the nation's first female president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't run on air,'' she complained on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' ``The
message is money and that's too bad, because that really diminished the
process.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Issues: Trade  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, beginning today, The Associated Press will ask the major
presidential candidates a question on the issues. Today's question and their
responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Trade
</P>
<P>
	   Should the United States seek free or liberalized trade agreements with more
nations?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``Yes. Agreements to lower trade barriers open export markets
and create opportunities for Americans to earn more. Global agreements reached
through the WTO (World Trade Organization) have the greatest potential benefits,
but they must take full account of the impact of trade on the environment and
labor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Yes. As president, I will ask Congress for the power to reach new
trade agreements, and open new markets to our goods and services. But wherever
necessary, I will also ask for, and use, the authority to negotiate labor and
environmental protections in those agreements.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``The U.S. should negotiate reciprocal trade treaties with all
nations, treaties that erase our monstrous trade deficits, assure U.S. economic
independence and put our manufacturers and workers before any claims of a
mythical 'Global Economy.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``The United States should seek free trade agreements with more
nations because our workers and businesses have proven year after year that they
are the most productive in the world. I am concerned about the multinational
trade agreements of recent years, including the one that created the World Trade
Organization, that left millions of American workers and farmers at a
competitive disadvantage. We need to renegotiate these agreements or, if this is
not possible, withdraw and start over with trading partners committed to free
and fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``Yes, I am a strong advocate of free and fair trade. I
believe we'll be prosperous if we embrace free trade, and I'll make it a
priority to obtain new negotiating authority. I will work to end tariffs and
break down barriers everywhere, entirely, so the whole world trades in freedom.
The fearful build walls. The confident demolish them. I am confident in American
workers, farmers and producers, and I am confident that America's best is the
best in the world. Unfortunately, the Clinton-Gore administration is the first
in 25 years to lose presidential trade negotiating authority. We need new
leadership on trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``As an international business leader and CEO, I strongly
support tearing down trade barriers and opening new markets to American goods
and services as a way to create better American jobs and increase economic
growth. I propose a new North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the U.S.,
Great Britain and Ireland, and free trade agreements with Japan, Australia, New
Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I have long supported expanding trade with more nations,
especially with our agricultural products, and have been an active supporter of
the Export Enhancement Program and the Market Access Program to promote American
products overseas. America's farmers and manufacturers should be able to compete
in an open market.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``The United States should negotiate trade agreements with
nations but based on the individual needs of the United States and each trade
partner nation. The United States should not be a member of such organizations
as the WTO which is not a representative body. The WTO is unelected and
unaccountable to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Yes. I believe in free trade. I supported NAFTA and GATT
(North American Free Trade Agreement and General Agreeement on Tariffs and
Trade), and I believe U.S. participation in the WTO will continue to be
beneficial to expanding our business opportunities around the world. The
benefits of expanded free trade have been an important contributor to the
unprecedented economic growth of the past decade.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs $10M for Gun Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to spend $10 million to help gun
manufacturers develop new technologies designed to prevent the weapons from
being fired by anyone but their owners.
</P>
<P>
	   White House chief of staff John Podesta said Sunday that Clinton's proposed
budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 will include money for the National
Institute of Justice to fund research and development of so-called smart-gun
technology, which would use fingerprints, radio waves or other ways to ensure
that a weapon would fire only when used by its owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Several gun manufacturers are developing the new technology, and Podesta
said the White House has talked with them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had some discussions with them about this, about how we can improve
the technology so that, again, only a lawful owner can use the gun,'' Podesta
said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' ``And if that's true, what you can prevent is
a police officer being disarmed by a felon and having the gun used against the
police officer. But I think almost most importantly, it'll prevent children from
being able to get access to guns and use them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta announced the smart-gun initiative as he also urged the
Republican-run Congress to pass gun control legislation. House and Senate
negotiators were unable to agree on a juvenile crime bill that contained gun
control measures, including background checks of purchasers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the Congress that we have in front of us, it's going to be a very
difficult chore to get that passed through this Congress,'' Podesta said. ``But
we are going to press ahead. With members going home and listening to their
constituencies, we still have a good chance of getting the commonsense gun
legislation that is before Congress passed into law this year.''

<HEADLINE> Migrants Being Returned to Haiti  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two days after a boat packed with more than 400 Haitians,
Dominicans and Chinese ran aground about a mile off the Florida coast, the U.S.
Coast Guard began shipping the migrants home, officials said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Carl Messalle said the migrants left the Miami area
Sunday evening aboard two Coast Guard cutters and were en route early Monday to
Haiti, where their voyage originated. The trip usually takes at least two days,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 411 passengers, 16 are Dominican, two are Chinese and the rest are
Haitian, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the passengers, three of them pregnant women, were brought to shore
for medical reasons and are expected to be returned later, said Mike Gilhooly, a
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very disappointed that INS once more has decided to continue its
racist policy vis-a-vis the Haitians and failed once more to give them the right
to a fair and due process,'' said Marleine Bastien, president of Haitian Women
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The repatriation of the passengers prompted a second day of protests Sunday
in front of the Coast Guard station in Miami Beach. About 400 people chanted
slogans and carried signs in an effort to get federal officials to allow the
group into this country.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters want U.S. laws changed to treat Haitians trying to get into
the country more like Cubans, who generally are allowed to remain if they reach
shore. Under a Haiti-U.S. agreement, those without proper documents are
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Metelous, 71, of Miami, who arrived from Haiti four years ago, said
anyone who makes the treacherous journey in an attempt to reach the United
States should be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   He talked about 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez -- the Cuban boy found clinging to
a raft after a boat he and his mother were on sank -- and the controversy over
whether he should be sent back to his father in Cuba or be allowed to remain
with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas also spoke up for the Haitians during
Sunday's rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Something must be going on in Haiti for these people to risk their lives,
to risk their children's lives and risk the lives of their family members and
seek freedom in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The migrants were found packed shoulder-to-shoulder on a 60-foot wooden boat
that ran aground early on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat first appeared on the radar of the Coast Guard patrol boat Farallon
shortly before midnight Friday. It was running in the dark at five to seven
knots, and its crews ignored warnings by radio and loudspeaker from the Farallon
that it was headed toward shallow water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were trying to tell them to turn or you'll hit the reef,'' said Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Andy Blomme.
</P>
<P>
	   After the boat ran aground on a sandbar, Coast Guard crews tossed life
jackets on board and tried to explain to the migrants that the wooden ship was
not safe and that, no matter what happened, they would not be allowed to enter
the United States, Blomme said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing that any threatening move could provoke the passengers to jump into
the water, the Coast Guard crews waited until dawn to persuade the migrants to
leave the rickety ship.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship apparently had been at sea for at lease five days, and most of the
passengers were weary and dehydrated, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two women -- one five months pregnant and possibly injured by a fall during
the trip, and one who was suffering from a fever and convulsions -- were taken
to a hospital Saturday, Petty Officer Sean Connett said. Both were in good
condition Sunday, a South Shore Hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Coast Guard rescued or turned back 363 Haitians and 406
Dominicans trying to reach the United States.

<HEADLINE> Podesta: Clinton Plans Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a package of tightly
targeted tax cuts resembling the five-year, $36 billion plan that congressional
Republicans rejected last year, a top aide says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you can expect the president to propose a tax cut in his budget
and in his State of the Union'' address, White House chief of staff John Podesta
said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' ``I think that it will be about the
size that we proposed last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pushing aside Clinton's relatively modest proposal, the GOP-led Congress
passed a 10-year, $792 billion package that included across-the board tax cuts,
elimination of the so-called marriage penalty and estate taxes and reduction in
capital gains levies.
</P>
<P>
	   But that package fell victim to a Clinton veto. The president contended that
the Republican measure would eat into a projected budget surplus without making
adequate provisions for preserving Medicare and Social Security. He also argued
that it gave too much relief to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said Sunday the fiscal 2001 Clinton tax cut proposal would be
similar is scope to last year's package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reason for that is, as we said over and over again last year, that ...
we've got an important opportunity now to make investments in Social Security,
in Medicare, in modernizing and improving our military, in education, in these
other priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we do think there's room for a tax cut targeted at the middle class,
and we'll be putting forward one.'' While it will be similar to the 1999
package, ``I think we may have some new ideas in that regard, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the net tax cut that we put forward last year went to increasing
savings, and we're going to continue with a tax relief in that area so that
people can save for their retirement along with extending the solvency of Social
Security. That's an important goal that we have,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think we may manage to change the package a little bit to invest in
some other important priorities, like expanding health insurance coverage and
investing and making sure that the people at the bottom end of the income scale
get a fair break in the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta declined to give further details or figures, saying Clinton would
lay them out in his State of the Union address later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposals last year consisted of about three dozen measures
tightly targeted to benefit specific groups, but no broad overall relief. The
various credits totaled $36.2 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the president sought a $1,000 tax credit to defray the costs of
caring for a disabled or chronically ill relative and another $1,000 credit for
disabled workers to offset the extra costs they sometimes face in holding a job.
</P>
<P>
	   A third middle-class credit proposed last year was aimed at encouraging
small employers to provide health insurance for workers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the only tax bill to be enacted last year was an extension of
some relatively small provisions that were set to expire.

<HEADLINE> Former Cuban Agent To Testify  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Cuban intelligence agent says one of the Puerto
Rican nationalists granted clemency by the White House last summer helped pull
off one of the nation's biggest robberies with funding from the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Masetti, who in the early 1990s defected to Europe, has been
interviewed by aides to the House Government Reform Committee and was to testify
today at a public hearing near Miami, committee chief counsel James Wilson said
in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said Masetti will tell the story of how the Cuban government helped
finance the 1983 robbery of a Wells Fargo armored truck in West Hartford, Conn.,
which netted $7.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those involved in the heist, Juan Segerra Palmer, was caught and
sentenced to 55 years in prison. Palmer was one of 12 members of the FALN
granted clemency by Clinton in August. Eleven of those were released, but Palmer
struck a deal that will allow him to go free in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeating a story published in his book, ``El Furor y El Delirio'' (``The
Fury and the Delirium''), Masetti has told investigators that Palmer received
$50,000 in ``seed money'' from the Cuban government to help carry out the Wells
Fargo robbery, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the robbery, the $7.2 million booty was smuggled to Mexico City in a
recreational vehicle outfitted with special hidden compartments, Masetti has
told investigators, according to Wilson. Masetti says he was involved in
shipping $4 million of the Wells Fargo money from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City to Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which acts as Cuba's embassy,
told the Hartford Courant earlier this year that the tale was ``more science
fiction than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Puerto Rico, nationalists said their links to Cuba were confined to Cuban
support for Puerto Rico's independence from the United States -- support that
predated Fidel Castro's 1959 communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Masetti's testimony is part of the Government Reform Committee's latest
effort to link Cuba to the FALN -- the Spanish abbreviation for the Armed Forces
for National Liberation -- and its Puerto Rican arm, the Macheteros, or Cane
Cutters.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., earlier this month requested any
records showing a link between the separatists and the Cuban government. He also
issued subpoenas to the Justice Department and FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton wrote to CIA Director George Tenet asking for surveillance intercepts
and any other records on a Cuba-Puerto Rico connection. He also sought a
briefing on the agency's knowledge of the pro-independence guerrilla groups the
nationals belonged to.
</P>
<P>
	   The FALN carried out a wave of bombings in the United States in the late
1970s and early 1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. The Macheteros have
been responsible mainly for attacks in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Often Turn to Stand-ins  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   With some 1,300 miles separating Des Moines, Iowa and Manchester, N.H.,
presidential candidates are hard-pressed to put in the requisite face time in
the nation's first caucus and primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   That's to say nothing of the endless driving within the states, where voters
in every tiny corner expect personal attention. Candidates can find themselves
stretched like guitar strings.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why most use stand-ins -- or campaign surrogates. Here is a look at
two.
</P>
<P>
	   --------
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   HANOVER, N.H. -- Before announcing the formation of an exploratory committee
for president a year ago, Bill Bradley made a courtesy call to someone already
in the race, Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, thanks for calling,'' Wellstone told Bradley. ``I'm glad you're
running, because I think you'd be a very good president. But there is just one
thing. Starting in Iowa, I'm going to kick your butt in.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's not going to happen. Wellstone dropped out, leaving only Bradley to
challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   He's on the campaign trail now as stand-in, helping the former New Jersey
senator seek votes in New Hampshire's leadoff primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He plays a terrific set of roles in the campaign,'' said Gina Glantz,
Bradley's campaign manager. ``He is a key surrogate, he is an adviser, he is
someone many of us turn to in the course of campaign planning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone has been Bradley's most active surrogate and plans to spend 18
days on the road this month.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Wellstone tells audiences that Bradley's integrity
transcends their differences on some issues. He said he's particularly attracted
to the candidate's goals of racial healing and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why am I supporting Bill Bradley, heart and soul?'' he said at Dartmouth
College. ``Because he can renew our nation's commitment to equal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone makes a point of telling audiences he doesn't always agree with
Bradley, and often does it with humor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Keene, N.H., a woman told Wellstone she doesn't think Bradley's health
care plan goes far enough. ``I wanted more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone clutched his chest with both hands. ``You want me to argue with
that?'' he responded in pretend shock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When Bill announced his plan, I said to him, 'I think you've struck a
compromise between vision and political feasibility.' Bill's plan isn't perfect,
but it pushes the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of their biggest disagreements is over the Senate vote Bradley cast in
1986 to provide the Nicaraguan Contras with $100 million in aid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've told Bill, 'What was that?' '' Wellstone said in an incredulous
voice. ``I don't think it's a vote that fits in with other votes on it, nor do I
think it's a vote that he thinks was his best vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite departing from Bradley on several key points, Wellstone has been
sought out by the candidate for advice. He participates in the campaign's
strategy sessions and reviews drafts of speeches in addition to serving as
surrogate speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone and Bradley could not have more different styles. Short and hyper,
Wellstone actually has a lot of candidate Clinton in him, asking people for
their first names during question-and-answer sessions and putting a hand on a
person during one-on-one chats.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is dry, but at a campaign event in Iowa, he joked about adopting
Wellstone's style.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill is introduced, and he looks out at everybody, and he says, 'I know
how I can get your support,' and he starts waving his hands,' '' Wellstone
recalled, flailing his arms as he mocks Bradley's mocking of him. '' 'I can
start speaking like Paul Wellstone!' ''

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, knows all about January in New
Hampshire, having shivered through it as a Dartmouth College undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, he's happily back in his boots, working old contacts to help a
new cause: Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm probably doing more than they asked me to do in terms of surrogate
work,'' he said, laying out a still-in-progress schedule of New Hampshire coffee
klatches, radio interviews and college organizing.
</P>
<P>
	   This is after Portman threw a $1 million fund-raiser in Cincinnati for the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend of the Bush family, Portman is the only alumnus of President Bush's
White House staff currently serving in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   That connection led the Bush campaign to tap Portman as a bridge to House
Republicans and as a policy adviser. Working out the basics of his federal tax
proposals, the candidate turned to Portman. One of the people he consulted about
Medicare was Portman. Social Security reform? Portman. Drug-fighting strategy?
Again, Portman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been a real asset to the campaign and a trusted friend of Governor
Bush,'' said campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
	   Portman is considered to be so tight with the Bush family, in fact, that
guessing what job he might be offered in the event of a Bush presidency has
become a sort of parlor game among Ohio Republicans. (Most frequent guesses:
White House chief of staff or commerce secretary.)
</P>
<P>
	   Portman exhales a half-laugh, half-sigh and for the umpteenth time tries to
discourage such speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think George Bush, if he's elected president, will have plenty of people
to fill positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To do a job and do it right at the White House, I found that's 20 hours a
day,'' he said. ``I can remember days when I would not see my newborn son for
two or three days at a time -- I would see him, but he would be asleep. That's
no way to live.''
</P>
<P>
	   Giving up precious family time to help the Bush campaign is, in part, a way
to repay the governor's parents for helping him in his first bid for public
office -- a special election in 1993 -- and earlier, for selecting him as White
House director of legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's probably the best job that I ever had, working for his father,'' said
Portman. ``There's a loyalty there.''

<HEADLINE> Democratic Rivals Push Big Themes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Revving up their drive for votes in Iowa and New
Hampshire, Bill Bradley and Al Gore are emphasizing big themes of their
competing presidential campaigns. Bradley promises ``a world of new
possibilities'' after seven years of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
	   In a single day of speeches today, the two candidates hoped to offer
Democratic primary voters a stark choice: Bradley's ``fresh start'' on the one
hand, the vice president's tried-and-true stewardship on the other.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the post-holiday jump on Gore, with campaign stops Sunday in
Boston and Concord, N.H., while Gore enjoyed one last day with his family before
the race to Iowa's Jan. 24 delegate caucuses and New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary
-- the first two nominating contests.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates meet Wednesday night in New Hampshire for their fourth
debate of the season, and again Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Bradley in Manchester and Gore in Davenport, Iowa, were kicking off
the month of virtually nonstop campaigning with speeches they hoped would
crystallize the themes they are running on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This campaign is based on the radical premise that you can go out and tell
people what you believe and win,'' Bradley told more than 400 voters who packed
the Concord, N.H., Elks Lodge for a dinnertime town meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   With universal access to health insurance, the alleviation of child poverty
and racial unity at the core of his campaign, Bradley said he hoped to offer
America ``a world of new possibilities guided by goodness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Gore would argue in his address that tackling just a few big
problems isn't good enough in this era of economic prosperity. With this
argument, Gore hoped to turn on its head the line Bradley has used in recent
months to help deflate the vice president's lead -- that Bradley is the ``big
ideas'' candidate while Gore would only lead the nation forward in baby steps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can do many things at once with the right kind of leadership and Al
Gore is uniquely positioned to provide that leadership given his experience over
the last seven years,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for endorsements was also being played out this week, with Gore
-- the Democratic establishment's favorite -- unveiling additional supporters
among local New Hampshire officials and Bradley holding a rally Wednesday
morning to trumpet the backing of several pro-choice women activists.
</P>
<P>
	   While each candidate was jumping from the January starting gate on a
high-minded note (Bradley dubbed his remarks today a ``Millennium Address''),
Lehane held out the prospect of down-and-dirty politicking to come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As we move into January and the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa begin
focusing more and more on specific issues -- issues they may talk about with
their families at the breakfast table and the dinner table -- they will see
differences,'' the Gore spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And we're going to be real clear about what those differences are --
whether its supporting Medicare, making education a top national priority,
keeping the economy strong through fiscal discipline, or an approach to health
care that would be effective and would work compared to Senator Bradley's
approach.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bradley tried to blunt any political advantage Gore could
claim from the booming economy. Some 13 million children still live in poverty
and 44 million Americans lack health insurance, he said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to be the good steward of a good economy. And by that I mean an
economy that just doesn't have a stock market at 10,000 or 11,000 -- that's
great -- but an economy that takes more and more people to higher economic
ground,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley ducked one woman's sticky question of how much voters should count
President Clinton's impeachment scandal against his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do I want people to vote for me because they want a fresh start? Why
not?'' Bradley said. But he added that he'd rather win votes for his own agenda.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Election: Chance for Change  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- For voters in Croatia, this week's parliamentary
elections mark a chance to choose the country's direction -- whether to stick
with late president Franjo Tudjman's authoritarian style or turn to Croatia's
Western-oriented opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling stations outside Croatia were open on Sunday to eligible expatriate
voters, and in neighboring Bosnia even the elderly and invalids stood in line
for hours to cast their ballots. People in Croatia proper began voting Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Staying the path set by the late president means continued problems with the
Western democracies that supported Tudjman's independence struggle but later
grew cool to his authoritarian style.
</P>
<P>
	   A victory by the opposition, on the other hand, would improve Croatia's
chances of joining the European Union and NATO but at the cost of loosening
links to Croats in Bosnia -- burying dreams of nationalists on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
	   Election rules stipulate that about 350,000 Croats outside the country,
about 9 percent of the total of 4.17 million voters, can cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Bosnian Croats are not strictly part of the so-called Croatian
diaspora, most of them carry two passports and are therefore eligible to vote.
Many did so on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Veso Vegar, a Croatian Embassy official in Sarajevo, said turnout in Bosnia
during the morning throughout the country was ``above any expectations.'' He
said soldiers of the NATO-led Stabilization Force were securing the areas around
the polling stations together with the local police.
</P>
<P>
	   With most expatriate Croats traditionally conservative, they are important
for the HDZ -- the Croatian Democratic Union of the Tudjman, which has been in
power since the country won independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnian Croat hard-liners' aspirations for secession during the Bosnian war
that ended in 1995 were largely supported and financed by Tudjman's party, and
financial support has continued for Bosnian Croats since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Many voters in Bosnia who lined up outside polling booths Sunday said they
were ready to again vote for the governing party in recognition of such support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's clear -- HDZ,'' 71-year-old Nikola Milicevic said, quoting the
party's slogan, while standing in line to vote in the Croatian Embassy in
Sarajevo. Milicevic said he came with an organized group by bus from the nearby
town of Kiseljak.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential elections in Croatia are set for Jan. 24, six weeks after
Tudjman, who led Croatia with an iron fist for nearly a decade, died on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   But the vote for the lower house of parliament is seen as potentially more
crucial -- both the opposition and some Tudjman party members expect the new
parliament to reduce presidential powers and reclaim authority lost under
Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman was present in the campaigning even after death -- his party put his
image and signature on its posters and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The party has also played heavily on Croats' patriotic feelings, recalling
historic moments: 1991 independence, international recognition a year later, and
the 1995 recapture of lands seized by Serb rebels during the 1991 war. The
message was simple: We made it happen.
</P>
<P>
	   While the ruling party has downplayed everyday problems -- low wages and
pensions that are often late, as well as 20 percent unemployment -- the
opposition has focused on those issues. They promised to fight corruption,
concentrate on developing the economy and improving living standards.
</P>
<P>
	   They also promoted European-style democracy and cooperation with the West,
positions subtly attacked by Tudjman's party as potentially compromising
national interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's two worlds, basically,'' said Zvonko Mimic, a 36-year-old computer
technician. ``We'll see to which one Croats really belong.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Price Often U.S. Cash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's bid to mediate peace between Syria and
Israel has drawn wide bipartisan praise in Congress. But the roar of applause
that would greet success might fade once the tab is tallied.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates in the region put the potential pricetag at up to $30 billion, ten
times what Israel now gets annually in U.S. assistance. And at $3 billion,
Israel is the largest single foreign aid recipient.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the most conservative estimate, of about $10 billion, rivals the entire
U.S. annual foreign aid budget, around $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   With talks resuming Monday in Shepherdstown, W.Va., little has been said
about what an Israel-Syria peace agreement might cost American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor is it yet clear how the administration would get around the fact that,
as one of seven nations branded as supporting terrorism, Syria is presently
ineligible for most U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   There's little doubt that Congress, currently out of session, will
eventually be asked to foot most of the bill if an Israel-Syria deal is reached.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has not been any agreement that has been made in the Middle East
that hasn't, in some way, meant that we would be giving some kind of
assistance,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters even as she
declined to answer questions on cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House
International Relations Committee, thinks the higher estimates are ``incredibly
inflated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Gejdenson said that, at this stage, potential costs are a secondary
consideration. ``The opportunities for peace aren't there forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has a history of spending billions for peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before Congress left for the holidays, it approved $1.8 billion in
special aid for Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians to carry out the 1998 Wye
River peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt, rewarded two decades ago for becoming the first Arab state to make
peace with Israel, is now the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel,
getting about $2.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   When Israel evacuated the Sinai Peninsula as part of that accord, the United
States gave Israel $3 billion in special aid -- some of it to compensate 7,000
Israeli settlers forced to move. Some of the families were given as much as
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 18,000 Israelis live in the Golan Heights, which Syria wants back as
part of any peace agreement. Israel captured the strategic highlands in the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-led Congress has been stingy about foreign aid, although
there is also a long tradition of generosity towards Israel -- most pronounced
during election years.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that generosity could be strained by huge requests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be difficult extracting the funds necessary,'' said Tom Mann, an
analyst at the Brookings Institution who studies Congress. He said a lot would
depend on how well Israeli's receive a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls indicate Israelis are almost evenly divided over whether to trade the
Golan Heights for peace with Syria. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged a
referendum if such a deal is struck.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Israeli legislators and newspaper reports, Israel might seek
$20 billion to $30 billion from the United States to help seal a deal. Barak
once estimated it would take about $10 billion to defend Israel without the
heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the issue of compensation for settlers, Israel is likely to request
sophisticated military equipment and intelligence-sharing to compensate for the
loss of its listening posts in the heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Providing for the Syrian component of the package would be problematic
because of the legal ban on assistance to countries on the State Department's
list of nations that support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts have suggested the simplest course might be to assemble a
package in which other countries, including Japan and European allies, shoulder
the Syrian portion. Syria's making peace with Israel itself might prompt a
reassessment of its terrorism designation.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, providing billions to resettle Golan Heights settlers might generate
the most U.S. resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we see is the various parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute getting in
line with their hands out for American dollars,'' said Ted Galen Carpenter, a
foreign policy expert at the conservative Cato Institute. ``I don't think that
benefits the people in these countries.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Links Fate of Putin to Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Increasing rhetorical pressure on Russia's new leader,
Clinton administration officials say acting President Vladimir Putin's political
future and place on the world stage will depend upon a peaceful end to the
conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who ascended to the presidency after Boris Yeltsin's surprise New
Year's Eve resignation, is the favorite to win in March elections and a moving
force behind the Russian military's assault on the rebellious province, a
campaign U.S. officials deplore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question for President Yeltsin's successors is not only how to
liberate Grozny without killing thousands of civilians; it's also whether this
war becomes a model for how to deal with other problems involving terrorists and
separatists,'' President Clinton wrote in an essay in this week's Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia has to find the right balance between the use of effective force
and decent respect for individual rights and international norms,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other U.S. officials appearing on Sunday's television talk shows warned that
even though Putin's hard line on Chechnya has increased his popularity, a
military quagmire in Chechnya could dim his political prospects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chechnya now is a dilemma,'' national security adviser Samuel Berger said
on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``If it goes on too long or if it begins to cause
increasing Russian casualties, as we seem to be seeing now, with an intensified
resistance, this could become something that mires Putin down, and the wave he
rode up could become the wave that engulfs him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has been an outspoken proponent of the military intervention in
Chechnya. On his first full day as acting president, he visited Russian forces
in Chechnya to praise them for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chechnya war won't be settled on the battlefield, but around a
negotiating table, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asserted on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can only be a political solution to this,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   She and other officials said the peaceful handoff of power to Putin bodes
well for Russia's democratic future. ``This transfer of power is something we
believe has taken place democratically,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, officials said there was an element of uncertainty with Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, we're pleased with the statements that he's made about affirming
Russian democracy, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of
conscience, private property,'' Berger said. ``But I don't think we yet have all
the answers as to where Mr. Putin -- what direction he intends to lead Russia.
We hope that it will continue to be the democratic direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials noted that Putin was a member of the KGB, the
Russian spy agency, but also was part of the reformist government of the city of
St. Petersburg. ``He has been a prime reformer,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to helping the Russian economy grow, Putin must do more to fight
crime and corruption, Clinton said in his essay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless that battle is joined ... the democratic norms and the market
economy that have been Yeltsin's prime focus can be undone,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Timor Airport Under Civilian Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The airport in East Timor's capital, Dili, reverted
to civilian control Monday, four months after a rampage by Indonesian troops and
their local allies put a stop to commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief ceremony, officers of the international force that arrived in
East Timor to restore order on Sept. 20, handed over control of Komoro airport
to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Transitional Authority in East Timor is guiding the half-island
territory to independence after 300 years of Portuguese colonial rule and a
quarter-century of Indonesian military occupation.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the handover, a Fokker 28 jetliner belonging to Indonesia's
state-owned Merpati Nusantara Airline landed at Komoro.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline representatives said the test flight, which carried Indonesian
government officials, was conducted in anticipation of the resumption of
commercial flights to East Timor in the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   Merpati, a subsidiary of national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, serviced
East Timor with daily flights from Jakarta before the Aug. 30 referendum that
resulted in an overwhelming vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are confident because people there have known us very well,'' said
Merpati's director, Wahyu Hidayat.
</P>
<P>
	   East Timor's main international airport is located in Baucau, 50 miles east
of Dili. It remains under the control of the peacekeeping forces.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Foreign Policy Outlook Better  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a new year begins, the Clinton administration is
finding the foreign policy environment more congenial than the almost uniformly
negative outlook of just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials are highlighting a modest revival of U.S.-Chinese relations
following a long period in the deep freeze. Prospects for peace in the Mideast
have brightened and there have been long strides toward a permanent settlement
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Kosovo has stabilized. And a sore point with much of the
rest of the world -- the United States' skipping out on its dues owed the United
Nations -- has been partially put to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   For Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, officials say there was no moment
more discouraging than the lonely, late-night trek she made to the Chinese
Embassy last May 7 to apologize to Ambassador Li Zhao Xing for the accidental
NATO bombing of Beijing's embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the three Chinese who were killed and the many injured, another
casualty was U.S.-Chinese relations, which the United States had been
assiduously nurturing. After the bombing, ties with Beijing went into a deep
freeze for months.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a difficult time for President Clinton and his foreign policy team,
and not only because of the problems with China.
</P>
<P>
	   Israelis and Palestinians were not implementing the U.S.-brokered Wye River
agreement they had reached in October 1998. Perceived military posturing by
North Korea was generating anxiety in Northeast Asia. And there were grave
doubts about whether NATO's air war over Yugoslavia would produce a positive
outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, almost eight months later, grounds for hope exist. Some reasons:
</P>
<P>
	   --U.S.-Chinese relations have revived somewhat after their midyear chill.
The two countries were able to reach a trade agreement this past fall that will
enable China to join the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for
international commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   --With the help of almost 50,000 mostly European troops, the situation in
Kosovo has stabilized for the time being. NATO's air war proved far more
effective in bringing Yugoslavia to heel than skeptics had believed. All Kosovo
Albanians who were evicted from the province by Yugoslav forces have returned.
But the goal of ethnic harmony between the Albanians and Serbs seems far off.
</P>
<P>
	   --With a nudge from U.S. diplomacy, Israeli and Syrian leaders have resumed
peace talks for the first time in almost four years. A crucial new round of
discussions begins today in West Virginia. Meanwhile, the tone of
Israeli-Palestinian relations has improved markedly, but progress on substance
remains difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   --North Korea has bowed to U.S. insistence that it not go ahead with a test
of a long-range missile. The prospect of a new test on the heels of one in 1998
had been causing alarm in much of Northeast Asia. Officials caution, however,
that it is too early to declare victory in their bid to wean Pyongyang on to a
peaceful path.
</P>
<P>
	   --With an assist from the United States, a new Protestant-Catholic
government has taken power in Northern Ireland, where war has flared
intermittently for 30 years. Resistance to disarmament by paramilitaries remains
a potential obstacle to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Clinton administration has made a lot of progress in foreign policy,''
says Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic chairman of the House International
Relations Committee who now heads the Wilson Center, a research group.
</P>
<P>
	   Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the Brookings Institution isn't sure the positive
trend of recent months means very much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a whole host of things that in some respects are better. Whether
they are fundamentally better you can't tell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   John Bolton, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State James A.
Baker, believes 2000 will be fraught with dangers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The past year has been a year of things that didn't happen,'' Bolton said.
There could be military tensions with China at the time of Taiwan's presidential
elections in March, much as there were when the last such elections were held,
in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Bolton also is concerned that Iraq may be developing weapons of mass
destruction with impunity now that more than a year has passed since President
Saddam Hussein forced U.N. weapons inspectors out.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Secretary Albright hinted that military action against Iraq
should not be ruled out if Saddam does not abide by renewed U.N. Security
Council demands that he ban forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still continue to have the possibilities that we've had before of
taking unilateral or multilateral action if we need to,'' Albright said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Flight Into Cuba 'Provocative'  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Vietnamese-American pilot engaged in a ``provocative
and reckless action'' by flying a small plane into Cuban airspace and dropping
anti-communist pamphlets, the State Department says.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said Sunday it was fortunate that the incident Saturday did
not result in any loss of life. It noted that Cuban authorities did not take
aggressive action against the aircraft in compliance with their international
obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   The official comment was disclosed by a State Department press official who
under agency procedures could not be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Customs Service identified the pilot as Ly Tong, a 51-year-old
naturalized American citizen who arrived from Vietnam in 1984. He lives in New
Orleans and was visiting friends in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   While Tong was flying the rented plane over Havana, Cuba sent two MiG
fighter jets to monitor his flight until he left Cuban airspace, Customs Service
spokesman Michael Sheehan said. The MiGs took no action, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The flight recalled an incident in February 1996 when two small, unarmed
civilian planes took off for Cuba from Miami and were shot down by MiG jet
fighters north of Havana, killing four Cuban-Americans on board. An angry
Congress retaliated days later by tightening sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba insisted the planes had penetrated Cuban airspace, but the Clinton
administration disagreed. An international inquiry concluded that the planes
were shot down in international airspace.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said Tong's action was particularly reckless in light
of the 1996 incident.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs Service radar center in Long Beach, Calif., tracked the
single-engine plane once it left U.S. airspace after leaving Tamiami Airport in
Miami on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His reason for going down was to drop leaflets, anti-communist leaflets in
multiple languages,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft returned to Tamiami Airport about four hours after it left and
Customs officials detained Tong for questioning, then released him without
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said the flight was an apparent violation of Federal
Aviation Administration rules. Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman, said an
investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Very important people are paying attention to what happens the first day
of the third millennium,'' Tong said. ``How can I sacrifice my life for Cuban
freedom? I believe in God, justice and my mission against communism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, a self-proclaimed ``freedom fighter,'' told Miami television station
WSVN he wants the Cuban people to revolt against President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is to try to encourage the Cuban people to rise
up and overthrow the Havana pirate,'' he said. He added that he wants to make
similar flights over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   The green paper pamphlets found scattered in some Havana neighborhoods
called on Cubans to launch a general strike and to seize radio and television
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed: ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Election Victory Likely  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- For many Russians, acting President Vladimir Putin's rivals
suddenly appear to have turned into a bunch of also-rans, and the coming
presidential election set for March 26 is looking like a mere formality.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the three-day New Year's holiday meant public reaction to the news of
Putin's new position and the news of the early presidential election was still
light, a number of people interviewed on Moscow's streets reflected Russians'
overwhelmingly positive attitude toward their new leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putin will win by a landslide,'' said Alexander Khudenkov, 27, a
construction worker. ``Those old goats have no chance at all. We've had enough
of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, 47, who became acting president Friday after Boris Yeltsin's abrupt
resignation, has been leading other presidential candidates by a broad margin.
Recent opinion surveys have shown him with the support of more than half of
respondents, while his nearest rivals -- Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, 55,
and former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, 70 -- were polling at around 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kremlin is already predicting that Putin will stride to a landslide
victory in the elections. Igor Shabdurasulov, deputy chief of the presidential
staff, predicted Sunday that Putin will get more than 50 percent of the vote,
avoiding the need for a second round in the election.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, a taciturn former KGB colonel, is the exact opposite of the burly,
buoyant Yeltsin who led Russia's surge to democracy. Yet Putin has managed to
match Yeltsin's popularity of the early 1990s -- something no Russian politician
has dreamed of since then.
</P>
<P>
	   When Yeltsin appointed Putin to the prime minister's post in early August,
the security chief was ridiculed by the political elite and unknown to the broad
public. Attitudes toward Putin quickly changed to adoration after he launched a
massive onslaught on breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The war has been popular with the Russians, who see it as the only way to
protect the nation from terrorist attacks such as the apartment bombings, blamed
on Chechen militants, that killed over 300 people in September. Putin has been
seen as a no-nonsense man of action -- a welcome change for a nation that has
grown sick of inept government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has taken on a challenge in Chechnya, and his action there has shown
that he can get things done,'' Khudenkov said. ``He's calm, yet resolute,
exactly the kind of person who can establish order here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has skillfully used the campaign to further boost his ratings,
frequently visiting troops on the front line and at one point flying in an
attack jet on a mission near Chechnya. On New Year's Day, he rushed to Chechnya
along with his wife, Lyudmila, to award soldiers with hunting knives.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has hailed Putin's ascent as the last hope to restore its
former might.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope that this man will be able to revive Russia, restore its economic
might and strengthen its armed forces and the military industrial complex,''
Col. Valery Zhuravel, a Russian commander in Chechnya, said on NTV television.
</P>
<P>
	   Western criticism of Russia for the excessive use of force in Chechnya has
only strengthened Putin's popularity at home, where many people blame the West
for Russia's political, economic and social turmoil of the last decade.

	   ``Americans have been trying hard to ruin everything, and Putin looks like a
man who can act tough and make them respect Russia,'' said Vladimir Ilyukhin,
74, a retired diplomat who was walking his fox terrier on the snowy Moscow River
embankment. ``Putin is a strong man who can put right the crumbling economy and
make life better.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has pledged adherence to free-market reforms, albeit with an emphasis
on strong state regulation of the economy and better social protection, but his
economic and political views generally are not known to the public. In view of
his KGB background, Putin's reticence looks menacing to his rare critics, who
fear he might rule with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Russians, however, appear to dismiss such fears.

<HEADLINE> Church Leader To Meet Cuba Boy's Dad  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- A leader of the National Council of Churches arrived in Cuba
to meet today with the father of a 6-year-old boy who was rescued at sea and to
discuss efforts to return the child from the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are puzzled why it has taken so long,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell, the council's outgoing general secretary, after her arrival late
Sunday night. ``We thought the child would have been returned by now.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, Elian Gonzalez, was paroled by U.S. officials to his paternal
great-uncle in Miami in late November after the boy was found clinging to an
inner tube off the Florida coast. Elian's mother died in the apparent attempt to
illegally emigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has become a political tug-of-war, with the boy's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, demanding that his son be returned to him in Cuba and the
great-uncle fighting to keep the child with him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   People on both sides of the Florida Straits have used the case to make their
own political points for or against Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell informed the White House about the group's trip and efforts to
reunite Elian with his father. The council is the United States' largest
ecumenical organization, representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations
comprising 52 million congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service postponed until Jan. 21 a
hearing that had been scheduled for before Christmas, dragging out Elian's case
for another month.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell and the Rev. Oscar Bolioli, director of the council's office for
Latin America and the Caribbean, had a meeting scheduled today with Gonzalez in
the family's hometown, Cardenas, a two-hour's drive east of Havana. Also
scheduled to attend the meeting were Elian's four grandparents and a
great-grandmother -- all of whom want the boy returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The council has been working with the Cuban Council of Churches on the case,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell wrapped up her term as general secretary with the beginning of the
new year on Saturday, but she said the new general secretary, the Rev. Robert W.
Edgar, asked her to make the trip because of her two decades of experience in
dealing with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Big Bookstore Backlash in Arizona  </HEADLINE>
    By JOLYN OKIMOTO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- It took only a couple of weeks for the bookstore
sitting just off Route 66 to earn an unflattering nickname.
</P>
<P>
	   Some residents have taken to calling the new Barnes &AMP; Noble store the
"ashtray" because of a turret-like structure jutting from the roof. But the
name-calling goes beyond aesthetic concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many across the country, some people here see the presence of a Barnes
&AMP; Noble or any national chain in their town as a threat small-town atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one wants to go there," said John Alexander, 19, a Northern Arizona
University student born and raised in this former railroad and lumber town.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents actually began complaining before the 20,000 square-foot store
opened the day before Thanksgiving. One of their chief concerns was that a
megastore stocking the equivalent of one book for each of the city's 60,000
residents will snuff out local booksellers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am a local business owner and I want to support my neighbors," said Katie
Harris as she bought a book at McGaugh's Newsstand, an institution since the
1950's. "I think shopping locally promotes community."
</P>
<P>
	   Simultaneously historic, scenic and tacky, Flagstaff holds the hearts of
many of its residents.
</P>
<P>
	   A stopping point for many trekking north to the Grand Canyon or cutting
across Arizona, Flagstaff's main drag is a hodgepodge of gas stations, motels,
restaurants and a visual overload of signs.
</P>
<P>
	   It also features an almost hidden downtown of historic brick buildings
housing restaurants, cafes and shops offering American Indian art and kitschy
Route 66 souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Barnes &AMP; Noble sits against a backdrop of pine-covered hills and looms
over its nearest neighbors, Dairy Queen and Crystal Inn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd rather keep supporting stores that have always been a part of the
community," said Alexander, whose loyalty lies with stores like McGaugh's where
he remembers buying popcorn and comic books as a kid.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes &AMP; Noble spokesman John Harden, also a Flagstaff resident, said that
his store may be new, but it's committed to the community.
</P>
<P>
	   A percentage of proceeds from a pre-opening sale benefitted a reading
program for at-risk children and other outreach projects are being planned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few protesters spend "maybe an hour a day" outside, he said. "But the
parking lot is always full."
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike many residents, independent booksellers say they aren't too concerned
about their new giant neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not competing with them. We're a newsstand, not a bookstore," said
Lillian Osthoff, who has been general manager of McGaugh's since 1978 and knows
most of her customers by name.
</P>
<P>
	   The tiny store -- roughly 10 times smaller than Barnes &AMP; Noble -- makes the
most of its limited space, stocking 4,000 magazine titles, books, snacks and
even cigars.
</P>
<P>
	   "People come in for a quick pack of cigarettes or a candy bar -- sometimes
it's a toothbrush or a razor," Osthoff said from behind a counter displaying
items from corncob pipes to horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than bash her competition, Osthoff said she prefers to emphasize the
positive. She and a friend have printed bumper stickers with the slogan: "SLOB:
Support Locally Owned Businesses."
</P>
<P>
	   One bookstore owner says he has seen the bookstore business from both big
and small perspectives.
</P>
<P>
	   After working for a large book chain, Evan Midling now co-owns Starlight
Books, a two-room store with a worn, lived-in feel. The front door sticks and
customers worry about opening it too loudly.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly all of Midling's inventory is used -- and he said he plans to keep it
that way.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much competition in new books that it's not going to serve us
very well to compete head to head with places like Barnes &AMP; Noble," he said.

Americans Return to Work With Little Y2K Worry
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans returning to work today are logging onto office
computers for the first time since the Year 2000 rollover amid signs that
overseas businesses were operating mostly glitch-free. Hopes that phones,
financial systems and power would continue to run smoothly were bolstered after
electronic trading at two Chicago exchanges went off without a hitch late Sunday
and oversees markets reported no major Y2K glitches. But small mom-and-pop shops
that didn't take precautions against Y2K bugs and stayed closed over the holiday
weekend might experience problems -- possibly with credit card swipe devices
that have not been upgraded, federal officials cautioned.

U.S. Links Fate of Putin to Chechnya
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Increasing rhetorical pressure on Russia's new leader,
Clinton administration officials say acting President Vladimir Putin's political
future and place on the world stage will depend upon a peaceful end to the
conflict in Chechnya. Putin, who ascended to the presidency after Boris
Yeltsin's surprise New Year's Eve resignation, is the favorite to win in March
elections and a moving force behind the Russian military's assault on the
rebellious province, a campaign U.S. officials deplore.

Israel, Syria Head Into New Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With President Clinton mediating, Syria headed
into a fresh round of talks with Israel on Monday with "open minds and a
truthful desire" for peace. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he felt the
"burden of responsibility" to reach an agreement this year. Clinton, who has
made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, cleared his schedule to
preside over the first day of negotiations. Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa were expected to focus on four key issues during the talks:
security, the normalization of relations, water rights and how much of the
strategic Golan Heights Israel would return to Syria.

Elizabeth Dole Set To Endorse Bush

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three months after losing the race for campaign cash to
George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole plans to endorse the Texas governor this week to
bolster his bid for the GOP presidential nomination in the looming New Hampshire
and Iowa contests, say associates close to both politicians. The sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunday that Mrs. Dole was expected to
endorse Bush on Tuesday during appearances in both states. Mrs. Dole's
associates have urged her for weeks to endorse Bush and said this is the perfect
time to help him. They hope an endorsement elevates her chances to be Bush's
running mate, though officials in both camps say no guarantees have been made.

Clinton Backs $10M for Gun Research
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to spend $10 million to help gun
manufacturers develop new technologies designed to prevent the weapons from
being fired by anyone but their owners. White House chief of staff John Podesta
said Sunday that Clinton's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
will include money for the National Institute of Justice to fund research and
development of so-called smart-gun technology, which would use fingerprints,
radio waves or other ways to ensure that a weapon would fire only when used by
its owner.

The Pontiac Aztek, an all-wheel-drive SUV with some minivan elements, will go on

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Green Bay and Carolina needed to win, and win big, to have a chance to get
into the NFL playoffs. They did just that, but still didn't reach the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas City and Seattle needed to win by any score, and neither was able to
pull it off Sunday, giving a playoff spot to Miami, another team that lost on
the final weekend of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas and the New York Giants needed to win, too, and since they were
playing each other, it would have been fitting in this wacky season if they had
tied. But the Cowboys held on in the final quarter to claim the last of the 12
postseason spots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas and Detroit are the fourth and fifth 8-8 teams to reach the playoffs,
and while none of the previous three has won a game, the Cowboys see no reason
why they can't change that trend Sunday at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought today was the first sign of a team actually trying to come
together," said the Cowboys' Emmitt Smith, who ran for 122 yards in the 26-18
victory over the Giants. "I think we have something to build on and be confident
about."
</P>
<P>
	   Only Dallas controlled its own playoff fate in the NFC, and because the
Cowboys and Giants played a late-afternoon game, Green Bay and Carolina had to
proceed as if Dallas would lose.
</P>
<P>
	   So they engaged in a shootout reminiscent of what colleges try to do when
they want to impress pollsters. Under a possible tiebreaker with the Giants,
Carolina needed to win by 18 more points than Green Bay, and with the coaches
getting updates on the sideline, the points came in bunches as the teams kept
throwing the ball to the end.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina beat defenseless New Orleans 45-13, and Green Bay poured it on
Arizona, too, winning 49-24 to finish with an 11-point advantage in the
differential tiebreaker. But when Dallas won a few hours later and won the
tiebreaker on better conference record, the point differential became moot.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had our chances and didn't make the most of them," said Brett Favre, who
passed the 4,000-yard passing milestone for the season for the third time. "I
think everyone should be aware of that."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed that we didn't get the help we needed today from the
Giants," said Packers coach Ray Rhodes, who was reportedly fired after the game.
"It's tough to have your season end the way it has, watching Dallas win a game
on television. But we have no one to blame but ourselves -- we got in this
situation by not taking advantage of some opportunities we had earlier this
season."
</P>
<P>
	   In the AFC, wins by Kansas City (9-7) and Seattle (9-7) would have
eliminated Miami (9-7), but neither the Seahawks nor the Chiefs could do it.
Seattle lost 19-9 to the New York Jets and the Chiefs blew a 17-0 lead before
losing 41-18 in overtime to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami lost 21-10 to NFC East champion Washington (10-6), but earned the last
spot in the AFC. Seattle won the AFC West in a tiebreaker with Kansas City after
winning both of their meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   That set up next weekend's first round of playoffs, with Buffalo at
Tennessee and Detroit at Washington on Saturday, and Dallas at Minnesota and
Miami at Seattle on Sunday. St. Louis and Tampa Bay in the NFC and Indianapolis
and Jacksonville in the AFC have byes.
</P>
<P>
	   In other games Sunday, it was New England 20, Baltimore 3; Jacksonville 24,
Cincinnati 7; Minnesota 24, Detroit 17; Buffalo 31, Indianapolis 6; Tampa Bay
20, Chicago 6; Philadelphia 38, St. Louis 31; San Diego 12, Denver 6; and
Tennessee 47, Pittsburgh 36.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle's coaches and players gathered around a television set in a
trainer's room to root for Oakland after the Seahawks lost, and they looked like
winners when Kansas City lost to the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
	   Curtis Martin gained 158 of his 203 total yards on the ground and scored the
only touchdown of the game. He also set the Jets' single-season rushing record.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Kansas City quarterback Rich Gannon brought the Raiders (8-8) back
from a 17-0 deficit to knock the Chiefs out of the playoff. Gannon was 25-for-47
for 324 yards and three touchdowns as the Raiders won in Kansas City for the
first time in 11 tries.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Nedney kicked a 33-yarder to win the game in overtime after kicking a
38-yarder to tie it with 45 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Tucker turned a short catch into a 90-yard touchdown, Raghib Ismail
caught a 4-yard touchdown pass and Eddie Murray kicked four field goals for the
Cowboys, who finished 7-1 at home and 1-7 on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorsey Levens ran for four touchdowns and rookie Basil Mitchell returned a
kickoff 88 yards for a score against Arizona (6-10), which got 396 yards passing
from Jake Plummer. But he also had three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina (8-8) won six of nine to finish its first season under coach George
Seifert, but the Panthers still came up short of qualifying for a wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina, trying to overtake Green Bay in point-differential, threw on
nearly every play in the fourth quarter, and New Orleans (3-13) did the same,
well aware of the Panthers' desperate need to win big. Jaguars 24, Bengals 7
</P>
<P>
	   Jacksonville wrapped up the top seed in the AFC as Jay Fiedler, filling in
for Mark Brunell, was 28-of-39 for 317 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   But with Brunell already injured, the Jaguars (14-2) saw Pro Bowl offensive
linemen Tony Boselli and Leon Searcy leave the game with injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Smith had 14 catches to match Marvin Harrison's NFL high this season.
Smith and Keenan McCardell combined for 273 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, whose 13-3 record is the best for a wild-card team, scored 17
points in barely a minute of the second quarter. The Titans defense generated 16
points and set up another score against Pittsburgh (6-10).
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Johnson, Doug Flutie's backup for 15 games, was 24-of-32 for 287 yards
and threw two TD passes for Buffalo (11-5).
</P>
<P>
	   The Bills had a season-high 419 offensive yards as the Colts (13-3) had
their 11-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Alstott ran for a touchdown and Jacquez Green caught 10 passes for 113
yards as Tampa Bay (11-5) won its first NFC Central title since 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Randy Moss caught five passes for 151 yards and a touchdown for Minnesota
(10-6), which knocked Detroit into the sixth seeding position.
</P>
<P>
	   Lions quarterback Charlie Batch reinjured his broken right thumb and was
replaced by Gus Frerotte just before halftime. His status for the wild-card
playoff round next week is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner joined Dan Marino as the only quarterbacks with 40 TD passes in
a season and Marshall Faulk broke Barry Sanders' total yardage record, but St.
Louis (13-3) turned the ball over seven times to open the door for Philadelphia
(5-11).
</P>
<P>
	   Donovan McNabb threw the decisive 5-yard TD pass to Chad Lewis with 10:55
left, ending the Rams' seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Brown had three long kick returns to lead New England (8-8).
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots won just two of their last eight games after starting the
season 6-2. The Ravens also finished 8-8 with wins in four of their last five
games.

<P>
	   The losses by Seattle and Kansas City put Miami in the playoffs, ending any
suspense over whether this would be Dan Marino's last game as a player and-or
Jimmy Johnson's last game as coach.
</P>
<P>
	   For Washington, the game became meaningless when Tampa Bay's victory over
Chicago was flashed on the scoreboard seconds before the coin toss. The
Buccaneers got the NFC bye.
</P>
<P>
	   The Broncos ended their first season since 1982 without John Elway at 6-10,
last in the AFC West. Rookie running back Jermaine Fazande ran for 183 yards and
a touchdown for the Chargers (8-8).

<HEADLINE> Packers 49, Cardinals 24  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- It's time for the Green Bay Packers to pack their
bags and go on vacation. Four touchdown runs by Dorsey Levens, their highest
scoring output in 16 years and a 25-point victory couldn't get them back to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers' first season under coach Ray Rhodes just didn't measure up to
the previous six under Mike Holmgren. Their playoff run that began in 1993 and
included two trips to the Super Bowl is over.
</P>
<P>
	   That cost Rhodes and his coaching staff their jobs, a source close to the
team told The Associated Press late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Packers will
announce the firings at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
	   "From contender to pretender in one year," read one sign Sunday at Lambeau
Field, where even the 30-degree weather was tame by January standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Green Bay ended up on the final Sunday needing to win and needing the New
York Giants to beat Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers got the victory, 49-24 over the Arizona Cardinals, but not the
assist from the Giants. Dallas' 26-18 win over New York eliminated the Packers,
who finished 8-8, and secured the final NFC wild card for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough to have your season end the way it has, watching Dallas win a
game on television," Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But we have no one to blame but ourselves -- we got in this situation by
not taking advantage of some opportunities we had earlier this season."
</P>
<P>
	   Starting a little more than three hours before the Giants kicked off, the
Packers took care of what they could. Levens became the first Packers back since
Terdell Middleton in 1978 to score four TDs in a game and also went over 1,000
yards for the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers put up the points Sunday, knowing that if the Giants did beat
the Cowboys, they would need to stay ahead of Carolina in net conference points.
</P>
<P>
	   Green Bay began the day with an 18-point advantage over the Panthers, who
beat New Orleans 45-13. The Panthers' runaway victory in Charlotte made
scoreboard watching and point scoring a must Sunday on an overcast, 32-degree
day at Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
	   Levens' 1-yard run with 58 seconds to go finally iced the Packers' point
advantage over Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't understand the point system until one of our PR guys explained it
to me," Levens said. "I knew we had to put the points up on the board because
Carolina was pouring it on. So we had to do the same."
</P>
<P>
	   But hours later, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had our chances and didn't make the most of them," quarterback Brett
Favre said. "I think everyone should be aware of that. We can learn from a lot
of the things that happened this year if we want to."
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona (6-10), which went to the playoffs a year ago for the first time
since 1982, finished the season on a four-game losing streak. Now it remains to
be seen if coach Vince Tobin will get a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
	   "We started off horrendously and then we evened up things at 6-6," Tobin
said. "We couldn't find ways to win down the stretch."
</P>
<P>
	   Favre completed 21 of 34 passes for 311 yards to go over 4,000 yards passing
for the third time in his career.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona's Jake Plummer was 35-of-57 for 396 yards, two touchdowns and three
interceptions. His 9-yard scoring pass to Mac Cody with 1:31 left brought the
Cardinals within 18, jeopardizing the Packers' point advantage over Carolina.
Minutes later, a large cheer erupted at Lambeau when a New Orleans TD was shown.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were just strange events," Favre said. "When the season started, I
had no idea, it never crossed my mind, that we would be sitting here hoping the
Giants would beat Dallas to put us in. Or that we had to score 49 points and go
hurry-up when we were up by 18."
</P>
<P>
	   Levens' 5-yard run early in the fourth pushed the lead to 35-10 before a
51-yard pass from Plummer to Rob Moore set up Mario Bates' 1-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
	   With 3:42 left, Mike McKenzie's interception near the end zone apparently
gave the Packers the ball at the 20. But Arizona challenged the call, and replay
showed that McKenzie was down at the 1.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Packers had to go from near their own end zone and they used a
two-minute drill, even though they were 18 points in front.
</P>
<P>
	   And Favre responded, completing 6-of-7 passes in a 99-yard drive and hitting
Bill Schroeder with a 32-yard TD pass with 2:38 to go that made it 42-17.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Bowl QBs Ready To Battle  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD ROSENBLATT AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Michael Vick reacts, Chris Weinke reloads.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick relies on a wristband to remember plays; Weinke recalls plays faster
than his coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   A 19-year-old unflappable freshman vs. a financially secure 27-year-old
former pro baseball player.
</P>
<P>
	   The performances of these vastly different quarterbacks most likely will
determine who wins the national championship when No. 1 Florida State plays No.
2 Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick is the brilliant improviser, a gifted 6-foot-1, 212-pound left-hander
who combined poise and pinpoint passing to lead the Hokies to their first
national title shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a reaction guy, an instinctive player," Florida State coach Bobby
Bowden said. "If you were talking about a boxer, he'd be a counter fighter. You
take a swing at him and miss, he'll nail you."
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke, financially set after signing as a bonus baby and toiling six years
in the minors before returning to college, is almost Vick's polar opposite: a
6-5, 240-pound drop-back passer with steadiness, size and smarts. Hokies coach
Frank Beamer calls him simply "that big old guy."
</P>
<P>
	   While the quarterbacks are different in many ways, they have something in
common: Their teams have 11-0 records and they are playing in their first
national title game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whatever happens out there, he's not going to panic," Bowden said of
Weinke, whom he sometimes calls "Sir." "It's his emotions and his seniority and
his composure and his patience."
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden said he usually gives the seniors all the responsibility but made an
exception for Weinke, a junior.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chris is not a senior yet. He's simply a senior citizen," Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke, who threw for 3,103 yards and 25 touchdowns, was at his absolute
best in a 30-23 win at Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Gators went ahead 16-13 late in the third quarter, Weinke led the
'Noles to a tying field goal and two more TDs. That sealed the victory and gave
his team its third title shot in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of my age, guys look to me for leadership and I accept that role,"
Weinke said. "It's no secret what this team has gone through this year off the
field. I've been a leader in terms of keeping everyone focused. I can't pinpoint
anything, but I just go about my business."
</P>
<P>
	   In more ways than one. When he wasn't keeping the team together during Peter
Warrick's two-game suspension, he chatted with offensive coordinator Mark Richt
about other matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a normal 27-year-old," Richt said, smiling. "We talk financial stuff,
and he's given me some pretty good leads, too." Richt also said Weinke knows
some plays better than he does.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick also knows his business. He insisted on being redshirted last season
because he knew he wasn't ready to run a college offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to sit down and learn, get used to being in a college atmosphere,
get my studies down right," Vick says.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick started slowly in '99, missing the second half of the season-opener
against James Madison and the next game against Alabama-Birmingham because of a
sprained ankle caused by his flip for a touchdown. The next week, he threw three
interceptions against Clemson, but the defense took charge in a 31-11 win.
</P>
<P>
	   He's been nearly perfect since, completing 90 of 152 passes for 1,840 yards
and 12 touchdowns and running 108 times for 585 yards and eight TDs. He finished
third in the Heisman Trophy balloting, matching the best finish for a freshman;
was voted Big East Conference player of the year; and led the nation in pass
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   In a win against Temple, Vick borrowed a backup's wristband with scripted
plays on it, and called an option. He didn't realize the wristband was prepared
for a right-handed quarterback. So he improvised and ran 75 yards for a TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Corey Simon, Florida State's All-American noseguard, says Vick is so good
it's "scary if you're outside looking in."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's elusive, quick, has a strong arm -- he's got the whole package in one
body," Simon said. "We need to put pressure on him and hope he makes mistakes. I
hope we can help him make some rookie mistakes."
</P>
<P>
	   Not likely, Vick says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being calm is just the type of person I am," he said. "I go out there and
try to execute the game plan. It's kind of tough to get to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Not many opponents have gotten to Weinke, either.
</P>
<P>
	   But playing at Florida State wasn't a sure thing for him at this time last
season. His career nearly ended with a neck injury against Virginia. He had
surgery in November 1998, and then went through two months of debilitating
headaches caused by leaking spinal fluid. He came back to the weight room and
regained 25 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't know if I'd ever have an opportunity to play again," Weinke said.
"So when we didn't win the championship game last year, I used that as a
motivational factor, to get healthy and play for a national championship. And
not just get there, I want to win it."
</P>
<P>
	   So does Vick.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've seen him here and there on films and he's a great athlete," Weinke
says. "But the way I look at it, we're both college quarterbacks. On the 4th,
we're going to find out who can get the job done."

<HEADLINE> Hokies Tailback Works in Shadows  </HEADLINE>
    By HANK KURZ Jr. AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- In any other season, and probably with any other
quarterback as a teammate, Shyrone Stith would be a well-known tailback.
</P>
<P>
	   Stith rushed for 1,119 yards and a school record-tying 13 touchdowns this
season for Virginia Tech. He caught four passes for 48 yards, averaged 25.8
yards on 15 kickoff returns and was the first-team selection in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
	   But while rookie Michael Vick and his fleet feet, powerful arm and ability
to improvise like a veteran received much of the credit, Stith helped make it
all possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "To have a great runner like Shyrone behind me, a 1,000-yard rusher, it
takes a lot of pressure off me," Vick said. "He's done that all season, and I
think that's where a lot of our success has come from in the play action game."
</P>
<P>
	   Stith has no problem taking a back seat to Vick. Stith shuns the spotlight
and thinks operating in the shadows could play right into the Hokies' hands.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think they are too worried about me or the receivers. All I've
heard is 'Michael, Michael, Michael,"' Stith said of Florida State, the Hokies'
opponent in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night with the national championship on
the line.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe something else will open up."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one Seminoles defender doesn't sound too concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   "Michael Vick makes the offense," linebacker Brian Allen said. "Stith is a
1,000-yard rusher, but he's not anything without his offensive line."
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle thinks the junior's lack of national
recognition is a simple product of Stith living up to high expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody thought Shyrone would be good and then Michael Vick had the year
that he had, Davis popped out of the woodwork and so those were surprises,"
Bustle said, referring to receiver Andre Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody knew that Shyrone would be a good player, and he was."
</P>
<P>
	   Stith began to see in the spring that this year could be special for the
Hokies when Vick was having his way against the heralded first-team defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was one of the main keys in the spring, changing the attitude that
Virginia Tech was just a defense and special teams team," Stith said. "Michael
Vick changed that whole interpretation of our team. We have an offense now."
</P>
<P>
	   And Stith, initially reluctant to redshirt two years ago when the Hokies had
a glut of quality tailbacks, now feels like agreeing to it was a good move.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the right thing for me to do," he said. "I took the back seat and I
think I did a good job with doing that. Now I've got another year next year."

<HEADLINE> Seminoles Tailback Plays Big  </HEADLINE>
    By BRENT KALLESTAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Travis Minor is often overlooked by opponents. After
all, the Florida State tailback certainly isn't a star -- he doesn't even have a
1,000-yard season yet.
</P>
<P>
	   What he does have is something most players only dream about: a shot at the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of guys out there with 1,500 yards are going to be watching us on the
4th," said Minor, who has averaged about 770 yards rushing in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Although his carries have been limited with the pass-happy Seminoles, Minor
has run for enough yards to rank fifth on Florida State's career list and his 26
touchdowns rank sixth.
</P>
<P>
	   And he's usually at the top of his game when it counts the most.
</P>
<P>
	   Minor averaged 100 yards in three games against rival Florida and 98 yards
in seven games against Top 10 teams in his career.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a matter of whenever the coaches call your number, you'd better be
ready for it," he said. "We've all got roles."
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot, 190-pound Minor is also an excellent blocker and receiver,
catching 64 passes in his career. Running backs coach Bill Sexton says Minor has
few flaws on the field.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's got strong marks across the board in all areas," Sexton said. "He's
extremely tough, very intelligent and a student of the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster says it's critical that the
Hokies control the Florida State running game, which ranked 83rd nationally this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can't, that's when they like toying with you," Foster said. "If they
have success running the football, then for sure you'll have to crowd eight guys
around the football."
</P>
<P>
	   While Minor isn't that well known to fans, opposing coaches don't need an
introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's right there with some of the best we've played: (Virginia's) Thomas
Jones, the kids from Miami and any other backs we've faced," Foster said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a lot of focus on Peter Warrick. If you put all your attention on
one individual, they have other guys that can exploit you."
</P>
<P>
	   For the second time in three years, Minor will be playing in the Sugar Bowl,
about an hour's drive from his home in Baton Rouge. He was recruited out of
Baton Rouge Catholic High School, the same school as former Seminoles great
Warrick Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   Minor's biggest challenge in the week leading up to the national title game
has been finding tickets for family and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anytime you get a chance to come back home it's great," he said. "Except
for tickets. They're so hard to come by that I had to quit doing that."

<HEADLINE> Miami Defense Shoots Down Shootout  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- After paying the price for NCAA probation, coach
Butch Davis thinks No. 23 Miami is close to rejoining the elite in college
football.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense certainly looked the part in the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 17 Georgia Tech came into the game with the No. 1 offense in the NCAA
led by the dangerous Joe Hamilton, the only player to ever have 1,500 yards
rushing among his 10,000-plus yards in total offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton walked off the field wondering what hit him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I could put my hand on it, but I can't," he said. "I just have to
give credit to Miami."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes (9-4) held Georgia Tech to its lowest output of the year in a
28-13 victory on Saturday, the fewest points it has scored in 17 games. It was
also the first time in 14 games that Hamilton failed to throw a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
	   More than anything, however, it offered more hope to Miami that its best
days await.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want our guys to buy into the idea that we're closing the gap," Davis
said. "We've paid our dues. We paid the price. I believe our football program is
getting into a position to have a chance to play for a championship."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes have 17 starters returning next year, including all of its
skill positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophomore quarterback Kenny Kelly and freshman Ken Dorsey each threw a
touchdown pass. Clinton Portis, the first true freshman to start at tailback for
Miami since 1975, rushed for 117 yards and scored on a 73-yard run. James
Jackson, a junior, added 107 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   And all the defense did was hold Georgia Tech to nearly four touchdowns
below its average. Hamilton scored on a 17-yard scrambled, but Tech had two
turnovers and missed two field goals out of its seven drives inside the Miami
30.
</P>
<P>
	   "They took control of the game and kept it their favor," Georgia Tech safety
Chris Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes were so impressive that Dan Dyke, who punted only 30 times
all year for Tech, kicked a season-high six times against Miami. And to cap it
all off, linebacker Nate Webster had 14 tackles and became the first defensive
player since 1989 to be named MVP of the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "The offense played good, but the defense ... wow," Portis said. "No one
expected that. All week, Georgia Tech had been bragging, 'We'll put up 40, we
can put up 40 on any team.' Our defense ... wanted to shut Georgia Tech out."
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Tech (8-4) was second in the nation in scoring with at least 30
points in all but one of their games. Its defense has been a disastrous,
allowing 30.3 points a game. A shootout seemed so likely that both coaches
referred to an NBA score as a possibility in the days leading up to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one of them was kidding.
</P>
<P>
	   The more Davis watched film, the more he realized the Yellow Jackets had not
seen the kind of speed Miami was about to show them. Hamilton had a tough time
getting outside and was closed off in the middle. He ran 22 times for 49 yards,
and was 20-of-40 for 245 yards but intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really, truly believed that we would stuff them," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Miami left town optimistic about the next several years, Georgia Tech
has some question marks.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton set 18 school records and will be sorely missed. Dez White, the
junior flanker who caught eight passes for 100 yards, will decide over the next
few weeks whether to make himself eligible for the draft.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've just got to regroup, come back next year and go from there," running
back Sean Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Caps Great Year in Citrus  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Michigan State cornerback Amp Campbell raised a few
eyebrows in the days before the Citrus Bowl game when he hung a "pretty boys"
label on the Florida players.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk like that can backfire.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, however, Campbell and the No. 9 Spartans backed up their talk
with a 34-31 victory over the No. 10 Gators. And they did it the Big Ten way, by
pounding the football, wearing Florida down at the end.
</P>
<P>
	   With the score tied at 34 in the fourth quarter, both teams had several
chances to win the game Saturday. But fumbles, interceptions and missed field
goals kept things tense.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, with 1:35 remaining, the Spartans (10-2) got the ball back one last
time. Starting at their own 45, they drove 33 yards in six plays to set up Paul
Edinger's 39-yard field goal on the last play of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is huge," said Edinger, who grew up just down I-4 in Lakeland, Fla.
"We didn't even go to a bowl last year. To go 9-2 this season and then go to one
of the best bowls in the country and beat Florida -- it's the best way to go out
for all the seniors."
</P>
<P>
	   It was a bitter loss for the Gators (9-4), who finished their season on a
three-game losing streak. Still, they were impressed with the way Michigan State
drove for the winning kick.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Burke, the senior quarterback seeking redemption for a slump that had
fans back in East Lansing booing him the second half of the season, opened the
drive with a 5-yard pass to Plaxico Burress.
</P>
<P>
	   This was a familiar sight. Burke passed for 257 yards and three touchdowns,
all three of them to Burress, the sensational junior who probably will skip to
the NFL next season.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the Spartans put some muscle on the Gators, giving the ball to Lloyd
Clemons four straight times.
</P>
<P>
	   It was nothing fancy. Clemons, a 207-pound fireplug, went straight ahead for
gains of 12, 6, 2 and 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were prepared for the run," Florida defensive tackle Buck Gurley said.
"We just couldn't stop it."
</P>
<P>
	   Clemons finished with 105 yards on 20 carries. Freshman T.J. Duckett ran 14
times for another 77 yards. The pounding took its toll on the Florida defenders.
They're used to more of a speed game in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Several times, a Florida defender would get a shoulder on either Clemons or
the 255-pound Duckett, only to have them break the tackle and grind out a few
more yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was hoping they'd be the ones getting tired," Florida coach Steve
Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Gators kept giving ground until Edinger finished it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Reliable," said Bobby Williams, coaching his first game since taking
over for Nick Saban, who left to coach at LSU. "He's been consistently a good
kicker. He doesn't seem to fold under pressure."
</P>
<P>
	   This was an especially hard loss for the proud Gators who only a few weeks
ago were still in contention for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Spurrier brought back the Fun 'n' Gun offense and let senior quarterback
Doug Johnson have every opportunity to go out on top. Johnson threw 50 passes,
but completed less than half of them. He finished with 288 yards and three
touchdown passes, all three to junior Travis Taylor who was almost as
spectacular as Burress.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never thought I'd see the day when Florida would lose three games in a
season, let along three in a row," Taylor said. "But we did some good things on
offense. Hopefully, we can take that into next season and build on it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Spartans, who wrapped up their first 10-win season since 1965, were
thinking the same thing. Especially with the charismatic Williams in charge.
</P>
<P>
	   "We should go out and try to win the national championship next season,"
linebacker Julian Peterson said.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Bowl Notebook  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- One more win and Florida State can claim a perfect
season -- and a piece of college football history.
</P>
<P>
	   A victory over No. 2 Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night would
make the top-ranked Seminoles the first team to go wire-to-wire in the AP poll
since the preseason ratings began in 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   Two teams -- Nebraska in 1983 and Florida State in 1993 -- came close. The
'83 Cornhuskers went 12-0 and were No. 1 until losing to Miami 31-30 in the
Orange Bowl; the '93 Seminoles were No. 1 for most of the season, lost to Notre
Dame but beat Nebraska in the Orange Bowl to claim the title.
</P>
<P>
	   Other near misses in the last half-century were Michigan State in 1952 (No.
2 in Oct. 6 poll); Nebraska in 1971 (No. 2 in preseason poll); and Southern
California in 1972 (No. 8 in preseason poll).
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1950, eight teams were ranked No. 1 in the preseason and went on to
win the national title: Tennessee (1951); Michigan State (1952); Oklahoma (1956,
1974, 1975, 1985); Alabama (1978); and Florida State (1993).
</P>
<P>
	   Before 1950 and preseason rankings, there were two wire-to-wire champions --
Notre Dame in 1943 and Army in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   The pre-'50 near misses included Minnesota in 1941 (No. 2 in Nov. 3 poll)
and Notre Dame in 1949 (No. 2 in Oct. 3 poll).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   JUST CALL HIM COACH ... OR DAD: There are times, Shane Beamer admits, when
it's odd seeing his father at work.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Beamer is coach of Virginia Tech. Son Shane is the team's deep snapper
on punts.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's still kind of weird, knowing he's my dad," Shane said Sunday. "I mean
when I'm at home at my apartment, it's dad. We hardly ever talk about football.
But when we're on the field, it's coach."
</P>
<P>
	   The Beamers will be on the field for the last time when the Hokies take on
Florida State in a matchup of unbeaten teams. To the coach, it's already been a
perfect season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some things just turn out better than you could ever imagine," he said.
"You try to draw it up and dadgum if it doesn't turn out better.
</P>
<P>
	   "For him to have a vital role on the team, I mean, he does what he does
well, and then for him to be playing for the national championship in his final
year, that's better than you can ever imagine."
</P>
<P>
	   Shane Beamer was a star wide receiver in high school, but decided to stay in
Blacksburg, Va., even though he knew his opportunities to play football would be
limited.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been tough at times," the senior said. "I'd be lying if I said I liked
playing only four or five plays a game. I work out in practice with the wide
receivers, but snapping is my priority."
</P>
<P>
	   Keeping up a player-coach relationship with his dad, at least on the field,
also is important.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we go out of our way to downplay that we're father and son," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Added the coach: "I try to treat him like everyone else and not any
differently. I try to treat him like all the other players out here."
</P>

<P>
	   JUST KICK ME: Florida State kicker Sebastian Janikowski found another use
for his powerful left leg during the weekend -- he ran extra wind sprints for
missing curfew on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Janikowski served the penalty Saturday and also spent all night in his hotel
room. But the two-time All-American won't miss any action in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they put the ball out there, he's going to kick it," coach Bobby
Bowden said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive back Reggie Durden also ran extra sprints Saturday for violating
curfew during the week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It ain't the first time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The third truant last week, defensive end Roland Seymour, and senior tackle
Jerry Johnson spent Sunday in the team hotel with flu symptoms.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   YIKES! Shayne Graham watched the Orange Bowl on TV, and cringed at how it
ended.
</P>
<P>
	   The Virginia Tech kicker saw Alabama's Ryan Pflugner miss an extra-point try
on the last play of overtime, giving Michigan a 35-34 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt a little bit of pain for the kid when I saw him walking off the
field," said Graham, 22. "You hate for all the blame to come down to one person.
Because there were 60 other minutes of play when other players could have done
something to win the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Graham made his biggest kick of the season, a 44-yarder as time expired to
win at West Virginia 22-20 on Nov. 6 and preserve the Hokies' title hopes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pflugner's kick was wide right.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a bad feeling when he ran onto the field, before he made the kick. I
remembered Alabama won an overtime game this season against Florida when they
missed an extra point, but got another chance because of a penalty," Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "My heart kind of sank for the kid last night," Graham said. "You don't
really want to see the game decided on one person's error."

<HEADLINE> Michigan Feels for Alabama Kicker  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A stunned Ryan Pflugner dropped to one knee, his head bowed
and his career at Alabama over.
</P>
<P>
	   The kicker missed an extra point on the final play of overtime, giving
Michigan a 35-34 victory in the Orange Bowl and leaving players and coaches from
both teams shaking their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a hard-fought game. It's not like they came here and won big,"
Crimson Tide defensive tackle Kenny Smith said. "It was a close game, and a
tough one to lose."
</P>
<P>
	   Especially the way Alabama did.
</P>
<P>
	   Failing to hold a 14-point lead in regulation twice. Answering Michigan's
touchdown in overtime, only to fall when Pflugner pushed the extra point attempt
wide right.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone is going to blame me," the senior said. "I missed the last kick.
It came down to an extra point I should have made. But it's a team game.
Everyone probably could have done something to make it better."
</P>
<P>
	   Pflugner's teammates refused to let him take sole responsibility for the
loss. Several rushed to the kicker and embraced him before escorting him off the
field.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama got 161 yards rushing and three touchdowns from Southeastern
Conference player of the year Shaun Alexander, however the Crimson Tide also had
18 penalties for 132 yards and couldn't stop Michigan after shutting down the
Wolverines for nearly a half.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told myself all week that no matter what happens this week and throughout
the season, I thank the Lord for just being here," Pflugner said. "That's all I
can say."
</P>
<P>
	   After converting all 27 of his extra point attempts as a junior, the Alabama
kicker was 21-of-25 this season despite being hampered by a pulled groin muscle
that kept him out of three games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crimson Tide beat Florida under similar circumstances during the regular
season when the Gators missed an extra point on the last play of overtime.
Pflugner thought he struck the ball well, but it drifted just right of the right
upright.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan coach Lloyd Carr saw his team overcome a slow start behind the
passing of Tom Brady, who was 34-of-46 for 369 yards, four touchdowns and no
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Carr also had mixed emotions about the way the game ended after Michigan
lost a fourth-quarter fumble at the Alabama 1 and had a 36-yard field-goal
attempt blocked as time expired in regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines coach has never been a proponent of overtime. And while he
felt his team deserved to win, he said it probably would have been fitting if
the game had ended on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody wants to see a winner, but somebody lost, too. ... To have a game
decided on a missed extra point, I feel bad for that kid," the Michigan coach
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady's fourth TD pass, a 25-yarder to Shawn Thompson on the first play of
overtime, snapped a 28-28 tie. Andrew Zow threw 21 yards to Antonio Carter to
keep Alabama in the game before Pflugner's miss set off a wild celebration among
Michigan players and fans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolverines overcame deficits of 14-0 and 28-14 and finished with 406
yards total offense after being held to 47 in the first 28 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   David Terrell, the game's MVP, had 10 catches for 150 yards and scored on
receptions of 27, 57 and 20 yards for Michigan (10-2), which also got a 3-yard
TD run from Anthony Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have so much to offer for next season," Terrell said, looking ahead. "We
have a lot of players coming back. And if no one leaves early for the NFL, we
will be a stronger team."
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander played his last game for Alabama (10-3). But Zow and Freddie
Milons, the explosive receiver who scored on a 62-yard punt return, are
sophomores who figure to be part of a promising future for the Crimson Tide.
</P>
<P>
	   There's already talk about how the team, which rebounded from a sexual
harassment scandal involving coach Mike DuBose to win the SEC championship,
could be good enough to earn a return trip to Miami for next season's national
title game.
</P>
<P>
	   Zow isn't afraid of heightened expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we showed the nation that Alabama is back," the quarterback said.
"We'll be back here next year."

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A thrilling finish got the Miami Heat off to a good start in
their new home.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first game at the $215 million American Airlines Arena, Miami
overcame a late 10-point deficit to beat the Orlando Magic 111-103 in overtime
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was kind of miraculous," Heat forward P.J. Brown said. "It was the
inaugural game, and we didn't want the record books saying we lost to the
Orlando Magic."
</P>
<P>
	   The only NBA game on Sunday drew a sellout crowd of 19,600, but many fans
departed before the wild finish.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were dead in the water with three minutes to go," Heat coach Pat Riley
said. "We're going to have to be better than we were tonight to keep people
interested."
</P>
<P>
	   Miami trailed 93-83 with 2:32 left in the fourth quarter, but Alonzo
Mourning's 8-foot jumper with eight seconds left tied it at 96. Orlando's Pat
Garrity missed a 20-footer as the clock ran out, forcing overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning hit three free throws in the extra period to put Miami ahead to
stay, and a 3-pointer by Dan Majerle made it 104-98. The Magic went four minutes
without a point, and the Heat made five free throws in the final 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew we would lose some games down the stretch this year because of how
young we are," Orlando coach Doc Rivers said. "But I didn't think we would lose
this one."
</P>
<P>
	   Voshon Lenard led Miami with 24 points. Mourning had just two points at
halftime but finished with 21 despite missing 14 of 18 shots. He grabbed only
four rebounds for the Heat, who were outrebounded 63-45.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami's Jamal Mashburn, who returned to the lineup after missing five games
because of a sprained ankle, had 22 points and 10 rebounds. Rookie Anthony
Carter sparked the Heat comeback with the first 3-pointer of his career, closing
the deficit to 95-92 with 1:17 left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's when I said, 'We're going to get this deal,"' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter missed his first seven 3-point attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq Abdul-Wahad scored 22 points and Darrell Armstrong 16 for Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat won their third game in a row and beat the Magic for the second
time in five days. The Magic lost their fourth consecutive game and slipped to
.500.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're up like that, you should win," Armstrong said. "The last four
games have been close, and we still haven't won any of them. It's tough."
</P>
<P>
	   Magic center John Amaechi scored the first basket in the arena -- and the
first of the new century in the NBA. His jersey will be sent to the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami missed 18 of its first 25 shots, trailed most of the game and never
got closer than seven points in the fourth quarter until the final two minutes.
But at the finish, the Heat felt at home.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an absolutely beautiful place," Riley said. "And it's a good win.
We'll take it."

<HEADLINE> Pippen Makes First Return to Chicago  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Break out the No. 33 jerseys and start reminiscing, Chicago
Bulls fans. Scottie Pippen is back.
</P>
<P>
	   OK, so it's only for one night. But no matter what uniform he wears or how
many times he disses the Bulls, Chicago fans will always claim Pippen as their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expect a warm welcome," Pippen said. "I'm looking forward to going back
there. It'll be my first time since winning the title there, so it should be a
lot of fun. I'm going to enjoy it."
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen's return to the United Center tonight is his first since the 1998 NBA
Finals, when he was still wearing a Bulls uniform, Michael Jordan was still
dazzling fans and Chicago was still good.
</P>
<P>
	   My, how things have changed. Pippen now wears the black, red and white of
the Portland Trail Blazers, Jordan is golfing and the Bulls are chasing the
NBA's all-time record for futility. At 2-25, Chicago already has lost more games
than it did altogether in 1995-96 (10) and 1996-97 (13).
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm grateful I was able to leave Chicago before the ship started sinking,"
Pippen said. "I hate to see them struggle like that."
</P>
<P>
	   At least Bulls fans had an appropriate mourning period before seeing Pippen
up close in another uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   Like almost everyone else in the championship gang, Pippen left town shortly
after Jordan and coach Phil Jackson. His first stop was Houston, but Chicago
didn't play the Rockets last year because of the lockout and the shortened
season that followed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen headed west last summer after a disappointing season with the Rockets
and a public squabble with Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be REAL weird," said Bulls center-forward Dickey Simpkins, a
longtime teammate and friend of Pippen's. "I haven't seen Pip in I don't know
how long. It's going to be different.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't play him last year, so I'm expecting he's going to get a warm
welcome from the fans. I'm sure his energy is going to be up being back here."
</P>
<P>
	   While Pippen was booed loud and long when he returned to Houston earlier
this season, the Bulls and their fans are sure to give him a better reception. A
two-minute video tribute will be shown during introductions.
</P>
<P>
	   His No. 33 probably will be retired someday, too, though not until he's
finished playing.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a part of basketball. People move, they find other places to play,"
former teammate Toni Kukoc said. "I don't think it should change the
relationship between us just because we play on different teams. Maybe during
the game, but overall, we all have great memories of playing with each other."
</P>
<P>
	   But there might be a few boos, warned Will Perdue, who returned to Chicago
this season after playing on the Bulls' first three championship teams.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will be mixed reaction," Perdue said. "They're having a
two-minute video tribute for Scottie, which I think is well deserved. But I do
know that with some of his comments and actions in the past, he's alienated some
of the fans."
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in Jordan's shadow, Pippen's relationship with Chicago and the Bulls
was often complicated. Fans still remember him sitting out the last 1.8 seconds
of Game 3 of the 1994 Eastern Conference semifinals because Jackson called the
last play for Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
	   He was still recovering from foot surgery when he said he wouldn't play in
Chicago anymore and demanded to be traded a few weeks into the 1997-98 season.
He eventually backed off and returned, but his unhappiness with management
festered.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Bulls were his team for the first 11 seasons of his career, the
team with whom he won six championships. No matter what happens, the memories
will always be there.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be an emotional time having been there for so long, but I hope not,
because I have a game to play," he said. "So I'm hoping to do what I'm there
for."

<HEADLINE> Beamer's Determination Still Simmers  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The most revealing story about Frank Beamer has nothing
to do with football. Not at the beginning, anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   That was 1954, long before Virginia Tech's 53-year-old coach had any idea
how he would make his living or that one day he would play for a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
	   A long scar running down the right side of Beamer's neck is a reminder of
that episode. Yet somehow, it wasn't until the spotlight landed on him that his
own son learned the details.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't like to talk about it," said Shane Beamer, who doubles as the
long snapper for the Hokies, "and I didn't want to ask."
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't hard to understand why.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Beamer was an easygoing 7-year-old growing up on a farm in the tiny
town of Fancy Gap, Va., the passageway between two Appalachian peaks. One day,
after helping his own father burn a pile of trash, Frank carried a smoldering
broom back into the garage. It ignited a can of gasoline, causing an explosion
that left him with severe burns on the right side of his neck, shoulder and
chest.
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer's older brother, Barnett, probably saved his life. He had the
presence of mind to roll Frank in the dirt and extinguish the flames. But the
suffering was only beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next four years, Beamer underwent 30 operations, most of them skin
grafts that didn't take. But every time he began to feel sorry for himself,
Beamer's mother, an elementary school teacher, made him walk down the hall at
the hospital. He always found someone in worse shape. Those memories steeled him
for nearly every challenge that followed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doctors said he might be able to walk, but that he definitely was
through with sports. He was determined to prove them wrong and he did," Shane
said. "If he tells you he's going to do something, whether it's golf or football
or even cooking out, it will happen. I see that determination in him now more
than anything."
</P>
<P>
	   This sort of thing happens every so often at the national championship. A
coach with a chance to validate his credentials by winning the biggest game of
his career comes in with a reputation but turns out to be very different.
</P>
<P>
	   All season, as Virginia Tech erased opponents and critics, the pictures
relayed from the sidelines and post-game interviews in Blacksburg, Va., made
Beamer look like the most regular of regular guys. Quiet. Content with his good
fortune. Hoping he had many years ahead on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   And yet from the moment Beamer arrived in Blacksburg in 1987, his
determination simmered just below the surface.
</P>
<P>
	   He recruited the local kids that big programs overlooked and taught them to
overachieve. He hired defensive whiz Phil Elmassian a half-dozen years ago and
gave him the freedom to play an attacking style. It became known as Beamer Ball,
and soon other colleges were trying to imitate it.
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer told reporters who showed up for his first news conference at
Virginia Tech that he would be playing for a national title. They snickered, but
after seven straight bowl appearances, he's the one laughing now.
</P>
<P>
	   "I may be from a small town," Beamer said not long after his arrival in the
Big Easy, "but I don't think I've ever thought small."
</P>
<P>
	   After that day in 1954, he could hardly afford to.
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer went on to play the games the doctors said he would not, and hasn't
quit exceeding expectations since. He was a star quarterback in high school, a
5-foot-9, 170-pound starter at defensive back for Virginia Tech in the mid-1960s
and the coach at Murray State. He then returned home to inherit a program the
NCAA had just put on probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer started in a rut and hit a handful of others on the way. He lost five
of his first six games against rival Virginia. In his sixth year, he went 2-8-1
and learned that he wasn't the only one suffering the consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   Shane and daughter Casey caught flak from schoolmates and his wife, Cheryl,
heard about her husband's shortcomings in the grocery aisles. When the phone
started ringing at home, it bothered Beamer more than the losses.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they wanted to write him or call him, that's the way he wanted it to
happen," Cheryl Beamer recalled. "I was naive. I thought everybody was nice. So
I had our number unlisted."
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody knows where to find Beamer these days. He'll be the coach on the
sideline at the Sugar Bowl looking calmer than he has a right to be.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Tim Allen is looking to make some home
improvements of his own.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen, who stars in the comedy-adventure movie "Galaxy Quest" and is the
voice of toy astronaut Buzz Lightyear in "Toy Story 2," bought the Hollywood
Hills home of actor Christian Slater for $2.2 million, the Los Angeles Times
reported Sunday.
</P>

separated from his wife of 15 years in fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5,500-square-foot home built in 1990 has three bedrooms, a pool and

<HEADLINE> Weaver Hopes Film Gets Recognition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sigourney Weaver hopes her Golden Globe nomination will
put her latest film on the map.
</P>
<P>
	   Weaver was nominated for best dramatic actress last month for "A Map of the
World," which had a one-week run in Los Angeles and New York in early December
and is to open in wider release nationwide on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was such a small picture going in," said Weaver, star of the "Alien"
movies and the current comedy "Galaxy Quest." "I only hope the nomination will
give us more recognition factor."
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Jane Hamilton's novel, "A Map of the World" tells the story of a
school nurse whose life is shattered when a friend's daughter drowns under her
care and a boy accuses her of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the most challenging role I've ever had," Weaver said. "The arc of
this character is so unusual. She's not a Hollywood heroine. She's very flawed,
and you don't necessarily like her."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie co-stars Julianne Moore and David Strathairn.

<HEADLINE> Skater Witt Seeks '10' in Acting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Olympic gold medal figure skater Katarina Witt always
strives for that perfect 10 -- even when she's acting.
</P>
<P>
	In a recently-taped episode of Pamela Anderson Lee's syndicated TV series
``V.I.P.'', Witt played a villain.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in this knock-down, drag-out fight with Pam and I get flattened,'' Witt
said in Sunday's New York Daily News. ``So when we finish shooting, the whole
cast comes out holding these little signs saying 10.0 ... 9.8. It was so sweet
-- but I kept thinking, 'Who gave me a 9.8?'''
</P>
<P>
	Witt, 33, won Olympic gold in 1984 and 1988. She's gone on to appear in movies
like ``Ronin,'' to pose for Playboy and promote her own line of jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	She's also appearing in the upcoming NBC special, ``Divas on Ice,'' a figure
skating program she also is producing.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal presides over Sunday service but not from pulpit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - After the city was recently home to an estimated 2
million New Year's Eve revelers, Cardinal John O'Connor wants people to remember
that they owe their existence to Jesus Christ.
<P>
	   "We, of course, have to remind ourselves that these 2 million people here in
New York have been preceded by 2,000 years of Christianity," O'Connor told
worshippers during Sunday service at St. Patrick's Cathedral. "We have been here
not by accident, not because of the festivities, but because for 2,000 years,
Christ's presence on earth has fed us and made it possible for us to live
Christian lives."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor had missed a handful of Masses in recent months, but on Sunday he
presided over his third consecutive Mass. In each case, O'Connor delivered the
Mass from a seat near the cathedral's high altar rather than climbing the stone
steps to the pulpit, where the sermon is traditionally delivered.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor had a brain tumor removed four months ago and has said that his
legs are still weak from his treatment and recovery. In addition to missing
Masses, at other times he stumbled while mounting the steps to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal said he planned to return to work at his First Avenue office
today for the first time since his surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday he delivered his sermon from the same spot where he sat during
midnight Mass on Christmas Eve and for the past two Sundays. He stood briefly at
several points during the service.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal turns 80 on Jan. 15 and has hinted that he does not expect to
preside over New York's archdiocese much longer. A dinner honoring him is
scheduled to take place on the night of his birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   It's up to the pope to decide when O'Connor's tenure ends and who replaces
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Possible successors include Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis, who, like
O'Connor, is close to the pope; Edwin O'Brien, the Bronx-born archbishop to the
U.S. military; and Roberto Gonzalez, archbishop of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who
has East Harlem roots and would suit New York's increasingly Hispanic flock.

<HEADLINE> 'Stuart Little' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You can't keep a good mouse down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little," with Michael J. Fox supplying the voice of the plucky
rodent, reclaimed the top spot at the weekend box office with $16 million,
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   A combination of computer animation and live action, "Stuart Little" pushed
its total gross to $79.7 million in 17 days of release. The movie, based on E.B.
White's children's tale, debuted as the No. 1 film two weeks ago before dropping
to third over Christmas weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "With Christmas Eve falling on a Friday, that's notoriously rougher on
family films," said Ed Russell, executive vice president for publicity at Sony
Pictures, which released "Stuart Little." "This past week is where kids came
back with their families."
</P>
<P>
	   With no new movies opening in wide release this weekend, holdovers made up
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Green Mile" was No. 2 with $13.2 million. Last weekend's top film, "Any
Given Sunday," was a close third with $13.1 million, "Toy Story 2" took fourth
with $12.2 million and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was fifth with $12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The films were bunched so closely that rankings could change when studios
release final weekend numbers today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Toy Story 2" climbed to $208.6 million since its Thanksgiving release,
passing "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" as the No. 3 movie released in
1999. "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" is first with $430.5 million
and "The Sixth Sense" is second with $276 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Star Wars" prequel, which reopened on Christmas for a three-week
domestic run, moved into second place last week on the all-time worldwide list
with $922 million, about $2 million more than "Jurassic Park," according to
"Star Wars" distributor 20th Century Fox. "Titanic" grossed $1.8 billion
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest weekend premiere was Disney's "Fantasia/2000," an update of the
1940 animated classic that opened Saturday for an exclusive four-month run in 75
large-screen Imax theaters around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   At 46 of those theaters in the United States and Canada, the movie did an
average of $22,060 a screen on Saturday, about $1 million overall, said Chuck
Viane, head of distribution for Disney. "Stuart Little's" three-day average was
$5,517 in 2,900 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney was unable to gather "Fantasia/2000" numbers Sunday from the other 29
Imax theaters, Viane said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's one of those films that's going to build and build," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie
ticket sales. "After the Imax run, it'll go to regular theaters. It's got a long
life ahead of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Opening in limited release for Oscar consideration was "The Hurricane,"
which grossed $295,000 in 11 theaters for a $26,818 average. Based on a true
story, the movie stars Denzel Washington as boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, who
spent decades fighting for release from prison on a trumped-up murder
conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures are to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Stuart Little," $16 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "The Green Mile," $13.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "Any Given Sunday," $13.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Toy Story 2," $12.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Galaxy Quest, $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Bicentennial Man," $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo," $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "Man on the Moon," $5.2 million.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. stock market opened without any reported Year 2000
technical troubles today, and quickly resumed the trading pattern that dominated
1999 -- technology stocks dramatically outperformed the broader market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 11.25 at 11,485.87.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 4.55 at 1,464.70.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nasdaq composite soared at the opening bell, rising more than 100
points initially before dropping back to a gain of 36.80 to 4,106.11. The Nasdaq
capped an extraordinary year on Friday by rising to a closing record that left
it with a gain of 85.6 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the technology-driven Nasdaq rose on the strength of Commerce One, up
8 1/2 to 205, and JDS Uniphase, up 6 11/16 at 168.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have struggled had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But after a weekend of
testing, many of the markets that opened for trading today were running
smoothly. Market indexes in Singapore and Hong Kong quickly rose to new records.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade also
opened electronic trading on Sunday evening without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
	   Several major stock markets remained closed today, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading, France's CAC-40 index was up 1.5 percent and Germany's
Xetra DAX was up 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The successful transition to Y2K hurt the bond market, which tumbled on the
fear that the Federal Reserve will resume raising interest rates at its next
meeting on Feb. 1. The Fed opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the
close of 1999, saying it wanted to ensure a stable monetary system into the new
year.
</P>
<P>
	   As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year bond soared to 6.57 percent,
up from 6.48 at the close of trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 139.93 million shares, well ahead of
Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.48 to 502.27.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal strong enough to return to office and is greeted warmly by  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor was strong enough to return to
his office today for the first time in several months, and was greeted warmly by
staff in the Archdiocese.
<P>
	   "It was good to see him here today," said O'Connor spokesman Joe Zwilling.
"All of the people in the building were glad to hear that he was back."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, who turns 80 on Jan. 15 and is recovering from brain surgery he
had in August, entered the Catholic Center on First Avenue around 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling said O'Connor planned to stay for a few hours to catch up on work.
It was not the first time he returned to the Catholic Center since his surgery
but it was the first time in recent months, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor has missed a handful of Masses recently because of weakness in his
legs due to radiation therapy. Doctors have told him to expect good days and bad
days as the affects of the radiation treatment wear off, Zwilling said. "That
does seem to be the case," he said, adding that he's had several good days
recently. "He really does seem to be much better," Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday he presided over his third consecutive Mass and stood briefly
during the service several times. He has been doing some work from the residence
behind St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hopeful that he'll be able to get back into a more normal work
routine," Zwilling said. "I know that's important to him."
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal has hinted that he does not expect to preside over New York's
archdiocese much longer but Zwilling said no announcement is imminent from the
cardinal. "He's leaving his retirement in the hands of Pope John Paul II,"
Zwilling said, "and will do whatever the pope wishes him to do."
</P>
<P>
	   A fundraising dinner in his honor to benefit various Catholic charities is
scheduled to take place on the night of his birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   Possible successors include Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis, who, like
O'Connor, is close to the pope; Edwin O'Brien, the Bronx-born archbishop to the
U.S. military; and Roberto Gonzalez, archbishop of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who
has East Harlem roots and would suit New York's increasingly Hispanic flock.

<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The business week started this morning with no signs
of major Y2K problems in New York state.
<P>
	   "There were no disruptions to critical services," said Gary Davis, the
state's Y2K project director.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Y2K bug that struck fear into the heart of business over recent
months, even years in some cases, isn't squashed yet. Davis said the state will
remain on heightened alert at least through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   State workers were checking 322 high-priority computer systems in agencies
like the state department of Criminal Justice, the Department of Mental Health
and the Department of Banking. And state emergency workers continued to monitor
power lines, hospitals and other vital services at the state's underground Y2K
command center in Albany
</P>
<P>
	   There have been few reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A small number of food stamp recipients had difficulties at grocery stores
when they tried to use their electronic benefits cards used for purchasing food.
The electronic prompt said that the cards had expired.
</P>
<P>
	   In another incident, call boxes along the side of the Adirondack Northway
are not working because of a systems glitch. Most of those call boxes are not
likely to be fixed because of the systems' advanced age.
</P>
<P>
	   That said, about half of the staff at the Y2K command center have been sent
home, according to officials who said the center is now down to about 75 people
per shift.
</P>
<P>
	   "Much of the work to be done over the next few days will be completed by
technicians monitoring systems in individual agencies and their counterparts in
the private sector," said Julie Leeper, a Y2K project coordinator for the state.
</P>
<P>
	   At 8 p.m. Saturday, officials closed down each of the 10 Y2K regional
command centers across the state, after all systems were determined to be
bug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Saturday, Gov. George Pataki proudly told emergency workers that New
York - after a tremendous amount of effort - updated its computer systems for
the 21st Century and passed the Y2K test with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were hoping for the most expensive non-event in history. That would be
good news," Pataki said. "And it was a non-event."
</P>
<P>
	   There were scattered power outages - including a temporary power loss to 966
customers Saturday in Eden in Erie County. But Gary Davis, state Y2K project
director, said those outages were ordinary occurrences unrelated to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   While state officials exulted in their initial success, others wondered if
maybe the Y2K wasn't quite the monster it was made out to be.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a lot of it was the media, it scares you more than anything," said
Chris Ericson, a North Carolina resident shopping in Albany's Colonie Center
Mall with her family. "I think they got people overly worried about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said the state will be on heightened alert for Y2K problems for a
while. He noted that this is a leap year, and Feb. 29 is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An early rally on Wall Street evaporated after a smooth
entry into the Year 2000 and a report of continued growth in the manufacturing
sector raised fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to hold
off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
153.58 at 11,343.54.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 23.37 at 1,445.88, and the Nasdaq composite was down 53.05 at 4,016.26,
having given up an early gain of 123 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied as trading began without a hitch in the first
session of 2000. But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the bond
market, which tumbled as investors bet that the Fed will return to a policy of
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times in 1999 in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure a stable monetary system into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's growth today, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to 6.58 percent, up from
6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting
an appealing alternative to volatile stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled. American Express lost 9 11/16 to 156 9/16,
dragging the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell 5 9/16 to 121 1/16.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Nine-term Rep. Herbert H. Bateman announced today
that he will not seek re-election because of worries about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Bateman, a 71-year-old Republican, has represented the 1st District in
eastern Virginia since 1983. His current term expires in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Bateman had surgery in November to remove plaque from his carotid artery. He
has undergone radiation treatment after having a cancerous growth removed from
his right lung in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressman said today that his health ``has to be my first priority
right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   As chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Readiness,
Bateman has been a supporter of Newport News Shipbuilding in the neighboring 3rd
District. Many of the shipyard's workers live in his district.
</P>
<P>
	   Bateman is the second Virginia congressman to drop out of the 2000
elections. On Thursday, Democratic Rep. Owen B. Pickett said he would not seek
an eighth term. He represents most of Norfolk and Virginia Beach.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- An early rally on Wall Street evaporated today after a
smooth entry into the Year 2000 and a report of continued growth in the
manufacturing sector raised fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates to hold off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
140.23 at 11,356.89.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 27.25 at 1,442.00, and the Nasdaq composite was down 36.05 at 4,035.26,
having given up an early gain of 123 points.
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for some scattered
profit-taking today.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital gains
taxes. The start of the new year means that investors who sell stocks now won't
pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied as trading began without a hitch in the first

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- While it's always exciting to see the work of a new
filmmaker, sometimes there's just no substitute for the experience of a long
career.
</P>
<P>
	   Bud Greenspan, who made his first sports documentary in 1952, traveled to
Muhammad Ali's training camp in 1978 to film him for a James Michener project
about black athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the twilight of his career, boxing's greatest showman paused after a
sparring session to speak about Jack Johnson, another controversial champion
from the early 1900s. It was vintage Ali, his eyes twinkling as he performed for
fans gathered around him.
</P>
<P>
	   "He married white women -- you know that Negro was bold," Ali said. "He was
bad. Back in 1909, man. Jack Johnson was the greatest. I know I'm bad, but he
was crazy."
</P>
<P>
	   When the Michener documentary was finished, though, Ali didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan never forgot the interview, and hung on to the footage. Twenty-one
years later, he found the perfect forum. Ali's comments are the glue between
eras, the key moment in Greenspan's latest film, "Kings of the Ring," which
premieres Monday on Showtime (10:05 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
	   The film is a breezy history lesson, but not just boxing history. Greenspan
traces the careers of four heavyweight champions -- Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe
Louis and Ali -- and shows how the men fit in with the tenor of the times.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, the first black champion, battled bigotry as hard as he faught in
the ring. Dempsey epitomized the Roaring '20s. Louis debunked Hitler's myths
about racial superiority and was a symbol of wartime sacrifice. Ali's refusal to
be drafted during the Vietnam War made him a polarizing force.
</P>
<P>
	   Showtime commissioned Greenspan to make a history of boxing, but he decided
to narrow it to the four heavyweight champions.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, 73, is best known for his series of Olympic documentaries. "Kings
of the Ring" fits comfortably into his niche: quality sports films that appeal
to more than just sports fans.
</P>
<P>
	   "People think I've been doing it since 1896," Greenspan said in an interview
in his Emmy-laden office at Cappy Productions, named after his late wife.
</P>
<P>
	   No, even Greenspan didn't experience all of the history in "Kings of the
Ring" firsthand. The film's segment on Johnson is fascinating for what it says
about race relations at the time. Novelist Jack London was one of Johnson's most
virulent enemies, leading the call for a "Great White Hope" to take the
championship back.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson's vicious beating of one white opponent, Tommy Byrnes, so angered
authorities that police stopped a cameraman from filming the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   The champion also lived large, opening a club, driving fast cars and
generally having a good time in a society that didn't flaunt such behavior.
Later, Dempsey -- a more acceptable, white champion -- became a glamorous star
and was said to be a model for movie star Clark Gable.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis' TKO of German Max Schmeling made him a national hero in the late
1930s. Like many athletes of the 1940s, some of his best years were in service
to his country, giving exhibitions to soldiers fighting in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The end of his career was a sad succession of comeback attempts made
necessary by Louis' debts to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
	   When Louis died and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Greenspan
implies it was the least the government could have done. "That is the way it
should be," the film states bluntly. "Joe Louis is an American worthy."
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt so badly for what had happened to him," Greenspan explained. "He
never complained. The American government was very unfair to him. He never
questioned it and he loved America."
</P>
<P>
	   Ali's story is more familiar. Greenspan fleshes it out with intriguing
footage from outside of the ring: the Rev. Martin Luther King supporting Ali's
stance against the draft, and Jackie Robinson opposing it.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a story of America, really," said Nancy Beffa, Greenspan's partner
and a non-boxing fan.
</P>
<P>
	   By implication, the documentary chronicles boxing's decline. No one on
today's boxing scene can be featured in the same way.
</P>
<P>
	   "Contemporary boxing over the last decade has been so illegal, immoral and
distasteful. ... Too many of the warts have been brought forward," Greenspan
said. "Even if it's legitimate, people question whether a fight has been fixed."

<HEADLINE> Democratic rivals push big themes in day of speeches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Beginning a January drive for votes in New
Hampshire and Iowa, Bill Bradley and Al Gore tried today to contrast the themes
of their competing campaigns. Bradley promised "a world of new possibilities"
while Gore countered that America needs "good decisions with good leadership."
<P>
	   Bradley, in New Hampshire, and the vice president, in Davenport, Iowa, both
emphasized education and health care as top priorities but - keeping their
gloves on, for now, and not directly criticizing each other - hinted at
differences in accomplishing their goals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need leadership that is prepared to take risks," Bradley said, laying
out for his audience at an interactive youth science center the five big issues
he would tackle: universal access to health insurance, child poverty, more new
teachers in public schools, tighter gun control and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny, but I say, in a
world of new possibilities guided by goodness, we can and we will," Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Bradley will offer a budget proposal to close tax loopholes and
eliminate tax shelters, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, in remarks prepared for his speech later today, tried to offer himself
as the tried-and-true national leader after seven years in the White House, and
one capable of addressing more than a few national problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough. All
of them are well within our reach if we believe in the idea of America, if we
trust one another, and if we make good decisions with good leadership," Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, where voters decide the nation's first primary on Feb. 1
and where anti-Washington sentiment traditionally is a strong selling point,
Bradley sought to turn Gore's White House tenure - and 16 years in Congress
before that - against him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Only those who have never left Washington have missed the lessons of the
last decade," Bradley, himself an 18-year Senate veteran, said to hearty
applause at Manchester's FIRST science center.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the post-holiday jump on Gore, with campaign stops Sunday in
Boston and Concord, N.H., while Gore enjoyed one last day with his family before
the month of virtually nonstop campaigning for Iowa's Jan. 24 delegate caucuses
and the New Hampshire primary - the first two nominating contests.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates meet Wednesday night in New Hampshire for their fourth
debate of the season, and again Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for endorsements was also being played out this week, with Gore -
the Democratic establishment's favorite - unveiling additional supporters among
local New Hampshire officials and Bradley holding a rally Wednesday morning to
trumpet the backing of several women activists. Today, Bradley added
Chicago-area Rep. Luis Gutierrez to the handful of congressional endorsements,
compared with the 100 or more members of Congress backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   While each candidate was jumping from the January starting gate on a
high-minded note - Bradley dubbed his remarks today a "Millennium Address" -
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane held out the prospect blunt politicking to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we move into January and the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa begin
focusing more and more on specific issues - issues they may talk about with
their families at the breakfast table and the dinner table - they will see
differences," the Gore spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we're going to be real clear about what those differences are - whether
it's supporting Medicare, making education a top national priority, keeping the
economy strong through fiscal discipline, or an approach to health care that
would be effective and would work compared to Senator Bradley's approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley adviser Anita Dunn promised return fire. "If circumstances warrant,
we're clearly respond," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign tried to blunt Gore's claim to fiscal prudence by
asserting in a news release today that the vice president's campaign promises
would overspend the $1-trillion projected budget surplus by as much as $350
billion. Bradley aides maintained that Gore underestimated costs of several
proposals, including teacher salary increases, and simply left others out of the
tally he said can be wholly paid for with surplus funds.
</P>
<P>
	   For months - and with some success, according to polls - Gore has painted
Bradley's agenda as too expensive to fit within a balanced budget.

<HEADLINE> Most Costly Tornado Was in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most expensive tornado in U.S. history struck last
year, though the total number of twisters was down from the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   In its year-end tornado roundup, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said there were six major tornado outbreaks during 1999, with
some of them hitting at unusual times of the year -- during the winter months of
January and December.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, there were 1,225 twisters reported in 1999, down from 1,424 a year
earlier, which was the record year for tornadoes in this country. The 1999 total
ranked fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   A 78-tornado outbreak over 21 hours on May 3-4 in Oklahoma and Kansas
included the most costly single tornado in U.S. history, NOAA reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said an F-5 tornado, the strongest on the Fujita Tornado Scale,
moved along a 38-mile path, from Chickasha through south Oklahoma City and the
suburbs of Bridge Creek, Newcastle, Moore, Midwest City and Del City. With 8,000
buildings damaged, the Oklahoma City tornado caused about a billion dollars in
damage. In all, that tornado outbreak killed 46 people, injured 800 and caused
$1.5 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service noted that there was an average warning lead
time of 18 minutes for the tornadoes -- better than the national 11-minute
average -- with some areas receiving more than 30 minutes notice before being
hit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oklahoma and Kansas outbreak contributed to May's monthly total of 325,
the highest for the year. June followed with a total of 275 tornadoes and
January had the third highest total with 216. That topped the previous January
record of 50 set in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The number of tornadoes the U.S. experienced in January is extraordinary
when compared with the 50-year monthly average of 20 tornadoes,'' said Dan
McCarthy, warning coordination meteorologist of the Weather Service's Storm
Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tornadoes occurred because of an unusually warm January weather
pattern that brought moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at low levels in the
atmosphere northward, which combined with strong upper level westerly flow. This
tornado-producing combination is common in March or April, but not in January,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 tornado season began early, with 26 twisters on Jan. 1 and 2 in
Texas and Louisiana that caused one death. On Jan. 17, 25 tornadoes killed eight
people in Arkansas, Tennessee and Missouri. Four days later, six people died as
104 tornadoes struck Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee on Jan. 21 and 22,
including the area around the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   The final tornado outbreaks of the year occurred once again in the cool
season. A total of six twisters killed two people in Chico, Texas, on Dec. 2,
and an F3 tornado moved through Bentonia, Miss., on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Other tornadoes and outbreaks of last year included:
</P>
<P>
	   --April 9: The northeast suburbs of the Cincinnati area were hit by an F4
tornado at 5:30 a.m., part of an outbreak of 70 twisters that began the evening
before and tracked across the plains from Nebraska through Iowa, Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   --July 24: Three people were killed when a tornado caused a tree to fall on
a car in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   --Aug. 11: A rare tornado in downtown Salt Lake City killed one person.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sept. 4 and 16: Tropical Storms Dennis and Floyd caused small tornado
outbreaks when they moved over parts of Virginia and North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Bush forces file petitions to get on New York primary ballot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush began filing
petitions Monday to secure him a spot on New York's March 7 presidential primary
ballot.
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of Sen. John McCain's New York effort said the Arizona
Republican would probably qualify presidential delegate slates through the
petition process in a majority, but not all of the state's 31 congressional
districts. McCain is simultaneously pursuing a federal lawsuit aimed at getting
his prospective convention delegates on the ballot throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, the only other Republican
presidential contender contesting New York, met for more than an hour in New
York City with leaders of the state's tiny but politically influential
Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, backed by about $750,000 for petition gathering in New York, is
expected to be on the New York GOP primary ballot all across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley said Monday
that their petitions would be filed later this week to secure spots on the March
7 Democratic presidential primary ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said the Bush
camp filed 19 volumes worth of signatures Monday aimed at securing a New York
ballot spot for the Texas governor and GOP front-runner. Bush has the backing in
New York of Gov. George Pataki and most of the rest of the state's top
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to state GOP Chairman William Powers, a Bush backer, said the initial
Bush filing contained more than 75,000 signatures and that more would be filed
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's ballot access rules are notoriously demanding, especially for
candidates without the backing of party bosses. In 1996, with the state GOP
behind Bob Dole, Forbes had to spend $1 million and get help from the federal
courts to get on the ballot all across the state. In the end, Dole ended up
winning all the convention delegates at stake in the New York primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In effect, New York has 31 separate GOP presidential primaries, one in each
of the state's congressional districts. Candidates must collect the signatures
of 1,000 party members or 0.5 percent of enrolled party members in each district
where they want to field delegate slates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll get on in the majority of the districts ... I wouldn't be surprised
if we hit 20" of the 31, said Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head
of McCain's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said the McCain forces would also press ahead with their federal
court lawsuit seeking to further open the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much unfairness in the system," said Molinari, a former
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   The ballot access rules were eased somewhat by Pataki and the state
Legislature in the wake of the 1996 election which drew heavy criticism of the
governor. Nonetheless, candidates must still collect thousands of signatures
statewide in about six weeks as part of what The New York Times called "a
corrupt system that is a national embarrassment" in a Monday editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday was the first day that candidates could legally file their petitions
for ballot spots. The last day for filing the petitions is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Bush camp was touting its ballot petition prowess and the McCain
forces were grumbling, Forbes met at a Manhattan hotel with leaders of the state
Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's clearly not backing out of the race," state Conservative party
Chairman Michael Long said after the meeting. "It was a good session."
</P>
<P>
	   Long and top party leaders have also met with Bush and expect to meet with
McCain. The Conservative Party won't select its presidential candidate until
September. Unlike most other states, major party candidates in New York can run
with third-party backing. The votes on each ballot line are then combined.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Gives $17M to Candidates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For now, presidential candidates are receiving just under
half the federal matching funds they are entitled to, the government said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates will eventually get the full amounts, but not until after
April 15. So few taxpayers have checked the box diverting $3 to the presidential
campaign fund that there is not enough money in the fund now to give the
candidates all of their money.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven current candidates and one former candidate will get $16.9 million of
the $34 million they are entitled to. The federal government matches the first
$250 of each individual contribution to candidates agreeing to limit their
campaign spending for the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans Steve Forbes and George W. Bush are not accepting federal funds
and do not have to limit their spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore will receive almost $5.5 million, while Democratic
opponent Bill Bradley will get $4.1 million and Lyndon LaRouche will get
$364,468.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, John McCain will get almost $2.1 million, while Gary
Bauer will receive nearly $2 million and Alan Keyes will get $616,630. Dan
Quayle, who withdrew from the race last year, will get $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan, who left the GOP after qualifying
for matching funds, will get almost $1.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Set To Go Long  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Bell Atlantic will announce its new long distance
service Tuesday, marking its entrance into the lucrative New York long distance
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month the Federal Communications Commission approved Bell Atlantic's
bid to offer long distance service in New York state, making it the first
regional Bell company to offer this service inside its local region.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the FCC ruling, New York consumers can begin using Bell Atlantic's
long distance services beginning Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic officials have scheduled a news conference in New York City
Tuesday to announce its long distance services, Mark Marchand, Bell Atlantic's
director of media relations, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials refused to comment on a Wall Street Journal story that said the
company plans to offer 10 cents-a-minute long distance service, available
anytime. The Journal cited sources familiar with Bell Atlantic's plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rival long distance providers have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the
FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties involved in the suit are expected to file comments with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit early this week. Under the
1996 Telecommunications Act, a Bell company must show that it has opened up its
local monopoly to give rivals a chance to compete before it can offer
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic expects to win over 25 percent to 30 percent of the $8 billion
market within the next five years, according to Bell Atlantic president and
chief operating officer James Cullen.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Raw Materials Rising  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. manufacturers say the cost of raw materials is rising
as the nation's economy closes in on a record for the longest expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewed inflation jitters rattled financial markets, with stocks
tumbling from record highs and bond yields rising to the highest level in more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's report from the National Association of Purchasing Management
heightened the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in
the weeks ahead to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report is closely watched because it is the first
national reading for December on U.S. industrial performance, a key sector in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said its index, based on a national survey of executives who buy
raw materials and other supplies for industry, registered 55.5 percent in
December, down from 56.2 percent in November and below analysts' expectations.
Readings over 50 indicate expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 11th consecutive month of growth, though at a slightly lower rate
than in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "These numbers are very healthy, indicating manufacturing is still
expanding," said Bryan Jordan, an economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that there was "dramatic improvement" in the industrial economy in
1999. "The manufacturing sector recovered as the global economy recovered," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   That puts the U.S. economy in line to set a record. The longest economic
expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106 months, from February 1961 until
December 1969. The current expansion, which began in March 1991, will match the
record if it continues through this month and pass it if it lasts until
February.
</P>
<P>
	   But concerns about inflation, sparked by the report's reading of raw
materials prices, unsettled financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on 30-year government bonds, a barometer for such long-term borrowing
costs as mortgages, shot up Monday to the highest level since September 1997,
approaching 6.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock markets fell. The Dow Jones industrial average, which ended 1999
at an all-time high, was down 137.13 points at 11,359.99 in midafternoon
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest report, 18 of 20 industries reported higher prices for raw
materials. Some 35 percent of the purchasing managers who were surveyed said
prices had risen, while just 6 percent said they were lower. The rest said they
were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The price index rose to 65.7 percent in December from 65.3 percent the month
before. It was the eighth consecutive month with a reading above 50 and the
fourth in a row above 60.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it means is that we still have a lot of inflation concerns," said Gary
R. Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. He noted
that other gauges indicate that most of the price increases are for oil and
related products and added that there's fear these will spread to other
products.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we can't rule out action by the Federal Reserve in February," Thayer
said. "The markets already are assuming they will raise rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Fed policy-makers raised rates three times in 1999 to try to keep the
economy from overheating and igniting inflation. The Fed left rates unchanged
last month because it did not want to upset the economy immediately before the
year 2000 date change. With the economy still roaring ahead with no apparent
disruptions caused by Y2K computer problems, an increasing number of analysts
expect further rates increases this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's next meeting is a two-day session beginning Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 146; Nasdaq Up 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An early rally on Wall Street evaporated today after a
smooth entry into the Year 2000 and a report of continued growth in the
manufacturing sector raised fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates to hold off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 146.75 at 11,350.37.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 22.30 at 1,446.95, and the Nasdaq composite was up 9.43 at 4,078.74. The
Nasdaq was especially volatile, having soared nearly 123 points at the start of
trading and dipped as much as 79 points.
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for some scattered
profit-taking today.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital gains
taxes. The start of the new year means that investors who sell stocks now won't
pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied as trading began without a hitch in the first
session of 2000. But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the bond
market, which tumbled as investors bet that the Fed will return to a policy of
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times in 1999 in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure a stable monetary system into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's growth today, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to 6.58 percent, up from
6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting
an appealing alternative to volatile stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled. American Express lost 8 5/8 to 157 5/8,
dragging the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell 4 9/16 to 122 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks again performed better than the broader market. CMGI,
which invests in young Internet companies, rose 36 1/8 to 313, and JDS Uniphase
rose 16 3/4 to 178 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have fared worse had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But after a weekend of
testing, many of the markets that opened for trading today were running
smoothly. Market indexes in Singapore and Hong Kong quickly rose to new records.
</P>
<P>
	   Several major stock markets remained closed today, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France's CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent and Germany's Xetra DAX tumbled 3.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 644.23 million shares, well ahead of
Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 10.71 to 494.04.

	   The task force proposes a new juvenile detention center for girls, to be
built "as soon as possible." It also suggests allowing the state Department of
Children and Families to overrule local zoning boards when developing facilities
for fewer than 50 juveniles.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents frequently pressure zoning boards to reject requests for group
homes and other, smaller residential facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   DCF Commissioner Kristine Ragaglia said Sunday she was familiar with many of
the recommendations and said she hopes they are supported by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we've been creeping along over the last year, this will help catapult
us forward," Ragaglia said, referring to changes her department has made in the
year and a half since the suicide of a 15-year-old girl at Long Lane School, the
state's juvenile correctional facility.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, lawmakers approved funding for a new, $53 million,
maximum-security juvenile correctional facility in Middletown. The Connecticut
Juvenile Training School is now under construction.
</P>
<P>
	   But the General Assembly's vote received criticism because the plan calls
for the housing of both boys and girls at the new facility. Many advocates and
lawmakers point to national research which shows that female juvenile offenders
do better in small, female-only facilities that cater to their specific
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Although lawmakers rejected a plan to create smaller regional facilities,
they did agree to create a "critical response team" to study the issue, in
conjunction with the state Office of Policy and Management.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a study by OPM, the estimated cost to construct three regional
facilities with a total of 150 beds is approximately $33 million, with annual
operating costs of $19 million. Potential sites have been identified in
Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven and Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
	   Ragaglia said the other recommendations in the report echo the findings of
an earlier committee that studied the problems last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Both that committee and the critical response team found that DCF should
switch from a punitive approach to one in which juveniles earn privileges and
are treated in a "positive reinforcement culture," Ragaglia said.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force also has recommended that DCF provide programs and services
specifically designed to meet the needs of juvenile offenders. Each child would
also have an individual rehabilitation plan, and access to appropriate mental
health and substance abuse treatment.

<HEADLINE> Consumers upset by reinstitution of Fleet-BankBoston ATM fees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Fleet Bank and BankBoston began imposing a fee on
non-customers who use their more than 500 Connecticut ATMs Monday, a move that
was criticized even by some Fleet customers.
<P>
	   The decision follows a state Supreme Court ruling last month that the state
did not have the power to block the fees. The $1 fee applies to patrons who use
the ATMs but do not have an account with Fleet or BankBoston, who recently
merged.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee - the so-called ATM surcharge - comes on top of a fee that other
banks may charge when their customers use another bank's ATM. The surcharge is
levied at the time of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
	   "It stinks," said Fleet customer Mirna Nevas, the owner of a small language
school in Burlington. "They're gouging people. You shouldn't be charged to
access your money."
</P>
<P>
	   Judy Santasiere of Simsbury, also a Fleet customer, was interviewed at a
downtown Hartford bank Monday. She said she thought the decision to resume
imposing the surcharge was "too bad, because the ATM is a convenience for the
bank as well as the customer."
</P>
<P>
	   "It definitely stinks," agreed John Gallacher, a Fleet customer from West
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   With 518 machines, the merged banks now have about 29 percent of the ATMs in
Connecticut. That will fall to about 24 percent once Fleet-BankBoston divests
about 85 ATMs later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union National Bank added the surcharge to its
roughly 100 Connecticut machines last month. The two largest Connecticut-based
banks - People's and Webster - said they are still trying to determine whether
they will impose the surcharge. Another bank, Providence-based Citizens Bank,
also said it has not decided.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Schepker, a Fleet spokesman in Hartford, said signs will be posted on
ATMs warning of the surcharge, and machines have been programmed to let users
cancel transactions to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankers who support the surcharge say it is reasonable to charge
non-customers for convenient access to cash. Non-customers tend to be frequent
users who withdraw small amounts of cash, and as a result increase
machine-maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumer advocates say the surcharge is an unfair practice which
generated more than $2 billion in nationwide revenue for banks last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the fee consumers pay to their own bank when they use another bank's
ATM already goes back to the bank that owns the machine. But that portion, some
banks argue, is not enough to help run expansive ATM networks owned by the
bigger banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleet has said it has lost up to $15,000 a day in revenue in Connecticut for
each day it has not imposed the non-customer fee. Over three years, the total
would have amounted to up to $15.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Democrats take control of Nassau legislature for first time ever  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Nassau County Democrats, who for decades fought
fruitlessly against one of the most powerful Republican machines in the nation,
took control of the county legislature on Monday, vowing a bipartisan effort to
solve the fiscal crisis that swept them to power.
<P>
	   Nearly 1,000 people, including the state's top Democratic elected officials
- U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Comptroller H.
Carl McCall - attended the swearing-in ceremony for the 19-member county
legislature, held at Nassau Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of a series of demonstrations of unity, Republican County Executive
Thomas Gulotta summoned Democrat Judy Jacobs - the new presiding officer - and
Peter Schmitt - the Republican minority leader - to the podium. The three joined
hands and embraced to rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
	   During her induction address, Jacobs acknowledged that voters sent a message
demanding changes. Because of a county budget deficit that McCall thinks could
rise as high as $190 million this year, Wall Street has reduced Nassau's bond
rating to just above junk level.
</P>
<P>
	   Gulotta and the legislature have already been tackling ways to cut spending,
but all agree that much work lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be going through an intensive examination of all spending areas,"
Jacobs said. "It took the county years and years of fiscally irresponsible
activity to find ourselves in the deep hole ... and it will require
multi-faceted and multi-year strategic planning to bring us back to fiscal
sanity."
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Democrats will have only a slim 10-9 advantage, the call for
bipartisan cooperation was a theme for most speakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Please don't do what has been done in Washington for the last decade,"
Schumer warned. "Where partisanship seems to rule and very little gets done."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-Seaford, a former county comptroller, agreed that
cooperation among legislators was important, but he couldn't help noting that
many in the audience were there to celebrate the Democrats' unlikely victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank Peter Schmitt for the opportunity to speak at this
Democratic Convention," he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, Democrats have never held power in either the county legislature,
which was created in 1996, or its predecessor, the county board of supervisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Hope, the state Democratic Party chairwoman, said the upset in Nassau
County could help Hillary Rodham Clinton in her anticipated race against New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It simply shows that suburban voters will vote Democratic under the right
circumstances," said Hope. "I think the suburbs are critical to both the
presidential election and the Senate race."

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins for second Louima trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of potential jurors showed up at Brooklyn
federal court Monday for the second trial stemming from the 1997 police assault
on a handcuffed prisoner in a station bathroom.
<P>
	   Jury selecton in the high-profile brutality case could take a month. Opening
statements are tentatively set for Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil right activists say the trial will further expose the so-called "blue
wall of silence" - the unwritten code among officers not to "rat" on each other.
Defense attorneys, meanwhile, hope to prove that Officer Charles Schwarz was
wrongly convicted in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that flamed tensions between police and minorities, Schwarz was
convicted last year of holding down Abner Louima on the 70th Precinct bathroom
floor while another white officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized the Haitian immigrant
with a broken broomstick. Volpe pleaded guilty, and has since claimed that the
other officer in the bathroom that night was Officer Thomas Wiese, not Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 35, Wiese, 37, and Officer Thomas Bruder, 34, now stand accused of
obstructing justice by concocting a story to clear Schwarz. If convicted, they
each face a maximum five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining other activists outside the courthouse Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton
told reporters, "What Justin Volpe did could not have been done without an
active cover-up in the 70th Precinct. ... So to us, this is just as important as
the first trial."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's wife, Andra, said she expects the new trial to vindicate her
husband, who has been in federal custody since his conviction in June. "We hope
the truth is going to come out," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 600 people were to fill out lengthy jury questionnaires Monday, the
first phase of a selection process designed to screen out candidates tainted by
pretrial publicity. U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson plans to begin
questioning finalists in his courtroom on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison. The former patrolman
had admitted ramming the stick up Louima's rectum in a blind rage, thinking -
mistakenly - that his prisoner had sucker-punched him outside a Brooklyn
nightclub. Prosecutors said Louima's cousin actually punched the officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Volpe and Louima are expected to testify at the second trial.

<HEADLINE> Woonsocket sex club house to be sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WOONSOCKET, R.I. (AP) - A former Connecticut school board member who
resigned after her involvement with a private sex club became public knowledge
has decided to sell the home where the club was based.
<P>
	   Leslie Moore-Linfield and her husband John Linfield decided to sell after
the city last month threatened to close their business permanently, real estate
broker Steve Gillikin told The Providence Journal. Officials earlier shut down
the club in a zoning dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they wanted to, they could stay, but the city would have made their
lives a living hell," Gillikin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woonsocket officials learned of the business last month when the Norwich
(Conn.) Bulletin reported that Moore-Linfield was the administrative and billing
contact for the club's Web page.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore-Linfield, a 33-year-old attorney and mother of two, had served on the
school board since 1997. She resigned from the board Dec. 1 after acknowledging
to Woonsocket officials that she ran the club.
</P>
<P>
	   An Internet site described the club as a Queen Anne-style home offering
group sex, fetish nights and other intimate activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The club also offers social areas where no intimate activity takes place.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut and Rhode Island have no laws governing private clubs when
consensual sex is involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Members do not pay for sex, but pay annual dues of $75 and fees of $25 to
$100 for special events.
</P>
<P>
	   The property's controversial history may help attract buyers, Gillikin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any publicity is good publicity," said Gillikin, an agent for Re/Max New
Horizons.

   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Elca Frye cooked for a crowd Monday as regulars
at Betty's Restaurant were joined by some of those on hand for the peace talks
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Serving up breakfast, Frye said she went through 10 dozen eggs, twice the
normal amount. She was unflappable after 40 years behind the smoky diner's
counter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just my natural self,'' she said. ``If the president would come in,
I'd treat him just like I'd treat you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her extra customers were mostly journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Food planning was a challenge for Erwin Asam, co-owner of the Clarion Hotel
and Conference Center, the semi-secluded site chosen to host the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Asam said kosher fare for the Israeli delegation and Syrian foods were being
brought in by caterers from the Washington area, 70 miles away. He sent some
chefs from his other establishment, the Bavarian Inn and Lodge, to the Clarion
to help with food preparation.
</P>
<P>
	   In town at the Old Pharmacy Cafe, co-owner Margaret Shifflet said she would
feature hummus and pita bread, a regular menu selection with a Middle Eastern
flavor.

	   About 70 townspeople gathered on Robert Keller's front lawn to watch
President Clinton's arrival by helicopter at the Shepherd College baseball field
across the road.

<P>
	   ``Everybody just kind of showed up,'' Keller said. ``It's OK. We're a

</P>
<P>
	   Social studies teacher Joy Lewis brought 2-year-old daughter Macaline and
3-year-old son Chandler to see Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton today launched a fresh round
of negotiations between Israel and Syria, seizing on a ``historic opportunity''
to reach a land-for-peace deal and end 50 years of enmity between the two
Mideast countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading into the talks, Syria was said to have ``open minds and a truthful
desire'' for peace. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he felt the ``burden
of responsibility'' to reach an agreement this year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, Clinton held a
separate meeting with Barak and planned a similar one with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, before a three-way session later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-way talks were being held at the semi-secluded Clarion Hotel and
Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown, 70 miles northwest of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But first, Clinton opened the discussions by escorting Barak and al-Sharaa
across a small wood-and-metal bridge connecting two buildings at the nearby
National Conservation Training Center, run by the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service.
They were deep in conversation as they strolled and, at one point, the president
gestured toward nearby trees and al-Sharaa nodded. The three refused to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president understands we have an historic opportunity here,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The president believes we can act as a
facilitator, as an honest broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   After today's sessions, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day to day.
At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa were expected to focus on four key issues during the
talks: security, the normalization of relations, water rights and how much of
the strategic Golan Heights that Israel would return to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, about 50 protesters, mostly university students, staged a
sit-in at the offices of the International Committee for the Red Cross,
denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian prisoners in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will be closeted with the
Israelis and Syrians throughout the negotiations, cautioned Sunday that there is
``no done deal'' yet between the two sides, who have fought three wars since
Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all understand how fateful the decisions are,'' Albright said in an
interview with The Associated Press in Washington. ``We are at the beginning of
a process here, not at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said there may have to be additional rounds of negotiations to
achieve a final settlement, knocking down any notion that all that remains is to
dispose of some details.
</P>
<P>
	   But she added that Barak and al-Sharaa, as well as Syrian President Hafez
Assad, were ``dedicated to making this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he left for Washington, Barak said Sunday he felt the ``burden of
responsibility'' to achieve an agreement within the year. ``We don't need to
wait for another millennium, another century or even another 10 years to find a
way to make peace with our neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel's Army radio during the
flight to Washington that there were signs that Syria would agree to Israel's
demands for trust-building measures.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said Israel would ask Assad to join the talks to prove
he was serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips abroad are even
rarer. Al-Sharaa is a close, trusted aide and has represented Syria in previous
negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian news media, which reflect government thinking, said Damascus pins
great hopes on the upcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Thawra newspaper said Syria heads into the talks with ``open minds and a
truthful desire to bring about a just and comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. The talks were revived in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border enclave that Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies. Security is
a prime issue for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Israeli and Syrian track, Clinton is pressing for a
resumption of talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to implement the Wye
River peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, residents of Shepherdstown prepared for the talks and the influx
of some 1,000 people -- mainly State Department staff and journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 people -- Christians, Muslims and Jews -- gathered for prayers
Saturday at Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church to bless the talks. The church
will open its doors every day at noon during the negotiations for special
prayers.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Tax Cut Falls Short  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting the stage for an election-year fight, Republicans
said Monday that President Clinton's tax relief proposals are far too modest
given the size of projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government today takes more from working Americans than it needs, and
that's not fair,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   But GOP leaders supported the administration's proposed tax credits aimed at
helping an estimated 44 million Americans gain health insurance coverage. That
issue also is at the forefront of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tax credits for the uninsured have broad bipartisan support,'' Armey said
in a statement. ``Now that the president is on board, there's no reason we can't
get this done this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although details remained in flux, White House officials said Clinton would
outline a tax relief package as part of the fiscal 2001 budget plan that closely
tracks the targeted, middle-class proposals he advocated last year.
</P>
<P>
	   It will include, the aides said, a revised version of 1999's tax credits for
people to invest for retirement savings accounts, which would supplement Social
Security and perhaps stave off insolvency in that program.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House last year advocated using budget surpluses to provide $300
tax credits for its Universal Savings Accounts, a proposal estimated to cost
some $250 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The new administration plan also is expected to include unspecified tax
credits for people who purchase health insurance policies and would likely
resurrect some combination of proposals to help middle class people with such
needs as elderly care and childcare in the home.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling said this year's plan ``will go even
further in ensuring we have a tax code that rewards work and family for the
hardest-pressed parents.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he would not say if the package would be offset with projected budget
surpluses or paid for with increases in other taxes, as was the case with last
year's failed administration proposals. Clinton successfully argued last year
that Social Security and Medicare must come before tax cuts in using the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet tax increases of any kind have virtually no chance of passing the
GOP-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be reckless and irresponsible to increase federal taxes to fund
additional government spending,'' Armey and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said in a recent letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are expected to push again this year for much larger and broader
tax cuts using the $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus, reprising parts of
the 10-year, $792 billion tax cut Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, already has said the GOP will
revisit the so-called marriage penalty, which imposes higher income taxes on
millions of two-income couples compared with similar people who are single.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP presidential front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has outlined a
five-year, $483 billion tax package that would cut income tax rates, abolish
estate taxes and double the $500 per-child tax credit, among many other breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   As they struggle to keep their narrow margin in the House, it behooves
Republicans to rally around tax cuts as a paramount campaign issue if Bush
secures the nomination, said Clint Stretch of the DeLoitte &AMP; Touche accounting
firm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are almost bound to do what he wants to do,'' Stretch said. ``They've
got to get on board and support Bush the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although a tax-relief agreement between Republicans and the White House
faces long odds, health insurance is one potential area of compromise.
Presidential candidates from both parties have made the issue a centerpiece of
their campaigns, and polls indicate that people believe it is a pressing
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Armey, in fact, praised Clinton for highlighting the uninsured and urged
support for his legislation that would provide a $3,000 tax credit for a family
purchasing health policies outside the workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We face this persistent crisis of the uninsured, because the tax code
isn't fair,'' Armey said. ``It discriminates against people who don't get their
insurance at work.''

<HEADLINE> Back-to-work no problem as computer bug fails to bite  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Computers in businesses and government agencies
rolled over seamlessly into the new millennium over the weekend, and virtually
no nasty surprises awaited workers returning Monday morning.
<P>
	   The start of the work week had been seen as the last real Y2K question mark
as many wondered whether glitches caused by the change from 1999 to 2000 would
surface when employees tried to use their computers for the first time this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   But by mid-afternoon, no significant problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sky hasn't fallen, the streets haven't blown up, and the markets are
all working, so I guess today is a good day," said Chris Biddle, a spokesman for
the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. "We made it through clean as a
whistle."
</P>
<P>
	   The association, which represents many small businesses, had not heard of
any problems from its 16,000 members, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer consultant John Meyer, owner of Mount Laurel-based Technology
Business Solutions, said six months of preparing his 60 corporate clients for
Y2K paid off Monday. Only one computer - an older model - showed the date as
Jan. 3, 1980 and had to be rolled over manually, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew they were all going to work," said Meyer, who estimates that his
clients spent about $400,000 upgrading 700 computers for the millennium. "I had
tested them all. We checked and we rechecked. There's been no glitches
whatsoever. It was all a farce."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer received no Y2K calls over the weekend, and said Monday was a normal
business day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you can breathe a sigh of relief. The majority of the worries are
over," said Meyer. "People should let it go. Come out of your bunker; go back to
work. Stop using it as an excuse."
</P>
<P>
	   Y2K fears stemmed from the possibility of some computers misreading the new
date as 1900 instead of 2000 and malfunctioning as a result. But systems
governing electricity, water, natural gas, air traffic control and other
functions performed nearly flawlessly during the rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am pleased but not surprised that the electric systems are functioning
normally," said Michehl R. Gent, president of the Princeton-based North American
Electric Reliability Council. "The electric industry worked very diligently for
the past few years so that Y2K would be a non-event."
</P>
<P>
	   With evidence mounting by the hour that computers had survived Y2K, the
State Police shut down their emergency command center in Ewing Township two days
early. Spokesman John Hagerty said there was simply nothing left to check.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to keep it open till the end of the afternoon, and then shut it
down," he said. "From an emergency response standpoint, our role is over. We're
through it."
</P>
<P>
	   State government computers also worked fine Monday, said Wendy Rayner, the
state's chief of computer operations. The only remaining concern will come next
month when February has an extra day due to leap year, but Rayner said she's
confident it won't cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Local government also reported no problems Monday, said William Dressel,
executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlantic City, casinos that had spent millions to make their
reservations, player-tracking and management computer systems Y2K compliant
found that the work had paid off. No Y2K glitches were reported - either on New
Year's Eve or on Monday, the first day of office operations.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's court system also made it through the changeover without
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers appeared to be keeping most of the batteries and bottled water
they bought in the days leading up to New Year's Eve, even though such
stockpiling proved unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one's bringing anything back," said Jeff Davis, manager of the Thriftway
supermarket in Washington Township, Mercer County. "Our customers are reasonable
people."
</P>
<P>
	   For the third day of the new year, AT&AMP;T encountered no Y2K glitches or phone
congestion. But spokesman Dave Johnson wasn't ready to declare victory just yet.
AT&AMP;T wants to make sure its billing records go through a full monthly cycle
without glitches on the dates or bill amounts first, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman at Broad National Bank in Newark, Paula Matos, said the bank's
computers were working well. Teodoro Camacho, 51, of Newark, inserted a bank
card into an automatic teller machine to get out $300. He got $100 and thought
there might be a glitch, but later discovered he had just pressed the wrong
button on the machine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything's working fine," he said.

<HEADLINE> India Deems Pakistan Terrorists  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURINDA KEYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Monday urged
the United States and other world powers to declare Pakistan a terrorist state,
saying India had enough evidence to show its neighbor and nuclear rival was
involved in an eight-day hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   Vajpayee said the United States, which historically has had a closer
relationship with Pakistan than India, should take the initiative in isolating
Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country under military rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan's active and sustained role in fomenting terrorism in India is
now too obvious to be overlooked by the international community,'' said
Vajpayee. ``India, therefore, strongly urges major nations of the world to
declare Pakistan a terrorist state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Worsening the rivalry on Monday was a particularly heavy day of shelling in
the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir and a land mine attack that led to
an unusually high death toll.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Indian-controlled side, a land mine exploded in a vegetable market
outside the city of Srinagar, killing 17 people and injuring 31. No one claimed
responsibility, but Muslim separatists often carry out attacks in the region. In
Pakistani-held Kashmir, five civilians were killed from repeated Indian
shelling, Pakistani officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asian rivals regularly trade fire across Kashmir. Shelling goes on
almost every day and militants frequently carry out bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Vajpayee's comments were the latest in a series of strong statements by
Indian leaders alleging Pakistani involvement in the hijacking of Indian
Airlines Flight 814 on a Dec. 24 flight from Nepal to New Delhi. However,
neither Vajpayee nor the other officials have provided evidence to back up their
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Nations that declare Pakistan a terrorist state could impose a range of
sanctions against Islamabad, including a ban on travel, restrictions on military
sales and withdrawal of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar on Monday dismissed the Indian
allegations as ``trumped-up charges'' and said India had an ``abhorrent record
of state terrorism,'' a reference to its military campaign against Muslim
militants in Indian-held Kashmir who are fighting for outright independence or
union with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of the Kashmiri militants, but their
names and nationalities are not known, and they wore masks throughout the
hijacking. Their whereabouts remained a mystery Monday, as did the location of
the three men India released from jail in exchange for 155 hostages held aboard
the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the three prisoners, Masood Azhar, made a telephone call Friday from
Kandahar, Afghanistan, to his family in Pakistan, according to a family member
who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar, who called his family in Bawahalpur in the eastern Pakistan, was
freed along with Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheikh, a Pakistani-born British citizen, and
Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, an Indian from Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men were imprisoned in India for involvement in the bitter and
bloody insurgency in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been several reports, many of them contradictory, about the
whereabouts of the hijackers and the freed prisoners. Afghanistan's Taliban
leaders gave the hijackers 10 hours to leave the country on Friday, the day the
hijacking ended, and Pakistan was considered the most likely destination.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan denies India's charges that it funds, trains and supplies the
militants. On Monday, Pakistan again said it had no knowledge of the hijackers
entering its territory, and challenged India to hand over any evidence it had.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who suggest Pakistan should arrest the hijackers make the naive
assumption that the hijackers have entered Pakistan,'' the Foreign Ministry said
in a statement. ``To the best of our information, such an assumption is
unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India both lay claim to all of Kashmir and have fought two wars
over Kashmir since their independence from Britain in 1947. The two countries,
which exploded underground nuclear devices last year, came close to another war
this summer over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with grenades, pistols and knives, the hijackers seized Flight 814
some 40 minutes after it took off. During the longest airplane hijacking in a
decade, the jet made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates
before landing in Afghanistan on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members when it took off
from Nepal. Twenty-seven hostages and the body of the slain man were unloaded in
the Emirates. An additional passenger, a diabetic, was released later.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarmed by the hijacking, the government is planning to have armed commandos
on its flights, Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton today launched a fresh round
of negotiations between Israel and Syria, seizing on a ``historic opportunity''
to reach a land-for-peace deal and end 50 years of enmity between the two
Mideast countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Before sitting down first with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the president strolled with them
across a bridge that spanned a dry creek, pointing out some of the sights and
exchanging inaudible pleasantries.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin tried, meanwhile, to dash
expectations of a deal, or even a declaration of principles, emerging this week.
``We do not expect to achieve a core agreement in one round of talks,'' the U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington did
not go deeply into the key issues, which include how much land Israel will yield
for peace and the terms Syria will offer in exchange. ``In these negotiations,
the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading into the talks, Syria was said to have ``open minds and a truthful
desire'' for peace. Barak said he felt the ``burden of responsibility'' to reach
an agreement this year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, Clinton held separate
meetings with Barak and al-Sharaa, before a three-way session later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-way talks were being held at the semi-secluded Clarion Hotel and
Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown, 70 miles northwest of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president understands we have an historic opportunity here,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The president believes we can act as a
facilitator, as an honest broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   After today's sessions, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day to day.
At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa were expected to focus on four key issues during the
talks: security, the normalization of relations, water rights and how much of
the strategic Golan Heights that Israel would return to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   In Damascus, about 50 protesters, mostly university students, staged a
sit-in at the offices of the International Committee for the Red Cross,
denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian prisoners in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will be closeted with the
Israelis and Syrians throughout the negotiations, cautioned Sunday that there is
``no done deal'' yet between the two sides, who have fought three wars since
Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all understand how fateful the decisions are,'' Albright said in an
interview with The Associated Press in Washington. ``We are at the beginning of
a process here, not at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said there may have to be additional rounds of negotiations to
achieve a final settlement, knocking down any notion that all that remains is to
dispose of some details.
</P>
<P>
	   But she added that Barak and al-Sharaa, as well as Syrian President Hafez
Assad, were ``dedicated to making this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he left for Washington, Barak said Sunday he felt the ``burden of
responsibility'' to achieve an agreement within the year. ``We don't need to
wait for another millennium, another century or even another 10 years to find a
way to make peace with our neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel's Army radio during the
flight to Washington that there were signs that Syria would agree to Israel's
demands for trust-building measures.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said Israel would ask Assad to join the talks to prove
he was serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips abroad are even
rarer. Al-Sharaa is a close, trusted aide and has represented Syria in previous
negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian news media, which reflect government thinking, said Damascus pins
great hopes on the upcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Thawra newspaper said Syria heads into the talks with ``open minds and a
truthful desire to bring about a just and comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. The talks were revived in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border enclave that Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies. Security is
a prime issue for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Israeli and Syrian track, Clinton is pressing for a
resumption of talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to implement the Wye
River peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, residents of Shepherdstown prepared for the talks and the influx
of some 1,000 people -- mainly State Department staff and journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 people -- Christians, Muslims and Jews -- gathered for prayers
Saturday at Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church to bless the talks. The church
will open its doors every day at noon during the negotiations for special
prayers.

	   Dow Down 159.86; Nasdaq Up 8.64
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An early rally on Wall Street evaporated today
after a smooth entry into the Year 2000. Stocks fell after a
purchasing managers' report of continued growth in the
manufacturing sector raised fears that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates to hold off inflation. Just before 3 p.m. EST,
the Dow Jones industrial average was down 159.86 at 11,337.26. But
the Nasdaq composite index, which had soared nearly 123 points and
then was down 79 points, was up again, gaining 8.64 to 4,077.95. No
trading glitches were reported.

	   U.S. Industrial Sector Up in Dec.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. industrial sector grew in December for
the 11th consecutive month, bringing worries in some quarters about
inflation and a possible hike in interest rates. But the growth
also kept the economy in line for its longest expansion in U.S.
history. That milestone will be reached if the economy continues to
grow in January, and would beaten if continues to rise in February.
The figures led to a selloff in stock and bond markets. The
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index, based
on a national survey of executives who buy raw materials and other
supplies, registered 55.5 percent in December, compared with 56.2
percent in November. Readings over 50 indicate expansion. Analysts
had predicted that the index would hit 56.5 percent. The report is
the first national reading for December on U.S. industrial
performance, a key sector in the economy.

	   Americans Return to Work Post Y2K
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans returned to work and businesses and
government offices operated without major computer problems today.
But the nation's Y2K chief cautioned that some small retailers
still could have difficulties. On the first day that most Americans
logged on to their office computers, the U.S. banking system opened
so smoothly that billions of dollars in extra currency --
distributed to banks to avert any financial panic -- was shipped
back to the Federal Reserve. All 1,300 Social Security
Administration field offices opened to the public, with ``no
reported glitches'' in 50 million lines of computer code, officials
said.

	   World Back at Work With Few Delays
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first major business day of the millennium
opened ith few signs of Y2K computer glitches. Those returning to
work today found energy supplies and corporate computer systems
operating smoothly. The U.S. banking system was ``running
smoothly'' this morning, said the U.S. Federal Reserve. Bruce
McConnell, director of the International Y2K Cooperation Center,
told the CBS ``Early Show'' that nothing serious was reported
anywhere and ``the risk is very low at this point.'' Not that the
Y2K bug was nowhere to be seen: Glitches hit government computers
in Hong Kong and mainland China. Police testing the sobriety of
drivers in Hong Kong had to enter birth dates on breath-testing
machine because of an apparent Y2K malfunction. Courthouse
computers in Italy mixed up prisoner dates by 100 years. A few ATM
machines shut down. But there were no reports of calamitous
failures some feared -- and stock markets responded.

that its board voted at an emergency meeting yesterday to terminate
the agreement, originally worth $2.1 billion. Western Resources,

	   Bank Glitch Makes Man Billionaire
</P>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- It seemed like a Y2K fantasy glitch. A
journalist in Cologne checked his on-line banking account on New
Year's Day and an unexplained deposit of $1.56 billion (3 billion
marks) beamed out at him from his computer screen. The software
problem caused a momentary stir, but it was one of only a few blips
in an otherwise flawless German transition into the new millennium.
Among the minor problems: Post office workers couldn't use their
electronic cafeteria cards in Frankfurt and automated teller
machines were drained of printer paper after customers made a
weekend dash to check on their account balances.
</P>
<P>
	   No Y2K Bugs Reported by Automakers

	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers rolled into the new
millennium with no reported Y2K computer bugs. General Motors
Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. resumed production
yesterday at various assembly and parts plants, coming off their
traditional holiday shutdowns and a weekend free of reported Y2K
snafus. And today, GM and Ford reported no Y2K problems as most
factories around the world ramped up as scheduled; DaimlerChrysler
spokespeople could not be reached for comment. Officials appeared
refreshed about entering the 21st century apparently free of Y2K
trouble.

	   GM To Unveil Truck-SUV Hybrid

	   WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- Bidding to add some luster to a lineup of
cars and trucks that has lacked it in recent years, General Motors
Corp. will offer two new models that meld features of pickups,
sport utility vehicles and minivans. The Pontiac Aztek, an
all-wheel-drive SUV with some minivan elements, will go on sale
later this year. The Chevrolet Avalanche, a merger of the passenger
cabin of a full-size SUV and a truck bed, will go on sale in a
slightly different form early in 2001. Both will be unveiled at the

	   Stronger Euro Predicted
</P>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Strong economic fundamentals are
likely to give the sagging euro a boost in the new millennium, two
of Europe's top monetary officials predicted Monday, exactly one
year after the joint currency was launched. German finance minister
Hans Eichel and European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg said
the currency shared by 11 European Union countries is likely to
rise as the European economy mounts a comeback. ``The euro's
exchange rate against the dollar will recover with the regaining of
the economic dynamic and rising economic growth,'' Eichel wrote in
a column in the Berliner Morgenpost daily.

<HEADLINE> Electrolux Points Finger at Worker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Appliance maker Electrolux may face losses of up
to $28 million as the result of unauthorized currency trading by an employee of
its internal bank in Germany, company officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The employee, who worked with foreign exchange transactions but was not
otherwise identified, admitted that he began unauthorized trading in currencies
early last year and manipulated records to hide the transactions, according to a
news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very serious, someone has managed to manipulate our systems and
fool both us and our accountants," the Swedish news agency quoted chief
executive Michael Treschow as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which developed the modern ice box nearly 80 years ago, is
investigating whether anybody else is involved and said losses could top $28
million, TT said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank in Germany is for internal purposes and has only four employees,
the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Electrolux, which had a 1998 profit of $588 million, is the world's biggest
maker of household appliances.

<HEADLINE> Local municipalities reporting no sign of Y2K problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y.(AP) - A bullet may have been dodged in upstate New York
Monday as local governments and municipalities reported no major Y2K glitches,
state officials said.
<P>
	   "We've had no negative reports from local government's suffering from Y2K
problems," said Gary Davis, the state's Y2K project director. "And we're feeling
more than a little gratified because we've spent a lot of time and energy
preparing the state and we've done a lot of outreach to local government."
</P>
<P>
	   Across New York, villages, towns and counties rushed to fix their computers
to avoid a series of potentially disastrous problems at the local level.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake were things like the operations of police dispatch systems, sewer
bill software, 911 emergency systems - even traffic lights and elevators.
</P>
<P>
	   Oneida County consulted with the state and began an operational review of
its computer systems about nine months ago. The county then began a six-month
project to upgrade and replace older systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "For about half a million dollars we replaced older PCs and revised a number
of larger software programs," Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace said. "But
the projects was worth every cent and not just because of Y2K. Now we've got
faster computers that are better networked which means we can operate more
efficiently."
</P>
<P>
	   In the Delaware County town of Delhi, officials also reported no problems
following the rollover. The town spent about $8,000 on system upgrades in the
town clerk and assessors office.
</P>
<P>
	   Y2K problems stem from the inability of older computer systems to discern
between dates in the 20th and 21st centuries. It's a complicated problem to fix
because computers ranging from mainframes to lap tops can be affected, as well
as the software they run with.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've just got to go through the pain," said Gary Manning, Delhi town
supervisor. "And when you think of the alternative, I'm glad we did what we
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Hemminger, the director of information systems in Ontario County,
reported that big Y2K problems were avoided because many of the county's
computer systems had been replaced over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "For us Y2K was the right problems at the right time," he said. "It was the
normal and right time for us to have begun replacing our systems because they
were old anyway and would have naturally needed upgrading."
</P>
<P>
	   But according to Davis, the year 2000 may have arrived with few of the
feared computer disruptions but Feb. 29 could pose the next problem date. He
noted that this is a leap year, and the end of February is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.

<HEADLINE> Democratic rivals push big themes in day of speeches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Beginning a January drive for votes in New
Hampshire and Iowa, Bill Bradley and Al Gore today contrasted the themes of
their competing campaigns. Bradley promised "a world of new possibilities" while
Gore countered that America needs "good decisions with good leadership."
<P>
	   Bradley, in New Hampshire, and the vice president, in Davenport, Iowa, both
emphasized education and health care as top priorities and highlighted
differences in how they would accomplish their goals, with Gore directly
attacking his opponent for having what he called a limited agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need leadership that is prepared to take risks," Bradley said, laying
out for his audience at an interactive youth science center the five big issues
he would tackle: universal access to health insurance, child poverty, more new
teachers in public schools, tighter gun control and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny, but I say, in a
world of new possibilities guided by goodness, we can and we will," Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Bradley will offer a budget proposal to close tax loopholes and
eliminate tax shelters, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, in his remarks to some 1,000 students and supporters in an Iowa gym,
offered himself as the tried-and-true national leader after seven years in the
White House, and one capable of addressing more than a few national problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough. All
of them are well within our reach if we believe in the idea of America, if we
trust one another, and if we make good decisions with good leadership," Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Bradley, Gore called him "a good and decent man" with ill-formed
proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that on many issues, he has the wrong plans," Gore said. "And on
some critical issues he has no plans. ... "Senator Bradley seems to believe
America can address only one thing at a time."
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, where voters decide the nation's first primary on Feb. 1
and where anti-Washington sentiment traditionally is a strong selling point,
Bradley sought to turn Gore's White House tenure - and 16 years in Congress
before that - against him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Only those who have never left Washington have missed the lessons of the
last decade," Bradley, himself an 18-year Senate veteran, said to hearty
applause at Manchester's FIRST science center.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the post-holiday jump on Gore, with campaign stops Sunday in
Boston and Concord, N.H., while Gore enjoyed one last day with his family before
the month of virtually nonstop campaigning for Iowa's Jan. 24 delegate caucuses
and the New Hampshire primary - the first two nominating contests.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates meet Wednesday night in New Hampshire for their fourth
debate of the season, and again Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for endorsements was also being played out this week, with Gore -
the Democratic establishment's favorite - unveiling additional supporters among
local New Hampshire officials and Bradley holding a rally Wednesday morning to
trumpet the backing of several women activists. Today, Bradley added
Chicago-area Rep. Luis Gutierrez to the handful of congressional endorsements,
compared with the 100 or more members of Congress backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   While each candidate was jumping from the January starting gate on a
high-minded note - Bradley dubbed his remarks today a "Millennium Address" -
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane held out the prospect blunt politicking to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we move into January and the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa begin
focusing more and more on specific issues - issues they may talk about with
their families at the breakfast table and the dinner table - they will see
differences," the Gore spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And we're going to be real clear about what those differences are - whether
it's supporting Medicare, making education a top national priority, keeping the
economy strong through fiscal discipline, or an approach to health care that
would be effective and would work compared to Senator Bradley's approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley adviser Anita Dunn promised return fire. "If circumstances warrant,
we're clearly respond," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign tried to blunt Gore's claim to fiscal prudence by
asserting in a news release today that the vice president's campaign promises
would overspend the $1-trillion projected budget surplus by as much as $350
billion. Bradley aides maintained that Gore underestimated costs of several
proposals, including teacher salary increases, and simply left others out of the
tally he said can be wholly paid for with surplus funds.
</P>
<P>
	   For months - and with some success, according to polls - Gore has painted
Bradley's agenda as too expensive to fit within a balanced budget.

<HEADLINE> Britney Spears Wants To Be in Movies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The princess of pop is longing for a shot at the silver
screen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really want to do a movie," 18-year-old Britney Spears said in the
February issue of Teen People. "There are, like, 20 scripts waiting for me -- I
get some really good scripts -- but I haven't taken them seriously because I
knew I didn't have any time."
</P>
<P>
	   She hopes to find the time this year as she basks in the success of her
first single, "Baby One More Time." The song shot to No. 1 last year in 15
countries and her debut disc of the same name sold more than 9 million copies in
the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Spears said if she finds the right movie, she doesn't necessarily have
to be the star.
</P>
<P>
	   "To go all out and have the lead role -- I'd be scared having that much
pressure on me," she said. "It would be fun to do a teen movie -- maybe a good
supporting role where I could show my acting ability."

<HEADLINE> Coup Leaders, Reggae Artists in Tune  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Eyes hidden behind sunglasses, the soldiers
cruise the streets of Ivory Coast's capital in a commandeered luxury car while a
radio bumps and grooves with the catchy rhythms and angry lyrics of reggae.
</P>
<P>
	   Local reggae musicians, banned under ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, are
back on the air -- with a melodic revolution supporting the soldiers who seized
power 10 days ago in a frenzy of looting and burning.
</P>
<P>
	   To hear these dreadlocked artists put it, Gen. Robert Guei's junta is
``liberating'' this West African nation of 19 million from a botched attempt at
democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ras Marlenze, a Ghanaian-born guitar player from ``Rasta Village,'' a beach
community of Rastafarian adherents in the commercial capital, Abidjan, puts it
more lyrically:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Soldja fight da bad man. Reggae help da soldja bring freedom land.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since well before Bob Marley popularized Jamaican reggae more than two
decades ago, the carefree-sounding Caribbean-African musical form has often
taken on strident political tones.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ivory Coast, a generation of musicians led by international recording
artist Alpha Blondy has in recent years aimed their songs at Bedie and his
ruling party, frequently accused of corruption and inciting ethnic tensions
during its four decades in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Bedie and his government are almost never named in the songs, the
singers openly admit the ousted president is their target. Singer Tiken Jah
Fakoly's lyrics call on listeners to fight ``the powers that divide,'' while
Alpha Blondy's 1999 song ``Dictature'' accuses Bedie of ``ruling by dividing,
dividing by trickery.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know Gen. Robert Guei well and I supported the transformation of power
from the beginning,'' says Serge Kassy, who has produced three hit reggae
albums. ``This was a people's revolution and we were fully behind it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The artists' support for the coup has been key in a part of the world where
music is a crucial form of communication and radio the most accessible medium.
Many Ivorians don't read, and those who do still respect the region's oral
tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   During Bedie's rule, the reggae musicians' references to ``dictator,''
``thief,'' or ``national divisions'' were enough to prompt state broadcasting
officials to pull them from the air. But within minutes of Guei's Christmas Eve
coup, the reggae rhythms were back on the radio.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a spontaneous, historic feeling. Suddenly all music seemed possible
to us. We had no limits,'' said Pol Dokoui, a programmer at Ivory Coast state
radio. ``And both soldiers and people on the streets seemed to enjoy us playing
these reggae songs, so we continued.''
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds of young men and women danced in the streets in some Abidjan
neighborhoods, many clutching radios and singing the reggae hits.
</P>
<P>
	   The junta's political agenda remains vague. Although Guei has promised a new
constitution, an interim civilian coalition government and an eventual return to
democracy, he has yet to say when.
</P>
<P>
	   One irony is that the coup leaders have -- so far -- allowed a much wider
range of views on radio talk shows and news programs than Bedie's government,
which was democratically elected in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first coup that I've ever heard of that makes people laugh and
smile,'' said Dokoui, the radio programmer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am, in principle, against coup d'etats and violence. But this brings me
joy because we have been liberated. So far, we are free to speak our minds and
hearts,'' says Fakoly, a popular 31-year-old reggae singer from northwestern
Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Alpha Blondy agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I see the general, I see proof of the love of God,'' he told
journalists last week. ``He has found a solution to the imbroglio that we find
ourselves in.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the honeymoon will last between the junta and reggae musicians --
who after all want their songs played on radio in order to sell albums -- is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
	   Fakoly says if the junta breaks its pledge to the people, the voices of
reggae will turn against it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have our own revolution,'' Fakoly said. ``Our music is all about
combat. We fight anyone who commits injustice, regardless of who they are.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Generally Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stock markets opened the new year bullishly on
Monday but key exchanges finished the first trading day of 2000 with losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders in Milan said there was concern that U.S. interest rate hikes were
inevitable, since the Y2K bug did no significant damage to the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 605 European companies closed down 0.5 percent
at 377.69.
</P>
<P>
	   Frankfurt's DAX index was off 3 percent at 6,750.76 Monday, taking a late
dive after spending most of the day above 7,000.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, the CAC-40 index of most actively traded stocks fell 0.7 percent
to 5,917.37, about 195 points below its peak during the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan's MIB30 blue-chip index was up 2 percent early in the day, but
finished down 3.5 percent to 41,477.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stock Exchange in London was closed for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In early trading, DAX shares were driven higher by a glitch-free transition
into the new millennium and good prospects for economic growth and corporate
restructuring in Germany this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors imagined things differently this morning ... a bit of angst set
in," said Klaus Stabel, a trader at ICF Freimakler in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler shares were up 1.9 percent at midday following news of the
company's bid for a contract to supply South Africa with up to 28,000 small and
medium-sized buses. However, shares closed down 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   An early selloff in the tumultuous U.S. financial and retail stocks spilled
over to the French market in late trading to offset early buying of technology
and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense electronics group Thomson-CSF was the biggest blue-chip gainer
on unconfirmed talk that it is about to clinch a purchase of U.K. rival Racal.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedish shares closed at a record high Monday, but some hefty gains made
early in the session vanished when Wall Street opened lower and profit-takers
emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stockholm Stock Exchange General index, or SXG, closed up 0.5 percent at
5,509.27. Most of the momentum came from the technology sector and forestry
shares, with Ericsson up 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pilot: Hijackers Were To Blow Up Jet  </HEADLINE>
   By ASHOK SHARMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A flight attendant had just brought Captain Devi
Saran a cup of tea 40 minutes after takeoff from Katmandu, Nepal, when a man
wearing a ski mask burst into the cockpit, armed with a grenade and revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No movement,'' he ordered, putting the revolver behind the Indian Airlines
pilot's right ear.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon another masked man came into the cockpit, saluted the first intruder as
``chief'' and said, ``Everything is under control.''
</P>
<P>
	   Five hijackers had taken over the New Delhi-bound plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Saran gave a detailed account Monday of the hijacking and the eight-day
crisis that ended Dec. 31 in Afghanistan after India traded three prisoners for
the 155 hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Saran said he always considered security lax at Katmandu's airport. ``The
airport is not even fenced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the first 24 hours of the crisis, the plane touched down in four
different airports. For most of that time, Saran had a gun to his head.
</P>
<P>
	   First, the hijacker ``chief'' told Saran, 37, to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.
But air controllers there denied the plane permission to land.
</P>
<P>
	   When Saran told the hijackers he was running low on fuel, they became tense.
Upon Saran's suggestion, the hijackers agreed to let the Airbus 300 refuel in
the northern Indian city of Amritsar. But they grew restive, threatening to kill
some passengers, as airport workers delayed the refueling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of them came to the cockpit and said four Indian passengers have been
killed,'' Saran said.
</P>
<P>
	   That was most likely when the hijackers stabbed to death Rippan Katyal, a
passenger who apparently disobeyed orders not to remove his blindfold.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspecting that Indian commandos were preparing to storm the plane, the
hijackers ordered Saran to take off immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Once airborne, Saran contacted Lahore Air Traffic Control and was again
denied permission to land. By then it was growing dark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I brought my plane down to 200 feet and decided to crash-land on a
highway,'' he said. But suddenly seeing a crowd of people below, he pulled the
plane up to 500 feet, Saran said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seeing us in a desperate situation, the Lahore airport authorities
switched on the runway lights and allowed us to land with barely one to two
minutes of fuel left in the aircraft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Lahore, Pakistani authorities denied Saran's request to accept wounded
passengers and women and children, but they refueled the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane took off again, and the ``chief'' told Saran to fly to Kabul, the
capital of Afghanistan. But after being told by Kabul's control tower that there
were no night landing facilities, the hijackers ordered Saran to go to Dubai in
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
	   As the plane changed course, air controllers at Kabul told Saran he could
land in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, but he kept this information from
the hijackers, hoping the crisis might end in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In any case, I didn't want to land in Afghanistan,'' Saran said. India
doesn't recognize the Taliban administration that controls nearly 90 percent of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Landing at an air base in Dubai early Dec. 25, the hijackers allowed some
injured passengers, women and children to disembark. They also handed over
Katyal's body to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane then flew back to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar, where it would
spend the next seven days sitting on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers became more relaxed after landing there, and Saran and the
crew were moved to the passenger cabin. From the cockpit, the hijackers
negotiated with a United Nations representative. They demanded the release of 36
militants jailed in India, the return of the body of a dead rebel and $200
million.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers ordered food for themselves and the passengers when they felt
hungry. On some days, there was only one meal.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers' mood swung wildly, depending on how the negotiations were
going, Saran said. Several times, they threatened to kill everyone on board, and
at other times they told the passengers jokes and stories.
</P>
<P>
	   On the morning of Dec. 30 -- the seventh day of captivity -- the hijackers
announced that negotiations with the Indian team had failed. ``They asked the
passengers to pray before they start killing them, beginning with the pilot,''
Saran said.
</P>
<P>
	   When 50 Taliban commandos surrounded the plane, the hijackers agreed to
continue negotiate -- but only after the commandos were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   If the talks broke down again, the hijackers said the plane would take off
and they would blow it up at 20,000 feet, Saran said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hours later, the hijackers announced that they had reached an agreement
with the Indian government and that the hostages would be able to return home
that evening or the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 31, as the hijackers left the plane for waiting cars -- part of
their agreement with the Indian government -- they said good-bye and ``God
willing, we'll see you again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A 10-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis who received a
lung transplant from a living stranger has died of complications.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Ostrovsky of Israel underwent a double lung transplant at St. Louis
Children's Hospital on Nov. 23, an operation that received international
attention because one of her donors, Ronald Johnson of England, was a complete
stranger who volunteered to donate a lung.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson had read about Lisa in the newspaper and responded to her father's
request for help on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, living donors are related to the patient. In many other cases,
transplanted lungs are taken from dead people.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa died Jan. 1. Doctors said Lisa's body did not respond to the new
portions of lung -- one portion donated by Johnson, the other from her mother.
The complications included infection and heart and kidney failure.

Janco Partners Inc. in Denver. "The fact that you can get a single-letter symbol
also gives the impression the stock is bullish."
</P>
<P>
	   With the addition of Qwest, the only single-letter symbols remaining are I,
M and V.
</P>
<P>
	   Qwest chairman and CEO Joseph Nacchio capped a morning ceremony that
featured a laser-light show by ringing the opening bell to start the first
trading day of 2000. His father, Frank Nacchio, bought the first 100 shares of
Qwest under its new symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were really happy with the Nasdaq. It's not that we were unhappy with
the Nasdaq," Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach said. "We're a global company. The
NYSE is more of a global exchange. We wanted more access to global investors in
all markets."
</P>
<P>
	   Since going public in 1997, Qwest has become a major player in the
telecommunications and Internet broadband industry, and is the fourth-largest
long-distance provider in the United States. In 1998, it had $2.24 billion in
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Rains, Mudslides Deadly in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Torrential rains washed out hillsides and
knocked down houses in southeastern Brazil, killing at least 11 people and
driving thousands from their homes, civil defense officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Greater Rio de Janeiro was the hardest hit, fire officials said. In the
impoverished Acari district on the city's north side, a hillside shack collapsed
under a mudslide and buried two people alive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The normally placid Maracana River overflowed and dragged away a car. The
body of one of the car's occupants was recovered, and the other is missing and
feared dead, said a fire department worker.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were killed in the mountain resort of Teresopolis, north of
Rio, when their home collapsed, the worker said. Another man died in a separate
mudslide.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Petropolis, a man died in a fall after climbing onto his roof to
escape the flood waters. Another was killed when his car was buried by mud. A
third man died when a mudslide buried his house.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man was killed in a mudslide in Itatiaia, in southern Rio de Janeiro
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Flooding in neighboring Minas Gerais state forced an estimated 10,000 people
to flee their homes, and 14 towns declared a state of emergency, officials said.
No fatalities were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The rain also impeded motorists who were returning to Sao Paulo after
celebrating the New Year in Rio. Floods and mudslides blocked Dutra Highway, the
country's most heavily traveled road, backing up traffic for 15 miles.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Down; Dow Off 162.26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Soaring bond yields held most stocks lower today, as a
smooth passage into the Year 2000 and a report of continued economic growth
raised fears that the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates to hold
off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 162.26 at 11,334.86.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 23.90 at 1,445.35, and the Nasdaq composite was up 6.19 at 4,075.50. The
Nasdaq was especially volatile, having soared nearly 123 points at the start of
trading and dipped as much as 79 points.
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for some scattered
profit-taking today.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital gains
taxes. The start of the new year means that investors who sell stocks now won't
pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied as trading began without a hitch in the first
session of 2000. But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the bond
market, which tumbled as investors bet that the Fed will return to a policy of
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times last year in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure a stable monetary system into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's growth today, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to 6.60 percent, up from
6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Bond yields are now at the highest levels
since Sept. 11, 1997, when long-term yields closed at 6.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting an appealing alternative to
volatile stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled. American Express lost 7 to 159 1/4, dragging
the Dow lower. J.P. Morgan fell 4 1/16 to 122 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks again performed better than the broader market. CMGI,
which invests in young Internet companies, rose 38 15/16 to 315 13/16, and JDS
Uniphase rose 17 11/16 to 179.
</P>
<P>
	   Amgen rose 3 7/8 to 63 15/16 after PaineWebber's chief investment strategist
Ed Kerschner added the company to a list of highlighted stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have fared worse had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But after a weekend of
testing, many of the markets that opened for trading today were running
smoothly. Market indexes in Singapore and Hong Kong quickly rose to new records.
</P>
<P>
	   Several major stock markets remained closed today, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France's CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent and Germany's Xetra DAX tumbled 3.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 747.58 million shares, well ahead of
Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 10.59 to 494.16.

<HEADLINE> Gormley boasts biggest campaign war chest among Republicans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - State Sen. William Gormley said Monday that his
under-the-radar campaign for U.S. Senate entered 2000 with $1.5 million - the
most among GOP candidates - and that he will announce his candidacy within
weeks.
<P>
	   In an early measurement of comparative financial strength, three other
Republicans reported campaign war chests significantly smaller than Gormley's.
</P>
<P>
	   According to officials at each campaign, Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley
Heights, has $750,000 on hand; Essex County Executive James Treffinger has
$625,000; and Murray Sabrin, a Ramapo College professor, has $40,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic candidates Jim Florio and Jon Corzine declined to release
financial estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake is the Senate seat now held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg, who
decided not to seek a fourth term. Voters in both parties will choose a
candidate in the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The actual reports on money raised and spent through Dec. 31, 1999 are due
at the Federal Election Commission by the end of this month. But even as
donations postmarked in 1999 continue to come in, the Republican campaigns
agreed to give ballpark estimates of what they will be reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   While important, the financial figures are only one measure of a candidate's
strength - a fact that Gormley's opponents were busy stressing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a press release, Franks boasted that he has statewide appeal, as
evidenced by the endorsements of hundreds of Republican elected officials and
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   An advisor to Sabrin said moderate Republicans like Gormley, Franks and
Treffinger need money because they lack a message.
</P>
<P>
	   And Matt Kirnan, treasurer of the Treffinger campaign, said Gormley's
announcement was no surprise. "I think everybody believed Bill Gormley would
raise a lot of money," Kirnan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gormley was hoping that his fund-raising success would provide a
foundation of optimism to a campaign that has still not been officially
launched.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm running," said Gormley, a state senator from Atlantic County since 1982
who is chairman of the judiciary committee and guardian of the Atlantic City
casino industry. "We're going to do a formal announcement, of course, but I'm
running."
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley said his campaign raised $1,530,000 since Oct. 13 and has virtually
all of it still in the bank. Not bad, he emphasized, given the fact that he was
frozen first by Gov. Christie Whitman, then by former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, both
of whom considered running before opting out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was going to run, then delayed because of Whitman," he said. "That got me
to Labor Day. Then Kean started to think, so I had to wait. This has all been
raised since October the 13th."
</P>
<P>
	   As a four-term member of the House, Franks enjoyed an advantage as the
Senate campaign began: an existing federal campaign account, which contained
about $300,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Counting that money, Franks collected more than $1 million in 1999, said his
campaign manager, Charlie Smith. Franks spent some of it and entered 2000 with
more than $750,000 on hand, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his statement, Franks said he is "on schedule to raise the $2 million
needed to win the Republican primary. I am also confident we'll raise the $10
million needed to win in November."
</P>
<P>
	   Kirnan said Treffinger has a goal of $3 million for the Republican primary.
He said the campaign raised $700,000 since Oct. 1 and entered 2000 with about
$625,000, plus $529,000 in "firm commitments" and $325,000 in additional
commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we're very enthused," Kirnan said. "Doing that in three months is
very impressive."
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin and his campaign aides make no claims to being financially
competitive with the other Republican candidates. They insist that Sabrin's
niche as the conservative Republican supported by abortion opponents and gun
enthusiasts brings support that money cannot buy.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Shaftan, an advisor, said Sabrin raised more than $200,000 in 1999,
"which is pretty impressive, considering that nobody thought we were going to
raise anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Sabrin spent the bulk of that money and entered 2000 with about $40,000,
Shaftan said.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Generally Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stock markets opened the new year bullishly on
Monday but key exchanges finished the first trading day of 2000 with losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders in Milan said there was concern that U.S. interest rate hikes were
inevitable, since the Y2K bug did no significant damage to the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 605 European companies closed down 0.5 percent
at 377.69.
</P>
<P>
	   Frankfurt's DAX index was off 3 percent at 6,750.76 Monday, taking a late
dive after spending most of the day above 7,000.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, the CAC-40 index of most actively traded stocks fell 0.7 percent
to 5,917.37, about 195 points below its peak during the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan's MIB30 blue-chip index was up 2 percent early in the day, but
finished down 3.5 percent to 41,477.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stock Exchange in London was closed for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In early trading, DAX shares were driven higher by a glitch-free transition
into the new millennium and good prospects for economic growth and corporate
restructuring in Germany this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors imagined things differently this morning ... a bit of angst set
in," said Klaus Stabel, a trader at ICF Freimakler in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler shares were up 1.9 percent at midday following news of the
company's bid for a contract to supply South Africa with up to 28,000 small and
medium-sized buses. However, shares closed down 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   An early selloff in the tumultuous U.S. financial and retail stocks spilled
over to the French market in late trading to offset early buying of technology
and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense electronics group Thomson-CSF was the biggest blue-chip gainer
on unconfirmed talk that it is about to clinch a purchase of U.K. rival Racal.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedish shares closed at a record high Monday, but some hefty gains made
early in the session vanished when Wall Street opened lower and profit-takers
emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stockholm Stock Exchange General index, or SXG, closed up 0.5 percent at
5,509.27. Most of the momentum came from the technology sector and forestry
shares, with Ericsson up 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Walgreen 1Q Earnings Up 23 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- First-quarter earnings at drugstore chain Walgreen
Co. jumped 23 percent due to soaring prescription sales, meeting analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings for the three months ended Nov. 30 were $127.8 billion, or 13 cents
per share, up 23 percent from $104 billion, or 10 cents per share, for the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That matched the estimate of 13 cents per share by analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong performance comes with Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore
chain, in the midst of rapid expansion. The Deerfield-based company said it
opened 94 stores in the first quarter of its 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the first quarter rose 20 percent to a record $4.82 billion, up
from $4.02 billion in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Walgreen dropped $1.25 to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange in
afternoon trading, however, following other stocks lower as the market was hurt
by fears of an interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief executive officer L. Daniel Jorndt attributed the company's quarterly
showing to strong pharmacy and general merchandise sales and good expense
control.
</P>
<P>
	   "Expenses as a percent to sales continue to fall as they're spread over a
larger store base," he said. "Most important is our ability to pay as we go for
the greatest expansion in our 99-year history while continuing to post record
earnings."
</P>
<P>
	   The company operates some 2,900 drugstores in 40 states and Puerto Rico. It
said it will top the 3,000-store mark this spring.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Congressman To Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Nine-term Rep. Herbert H. Bateman announced today
that he will not seek re-election because of worries about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   The 71-year-old Republican has represented the 1st District in eastern
Virginia since 1983. His term expires in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Bateman had a cancerous growth removed from his right lung in April 1998.
During surgery in November to remove plaque from his right carotid artery,
doctors also removed a swollen lymph node that was malignant, Bateman said. He
said he began radiation treatments on Dec. 20 to keep the cancer from coming
back.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressman said today that his health ``has to be my first priority
right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   As chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Readiness,
Bateman has been a supporter of Newport News Shipbuilding in the neighboring 3rd
District. Many of the shipyard's workers live in his district.
</P>
<P>
	   Bateman is the second Virginia congressman to drop out of the 2000
elections. On Thursday, Democratic Rep. Owen B. Pickett said he would not seek
an eighth term. He represents most of Norfolk and Virginia Beach.

<HEADLINE> Shulman, convicted in Suffolk, on trial in Westchester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A man who is already on death row for
murdering three women at his Long Island apartment went on trial Monday for
allegedly killing two more, wedging the victims into garbage cans and dumping
them in Westchester.
<P>
	   One of the victims was cut into pieces and has never been identified.
Investigators say DNA tests showed the blood of both women in the apartment -
including some on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truth is the truth, the facts are the facts, the blood is the blood and
the blood is on the hands of Robert Shulman," prosecutor Robert Neary told the
jury in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, 45, shuffled through papers as Neary spoke, rarely looking up. In
March, he was convicted of first-degree murder in Suffolk County Court and was
sentenced to death, but is appealing.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the conviction, Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said
Monday that the case in White Plains is being prosecuted because "There's no way
of knowing what's going to happen in the Suffolk case."
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction in Westchester, she said, would "give the victims' families the
ability to get justice and guarantee that he remains in prison the rest of his
life if he is not killed by lethal injection."
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman is accused of second-degree murder in the killings of the
unidentified woman and of Lori Vasquez of Brooklyn, a 24-year-old prostitute
Shulman allegedly picked up in Manhattan and brought back to his Hicksville
apartment in late August 1991. The state had no death penalty law at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, a postal worker, was a virtual recluse except for "the occasional
walk on the wild side," Neary said, when he would bring in prostitutes and share
crack cocaine with them at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most emerged unscathed," Neary said, but not all. The back of Ms. Vasquez's
head was bashed in with a blunt instrument. As she lay dead and naked on
Shulman's bed, he went to a Home Depot and bought a plastic garbage can, then
stuffed it with the body and the bedding, Neary said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman and his brother Barry drove to Yonkers and left the can by the side
of a road, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Aug. 31, responding to a call from residents, police Officer William
Howell found the open garbage can on its side and peered in.
</P>
<P>
	   Howell, the first witness, said he saw "a little hand ... a human hand"
protruding from the bedding.
</P>
<P>
	   The second body was found in 1992, also in Yonkers and in a trash can, but
with both arms and part of one leg severed. Shulman "took the extra precaution
of dismembering that body," Neary said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman's lawyer, William Keahon, told the jurors - seven men and five women
- that there were no witnesses to the killings and that no one saw Shulman with
the women or in Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
	   He also implied that incriminating statements attributed to Shulman had
actually been compiled by investigators, noting that there was no tape recording
of the statements. Police have said that Shulman admitted killing all five women
with a bat, a hammer or a barbell.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Suffolk District Attorney Georgia Tscheimber said in 1996, soon
after Shulman was arrested, that "Almost every item in his room appeared to be
splattered with blood."
</P>
<P>
	   The brother of the accused, Barry Shulman, has been sentenced to two years
in prison for helping dump two of the bodies in the Suffolk County case. He is
also charged in Westchester with helping to dump Ms. Vasquez's body.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Shulman was in the courtroom during his brother's trial Monday. His
own case was put off to next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Panic Money Shipped Back to Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the billions of extra dollars distributed to
banks to alleviate Y2K panic were shipped back in armored trucks Monday to the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the temporary displacement should have no significant impact
on the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on Treasury bonds, meanwhile, hit two-year highs as some investors
sold bonds they had been holding as insurance against Year 2000 disruptions. The
selling wave pushed down bond prices, which move inversely to yields.
</P>
<P>
	   "It appears to be money going back home," said David Wyss, chief financial
economist at Standard and Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, government bond prices were driven lower by what Allen Sinai,
chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, called "the same old
concern: inflation and the Fed" and whether the central bank would raise
interest rates early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve distributed some $80 billion to banks, thrifts and
credit unions during the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with $23 billion over
the same period a year ago. But some of the extra currency could have been
requested for reasons unrelated to Y2K, such as bank customers' holiday shopping
needs, Fed officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that 2000 has arrived without a run on banks, the banks and other
financial institutions started packing up the surplus currency and sending it
back to regional Federal Reserve banks, as previously planned. The process is
expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
	   "The funds were just there temporarily," Wyss said. "(The Fed is) going to
take them right back."
</P>
<P>
	   Since most of the Y2K money stayed in bank vaults and didn't get into the
public's hands, there shouldn't be any inflationary effect on the economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Fed needed to provide the extra cushion of cash to reassure the
public, banks and the financial markets, Sinai said from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "No responsible central bank could have done otherwise," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the nation's banking system appeared to be operating largely free
of Y2K glitches on the first business day of 2000 -- when weekend transactions
were first accounted for in massive computer databases.
</P>
<P>
	   ATMs -- stuffed with extra cash -- continued to work, and bank balances and
loan information appeared accurate throughout the system, government and banking
industry officials reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been doing the 'health checks' of financial institutions," said Fed
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto, referring to the telephone calls to the nation's
banks made by Fed employees. "There have been no major problems reported."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Ms. Pianalto said, the central bank's check-clearing
operations, which process 68 million checks on a typical day, continued to
operate normally. "Everything went smoothly," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking industry officials say they're optimistic people won't experience
problems withdrawing cash from automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thrilled with how everything has gone," said John Hall, a spokesman
for the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there had been a public confidence issue, we could have had a much
bigger problem," he said. "The American people took a commonsense approach.
Anecdotally, it appears there were completely normal withdrawal patterns."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, banks will be watching closely to see how their computer systems
perform this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We won't have a complete picture until Tuesday," said Mary Rodrigues, a
spokeswoman at Wells Fargo in San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices tumbled Monday as
commodities began the year with a glitch-free but negative session
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn led the losses, pressured by low U.S. weekly corn shipments
along with the slide in soybeans and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans were pushed downward by a sharp decline in soyoil along
with investors' assumption that weekend rains were beneficial to
crops in southern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat saw a less steep fall but was pressured from a storm
system that brought beneficial moisture to much of the U.S. hard
red winter wheat belt.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 1 cent to $2.47 1/2 a bushel; March
corn fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.00 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1 cent to
$1.08 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 5 1/4 cents to $4.64 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while
pork futures rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle rose .10 cent to 69.70 cents a pound; March
feeder cattle rose .48 cent to 85.90 cents a pound; February lean
hogs rose 1.47 cents to 55.97 cents a pound; February frozen pork
bellies rose 3 cents to 81.15 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Board of Trade and Chicago Merc both reported no computer
problems in connection with Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   "The transition was very smooth," said BOT spokesman Bret
Galloway. "We didn't get any reports of any glitches."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was not surprised by the lack of problems in light of
nearly five years of planning and millions of dollars in
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
	   "We tested and retested every system to the point where we were
very confident going into the weekend that there would be no
problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> 20 Die in Religious Riots in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
   By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An area of southern Egypt was under curfew Monday after
a dispute between a Christian shopkeeper and a Muslim customer exploded into
three days of religious violence that left 20 people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires had been extinguished and security forces reportedly had quelled
gunfighting and rioting, but tensions remained high Monday in a corner of the
country that has been torn before by religious clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty people were killed in the village of el-Kusheh, the Interior Ministry
said in a statement distributed by Egypt's Middle East News Agency. Coptic
Bishop Wissa, whose parish includes villages hit by the unrest, said Monday that
the victims, all Christians, died during rampages by Muslim protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 44 people injured in the unrest, 34 remained hospitalized Monday, the
Interior Ministry said. It said more than 20 buildings and several vehicles were
torched.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Kusheh, 275 miles south of Cairo, has been at the center of the rioting.
The area was reported quiet Monday, under heavy security and a curfew requiring
people to remain in their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Outsiders were not being allowed in. The Interior Ministry, which said
el-Kusheh residents earlier exchanged gunfire from their rooftops, said ``the
situation now is calm and under control.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of Muslim-Christian friction are a sensitive matter to the Egyptian
government, which has played down past troubles in el-Kusheh. In an attempt to
ease tensions, the Interior Ministry said, Muslim and Christian dignitaries have
been dispatched to the village.
</P>
<P>
	   The village of 23,000, three-fourths of whom are Coptic Christians, gained
international attention when Christian residents claimed widespread police
brutality during a 1998 murder investigation. The case came to the attention of
the U.S. Congress and, in March 1999, visiting first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
voiced concern about treatment of Copts to President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence began Friday in el-Kusheh when guns were drawn during a dispute
between a Muslim street vendor and a Christian shopkeeper. Three farmers riding
by on donkeys were shot and wounded. Later, unrest spread to the nearby villages
of Dar el-Salam and Awlad Toq West.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses in Dar el-Salam said protesters claimed that Christians had
attacked Muslims smashed and burned scores of Christian-owned shops and offices.
They said police opened fire to disperse the protesters, some of whom fired
back, and that more forces were called to restore order.
</P>
<P>
	   A church and 50 houses, shops and warehouses were burned in Awlad Toq West,
Wissa said. In Dar el-Salam, Christian homes and shops came under rifle fire, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities arrested a number of people suspected of instigating the
violence and confiscated cars carrying looted items, the ministry statement
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coptic Christians are the largest religious minority in mainly Muslim Egypt,
making up about 10 percent of the 64 million population. Copts and Muslims
generally live together peacefully, but Copts at times complain of
discrimination and occasional violence is reported.

<HEADLINE> Church Group To Fight For Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- The representatives of an influential American church
organization met with the father of a 6-year-old boy rescued off Florida's coast
and promised to press the U.S. government to return the child to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to help our president see that the issue is a moral one, a
humanitarian one,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the outgoing general
secretary of the National Council of Churches. ``We need to be concerned for a
small boy rather than politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell spoke with reporters after meeting with Elian Gonzalez' father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the child's four grandparents and great-grandmother in
this coastal town about a two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by Cuban church representatives, Campbell, a Baptist minister,
was clearly affected by her hourlong visit inside Gonzalez' modest two-story
home, built of brick and cement on an unpaved street where horse-drawn carts are
as common as automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very loving family,'' Campbell said, appearing to be on the
verge of tears. ``We are more convinced than ever that this child belongs with
this family. We will work very hard to make sure (Elian) comes back very soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the council is willing to play a mediation role in the dispute and
even to physically transport Elian back to Cuba and turn him over to the Cuban
Council of Churches to be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The council is the United States' largest ecumenical organization,
representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations comprising 52 million
congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials gave temporary custody of Elian to his paternal great-uncle
in Miami in late November after the child was found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast. Elian's mother died in the apparent attempt to illegally
immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has become a political tug-of-war, with Gonzalez demanding that his
son be returned to him in Cuba and the great-uncle fighting to keep the child in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   People on both sides of the Florida Straits have used the case to make their
own political points for or against Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez, who has shunned publicity in recent weeks, said he was grateful
for the council's efforts. He said he understood his son was well, but that he
missed him very much. ``How could I not miss him?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that he met a second time with Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials on Friday, but declined to provide details for fear of harming
his case.
</P>
<P>
	   During an earlier meeting with INS officials in Cuba, Gonzalez provided them
with the boy's birth certificate, photographs and other documents aimed at
proving his paternity and assumption of parental responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was to present his own case to the
INS in Miami before Christmas, but that meeting was postponed until Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said she had informed the White House about the group's trip and
efforts to reunite Elian with his father.

<HEADLINE> T-Bill Interest Rates Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in
Monday's first auction of the New Year to the highest level in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $8.02 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 5.360 percent, up from 5.300 percent last week. An additional
$7.01 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.585 percent, up from
5.505 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the highest since Dec. 20, when the bills sold for
5.400 percent. The six-month rate was also the highest since Dec. 20 when the
rate was 5.600.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.525
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,864.50 and
5.844 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,717.60.

<HEADLINE> Rocket Co. Considers Fla. Factory  </HEADLINE>
   By JEANNINE RELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- A Texas rocket company whose
proposed factory on the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix has faced stiff
opposition said Monday it may instead build the facility near Florida's Cape
Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
	   Beal Aerospace Technologies Inc. has been searching for sites to build and
launch rockets carrying satellites for private companies. Beal said the Florida
government had offered it a package of tax incentives and grants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're evaluating the proposal from Florida,'' Beal spokesman Wade Gates
said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Frisco, Texas.
``Our first choice is still St. Croix.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gates would not reveal details of the Florida offer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had promised to invest $50 million and create at least 130 jobs
on St. Croix, where the jobless rate of 8.5 percent is about twice the national
average. The plan was to assemble the rockets on St. Croix's southern coast and
launch them from tiny Sombrero Island, part of the British Caribbean territory
of Anguilla.
</P>
<P>
	   But environmentalists managed to delay plans in Anguilla. And in the Virgin
Islands, a court declared a land deal between the territorial government and the
company illegal on Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, Beal planned to build its headquarters and an assembly plant
on historic land that contains pre-Columbian and colonial-era ruins. In
exchange, Beal was to give the government land it owns in an industrial area of
St. Croix. Angry residents sued the government in October.
</P>
<P>
	   A court still has to rule on a second suit filed by environmentalists, who
say Beal could damage the area's fragile coral and wetlands.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israel and Syria
together Monday for the second time in less than a month, seizing a ``historic
opportunity'' to end half a century of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests in Syria served as a stark reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face. And U.S. officials downplayed expectations the antagonists would
reach an agreement on major issues during this round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Before sitting down first with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the president strolled with them
across a 200-foot long pedestrian bridge that spanned a dry creek.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-way meeting was planned for later in the day at the semi-secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the issues they will discuss are security -- a major concern for
Israel -- sharing of precious water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal
from the strategic Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character
of peace between the two Mideast neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin said, ``There's real seriousness'' on
both sides, but ``we don't expect to be able to achieve a core agreement'' in
one round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``The president understands we have
an historic opportunity here'' and that the United States ``can act as a
facilitator, as an honest broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the talks began Monday, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day
to day. At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria said they want to see the other side show its
earnestness about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources close to the Syrian delegation as well as Syria's newspapers, which
reflect government thinking, said Damascus views the negotiations as a test of
Israel's intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syrian
President Hafez Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date
for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.

<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Elca Frye cooked for a crowd Monday as regulars
at Betty's Restaurant were joined by some of those on hand for the peace talks
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Serving up breakfast, Frye said she went through 10 dozen eggs, twice the
normal amount. She was unflappable after 40 years behind the smoky diner's
counter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just my natural self,'' she said. ``If the president would come in,
I'd treat him just like I'd treat you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her extra customers were mostly journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Food planning was a challenge for Erwin Asam, co-owner of the Clarion Hotel
and Conference Center, the semi-secluded site chosen to host the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Asam said kosher fare for the Israeli delegation and Syrian foods were being
brought in by caterers from the Washington area, 70 miles away. He sent some
chefs from his other establishment, the Bavarian Inn and Lodge, to the Clarion
to help with food preparation.
</P>
<P>
	   In town at the Old Pharmacy Cafe, co-owner Margaret Shifflet said she would
feature hummus and pita bread, a regular menu selection with a Middle Eastern
flavor.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The first talks of the day began not at the Clarion but at the nearby
National Conservation Training Center run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, then walked with them across a 200-foot-long
wood and metal pedestrian bridge spanning a 25-foot deep wooded gully.
</P>
<P>
	   About two-thirds of the way across, Clinton stopped to point toward the
Potomac River, which runs parallel to the bridge. The three chatted, then
continued their stroll.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   About 70 townspeople gathered on Robert Keller's front lawn to watch
President Clinton's arrival by helicopter at the Shepherd College baseball field
across the road.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody just kind of showed up,'' Keller said. ``It's OK. We're a
friendly town.''
</P>
<P>
	   Social studies teacher Joy Lewis brought 2-year-old daughter Macaline and
3-year-old son Chandler to see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm so glad my children get to experience this and that my town was
selected for this. We are so blessed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Most downtown businesses displayed window posters with the word ``peace'' in
English, Hebrew and Arabic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herb Lady, a card, candle and potpourri boutique, carried the message
further with a window display of peace-themed greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm excited. I think it's great,'' manager Donna Wallace said. ``There are
a lot of really enlightened people in this area. We have all kind of been
pulling together to pray for peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Ouch!
</P>
<P>
	   Before the presidential entourage departed the White House for
Shepherdstown, a Secret Service agent assigned to President Clinton's detail got
two fingers of his right hand caught in the driver's door of the black Chevrolet
Suburban that trails Clinton's limousine.
</P>
<P>
	   The agent collapsed in pain on the White House driveway and a pair of medics
rushed across the South Lawn with a stretcher. But the man recovered quickly
enough to walk back into the White House with the help of two fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Secret Service spokesman Jim Mackin, who declined to identify the agent,
said the agent's fingers did not appear to be broken but he planned to see a
doctor. The agent was expected to return to work soon, Mackin said.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Raw Materials Is Rising  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. manufacturers say the cost of raw materials is rising
as the nation's economy closes in on a record for the longest expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewed inflation jitters rattled financial markets, with blue-chip
stocks tumbling from record highs and bond yields rising to the highest level in
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's report from the National Association of Purchasing Management
heightened the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in
the weeks ahead to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report is closely watched because it is the first
national reading for December on U.S. industrial performance, a key sector in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said its index, based on a national survey of executives who buy
raw materials and other supplies for industry, registered 55.5 percent in
December, down from 56.2 percent in November and below analysts' expectations.
Readings over 50 indicate expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 11th consecutive month of growth, though at a slightly lower rate
than in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "These numbers are very healthy, indicating manufacturing is still
expanding," said Bryan Jordan, an economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that there was "dramatic improvement" in the industrial economy in
1999. "The manufacturing sector recovered as the global economy recovered," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   That puts the U.S. economy in line to set a record. The longest economic
expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106 months, from February 1961 until
December 1969. The current expansion, which began in March 1991, will match the
record if it continues through this month and pass it if it lasts until
February.
</P>
<P>
	   But concerns about inflation, sparked by the report's reading of raw
materials prices, unsettled financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on 30-year government bonds, a barometer for such long-term borrowing
costs as mortgages, shot above 6.6 percent Monday, reaching the highest level
since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which ended 1999 at an all-time high, fell
140.23 points to close at 11,356.89. But the Nasdaq composite index began the
year by reaching a new high in volatile trading.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest report, 18 of 20 industries reported higher prices for raw
materials. Some 35 percent of the purchasing managers who were surveyed said
prices had risen, while just 6 percent said they were lower. The rest said they
were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The price index rose to 65.7 percent in December from 65.3 percent the month
before. It was the eighth consecutive month with a reading above 50 and the
fourth in a row above 60.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it means is that we still have a lot of inflation concerns," said Gary
R. Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. He noted
that other gauges indicate that most of the price increases are for oil and
related products and added that there's fear these will spread to other
products.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we can't rule out action by the Federal Reserve in February," Thayer
said. "The markets already are assuming they will raise rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Fed policy-makers raised rates three times in 1999 to try to keep the
economy from overheating and igniting inflation. The Fed left rates unchanged
last month because it did not want to upset the economy immediately before the
year 2000 date change. With the economy still roaring ahead with no apparent
disruptions caused by Y2K computer problems, an increasing number of analysts
expect further rates increases this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's next meeting is a two-day session beginning Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> Local municipalities reporting no sign of Y2K problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y.(AP) - A bullet may have been dodged in upstate New York
Monday as local governments and municipalities reported no major Y2K glitches,
state officials said.
<P>
	   "We've had no negative reports from local governments suffering from Y2K
problems," said Gary Davis, the state's Y2K project director. "And we're feeling
more than a little gratified because we've spent a lot of time and energy
preparing the state and we've done a lot of outreach to local government."
</P>
<P>
	   Across New York, villages, towns and counties rushed to fix their computers
to avoid a series of potentially disastrous problems at the local level.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake were things like the operations of police dispatch systems, sewer
bill software, 911 emergency systems - even traffic lights and elevators.
</P>
<P>
	   Oneida County consulted with the state and began an operational review of
its computer systems about nine months ago. The county then began a six-month
project to upgrade and replace older systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "For about half a million dollars we replaced older PCs and revised a number
of larger software programs," Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace said. "But
the projects was worth every cent and not just because of Y2K. Now we've got
faster computers that are better networked which means we can operate more
efficiently."
</P>
<P>
	   In the Delaware County town of Delhi, officials also reported no problems
following the rollover. The town spent about $8,000 on system upgrades in the
town clerk and assessors office.
</P>
<P>
	   Y2K problems stem from the inability of older computer systems to discern
between dates in the 20th and 21st centuries. It's a complicated problem to fix
because computers ranging from mainframes to lap tops can be affected, as well
as the software they run with.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've just got to go through the pain," said Gary Manning, Delhi town
supervisor. "And when you think of the alternative, I'm glad we did what we
did."
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Hemminger, the director of information systems in Ontario County,
reported that big Y2K problems were avoided because many of the county's
computer systems had been replaced over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "For us Y2K was the right problems at the right time," he said. "It was the
normal and right time for us to have begun replacing our systems because they
were old anyway and would have naturally needed upgrading."
</P>
<P>
	   But according to Davis, the year 2000 may have arrived with few of the
feared computer disruptions but Feb. 29 could pose the next problem date. He
noted that this is a leap year, and the end of February is being mentioned as a
potential trouble date for computers.

<HEADLINE> Syria Has Many Issues With Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- As Syrian and Israeli leaders began a crucial round
of U.S.-brokered talks Monday, Syrians staged a sit-in denouncing the Jewish
state and demanding the immediate release of Syrian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   The government-sanctioned protest -- held annually for three years but this
year timed to coincide with the negotiations -- was a reminder of the numerous
thorny issues facing negotiators and the need for both sides to take steps to
build each other's confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 50 protesters, mostly university students, gathered at the offices of
the International Committee for the Red Cross in Damascus carrying portraits of
17 Syrians from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights imprisoned in Israel. Syria
has set the return of the Golan, the strategic plateau Israel seized in the 1967
Mideast War, as the price of peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our action is a message addressed to the negotiators in the United
States,'' said Maymouna al-Maqet, a 25-year-old studying computer engineering
whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not clear how many Syrians are held in Israel. Many are believed
jailed for taking part in operations from neighboring Lebanon, but public
attention is usually focused on those from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria views the new round of peace talks as a test of Israel's intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this round, the Israeli side should show seriousness and credibility
towards the honest and true attitude taken by Syria on the peace process,'' said
the state-run Syria Times, an English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met in Washington on Dec. 15-16 in the first such high-level encounter
between the two countries in more than half a century of hostility. At that
meeting, they agreed on the second round of talks, where real and tangible
progress was expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Progress will be difficult, as Monday's protest made clear. Deep-rooted
animosity towards Israel, linked to issues such as the hundreds of Arab
prisoners in Israeli jails and the fate of tens of thousands of Palestinian
refugees residing in Arab countries, could constrain Syrian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters handed Claude Voillat, the Swiss head of the ICRC in Syria, a
letter denouncing the ``Zionist heinous occupation'' of the Golan and demanding
immediate release of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria have said they want to see the other side show it is
serious about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy suggested on Sunday that Syrian
President Hafez Assad get involved in the talks to show that Syria is serious
about peace. Barak is leading the Israeli negotiating team in the United States,
while Assad instead sent one of his most trusted advisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely travels abroad. In addition, he may be waiting
until he is sure of success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian wariness has been increased by what is seen as conflicting signals
from Israel over the Golan's future.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech Dec. 20 after returning from the opening round of peace talks,
Barak spelled out for the first time that Israel would have to pull out of Golan
territory. But he did not say whether he meant the entire plateau would be
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   A day before the speech, Barak's government had approved the construction of
new homes in the Golan -- a decision not made public until just a few days ago.

<HEADLINE> Fire May Scorch More Aussie Acreage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERTH, Australia (AP) -- An out-of-control bush fire that has burned for four
days could scorch more of Western Australia on Tuesday as strong winds fan the
flames, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in Western Australia's
Beekeepers Nature Reserve, about 190 miles north of Perth, the state capital.
``Our main concern this morning is the strong southwesterly (wind) change,''
said Conservation and Land Management Fire Manager Rick Sneeuwjagt.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of Monday, the fire was believed to have destroyed about 123,500
acres of scrub, Sneeuwjagt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody was reported injured in the blaze in largely uninhabited bush, but
about 100 storage shacks used by farmers were threatened. Four were gutted
Monday, and buildings and vehicles on several farming properties were also
believed to have been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets Handle Y2K Smoothly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors were surprised to see the date Jan. 3, 100, on
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Web site on Monday morning. But the minor glitch
was only one of the few in the first day of trading in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the major brokerage firms and stock exchanges around the world
reported smooth trading Monday, though Wall Street is expected to remain on
alert through Tuesday when trading resumes in Japan, the United Kingdom and the
New York Mercantile Exchange, as well as a handful of other overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had glitches here or there, but from a Y2K perspective it's gone very
well," said Edward Goldberg, executive vice president of operations for Merrill
Lynch. "We're just waiting for London and Tokyo to come alive, and if that goes
well, we'll all relax."
</P>
<P>
	   The glitches included phone lines that went down, the occasional piece of
bad data, and delays in reporting -- but then, things like that happen everyday
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In Time Square, the new Nasdaq Stock Market broadcast and educational
facility opened Monday. Trading went off without a hitch -- as it did in other
major U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq ended the day higher, though both the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Other U.S. markets, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade, experienced no problems.
</P>
<P>
	   This Y2K stress-free day in the markets, however, didn't come cheap. U.S.
brokerage firms spent $5 billion and three years upgrading their computer
systems. And the work didn't end Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Schwab said it was answering a flood of calls from customers who
wanted to be assured of their balances and execution of their trades. The
company's Web site also was clogged with 60,000 simultaneous users for most of
the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The date error on the Philadelphia exchange Web site, which was fixed by
lunchtime, was caused by a computer server, said Kelli Crudo, a spokeswoman for
the exchange. The exchange itself opened with a "seamless transition" into the
new year, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the world, the news was similar. Stock indexes in Hong Kong and
Singapore, both of which rang out 1999 at record levels, soared again Monday,
with Singapore's main index up 4.2 percent and Hong Kong shares up 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan, one of the countries experts were most worried about, opened its
stock market with success, as did India.
</P>
<P>
	   Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Poland reported no Y2K problems,. Markets in
Japan, China, Switzerland and London were closed Monday, but Britain's Cabinet
Office reported business as usual and Swiss banks noted no signs of
abnormalities.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli: Hillary Clinton will have all the money she needs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The head of the national Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee pledged Monday to spend "whatever is required to win" to help
Hillary Rodham Clinton capture a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
<P>
	   "This race is not going to be lost for financial resources. Indeed, it is
not going to be lost at all," Sen. Robert Torricelli, a major booster of the
first lady's expected Senate campaign, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "Between the DSCC and Hillary Clinton's own campaign efforts, spending will
reach the maximum levels that are effective," Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli refused to say how much the DSCC might spend in New York but said
the committee's report to the Federal Election Commission due at the end of this
month would show it has more than $9 million on hand going into the election
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary Clinton is entitled to a portion of that money," Torricelli said.
The first lady has been aggressively raising money for the DSCC in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the national Senate campaign committee said that Mrs. Clinton
also is raising record amounts of money on her own for her race but he refused
to provide specific figures. Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff has also refused to
divulge how much she has raised over the past six months, saying that
information will be made public at the end of this month when she files her
first campaign finance report with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Mrs. Clinton and her expected Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, have refused to say how much they have raised in the
past six months, aides to both told The New York Times last week that they have
each topped the $6.6 million mark. That is how much former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
raised in 1997, the year before he lost his Senate seat from New York to
Democrat Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani campaign aide Bruce Teitelbaum said Monday that Torricelli's
comments came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fully expect the Clinton campaign will raise more money than we will ...
We expect it, we're prepared for it and we will obviously raise sufficient funds
to run a competitive and winning campaign," the Giuliani adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign finance team has vowed to raise at least $25 million
for the race while Giuliani has said he expects to raise about $20 million. That
could make it the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York and New Jersey must both be won to get the 51 Democratic United
States senators" the party needs to take back control of the Senate, Torricelli
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the New York Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported that
Giuliani was considering delivering a major speech on the need for campaign
finance reform in which he would call on the state and national GOP to refrain
from spending "soft money" to help his candidacy. Teitelbaum said Monday that he
could not confirm that and that the mayor has, thus far, not ruled out the use
of soft money. Mrs. Clinton has said she wouldn't mind seeing soft-money
spending kept out of the campaign but only if both sides agree.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has already benefitted from unlimited soft-money donations to
the DSCC. It supplied several hundred thousand dollars of such funds late last
year to finance television ads in upstate New York promoting her. Giuliani has
run campaign ads in the region as well but paid for them out of his own campaign
coffers.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Trade Accusations  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURINDA KEYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India and Pakistan exchanged angry accusations
Monday over India's claim that its nuclear rival had a hand in the eight-day
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jetliner in which one person was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting the tensions between the two neighbors, a land mine explosion
killed 17 people and wounded 31 in the disputed region of Kashmir. No one
claimed responsibility for the blast in a vegetable market outside
Indian-controlled Srinagar, but Muslim separatists often carry out attacks in
the region. In Pakistani-held Kashmir, five civilians were killed from repeated
Indian shelling, Pakistani officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asian rivals regularly trade fire across Kashmir. Shelling goes on
almost every day and militants frequently carry out bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged the United States and
other world powers on Monday to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, saying India
had evidence proving Pakistan was involved in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   Vajpayee said Washington, which historically has had a closer relationship
with Pakistan than India, should take the initiative in isolating Pakistan, a
predominantly Muslim country under military rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan's active and sustained role in fomenting terrorism in India is
now too obvious to be overlooked by the international community,'' said
Vajpayee. ``India, therefore, strongly urges major nations of the world to
declare Pakistan a terrorist state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vajpayee's comments were the latest in a series of strong statements by
Indian leaders alleging Pakistani involvement in the hijacking of Indian
Airlines Flight 814 on a Dec. 24 flight from Nepal to New Delhi. However,
neither Vajpayee nor the other officials have provided evidence to back up their
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Nations that declare Pakistan a terrorist state could impose a range of
sanctions against Islamabad, including a ban on travel, restrictions on military
sales and withdrawal of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar dismissed the Indian allegations
Monday as ``trumped-up charges'' and said India had an ``abhorrent record of
state terrorism,'' a reference to its military campaign against Muslim militants
in Indian-held Kashmir who are fighting for outright independence or union with
Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of the Kashmiri militants, but their
names and nationalities are not known, and they wore masks throughout the
hijacking. Their whereabouts remained a mystery Monday, as did the location of
the three men India released from jail in exchange for 155 hostages held aboard
the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the three prisoners, Masood Azhar, made a telephone call Friday from
Kandahar, Afghanistan, to his family in Pakistan, according to a family member
who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar, who called his family in Bawahalpur in the eastern Pakistan, was
freed along with Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheikh, a Pakistani-born British citizen, and
Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, an Indian from Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men were imprisoned in India for involvement in the bitter and
bloody insurgency in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been several reports, many of them contradictory, about the
whereabouts of the hijackers and the freed prisoners. Afghanistan's Taliban
leaders gave the hijackers 10 hours to leave the country on Friday, the day the
hijacking ended, and Pakistan was considered the most likely destination.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan denies India's charges that it funds, trains and supplies the
militants. On Monday, Pakistan again said it had no knowledge of the hijackers
entering its territory, and challenged India to hand over any evidence it had.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who suggest Pakistan should arrest the hijackers make the naive
assumption that the hijackers have entered Pakistan,'' the Foreign Ministry said
in a statement. ``To the best of our information, such an assumption is
unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India both lay claim to all of Kashmir and have fought two wars
over Kashmir since their independence from Britain in 1947. The two countries,
which exploded underground nuclear devices last year, came close to another war
this summer over Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Sale Looms for Smith &AMP; Wesson  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- With the gun industry itself under fire, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, maker of the .44-caliber Magnum carried by Dirty Harry, is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman Ken Jorgensen said Monday that the nation's largest
gun manufacturer has not yet engaged a specific buyer but that its parent
company is shifting aim away from the firearms business.
</P>
<P>
	   The gunmaker is battling a series of municipal lawsuits blaming Smith &AMP;
Wesson and others for gun violence. Smith &AMP; Wesson has been cleared in every
lawsuit decided so far, but other cases remain before the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Sally Slovenski, a gun control advocate at Boston-based Join Together, said
the lawsuits are making life more complicated for gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quite a few of the gun companies are starting to change perspective," she
said. Some "are starting to broaden the variety of their manufactured goods."
</P>
<P>
	   A British newspaper, the Mail on Sunday, quoted an unidentified source as
saying that Smith &AMP; Wesson is being put up for sale by its owner, the English
conglomerate Tomkins PLC. The newspaper suggested the sale could take in more
than $160 million. Smith &AMP; Wesson confirmed the report Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorgensen said that Tomkins, which acquired Smith &AMP; Wesson in 1987, is
refocusing on business and automotive products.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going to divest themselves of companies that don't fit into that
when they have an opportunity, but there's nothing ongoing with Smith &AMP; Wesson
at this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He described Smith &AMP; Wesson's sales during the past year as strong, but
declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to handguns, Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson makes bicycles and
a range of computer software for law enforcement agencies. It also does
specialized metal working for more than 300 other companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith &AMP; Wesson developed the first gun of its Magnum line in 1935, and the
powerful and physically imposing .44 became an icon in the Dirty Harry movies of
the 1970s and '80s starring Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1983 movie "Sudden Impact," Eastwood tells a villain, "Well we're not
just going to let you walk out of here." Asked what he meant by "we," Eastwood
replied, "Smith and Wesson and me."
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's oldest handgun maker at 147 years, Smith &AMP; Wesson employs about
750 workers in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the company in 1852 to develop a
gun that could shoot self-contained cartridges, avoiding the need for loose
gunpowder, balls and primer.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith &AMP; Wesson is also known historically for its widely used six-shot
revolvers and weapons that were once standard sidearms for U.S. soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Putin Fires Yeltsin's Daughter  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH INGRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin fired Boris Yeltsin's
daughter Monday in one of his first official acts, moving quickly to distance
himself from Yeltsin's scandal-tinged administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The speedy removal of Tatyana Dyachenko from her Kremlin post as ``image
adviser'' sent a clear message to the Russian public that Putin wants nothing to
do with the widespread corruption that has plagued Russia and may be the single
biggest obstacle to the country's development.
</P>
<P>
	   The terse announcement of Dyachenko's dismissal marked Putin's first
personnel change since taking office Friday. He also fired three other members
of Yeltsin's inner circle, whom many Russians have come to despise.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyachenko had been accused of exercising undue influence over government
policy, and has recently been a focus of an investigation into allegations of
Kremlin bribery.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who is seen as the strong front-runner in presidential elections
expected March 26, has indicated that one of his main goals is to clean up the
widespread corruption that may be the single biggest obstacle to Russia's
development. He has sternly warned government bureaucrats that he won't tolerate
criminality or favoritism.
</P>
<P>
	   But many analysts have questioned whether he will go beyond window-dressing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem of anti-corruption campaigns is that unless you start at the
top, there's no point,'' Margo Light, a Russia expert at the London School of
Economics, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin granted Yeltsin immunity from prosecution on Friday, almost
immediately after the aged president resigned unexpectedly and named him acting
president. However, while the decree protected Yeltsin and made it impossible to
subpoena his papers, the immunity did not extend to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the substance of Dyachenko's job nor the extent of her influence
were ever clear. Regardless, it was a position that gave the former computer
engineer a Kremlin office, access to her father in an official capacity and a
great deal of behind-the-scenes influence.
</P>
<P>
	   She shied away from public attention, but Russian media persistently linked
her to several powerful businessmen who have allegedly used their wealth and
media holdings to try to manipulate government policy and acquire privatized
state assets through sweetheart deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's erratic moves -- especially his abrupt firing of four successive
prime ministers -- often provoked speculation that his daughter and her allies
were pulling strings.

<P>
	   Most recently, Dyachenko has been at the center of a probe into allegations
of massive kickbacks that plagued the Kremlin during Yeltsin's last year in
office.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss and Russian prosecutors have been investigating allegations that
Dyachenko and her sister Yelena Okulova, as well as other Kremlin officials,
took bribes from a Swiss company, Mabetex, that won lucrative Kremlin
construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to $1 million allegedly went to Kremlin property manager Pavel Borodin,
who oversaw the renovation work, and was made available to Yeltsin and his
family, according to some press reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss prosecutors have focused on allegations that Yeltsin and his daughters
were provided with credit cards funded by Mabetex and that hundreds of thousands
of dollars were allegedly charged to them. Mabetex, Yeltsin and his family have
consistently denied the allegations and nobody has been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   In October the Swiss Banca del Gottardo confirmed that it provided
guarantees credit cards for Yeltsin and his two daughters on instructions from
Mabetex. The bank stressed that it did not provide actual credit cards and that
the guarantee -- which would come into force if bills went unpaid -- was never
invoked.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss authorities were also reportedly monitoring a bank account opened by a
Svetlana Dyachenko, which they suspected was actually set up for Tatyana.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the corruption allegations against Yeltsin and his administration
have been swirling for months, nobody has been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin removed three other officials from their Kremlin posts on Monday:
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin, protocol chief Vladimir Shevchenko, and
presidential office chief Valery Semyonchenko. However, Kremlin chief of staff
Alexander Voloshin then appointed Yakushkin as one of his deputies.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin told Echo of Moscow radio on Monday that Yeltsin would maintain an
office in the Kremlin, and that he would continue meeting with officials on an
informal basis.

<HEADLINE> Fraunces Tavern restaurant bites the dust - but historic part  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The tables were draped with linen, overflowing with food
and dozens of wine decanters. But it all lay untouched one night in 1783 at the
Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan.
<P>
	   George Washington was on his way, to bid adieu to his officers in the
Revolution. And many tearful kisses would pass among them before the feast.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, at the start of the 21st century, a notice went up at the
historic watering hole visited by the likes of Richard Nixon and Harry Truman:
The restaurant and bar were closed, indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is money," said tavernkeeper Robert Norden.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the American Revolution, the bottom line was victory.
</P>
<P>
	   And on that night in the "Long Room," just above today's restaurant, General
Washington told the officers who helped him win America's freedom from Britain:
"With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you."
</P>
<P>
	   Then each man, many suffused in tears, "marched up to, kissed, and parted
with his General-in-Chief," wrote Lt. Col. Benjamin Tallmadge, one of the
officers with Washington in the last hours before he resigned his military
commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's reality is far more prosaic.
</P>
<P>
	   The restaurant's operators, Robert and Jacqueline Norden, are unable to
agree on terms of a new lease with the building's owner, the Sons of the
Revolution, a patriotic not-for-profit organization that owns the tavern and the
right to its name.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nordens said the restaurant is losing money, with the lease and
real-estate taxes totaling around $315,000 a year. Since Jan. 31, 1991, when the
previous lease expired, the Nordens have been month-to-month tenants while
negotiations continued, unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect they're going to leave," said Robert McKay, chairman of the real
estate committee of the Sons of the Revolution. The committee planned to meet
Monday evening to discuss "the restaurant situation," he said, but "it's
improbable they'll stay beyond noon on Jan. 5. They've agreed to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the oldest continually operated restaurants in the country, the
tavern's clubby bar on Pearl Street - just down from Nasdaq headquarters - has
been a hot spot for Wall Street brokers and financiers. When a company went
public, they'd often celebrate here, watching the TV in the bar for stock
quotes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fun was shattered in 1975, when an explosion at the tavern killed four
people and injured 60. A Puerto Rican nationalist group took responsibility for
the attack on a site they associated with America's identity.
</P>
<P>
	   The yellow brick colonial at the corner of Broad Street was opened in the
1760s by Washington's chief steward, a patriot named Samuel Fraunces. A meeting
place, it later housed the administrative offices of the new nation, when New
York was its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   "More than a place to drink!" says a sign.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six decades, the tavern has been operated by the Norden family.
But apparently, they're not what the patriotic Sons want.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're seeking is three things: a reasonable rate of return, a quality
operation, and a cooperative relationship with the tenants," McKay said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday in the Long Room, a fake turkey lay on a platter and clams on a
plate - not steaming. The historic room graced by a portrait of Washington is
part of a museum still open to the public, and is separate from the Nordens'
business.
</P>
<P>
	   In the eatery below, tables were elegantly set for a dinner that was not to
be. And in the bar, huge wildlife trophies Norden purchased at auction loomed
over the wood-paneled space.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh no!" said one man as he was turned away at the front door.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is American history, and it dies hard.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sons of the Revolution say they're looking for a new tenant, and the
tavern could reopen sometime in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 140; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The first day of trading on Wall Street in the year 2000
looked very much like a typical session of 1999. Soaring bond yields held most
stocks lower, but technology investors weathered a volatile market and scooped
up shares of their favorite companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 140.23 to close at 11,356.89.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell,
but the Nasdaq composite rebounded from a loss of as much as 79 points to finish
higher. The Nasdaq's gain brought it to a new closing record, launching the
technology-dominated index into 2000 in the same fashion it wrapped up 1999. It
rose to rose 61.49 to 4,130.80 today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 14.08 to 1,455.17.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 2,143 down, 1,111 up and 291 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 921.34 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 372.60 million
at the close of Friday's shortened session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.70 to 497.05.
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for scattered
profit-taking today.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors had held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital
gains taxes. The start of the new year means that investors who sell stocks now
won't pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied as trading began without any Y2K problems in the
first session of 2000. But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the
bond market, which tumbled as investors bet that the Fed will return to a policy
of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times last year in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure a stable monetary system into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's strength today, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row. Many economists
had expected the indexes to rise more sharply, but the moderate increases
rattled investors nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   "The figures were not sufficiently restrained to suggest that the Fed may
remain on hold," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the 30-year bond as high as 6.61 percent, up
from 6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Bond yields are now at the highest
levels since Sept. 11, 1997, when long-term yields closed at 6.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting an appealing alternative to
volatile stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled, inclduing American Express and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks again performed better than the broader market. CMGI,
which invests in young Internet companies, and JDS Uniphase rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Amgen rose after PaineWebber's chief investment strategist Ed Kerschner
added the company to a list of highlighted stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Technology stocks are truly a mania on Wall Street," Meehan said. "I don't
see that changing any time soon."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have fared worse had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But after a weekend of
testing, many of the markets that opened for trading today ran smoothly.
</P>
<P>
	   Several major stock markets remained closed, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France's CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent and Germany's Xetra DAX tumbled 3.0
percent.

<HEADLINE> With AM-NJ--Campaign Sprint, Bjt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) - Matching promises at long distance, Al Gore and
Bill Bradley pledged radical, "revolutionary" school improvements Monday at the
beginning of a January drive toward the first Democratic presidential showdowns.
<P>
	   Gore, while touting his experience in the White House, also promised the
nation "a new era of progress" if elected. Bradley, set to release his budget
proposal, took a shot at Gore's, contending the vice president's campaign
promises would run up $350 billion in red ink.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was campaigning in New Hampshire and trying to make the case that he
is proposing far more aggressive policies than a timid Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need leadership that is prepared to take risks," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore focused tightly on education, and later in the day was courting women
voters as he sought support from key Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a challenge also in helping hardworking families find the time that
they want and need for their children without sacrificing their standard of
living," said Gore, speaking to cheering students and supporters packed into a
high school gymnasium in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals focused on traditional Democratic issues with an eye on the
first nomination tests, in Iowa Jan. 24 and New Hampshire eight days later.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore promised "revolutionary improvements in our schools."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's rhetoric matched the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must radically improve our education system, for that is and always has
been the engine of growth and change in our society," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Gore called Bradley "a good and decent man." But he quickly added
that his opponent "has the wrong plans and on some critical issues he has no
plans."
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Bradley said campaign finance reform was needed "to fight
the disease of money in our politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, much criticized for his fund-raising activities in 1996, said Bradley
"has labored to draw an artificial distinction on this issue."
</P>
<P>
	   "I have supported tough campaign finance reform for 20 years now," Gore told
backers.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point in the day, Bradley's campaign released what it said was a
study of Gore campaign proposals on health care, Medicare and education - a
study that said the proposals would outspend the nation's budget surplus by "as
much as $350 billion over 10 years."
</P>
<P>
	   "Leadership is about being honest with people about what can be achieved,"
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore argues that Bradley's proposals are even larger and would run up more
red ink in the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The back-and-forth was predictable.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our numbers are from independent sources and Gore's are not," said Bradley
aide Jim Farrell. "We don't trust his numbers at all."
</P>
<P>
	   "He seems to have as much difficulty with our budget numbers as he does
adding up his own health care numbers," said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. "We
practice what we preach, we've been doing it for seven years."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also stressed racial harmony, the environment and arms control as he
returned to the campaign trail after a holiday break.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,"
said Gore. "All of them are within our reach ... if we make good decisions with
good leadership."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaigned at an interactive youth center focusing on universal
health insurance, child poverty, teacher hiring, gun control and campaign
finance reform. He was underscoring his appeal as a Washington outsider, though
he spent 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Only those who have never left Washington have missed the lessons of the
last decade," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley's vision was limited.
</P>
<P>
	   "Senator Bradley seems to believe America can address only one thing at a
time," he said. "The vision of the American people should not be limited by
those who lead us."
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning will be virtually nonstop leading up to Iowa's precinct caucuses
and New Hampshire's opening primary. The candidates have their fourth debate
Wednesday in New Hampshire and meet in debate again Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley didn't mention Gore in his speech, his campaign quickly did it
for him. Gore was less subtle, going after Bradley directly during his stump
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates were choosing their words carefully. Bradley used a
TelePrompTer to read a six-page speech, while Gore carefully read from a
seven-page speech with little of the spontaneity of earlier events.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Hit Russia Embassy in Beirut  </HEADLINE>
   By HUSSEIN DAKROUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Assailants protesting Russia's crackdown on Chechnya
fired rocket-propelled grenades Monday at the Russian Embassy in Beirut, killing
a policeman and leading to a manhunt and a raid that left one attacker dead.
</P>
<P>
	   No Russian casualties were reported at the embassy, located along the busy
Corniche Mazraa thoroughfare, but political attache Andrey Avdeev said the
building's consular area was damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Mazraa area is
in the Muslim sector of Beirut, where extremists are sympathetic to fellow
Muslims in Chechnya. Lebanese Muslim militants opposed to Russia's military
campaign in the breakaway republic have staged protests and have been raising
money for the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   Police sources confirmed, on condition of anonymity, reports that the dead
assailant was carrying a statement indicating the attack was motivated by anger
with Russian military actions in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run television reported the paper said: ``In sacrifice for Chechnya.''
A private radio station, Voice of Free Lebanon, said the paper found on Kharroub
was addressed ``The Call of Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese army troops and police in armored personnel carriers and trucks
fanned out in the area shortly after the midday attack, which shattered windows
and left the compound pocked with shrapnel and bullet marks. The windshield of
an embassy car was shattered.
</P>
<P>
	   The assailants launched four grenades and fired assault rifles at the
embassy from a nearby building. Security forces stormed the building and killed
one of the attackers, police said. Several passers-by were injured in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   Troops sealed off neighboring buildings and streets and searched for at
least two assailants who fled under heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the most serious attack on a foreign diplomatic mission in Lebanon
since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war, during which foreign nationals and
embassies as well as ordinary Lebanese were targets of armed factions.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Russian Foreign Ministry gave no immediate comment on the
attack. The Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying only that
``details of the occurrence are being clarified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Shepherdstown, W.Va., where Israel and Syria were resuming peace talks,
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin condemned the attack on the embassy,
calling it a ``cowardly act of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police identified the dead suspect as Ahmed Raja Abou Kharroub, a
30-year-old Palestinian resident of Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest Palestinian
refugee camp. Ein el-Hilweh, located outside the port city of Sidon, 30 miles
south of Beirut, is a camp of 75,000 controlled by rival Palestinian factions,
including radical groups and the PLO's mainstream Fatah group.
</P>
<P>
	   Police did not say whether Abou Kharroub was known to be affiliated with any
particular group.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops launched a military offensive in September to wrest control
of the rebel republic of Chechnya after Chechen-based militants invaded a
neighboring region and were blamed for bombings elsewhere in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Official: Muslims in Lebanon Kill 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) -- Armed Muslim militants fleeing an army onslaught in
the mountains of northern Lebanon on Monday killed four soldiers and three
hostages, including an army officer, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings raised the death toll to 21 in four days of the bloodiest
inter-Lebanese fighting in years, the Lebanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting started in Dinniyah, a lightly populated mountainous area 15
miles east of this northern port city, when militants ambushed an army unit on
Friday. Four soldiers were killed and an officer and an aide were kidnapped. The
aide was found dead on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of the officer, Lt. Col. Milad Naddaf, had been unknown. But on
Monday, Naddaf's body, hands tied, was dumped in a village in the Dinniyah
region, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of the officer plus the deaths of four more soldiers during a
battle earlier in the day brought to 11 the number of Lebanese troops killed in
the confrontation with Muslim extremists.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, the militants raided the house of army Sgt. Hanna Yazbek in the
village of Kfar Hebbou. The soldier escaped from the assailants, who shot him in
the leg as he fled. But the militants took his family hostage, apparently as
human shields.
</P>
<P>
	   The army statement Monday night said the gunmen killed two hostages they
were holding in Kfar Hebbou. It did not identify the two people. The army
statement also said several militants, including a commander, were killed and
others were wounded or captured.
</P>
<P>
	   The confrontation has been the worst between the Lebanese army and an armed
Lebanese faction since the end of the 1975-90 civil war and the dismantling of
the armed militias that ruled Lebanon then. It also was the first major clash
between the mixed Christian-Muslim Lebanese army and Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the first attacks Friday, the army thrust tanks, armored
personnel carriers and about 3,000 troops into the northern region to try to
flush out the gunmen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Peres: Israel, Syria Agree on a Lot  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and Syria already agree on most major issues, the
last Israeli prime minister to negotiate with Syria said Monday, but the Syrian
president's stubborn refusal to meet with Israeli leaders could yet stymy a
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israeli and Syrian leaders meeting near Washington for the first time
since peace talks broke off in 1996, Shimon Peres reflected on his own
frustrations in trying to reach a deal with Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Syrians will bring with them a little bit more flexibility than the
previous occasions, then we can estimate'' an early resolution, Peres told The
Associated Press in an interview at his office in Israel's parliament. ``If they
will repeat the same stubbornness, it will be a long time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peres said Assad told interlocutors early in 1996 that he wanted to clinch a
deal before elections later that year -- apparently out of concern that Peres
would be defeated by hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
	   Peres said he refused unless the two leaders met at a summit. ``You cannot
negotiate by proxy, it's slow-moving,'' Peres said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad told then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that he could not
commit to a meeting with Peres. ``A girl without a date is like a date without a
girl,'' Peres told Christopher when he received the message.
</P>
<P>
	   Netanyahu won the elections and froze the process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was a missed opportunity for peace,'' said Peres, who had a sculpture
of two doves perched on a nearby table. ``I think we could have made peace a
long time ago and saved a great deal of life and resources and money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who ousted Netanyahu in May elections, heads the
Israeli team meeting in Shepherdstown, W.Va., while the Syrian team is led by
Assad's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa. Barak's opposition has needled the
Israeli leader for meeting with an officials of lesser rank.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One change that should come is that Assad should come and meet with Mr.
Barak,'' said Peres, the regional development minister notably left off Barak's
team.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Peres said he was more optimistic now, believing that Assad now
realizes the sides must reach an agreement quickly, before the end of President
Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides have already agreed on the major issue, Peres said: a return of
territory in exchange for a full peace. But in any process, he warned, the
secondary issues could still trip up negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The nature of small-size issues and medium-size issues is more complicated
than large issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peres said the greatest stumbling block is borders.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has demanded that Israel return all the territory it controlled on
June 4, 1967, the outbreak of the Mideast War, which ended when Israel captured
the Golan Heights. Israel reportedly wants to return almost all of the strategic
plateau -- but insists on observing the 1923 border drawn by British and French
colonial powers, which would leave it controlling the eastern coast of the Sea
of Galilee, as well as precious water resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Peres would not confirm Israel's demand that Syria accede to the 1923 line,
but said: ``I see no reason why Israel should give Syria more than she had
before her independence'' in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad also reportedly is wary of Israel's demand for full diplomatic
relations, fearing that open borders and trade would loosen his iron grip on
power.
</P>
<P>
	   Peres said Assad need not worry about a sudden influx of Western goods and
ideas, saying commerce was less crucial than cooperation,
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the infrastructure on the regional level that counts, the water and
the electricity should be handled regionally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There are also differences on security arrangements -- Israel wants to keep
an early warning system on the heights, while the Syrians hope to persuade
Israel to rely on satellite surveillance -- but Peres said those issues were
``easily'' solvable.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has promised to bring an agreement with Syria to the public in a
national referendum. Peres hopes that Israelis will begin to see an accord of
Syria as part of a new, friendlier Middle East, a ``liberation from fear.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The young generation of Syrians and Israelis will join the young
generations all over the world who gave up hatred,'' he said. ``It's really like
being half blind and opening your eyes and seeing new horizons and new
potentials.''

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was gaining strength
and could be released this week from a hospital where he has been treated for
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Trudeau, 80, was admitted on New Year's Eve to the Royal Victoria Hospital
with complications from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He continues to respond well to the treatment,'' hospital spokeswoman
Gillian Ross MacCormack said Monday. ``They are still hoping he can be released
later this week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital officials said the pneumonia was never life-threatening, and that
Trudeau had been up and walking despite receiving intravenous antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   Trudeau spent the Christmas holiday with his ex-wife, Margaret, and the
couple's two sons. According to his ex-wife, Trudeau had the flu at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Trudeau was prime minister from 1968 to 1984 except for a nine-month period
when he was out of office. He was recently named newsmaker of the century in a
Canadian Press poll of editors and broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> US Declines To Criticize India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite its strong opposition to making concessions to
hijackers, the State Department on Monday declined to criticize India's decision
to release three Muslim prisoners to secure freedom for 155 passengers who were
held captive aboard an Indian Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States cannot second-guess or judge how the Indian government
handled the hijacking,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This incident presented very difficult decisions for the Indian
government. Obviously they weighed all the options after days of negotiations
and rigorous domestic debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. position was outlined by a department official who under the ground
rules could not be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, U.S. policy on terrorist actions is to make no concessions to the
perpetrators or to make deals with them.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian Airlines hijacking ended Friday at the airport in Kandahar,
Afghanistan, eight days after it began during a flight from Nepal to New Delhi.
India won freedom for the hostages by agreeing to release three prominent Muslim
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Delhi on Monday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged the United
States and other world powers to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. He said
India had enough evidence to prove Pakistani complicity in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Vajpayee's statement, the State Department said that in order
for a state to be designated a terrorist state, the secretary of state must
determine that its government has repeatedly provided support for acts of
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``has not made such a determination
with respect to Pakistan. However, the list of state sponsors of terrorism is
under continuous review,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Shepherdstown, W. Va., where Israeli and Syrian officials are attending
peace talks, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said there are
conflicting reports about who was responsible for the hijacking and where the
hijackers are.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan has told us that it will meet its obligations under the
international convention to apprehend the hijackers and bring them to justice.
We do not know where the hijackers have gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think they must be brought to justice to remind all countries of their
international obligations associated with the convention on hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers left Kandahar in a vehicle and were accompanied by the three
former prisoners. They had been given 10 hours by Afghan authorities to leave
the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israel and Syria
together Monday for the second time in less than a month, seizing a ``historic
opportunity'' to end half a century of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests in Syria served as a stark reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face. And U.S. officials downplayed expectations the antagonists would
reach an agreement on major issues during this round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Before sitting down first with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the president strolled with them
across a 200-foot long pedestrian bridge that spanned a dry creek.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-way meeting was planned for later in the day at the semi-secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the issues they will discuss are security -- a major concern for
Israel -- sharing of precious water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal
from the strategic Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character
of peace between the two Mideast neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin said, ``There's real seriousness'' on
both sides, but ``we don't expect to be able to achieve a core agreement'' in
one round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``The president understands we have
an historic opportunity here'' and that the United States ``can act as a
facilitator, as an honest broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the talks began Monday, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day
to day. At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria said they want to see the other side show its
earnestness about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources close to the Syrian delegation as well as Syria's newspapers, which
reflect government thinking, said Damascus views the negotiations as a test of
Israel's intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syrian
President Hafez Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date
for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20,
said Nabil Shaath, planning minister of Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Shaath
said Clinton and Arafat will review implementation of a U.S.-brokered interim
agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinians at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in
September.

<HEADLINE> T-Bill Interest Rates Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in
Monday's first auction of the New Year to the highest level in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $8.02 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 5.360 percent, up from 5.300 percent last week. An additional
$7.01 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.585 percent, up from
5.505 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the highest since Dec. 20, when the bills sold for
5.400 percent. The six-month rate was also the highest since Dec. 20 when the
rate was 5.600.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.525
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,864.50 and
5.844 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,717.60.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in
adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 5.95 percent last week from 5.97 percent the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 139; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The first day of trading on Wall Street in the year 2000
looked very much like a typical session of 1999. Soaring bond yields held most
stocks lower, but technology investors weathered a volatile market and scooped
up shares of their favorite companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.61 to close at 11,357.51.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell,
but the Nasdaq composite rebounded from a loss of as much as 79 points to finish
higher. The Nasdaq's gain brought it to a new closing record, launching the
technology-dominated index into 2000 in the same fashion it wrapped up 1999. It
rose to rose 61.49 to 4,130.80 today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 14.08 to 1,455.17.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 2,143 down, 1,111 up and 291 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 921.34 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 372.60 million
at the close of Friday's shortened session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.70 to 497.05.
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for scattered
profit-taking today.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors had held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital
gains taxes. The start of the new year means that investors who sell stocks now
won't pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied as trading began without any Y2K problems in the
first session of 2000. But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the
bond market, which tumbled as investors bet that the Fed will return to a policy
of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times last year in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure a stable monetary system into the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's strength today, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row. Many economists
had expected the indexes to rise more sharply, but the moderate increases
rattled investors nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   "The figures were not sufficiently restrained to suggest that the Fed may
remain on hold," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the 30-year bond as high as 6.61 percent, up
from 6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Bond yields are now at the highest
levels since Sept. 11, 1997, when long-term yields closed at 6.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting an appealing alternative to
volatile stock investing.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled, inclduing American Express and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks again performed better than the broader market. CMGI,
which invests in young Internet companies, and JDS Uniphase rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Amgen rose after PaineWebber's chief investment strategist Ed Kerschner
added the company to a list of highlighted stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Technology stocks are truly a mania on Wall Street," Meehan said. "I don't
see that changing any time soon."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have fared worse had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But after a weekend of
testing, many of the markets that opened for trading today ran smoothly.
</P>
<P>
	   Several major stock markets remained closed, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   France's CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent and Germany's Xetra DAX tumbled 3.0
percent.

<HEADLINE> Y2K causes few problems for companies, consumers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Y2K disaster that wasn't left some people
with still-unused generators and a few extra gallons of bottled water, but that
was about the extent of Y2K's effects in Connecticut.
<P>
	   Companies reported few Y2K glitches as their employees returned to their
jobs Monday for the start of the work week and the first major test of their
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Things were so Y2K-quiet that the state's Emergency Operations Center called
off its scheduled morning news conference because there were no emergencies to
report, and shut down completely after an afternoon news briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   The state reported just three minor Y2K-related problems:
</P>
<P>
	   -A date in a computer system at the UConn Health Center improperly printed
the year as "20" instead of "00." The hospital said the problem was caught and
fixed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   -A highway radio advisory system in Bridgeport was not saving recordings
because an internal clock read "1900." A software patch was expected to be in
place by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   -The Department of Revenue Service was blocked from accessing a
900-telephone service used to support research and analysis because of a Y2K
glitch. Southern New England Telephone planned to reset the system to unblock
access to the 900 numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   But no major problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had absolutely no problems ... everything is running very smoothly,"
said United Technologies Corp. spokesman Peter Dalpe.
</P>
<P>
	   Xerox Corp. said it had not had any significant Y2K problems, only a few
cases where an incorrect date was printed on reports. The glitch, which was
quickly corrected, did not affect the data in the reports.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of our worldwide systems are open and we have not detected a Y2K bug
that has affected any of our operations," said Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna said it had no problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "All systems so far are operating the way they are supposed to," said
spokesman Fred LaBerge.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey of 52 small companies in Connecticut and New York showed only three
reporting Y2K snags.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone survey, conducted Monday by LeBlanc Communications Group Inc.,
a Norwalk-based computer and telephone systems consulting firm, covered a
variety of its clients, including accounting firms, law offices, insurance
agencies, publishers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was almost universal - Y2-OK," said Michael LeBlanc, president and chief
executive of the consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies reporting problems said the calendar function on their
computers would not show the Year 2000 date, but instead showed the dates 1980
or 1900.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardware and grocery stores reported only a handful of returns on popular
Y2K items such as generators, kerosene lamps, flashlights, batteries and bottled
water.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't heard a peep," said Don Hrenko, of Mickey Finn's Honda in
Berlin, a company that had brisk sales of portable generators just before the
new year.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the same story at Karp's hardware store in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
	   "We joked to ourselves that someone is probably going to bring back a box of
batteries, but no one has," said store manager Dave Hoskins.
</P>
<P>
	   At Keough's Turn of River Hardware in Stamford, one customer attempted to
return a kerosene heater, but she was turned down because the company had posted
signs notifying customers of its no-returns policy on Y2K items.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told them if that's all you're buying it for, I wouldn't recommend it
because we're not allowing returns," said Keough.
</P>
<P>
	   At The Home Depot, only one or two customers throughout the chain's 900
stores returned Y2K items such as kerosene heaters and gasoline cans.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman John Simley said the Atlanta-based company counseled customers
against buying big-ticket items solely for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did not want to scare people into buying something they probably didn't
need," Simley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several grocery store managers said they had not had any customers attempt
to return Y2K items.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the Wethersfield Stop &AMP; Shop Supermarket, quite a few customers
brought bottled water back over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had one woman who brought back 10 jugs of water she had bought as an
emergency supply," said Valerie Fox, who runs the store's service desk. The
market accepted the returns - no questions asked.

<HEADLINE> Bush and Forbes file petitions to get on New York primary ballot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes filed petitions Monday to secure spots on New
York's March 7 presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of Sen. John McCain's New York effort said the Arizona
Republican would probably qualify presidential delegate slates through the
petition process in a majority, but not all of the state's 31 congressional
districts. McCain is simultaneously pursuing a federal lawsuit aimed at getting
his prospective convention delegates on the ballot throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Forbes met for more than an hour in New York City with leaders
of the state's tiny but politically influential Conservative Party, courting
their support.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley said Monday
that their petitions would be filed later this week to secure spots on the March
7 Democratic presidential primary ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said the Bush
camp filed 19 volumes worth of signatures Monday aimed at securing a New York
ballot spot for the Texas governor and GOP front-runner. Bush has the backing in
New York of Gov. George Pataki and most of the rest of the state's top
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to state GOP Chairman William Powers, a major Bush backer, said the
Texas governor's New York petitions contained the signatures of almost 90,000
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such overwhelming support proves that his vision for America has clearly
struck a cord with the families of New York," U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, a member
of Bush's Congressional Steering Committee and a former top aide to both Pataki
and Powers, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' campaign chief, Bill Dal Col, said Forbes' petitions contained about
50,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   The petitions are subject to challenge by rival candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Republicans need the signatures of 15,410 party members, properly
distributed across the state, to get their delegate slates on the ballot
everywhere. Only Bush, Forbes and McCain decided to contest New York's GOP
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's ballot access rules are notoriously demanding, especially for
candidates without the backing of party bosses. In 1996, with the state GOP
behind Bob Dole, Forbes had to spend $1 million and get help from the federal
courts to get on the ballot all across the state. In the end, Dole ended up
winning all the convention delegates at stake in the New York primary. This
year, Forbes spent about $750,000 on his petition effort.
</P>
<P>
	   In effect, New York has 31 separate GOP presidential primaries, one in each
of the state's congressional districts. Candidates must collect the signatures
of 1,000 party members or 0.5 percent of enrolled party members in each district
where they want to field delegate slates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll get on in the majority of the districts ... I wouldn't be surprised
if we hit 20" of the 31, said Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head
of McCain's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said the McCain forces would also press ahead with their federal
court lawsuit seeking to further open the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much unfairness in the system," said Molinari, a former
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   The ballot access rules were eased somewhat by Pataki and the state
Legislature in the wake of the 1996 election which drew heavy criticism of the
governor. Nonetheless, candidates must still collect thousands of signatures
statewide in about six weeks as part of what The New York Times called "a
corrupt system that is a national embarrassment" in a Monday editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday was the first day that candidates could legally file their petitions
for ballot spots. The last day for filing the petitions is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Bush camp was touting its ballot petition prowess and the McCain
forces were grumbling, Forbes met at a Manhattan hotel with leaders of the state
Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's clearly not backing out of the race," state Conservative party
Chairman Michael Long said after the meeting. "It was a good session."
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lot of great give-and-take," Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long and top party leaders have also met with Bush and expect to meet with
McCain. The Conservative Party won't select its presidential candidate until
September. Unlike most other states, major party candidates in New York can run
with third-party backing. The votes on each ballot line are then combined.

<HEADLINE> KCPL Board Drops Merger Agreement  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID MILES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. has abandoned its
proposed $1.4 billion acquisition by Western Resources, nearly three years after
the companies announced plans to combine.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas City Power's board voted at an emergency meeting Sunday to terminate
the agreement, which was originally worth $2.1 billion but has since declined in
value because of Western Resources' plummeting stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   KCPL and Western first announced an agreement on a merger in February 1997
but later revised it. Western's stock closed at $43.13 per share on March 18,
1998, when the revised deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, shares of Western were trading at $16.50, down 43 3/4 cents on
the New York Stock Exchange, down more than 60 percent from the revised deal.
Kansas City Power shares were up 37 1/2 cents to $22.43 3/4, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   Western Resources, based in Topeka, said it was disappointed that the deal
had been terminated.
</P>
<P>
	   Drue Jennings, Kansas City Power's chief executive, cited problems with
Western's Protection One security subsidiary as a key factor in terminating the
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Western assumed a sizable debt when it acquired Protection One, the nation's
second biggest home security provider, and the business has not been profitable
for Western.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the agreement, Kansas City Power shareholders would have
traded their shares for Western stock. The pact allowed either party to
terminate the merger if it was not consummated on or before Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both sides worked hard to bring this transaction to a successful
completion, and we obviously regret the events that have required us to take
this action," Jennings wrote in a letter to David Wittig, chief executive of
Western Resources.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate statement, Wittig said merging the electric operations of the
two companies "made good business sense for a variety of reasons, but it simply
took too long to complete the process."
</P>
<P>
	   The merger would have given Western about 1 million electricity customers in
Kansas and Missouri, supplying them through three operating companies -- KCPL,
Kansas Gas and Electric Co. and Kansas Power and Light Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Western Resources, with about 2 million energy customers, was created by the
merger of KGE and KPL in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Pataki says STAR tax rebates should go straight to taxpayers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Homeowners should get their School Tax Relief rebate
checks directly from the state instead of through the school districts to show
them how local officials are eating up the tax break, Gov. George Pataki said
Monday.
<P>
	   The STAR checks currently go to school districts, who then pass the savings
on to taxpayers. But Pataki said some of those school districts are raising
their own spending and hiding it by capitalizing on the rebate checks, making
taxpayers' rebates less than they would otherwise be.
</P>
<P>
	   By sending the whole rebate check directly to homeowners, local officials
will not be able to hide their local increases, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are removing local school districts as 'middlemen' in the delivery
process and not longer permitting them to use growing STAR savings to mask
excessive spending increases," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Kremer, executive director of the New York School Board Association,
reacted angrily, saying Pataki was accusing school districts of basically
skimming money off the top of taxpayers' relief checks. "We believe the governor
defamed 5,000 school board members," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While it makes no technical difference whether the check goes to the
taxpayer or the district, Kremer said Pataki's plan makes school board members
look like criminals for trying to keep up with the rising costs of New York
educational standards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that school districts or school boards, which I represent,
have done anything wrong or anything inappropriate," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor will try to convince the Legislature to divert the checks away
from the school districts in his State of the State speech on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would expect broad-based support," Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kremer said his organization would oppose Pataki's proposal. "It's his
method we oppose," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Lynch, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any proposal that gets money back in taxpayers' pockets is a good thing,"
John McArdle, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   The STAR program lowers property taxes by dropping the assessed value of
owner-occupied homes. The program provides state money to school districts to
make up for local property tax revenues that are lost.
</P>
<P>
	   STAR makes senior citizens eligible for an eventual average 45 percent
reduction in their school property tax bills while other property owners are
eligible for a 27 percent average reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   When fully implemented in 2001-02, senior citizens with household incomes of
less than $60,000 a year will get a $50,000 tax exemption under the STAR plan
while all other homeowners will receive a $30,000 exemption.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Pataki's plan, schools would be required to bill the entire tax amount
to non-senior taxpayers, which would show any tax increase. He also wants a cap
on local school budget increases - which previously has been rejected by the
Legislature. The last prong of his plan would force school districts to tell
voters how their proposed school budgets would affect their STAR savings and how
the proposed budget compares with the maximum contingency budget should voters
reject the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not only preserving STAR benefits, we are taking important steps to
keep property taxes down for every homeowner in New York state," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases school districts got last year were going to be needed whether
STAR had been passed by the state Legislature or not, Kremer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki plans on trying to add an additional $800 million for STAR in his
budget for this year, which will bring the tax exemption up to more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors making less than $60,000 already are getting their full $50,000 tax
exemption from the value of their homes. Non-senior homeowners will be eligible
for a $20,000 exemption this year, which will grow to $30,000 next year.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli: Hillary Clinton will have all the money she needs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The head of the national Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee pledged Monday to spend "whatever is required to win" to help
Hillary Rodham Clinton capture a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
<P>
	   "This race is not going to be lost for financial resources. Indeed, it is
not going to be lost at all," Sen. Robert Torricelli, a major booster of the
first lady's expected Senate campaign, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "Between the DSCC and Hillary Clinton's own campaign efforts, spending will
reach the maximum levels that are effective," Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator from New Jersey refused to say how much the DSCC might spend in
New York but said the committee's report to the Federal Election Commission due
at the end of this month would show it has more than $9 million on hand going
into the election year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary Clinton is entitled to a portion of that money," Torricelli said.
The first lady has been aggressively raising money for the DSCC in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the national Senate campaign committee said that Mrs. Clinton
also is raising record amounts of money on her own for her race but he refused
to provide specific figures. Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff has also refused to
divulge how much she has raised over the past six months, saying that
information will be made public at the end of this month when she files her
first campaign finance report with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   While both Mrs. Clinton and her expected Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, have refused to say how much they have raised in the
past six months, aides to both told The New York Times last week that they have
each topped the $6.6 million mark. That is how much former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
raised in 1997, the year before he lost his Senate seat from New York to
Democrat Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani campaign aide Bruce Teitelbaum said Monday that Torricelli's
comments came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fully expect the Clinton campaign will raise more money than we will ...
We expect it, we're prepared for it and we will obviously raise sufficient funds
to run a competitive and winning campaign," the Giuliani adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign finance team has vowed to raise at least $25 million
for the race while Giuliani has said he expects to raise about $20 million. That
could make it the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York and New Jersey must both be won to get the 51 Democratic United
States senators" the party needs to take back control of the Senate, Torricelli
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the New York Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported that
Giuliani was considering delivering a major speech on the need for campaign
finance reform in which he would call on the state and national GOP to refrain
from spending "soft money" to help his candidacy. Teitelbaum said Monday that he
could not confirm that and that the mayor has, thus far, not ruled out the use
of soft money. Mrs. Clinton has said she wouldn't mind seeing soft-money
spending kept out of the campaign but only if both sides agree.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has already benefitted from unlimited soft-money donations to
the DSCC. It supplied several hundred thousand dollars of such funds late last
year to finance television ads in upstate New York promoting her. Giuliani has
run campaign ads in the region as well but paid for them out of his own campaign
coffers.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins for second Louima trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of potential jurors showed up at Brooklyn
federal court Monday for the second trial stemming from the 1997 police assault
on Abner Louima, a prisoner handcuffed and tortured in a station bathroom.
<P>
	   Jury selection in the high-profile brutality case could take a month.
Opening statements are tentatively set for Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil right activists say the trial will further expose the so-called "blue
wall of silence" - a supposed code among officers never to "rat" on each other.
Defense attorneys, meanwhile, hope to prove that Officer Charles Schwarz was
wrongly convicted in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that flamed tensions between police and minorities and sparked
social unrest, Schwarz was convicted last year of violating Louima's civil
rights by holding him down on the 70th Precinct bathroom floor while another
white officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized the Haitian immigrant with a broken
broomstick. Volpe pleaded guilty, and has since claimed that the other officer
in the bathroom that night was Officer Thomas Wiese, not Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 35; Wiese, 37; and Officer Thomas Bruder, 34, now stand accused of
obstructing justice by concocting a story to protect Schwarz. If convicted, they
each face a maximum five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining other activists outside the courthouse Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton
told reporters, "What Justin Volpe did could not have been done without an
active cover-up in the 70th Precinct. ... So to us, this is just as important as
the first trial."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's wife, Andra, said she expects the new trial to vindicate her
husband, who has been in federal custody since his conviction in June. "We hope
the truth is going to come out," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first trial, all three defendants were cleared of charges they beat
Louima while taking him by patrol car to the stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruder and Schwarz "are looking forward to being acquitted a second time,"
Bruder's attorney, Stuart London, said following a brief pre-trial hearing on
Monday. Both London and Wiese's attorney, Joseph Tacopina, said their clients
still contend Schwarz was never in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors declined comment to the media on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 500 people filled out 47-page questionnaires, the first phase of a
jury selection process designed to screen out candidates tainted by pretrial
publicity. U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson plans to begin questioning
finalists in his courtroom on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The questionnaire was approved by Nickerson after consulting with attorneys
for both sides. Potential jurors were asked whether they think police
discriminate against minorities, what "blue wall of silence" means, if it's
wrong to second-guess officers and whether they have heard or read any media
accounts about Schwarz's role in the attack on Louima.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison. The former patrolman
had admitted ramming the stick up Louima's rectum in a blind rage, thinking -
mistakenly - that his prisoner had sucker-punched him outside a Brooklyn
nightclub. Prosecutors said Louima's cousin actually punched the officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Volpe and Louima are expected to testify at the second trial.

year 2000 looked very much like a typical session of 1999. Soaring
bond yields held most stocks lower, but technology investors

	   Cost of Raw Materials Is Rising
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. manufacturers say the cost of raw materials
is rising as the nation's economy closes in on a record for the
longest expansion ever. The renewed inflation jitters rattled
financial markets, with blue-chip stocks tumbling from record highs
and bond yields rising to the highest level in more than two years.
Today's report from the National Association of Purchasing
Management heightened the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates in the weeks ahead to cool the economy and
dampen inflationary pressures, economists said. The group said its
index, based on a national survey of executives who buy raw
materials and other supplies for industry, registered 55.5 percent
in December, down from 56.2 percent in November and below analysts'
expectations. Readings over 50 indicate expansion.

	   Business As Usual for USA in Y2K
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Main Street to Wall Street, Americans
returned to work, logged onto their computers, checked their e-mail
and found that whatever Y2K bug there may have been had largely
crept back from whence it came. Ironically, one of the few spots
infected by the bug was the campaign Wide World Web site of Vice
President Al Gore, who last year once claimed to have invented the
Internet. His ``Internet Town Hall'' Web site touting his
presidential candidacy carried the date ``Monday, January 3,
19100.'' The site was corrected later in the day. Otherwise, aside
from a few minor irritations, most Americans appeared to be
relatively unaffected by the once-dreaded bug. Businesses and
government offices reopened with few computer problems.
</P>
<P>
	   World Back at Work With Few Delays
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first major business day of the millennium
opened with few signs of Y2K computer glitches. Those returning to
work today found energy supplies and corporate computer systems
operating smoothly. The U.S. banking system was ``running
smoothly'' this morning, said the U.S. Federal Reserve. '' Not that
the Y2K bug was nowhere to be seen: Glitches hit government
computers in Hong Kong and mainland China. Police testing the
sobriety of drivers in Hong Kong had to enter birth dates on
breath-testing machine because of an apparent Y2K malfunction.
Courthouse computers in Italy mixed up prisoner dates by 100 years.
A few ATM machines shut down. But there were no reports of
calamitous failures some feared -- and stock markets responded.
</P>
<P>
	   How Y2K Scare Helped Businesses
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Keeping its planes airborne and punctual at the
start of the new year was satisfaction enough for Virgin Atlantic
Airways, which spent $20 million to inoculate its computers against
the millennium bug. But the airline also got an unexpected payoff
for fixing its Y2K problem: The speedy replacement of its piecemeal
computer system with a streamlined and more efficient network.
Virgin Atlantic is not alone. The Y2K scare compelled phone
companies, banks, manufacturers and other businesses around the
world to make their corporate nervous systems more efficient and
cheaper to run.
</P>
<P>
	   European Stocks Close Lower
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- European stock markets opened the new year
bullishly today but key exchanges finished the first trading day of
2000 with losses. Traders in Milan said there was concern that U.S.
interest rate hikes were inevitable, since the Y2K bug did no

<HEADLINE> Rockets Hit Russia Embassy in Beirut  </HEADLINE>
   By HUSSEIN DAKROUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Assailants protesting Russia's crackdown on Chechnya
fired rocket-propelled grenades Monday at the Russian Embassy in Beirut, killing
a policeman. Troops killed one attacker during a manhunt.
</P>
<P>
	   No Russian casualties were reported at the embassy, located along the busy
Corniche Mazraa thoroughfare, but political attache Andrey Avdeev said the
building's consular area was damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Mazraa area is
in the Muslim sector of Beirut, where extremists are sympathetic to fellow
Muslims in Chechnya. Lebanese Muslim militants opposed to Russia's military
campaign in the breakaway republic have staged protests and have been raising
money for the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   Police sources confirmed, on condition of anonymity, reports that the dead
assailant was carrying a statement indicating the attack was motivated by anger
with Russian military actions in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run television reported the paper said: ``In sacrifice for Chechnya.''
A private radio station, Voice of Free Lebanon, said the paper found on Kharroub
was addressed ``The Call of Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese army troops and police in armored personnel carriers and trucks
fanned out in the area shortly after the midday attack, which shattered windows
and left the compound pocked with shrapnel and bullet marks. The windshield of
an embassy car was shattered.
</P>
<P>
	   The assailants launched four grenades and fired assault rifles at the
embassy from a nearby building. Security forces stormed the building and killed
one of the attackers, police said. Several passers-by were injured in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   Troops sealed off neighboring buildings and streets and searched for at
least two assailants who fled under heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the most serious attack on a foreign diplomatic mission in Lebanon
since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war, during which foreign nationals and
embassies as well as ordinary Lebanese were targets of armed factions.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Russian Foreign Ministry gave no immediate comment on the
attack. The Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying only that
``details of the occurrence are being clarified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Shepherdstown, W.Va., where Israel and Syria were resuming peace talks,
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin condemned the attack on the embassy,
calling it a ``cowardly act of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police identified the dead suspect as Ahmed Raja Abou Kharroub, a
30-year-old Palestinian resident of Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest Palestinian
refugee camp. Ein el-Hilweh, located outside the port city of Sidon, 30 miles
south of Beirut, is a camp of 75,000 controlled by rival Palestinian factions,
including radical groups and the PLO's mainstream Fatah group.
</P>
<P>
	   Police did not say whether Abou Kharroub was known to be affiliated with any
particular group.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Monday night, assailants threw a small explosive at an army checkpoint
on the edge of the Ein el-Hilweh camp, causing no casualties or damage, Lebanese
security officials said. It was not clear if the bomb was meant to avenge Abou
Kharroub's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops launched a military offensive in September to wrest control
of the rebel republic of Chechnya after Chechen-based militants invaded a
neighboring region and were blamed for bombings elsewhere in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Spat Knocks Fox Off Cox Cable  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- With the NFL playoffs looming, about 400,000 cable
subscribers have lost their connection to Fox channels because of disputes
between two media giants.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflict has already caused sports fans in Texas to miss the Cotton Bowl
and a Dallas Cowboys game and was likely to frustrate "Ally McBeal" followers
Monday night in that region as well as in Northern Virginia and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox refused to let several Cox Communications systems retransmit its
programming after Cox declined to add two other Fox networks as it upgrades to
digital systems that carry more channels. Without Fox's permission to carry the
stations, Cox had to drop them by midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar deadlines could soon knock Fox off Cox systems in Phoenix and Orange
County, Calif., a Cox spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each company claims to be looking out for its customers' interest. But the
cable company could suffer more, especially now that customers can switch to
satellite-dish TV reception without losing local channels, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an invitation for (satellite companies) to come in and advertise in
those markets," said Jessica Reif-Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
"Obviously, one of them will have to back down."
</P>
<P>
	   "This speaks to control -- the cable operators don't want to be told what to
do. But cable is vulnerable to satellite in channel capacity," said Tom Eaton,
an analyst with Paine Webber. "The real winners here are the satellite TV
providers."
</P>
<P>
	   That's the attitude of some consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know who's right, and I don't care," said Chuck Hipp of Yorktown,
Va. "I'm getting ready to drop Cox cable and get a satellite dish."
</P>
<P>
	   Cable companies do not pay to retransmit the signals of TV-network stations,
analysts say. But the networks have pressured cable operators to run their
specialty channels, such as ABC's ESPN and NBC's MSNBC, in exchange for
retransmitting the signals of network stations.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current flap, Fox asked Cox to carry FXM, a Fox movie channel, and
Fox Sports World on all of its digital networks in exchange for carrying the
local Fox affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see digital TV giving customers the power of choice," said Fox spokesman
Tom Tyrer. "Cox disagrees, and they've cut their customers off from these
popular local stations in order to prove it."
</P>
<P>
	   Cox rejected the Fox demand to carry the two Fox stations on among its
digital offerings, saying such decisions should be left to local programming
managers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't be held hostage by Fox Corporation's greed," said Cox spokeswoman
Ellen East.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the affected Cox subscribers, about 260,000, are in Northern
Virginia, while nearly 90,000 are spread across Texas and about 72,000 are in
Cleveland's western suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Cox replaced the Fox channels with movies. The company's subscribers would
have to disconnect their cable or hook up a signal-splitter to continue
receiving the Fox channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Fox could be counting on the popularity of its NFL playoff
coverage to make Cox cry uncle -- both the Washington Redskins and Cowboys are
in the playoffs and in affected areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Cox asked for a 90-day extension on its right to retransmit Fox signals --
putting off a showdown until after football season -- but Fox said no.
</P>
<P>
	   "They wanted to put us in this tough spot," said Ms. East, who conceded that
the cable-company has heard from irate subscribers. "I think it shows very
little regard for their viewers."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, separate Fox-Cox disputes have led the cable company to drop Fox
affiliates in Memphis, Tenn., and Portsmouth, Va., where Hipp, the 35-year-old
Virginia man who is thinking about buying a satellite dish, used to watch WVBT.
The station wanted a lower number than its current 43 on the cable lineup, but
Cox said no.
</P>
<P>
	   New York-based Fox Entertainment Group, 82 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp., produces TV shows and movies and owns the Fox network and 22 TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta-based Cox is one of the nation's largest cable companies, with 6
million subscribers. It also owns nearly 25 percent of Discovery Communications
and about 10 percent of the E! Entertainment Network.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc. has sold its workers' compensation and
Medicare supplemental businesses in an effort to help the struggling health
maintenance organization focus on its core business and reduce debt, the company
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana said it expects to take up to a $500 million charge in the fourth
quarter of 1999 because of the deals, and because some of its acquisitions are
now worth less than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana is selling its PCA Property &AMP; Casualty Insurance Co. to FolksAmerica
Holding Co. of New York for $125 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana is selling its individual Medicare supplemental business to United
Teachers Associates Insurance Co., of Austin, Texas. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed. The Medicare supplemental product currently serves 42,000 members in
17 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Humana said it will take a pretax loss on the sale of PCA of about $65
million. Humana bought PCA P&AMP;C in 1997 as part of its acquisition of Physician
Corp. of America.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Qwest Makes Jump to NYSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Qwest Communications International Inc. jumped from the
Nasdaq stock market to the New York Stock Exchange on Monday in a move aimed at
attracting global investors and lowering the volatility of the company's stock
price.
</P>
<P>
	   Qwest, which specializes in broadband Internet and telecommunications
systems, opened trading on the Big Board under the symbol Q.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Qwest fell 87 1/2 cents to $42.12 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on
the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   "The New York Stock Exchange is considered by many the premier exchange in
the U.S., if not the world," said Tom Friedberg, senior research analyst at
Janco Partners Inc. in Denver. "The fact that you can get a single-letter symbol
also gives the impression the stock is bullish."
</P>
<P>
	   With the addition of Qwest, the only single-letter symbols remaining are I,
M and V.
</P>
<P>
	   Qwest chairman and CEO Joseph Nacchio capped a morning ceremony that
featured a laser-light show by ringing the opening bell to start the first
trading day of 2000. His father, Frank Nacchio, bought the first 100 shares of
Qwest under its new symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were really happy with the Nasdaq. It's not that we were unhappy with
the Nasdaq," Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach said. "We're a global company. The
NYSE is more of a global exchange. We wanted more access to global investors in
all markets."
</P>
<P>
	   Since going public in 1997, Qwest has become a major player in the
telecommunications and Internet broadband industry, and is the fourth-largest
long-distance provider in the United States. In 1998, it had $2.24 billion in
revenue.

<HEADLINE> US Electric System Passing Y2K Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Y2K-related computer malfunction at the Oak Ridge
nuclear weapons plant in Tennessee caused no operational problems and was
corrected within hours, federal officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   John Gilligan, the DOE's top computer expert, said the problem experienced
during the rollover into the new year involved a computer that tracks nuclear
material as to its weight and type. He said the actual accounting of material
was not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory initially declined to provide
details of the malfunction, first reported Sunday, because it involved
classified activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilligan said the Oak Ridge incident was the only Y2K problem affecting
``mission critical'' systems at Energy Department facilities nationwide during
the New Year's rollover, although there were ``about a dozen'' minor glitches
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the failures ``tended to be minor and easily fixed,'' he told
reporters. He said there are about 200,000 computer systems at DOE facilities
including the three weapons labs. The Oak Ridge facility has 260 systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge makes warhead components for the MX missile
system and is the primary uranium storage site for the nation's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the $5 billion spent on Y2K
in the energy sector was well worth it and will pay dividends that will reduce
the likelihood of future power outages or oil disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would have been a disaster to assume a wait-and-see attitude,'' he said
of the extensive preparation for the Y2K transition. Only a handful of minor
glitches were reported by the broad civilian energy sector during the rollover,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the government's and energy industry's scrutiny and its
updating computer systems ``we now have better communications and better
monitoring'' and preparedness, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Energy Department spent about $235 million on Y2K including
computer fixes at its nuclear weapons facilities and research labs.

<HEADLINE> Walgreen 1Q Earnings Up 23 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- First-quarter earnings at drugstore chain Walgreen
Co. jumped 23 percent due to soaring prescription sales, meeting analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings for the three months ended Nov. 30 were $127.8 billion, or 13 cents
per share, up 23 percent from $104 billion, or 10 cents per share, for the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That matched the estimate of 13 cents per share by analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong performance comes with Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore
chain, in the midst of rapid expansion. The Deerfield-based company said it
opened 94 stores in the first quarter of its 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the first quarter rose 20 percent to a record $4.82 billion, up
from $4.02 billion in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Walgreen dropped 68 3/4 cents to $28.56 1/4 in trading at 5:15
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, however, following other stocks lower as
the market was hurt by fears of an interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief executive officer L. Daniel Jorndt attributed the company's quarterly
showing to strong pharmacy and general merchandise sales and good expense
control.
</P>
<P>
	   "Expenses as a percent to sales continue to fall as they're spread over a
larger store base," he said. "Most important is our ability to pay as we go for
the greatest expansion in our 99-year history while continuing to post record
earnings."
</P>
<P>
	   The company operates some 2,900 drugstores in 40 states and Puerto Rico. It
said it will top the 3,000-store mark this spring.

<HEADLINE> Parcells resigns as Jets coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) - The man in the glass told Bill Parcells it's
time. His illustrious NFL coaching career is over.
<P>
	   Citing an inability to totally devote himself to what has become a 365-day
job, Parcells resigned Monday as coach of the New York Jets, handing the reins
to defensive coordinator Bill Belichick. Parcells will remain as the team's
chief operating officer, but will have no hand in the coaching.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill's not coming back," Parcells said. "You can write that on your
chalkboard."
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells, 58, told his players, for whom he admitted he had strong feelings,
that he could no longer make the kind of commitment the job requires. He also
read them a poem, "The Man in the Glass," which concludes:
</P>
<P>
	   "You may fool the whole world down the pathway of Life
</P>
<P>
	   And get pats on the back as you pass
</P>
<P>
	   But your final reward will be heartaches and tears
</P>
<P>
	   If you've cheated the Man in the Glass."
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells turned around three franchises, leading the New York Giants to two
Super Bowl titles and the New England Patriots to an AFC crown before joining
the Jets in 1997. He took the Jets from laughingstock to contender, going 9-7,
12-4 (losing in the conference title game) and 8-8. This season, in which the
Jets were ravaged by injuries and lost several close games early, included some
of his best work.
</P>
<P>
	   New York won seven of its last nine games and won five times against playoff
teams, including the last four games.
</P>
<P>
	   He also found a quarterback in Ray Lucas after Vinny Testaverde tore his
Achilles' tendon in the opener. After the inexperienced Lucas took over for the
ineffective Rick Mirer for good in Game 9, the Jets went 5-2.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm grateful to the players who hung in there for me this season," Parcells
said. "It was a difficult thing for a while this year. If I was burned out, this
season halfway through would've been a strong indication I was. I coached hard
right to the end. I think the players would tell you that.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ray Lucas ... everybody started to feed off him. He gave us the energy. The
players would feed off him, the coaches."
</P>
<P>
	   Lucas, a special-teamer for most of his first two-plus NFL seasons, not only
finished third in AFC passing statistics, but he erased concerns about the
position for next season if Testaverde has any setbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least I won't have to hear him tear me up every day," Lucas said,
laughing. "It's tough. When he finished talking, he walked out and we were all
sitting there like ...
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he made a decision that he couldn't go 365 days. Maybe it was his
health, or he is not able to put too much devotion to the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "My opinion was I would be shocked, but it was heartfelt when he told us. I
know it hurts him a lot."
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells said he would have been more inclined to return if the team had not
turned things around. But he likes the direction the Jets have taken, making the
timing of his resignation easier.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think one of the things I have always tried to pride myself on is that if
I did go someplace, when I left there that it was a better operation," he said.
"I feel that way now."
</P>
<P>
	   He claimed the pending sale of the team had no impact on his decision. Nor
did the fact the Patriots were interested in Belichick to replace Pete Carroll,
who was fired as coach Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But it seemed clear the entire process was speeded up significantly when New
England's interest became known. The Patriots contacted the Jets on Monday
morning about Belichick's availability and were told he had been elevated to
replace Parcells.
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells said he has no concerns about turning over coaching duties to
Belichick, who was 37-45 in five seasons with the Cleveland Browns, but is best
known for his creative defenses. Belichick was the coordinator for all of
Parcells' Super Bowl teams and worked 14 years under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick was not available Monday, saying in a statement, "My intention was
to allow this to be coach Parcells' day exclusively."
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill will be making the football decisions," said Parcells, whose career
coaching record is 149-106-1. "We have a very long-standing business
relationship. He is extremely bright, well-organized and a tireless worker. He
gained a wealth of experience from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been on the job and seen the evolution of this for three years. He's
been a part of it and has a good chance to succeed."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick is following a tough act, a man termed "a Hall of Fame coach" by
running back Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like it if I have a legacy that the players who played for me
thought I tried to win every game," Parcells said. "I'd be proud if that is my
legacy."

<HEADLINE> Manchester Planned Parenthood clinic closed after threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) - A Planned Parenthood clinic was evacuated
Monday morning after a worker opened a letter the author claimed was
contaminated with anthrax.
<P>
	   A female worker discovered the letter while opening the mail, police said.
The FBI, environmental officials and a police hazardous materials team were
called in and workers were ordered out of the building.
</P>
<P>

Though deaths are rare with appropriate treatment, the woman who opened the

	   Authorities said other clinics in the country received similar threats
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the threat was sent through the mail, the FBI was investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic threats of contamination with the potentially lethal anthrax
bacterium date back several years. The FBI said a spate of letters last year
contained a sticky substance or dark powder and the ominous warning: You've been
contaminated by anthrax.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters have been received in almost every region of the nation. They
often arrive in bunches, at 10 or 15 similar targets in a city. The targets have
been quite varied: Abortion clinics, Catholic schools, nightclubs, department
stores, hospitals, post offices, courthouses, news media offices, FBI offices
and even the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israel and Syria
together Monday for the second time in less than a month, seizing a ``historic
opportunity'' to end half a century of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests in Syria served as a stark reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face. And U.S. officials played down the possibility that the antagonists
would reach an agreement on major issues during this round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's quite unrealistically optimistic to think it can be done in this
round, but it's important to start ... the hard work of narrowing differences,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton was prepared ``to invest as many days as are appropriate and
constructive'' to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin also sought to damp expectations.
But he did not underplay the significance of the negotiations. ``This is an
historic opportunity that may not come again unless it is seized,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before sitting down first with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the president strolled with them
across a 200-foot long pedestrian bridge that spanned a dry creek.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-way meeting was planned for later in the day at the semi-secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just outside Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the issues they will discuss are security -- a major concern for
Israel -- sharing of precious water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal
from the strategic Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character
of peace between the two Mideast neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman Rubin said, ``There's real seriousness'' on both
sides, but ``we don't expect to be able to achieve a core agreement'' in one
round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``The president understands we have
an historic opportunity here'' and that the United States ``can act as a
facilitator, as an honest broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the talks began Monday, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day
to day. At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria said they want to see the other side show its
earnestness about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources close to the Syrian delegation as well as Syria's newspapers, which
reflect government thinking, said Damascus views the negotiations as a test of
Israel's intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syrian
President Hafez Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date
for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20,
said Nabil Shaath, planning minister of Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Shaath
said Clinton and Arafat will review implementation of a U.S.-brokered interim
agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinians at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in
September.

<HEADLINE> Small Investor Portfolio a Gamble  </HEADLINE>
    By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Internet stocks, which helped drive the Nasdaq composite index up more than
85 percent last year, seemed like a sure bet. But some stocks turned out to be a
bad gamble, as The Associated Press found by adding an online issue to a sample
small investor's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
	   EToys was one of the hottest stocks of 1999, surging higher as Internet
retailing grew more popular and more promising. The AP, which has tracked the
small investor's portfolio since October 1997, decided to include eToys as part
of a reallocation of the portfolio's assets that took place as of Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   EToys was valued at $66.56 a share at the third quarter's end. On Oct. 26,
when it closed at $77.81, the online toy retailer was looking like a great
investment. But the stock began to bounce around a few days later as doubts
about eToys' fourth-quarter earnings grew, and then it plunged in December as
the company admitted it was having trouble getting Christmas shipments out on
time.
</P>
<P>
	   It closed Dec. 31 at $26.25, for a drop of more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Was it a bad decision to go for eToys? Maybe, if you're looking for a quick
return. And maybe not, if you're in for the long term. Two years ago, the
portfolio's Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Pacific Growth Fund looked like a dog as
Asian economies fell into recession. In the just-ended quarter, the fund
continued its recovery, surging 22.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   EToys' rise and fall shows how tricky Internet investing can be. While
stocks like eToys, Amazon.com, Yahoo! and eBay have won notoriety for their huge
gains, these stocks can also take a big tumble, and in a small portfolio they
can do a lot of damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the portfolio, which includes four mutual funds and four individual
stocks, rose 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter. That was well behind the Dow
Jones industrial average, which rose 11.2 percent for the quarter, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which rose 7 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, which
outperformed all major market measures, was up 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, the portfolio rose 14.3 percent, compared to the Dow's 25.2
percent, the S&AMP;P 500's 19.5 percent and the Nasdaq's 85.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The portfolio's top gainer in the fourth quarter was Wal-Mart, which rose
45.4 percent, followed by the Pacific Growth fund and Coca-Cola, rebounding
after three dismal quarters with a 20.7 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
	   Another new addition to the portfolio, the Legg Mason Value Trust, rose a
robust 18.9 percent, while the Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio fund, which
includes S&AMP;P 500 stocks, was up 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The assets in the portfolio were allocated to keep it diversified. When the
portfolio was first put together, it had about $25,000 spread evenly among six
holdings. Since then, the tremendous surge in Wal-Mart and another holding, IBM,
meant more than half the portfolio's value rested in those two stocks, making
the portfolio more vulnerable to swings in their prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the reallocation, the $39,279.71 in the fund as of Sept. 30 was split
evenly among its eight holdings, which also include the T. Rowe Price U.S.
Treasury Long-Term Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the reallocation and addition of eToys and the Legg Mason fund, the
portfolio would have risen 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter. While the changes
reduced the portfolio's gain, it is now more diverse and in a position to move
higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The laggards in the portfolio this past quarter included IBM, hurt by
worries about Y2K and unable to continue its big winning streak. It fell 10.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The T. Rowe Price fund, included as a hedge against stock market volatility,
lost 4.6 percent as interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The portfolio was valued at $25,299.85 at its inception and was worth
$41,477.69 at year's end.

<HEADLINE> Old Checks Are Not Y2K Compliant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Folks who don't write a lot of checks and still have old
blanks with "19" printed as the first two digits of the century now have one
more thing to remember in the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   They have to scribble out the "19" and write in "20."
</P>
<P>
	   The Deluxe Corp., the nation's leading supplier of printed checks, hasn't
printed "19----" on checks since 1996, when it began leaving the date spot blank
in anticipation of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke American Checks Inc., a Deluxe competitor based in San Antonio, began
removing the "19----" from the date line in August 1997, when the company's
1997-98 catalog was introduced. All catalog products had been changed by
mid-1999, said spokeswoman Julie Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
	   "We started really early because we had a catalog coming out, so there
shouldn't be that many (dated checks) out there," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty Check Printers, based in St. Paul, began dropping the "19" in 1997
and by April 1999 all production plants had completed the changeover, said
spokesman Rick Foy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's almost impossible to tell how many of the old checks are still out
there. It's OK to use those checks, you just have to make an adjustment on the
date," Foy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Connie Sierra of Belleville, N.J., doesn't mind using a bit of extra ink.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me, it's just another year. I'll write '2000' on my old checks -- I'm
certainly not going to buy new ones," she said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 139.61; Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- As fears of Y2K computer crashes waned, concern about
rising interest rates returned to Wall Street Monday, holding most stocks lower
on the first day of trading in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Lifting of the Y2K cloud helped boost technology shares as some analysts
predicted a round of corporate spending on high-tech initiatives.That helped
lift the Nasdaq composite index to yet another closing high.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, investors had to weather some wide price swings Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.61 to close at 11,357.51, while
the Nasdaq composite index rose 61.84 to 4,131.15. The Nasdaq opened the day by
rising more than 120 points, then dipped as much as 79 points before recovering.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 14.03 to 1,455.22
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for scattered
profit-taking Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors had held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital
gains taxes for 1999. The start of the new year means investors who sell stocks
now won't pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied Monday as trading began without any Y2K problems.
But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the bond market, which
tumbled as investors bet the Fed will return to a policy of higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times last year in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure monetary stability while Y2K bugs were still
perceived as a threat to the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's strength Monday, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row. Many economists
had expected the indexes to rise more sharply, but the moderate increases
rattled investors nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   "The figures were not sufficiently restrained to suggest that the Fed may
remain on hold," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond as high as 6.62
percent, up from 6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Bond yields are now at the
highest levels since Sept. 11, 1997, when long-term yields closed at 6.69
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting an appealing alternative to more
volatile stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled. American Express fell 8 11/16 to 157 9/16 and
J.P. Morgan fell 5 3/16 to 121 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet technology stocks were mostly higher. Analysts suggested that the
apparent end of Y2K-related worries may prompt a new round of technology
spending in the coming months. CMGI, which invests in young Internet companies,
soared 49 9/16. JDS Uniphase rose 26 11/16 to 188.
</P>
<P>
	   Amgen rose 2 7/8 to 62 15/16 after PaineWebber's chief investment strategist
Ed Kerschner added the biotechnology company to a list of highlighted stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Technology stocks are truly a mania on Wall Street," Meehan said. "I don't
see that changing any time soon."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have fared worse had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But markets that opened for
trading Monday ran smoothly; France's CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent and
Germany's Xetra DAX tumbled 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other major stock markets remained closed, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.17 billion shares, compared
with 541.95 million at the close of Friday's shortened session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.33 to 496.42.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell sharply Monday, as renewed fears of
possible interest rate hikes pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond to its highest level in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond fell 1 3/4 points, or $17.50 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.62
percent from 6.48 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's closing figure was the highest point reached since the 30-year
yield hit 6.69 percent on Sept. 11, 1997. Yields on the so-called long bonds
peaked last year at 6.49 percent on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   As the U.S. economy continues to hum along toward the longest expansion in
history, bond traders grew anxious Monday that the Federal Reserve Board will
increase interest rates in an effort to fend off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Monday from the National Association of Purchasing Management
indicated that the cost of raw materials for manufacturing is rising and
heightened the likelihood that Fed policy-makers will raise interest rates in
the weeks ahead to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   As the new year came in with virtually no problems for banks or industry,
bond market participants returned their focus to the Federal Reserve, and what
actions it might take to avoid the inflationary potential of the U.S. economy's
near-record expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Most market observers expect the Federal Reserve to resume its tightening
course in early 2000 now that fears of a Year 2000 computer disaster have
dissipated. Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return
to investors. The Fed raised rates three times in 1999 -- in June, August and
November -- to slow the red-hot economy and to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the fixed-rate market, yields on three-month Treasury bills
were 5.41 percent as the discount rose 0.09 percentage point from Friday to 5.26
percent. Six-month yields were 5.78 percent, as the discount rose 0.05
percentage point to 5.54 percent. One-year yields were 6.06 percent as the
discount rose 0.11 percentage point to 5.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 9/32
point to 5/16 point and intermediate maturities fell  5/8 to 1 1/32 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.50 percent, down from 6.00 on Friday
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 to 91 15/16. The average yield
to maturity rose to 6.25, up from Friday's 6.22 percent.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said IBM, which said Year 2000 worries had discouraged some of its
mainframe customers from buying, should rebound strongly. A smooth conversion
into the new year should encourage companies to resume buying technology,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Credit Suisse First Boston cut its rating on the stock to "buy" from "strong
buy," following a downgrade last month from Banc of America Securities. Tommy

<P>
	   Bear Stearns analyst Kevin R. Gruneich raised his rating on the stock to

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices Fall on Brazil Rains  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Coffee prices rang in the new trading year with another wild swing, diving 7
percent after heavy rains soaked drought-stricken key growing regions in Brazil,
the world's No. 1 coffee producer.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, corn and soybeans fell sharply and pork bellies rose 4
percent to reach their highest level since Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   While drought-plagued Brazil has received more rain recently, investors are
still watching the weather there closely for significant rainfall that may
favorably affect the new crop. Steady rains could still increase the
government's estimate that the 2000 crop will total some 28.9 million bags --
more than a 25 percent drop from pre-drought projections.
</P>
<P>
	   On New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange, coffee for March delivery fell
9.4 cents to $1.165 per pound. That's about in the middle of the range it has
traded in since the start of the drought -- from a low of 80 cents to a high of
$1.497.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Scoville, vice president of the Price Futures Group in Chicago, said
the decline in the U.S. stock markets contributed to coffee's slide, as did the
perception the market was over-bought, or long. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 140.23 on Monday to close at 11,356.89, according to preliminary
calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Funds are completely long in the market, so they probably felt the need to
lighten up in case the rain was beneficial," he said.	   Corn led grains' losses
on the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by low U.S. weekly corn shipments along
with the slide in soybeans and the stock market.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Markets Selloff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slumped against most major currencies on Monday
as rising bond yields hurt stocks and dampened demand for the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0259, up from Friday's late
rate of $1.0092. The dollar bought 101.56 Japanese yen, down from 102.27.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond market fell sharply amid concerns that the Fed will return to a
policy of higher interest rates. The U.S. central bank raised rates three times
last year in an effort to hold back inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation of another rate hike was fueled by a new report showing signs of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Purchasing Management said the industrial sector
of the economy grew in December for the 11th consecutive month. Its price index,
which measures the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors subsequently sent bond prices lower, pushing the yield on the
30-year bond to 6.62 percent, the highest levels since Sept. 11, 1997, when
long-term yields closed at 6.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average also fell on the report, ending down 139.61
to close at 11,357.51 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Fed decides to raise interest rates and that puts an end to the
stock market rally, that will show up with a weaker dollar," said David Gilmore,
a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   In other dealings Monday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5650 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5925, and 1.4457 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4467. The
British pound fetched $1.6372, up from $1.6158 Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9067 German marks, down from 1.9462; 6.3949
French francs, down from 6.5273; and 1,887.66 Italian lire, down from 1,926.73.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore and GOP field begin dash to first contests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The presidential candidates began a January primary
sprint through Iowa and New Hampshire on Monday, their comments promising
rough-and-tumble days ahead.
<P>
	   Out of the box, Bill Bradley promised a "new world of possibilities" after
seven years of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The vice president said the country
needs a tested leader, suggesting that his sole Democratic rival is less than
that.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, George W. Bush's campaign promised to become tougher
on John McCain, who is threatening the GOP front-runner in New Hampshire and
running new campaign ads in South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reform Party was afire with internal bickering, and its two most likely
candidates - Pat Buchanan and Donald Trump - planned major appearances this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of polls, planes and plans, the campaign shifted into a higher
gear with the dawn of a new year and many voters just beginning to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting begins Jan. 24 in Iowa and Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. Nominees in both
parties could be determined in a blur of activity that peaks March 7, when more
than a dozen states conduct presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The secret to January is managing your campaign message every cycle," said
Republican consultant Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's failed 1996 campaign.
"You want to be on the offensive, not the defensive."
</P>
<P>
	   That's the strategy of the two Democratic and six Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the campaign's next stage a "contest of ideas," Bush has promised
supporters that he will draw sharper distinctions between himself and McCain,
particularly on taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will see the governor engage in an upbeat, optimistic campaign, but he
will not shy away from distinctions," spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor, leads most state GOP polls by wide
margins but was surprised by McCain's ability to eliminate the gap in New
Hampshire polls. Aides are confident that Bush will win Iowa's caucuses, which
are dominated by party stalwarts, and they still hope to claim New Hampshire's
unpredictable primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They worry, however, that the race will continue to tighten.
</P>
<P>
	   One major fight could be over taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, 10-year tax cut package, which dwarfs a
proposal McCain outlined in June. The Arizona senator plans to beef up his
package this month, but it will still be less than half the size of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing a potential line of attack, a Bush aide says a family with two
children would pay $1,000 more in taxes under McCain than under Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, is prepared to question Bush's commitment to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush would spend a bulk of the federal surplus on tax cuts, McCain
says he would dedicate just 23 percent of Washington's extra money to a
tax-cutting plan. For the rest of the surplus, McCain says 62 percent would
bolster Social Security, 10 percent would go to Medicare and 5 percent would pay
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "John McCain has never voted for a tax increase, but he thinks saving Social
Security is the issue," campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's rise in New Hampshire polls has improved his fund raising, allowing
him to pour more money into television advertising. A new spot in South Carolina
promotes the endorsement of Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C..
</P>
<P>
	   In Michigan, a critical state in McCain's uphill battle against Bush, the
Arizona senator plans to air $1 million worth of ads before the Feb. 22 primary.
The first ad, a slick production of his biography that has run in the earlier
primary states, airs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain isn't Bush's only worry. Wealthy conservative Steve Forbes has made
inroads in Iowa and can afford millions of dollars in ads that raise questions
about the Texas governor. Forbes' internal polls show him gaining on Bush in
Iowa, though he still lags 20 percentage points behind.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's risky decision not to compete in Iowa frees him to campaign in
South Carolina and attend a handful of fund-raisers while Bush battles on two
fronts in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is hoping for a quick boost Tuesday with the announcement that failed
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole is backing him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democrats' campaign of tougher talk, Gore and Bradley squared off in
separate states Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that on many issues, he has the wrong plans. And on some critical
issues, he has no plans," Gore said of Bradley in a speech to 1,000 people at a
high school gym in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to focus on just five big issues: universal health care
insurance, child poverty, more teachers in public schools, tighter gun control
and campaign finance reform. "Now is not the time to settle," he said in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ticks off a laundry list of issues - the five mentioned by Bradley plus
a strong economy, "revolutionary" changes in education, Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,"
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley raised more money than Gore in the last quarter and saved up his
money early in the campaign, allowing him to air more ads than the vice
president of late; he outspent Gore 2-to-1 last month in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Sale Looms for Smith &AMP; Wesson  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- With the gun industry itself under fire, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, maker of the .44-caliber Magnum carried by Dirty Harry, may soon be up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest gunmaker has not yet engaged a buyer, but its parent
company is shifting aim away from the firearms business, Smith &AMP; Wesson
spokesman Ken Jorgensen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is battling a series of municipal lawsuits blaming Smith &AMP;
Wesson and others for gun violence. Smith &AMP; Wesson has been cleared in every
lawsuit decided so far, but other cases remain before the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Sally Slovenski, a gun control advocate at Boston-based Join Together, said
the lawsuits are making life more complicated for gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quite a few of the gun companies are starting to change perspective," she
said. Some "are starting to broaden the variety of their manufactured goods."
</P>
<P>
	   A British newspaper, the Mail on Sunday, quoted an unidentified source as
saying that Smith &AMP; Wesson is being put up for sale by its owner, the English
conglomerate Tomkins PLC. The newspaper suggested the sale could take in more
than $160 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorgensen said that Tomkins, which acquired Smith &AMP; Wesson in 1987, is
refocusing on building and automotive products.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going to divest themselves of companies that don't fit into that
when they have an opportunity, but there's nothing ongoing with Smith &AMP; Wesson
at this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He described Smith &AMP; Wesson's sales during the past year as strong, but
declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to handguns, Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson makes bicycles and
a range of computer software for law enforcement agencies. It also does
specialized metal working for more than 300 other companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith &AMP; Wesson developed the first gun of its Magnum line in 1935, and the
powerful and physically imposing .44 became an icon in the Dirty Harry movies of
the 1970s and '80s starring Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1983 movie "Sudden Impact," Eastwood tells a villain, "Well, we're
not just going to let you walk out of here." Asked what he meant by "we,"
Eastwood replied, "Smith and Wesson and me."
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's oldest handgun maker at 147 years, Smith &AMP; Wesson employs about
750 workers in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the company in 1852 to develop a
gun that could shoot self-contained cartridges, avoiding the need for loose
gunpowder, balls and primer.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith &AMP; Wesson is also known historically for its widely used six-shot
revolvers and weapons that were once standard sidearms for U.S. soldiers.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Hijack Victims Speak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Jeanne Moore says her status as the only American on
board a hijacked Indian Airlines plane made her fear that she would be singled
out by her captors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always felt the pressure of being an American ... and was always
expecting the worst to happen to me,'' the Press Trust of India news agency
quoted Moore, 53, as saying Monday. ``I comforted myself by thinking about my
family and my friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, a teacher and psychotherapist from Bakersfield, Calif., said the
hijackers took her passport, ``and my offer to speak with my government was
turned down, making me more worried.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore left India on Monday for home, 10 days after her flight from Nepal to
New Delhi was hijacked Dec. 24. Her whereabouts weren't publicly known Monday
night. She and 154 other hostages were freed Dec. 31 after India agreed to
release two Kashmiri militants and a Pakistani fundamentalist cleric.
</P>
<P>
	   Her son, Jim, a Bakersfield police officer, came to India to accompany her
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Hostage Shirley Macklin, a Canadian, had similar fears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said, `Well, OK, so who will they kill?' I'm a likely candidate because
I'm Canadian, that's kind of a high-profile country,'' said the 60-year-old
humanitarian aid worker from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Radio from New Delhi,
Macklin said she came to terms with the possibility of dying during the
standoff. She comforted herself by thinking about her family and doing yoga
exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore thought she was going to be killed when the hijackers asked her to
spell coffin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the bad guys approached me and asked, 'What do you call the box to
keep a body?' I thought it was meant for me,'' Moore said. ``I spelled the word,
`coffin,' and wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to them, not knowing what
was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore described riding a roller coaster of emotions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were scared a lot. We never knew what was going to happen to us,''
Moore told the Los Angeles Times. ``It was a very interesting study in people.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also described how the hijackers played on hostages' nerves. ``At one
point of time they used to terrorize us, and then you see them handing over
packets of food. We were confused,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Though they were nice to women and children, I got hit on my head by one
of the hijackers when I tried to bend and blow off a bug which was troubling me
on my hand,'' she said. ``It is truly amazing that anyone can be so cruel.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Press Trust of India quoted Moore as saying, ``the scene in there was
not just like out of a Hollywood thriller, which is dramatic and exciting. It
was terror and bad stuff. They smelled bad.''

<HEADLINE> US Affirms Russia Democracy Support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- The White House reaffirmed Monday its support
for democratic and market reform in Russia as acting President Vladimir Putin
settles into his new job in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an important time,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said, referring to the
presidential elections due in three months. ``But the Russian people will have
to speak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who is here to mediate between Israel and Syria, called Putin from
the White House on Saturday, a day after President Boris Yeltsin resigned and
named the prime minister to succeed him until national elections are held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the president congratulated him on his designation as acting
president, told him it was important to continue to work to strengthen the
relationship, noted that there are areas of disagreement in the relationship,
particularly Chechnya, but there are also many areas that we do agree on,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has promoted the Russian military offensive in Chechnya, a drive that
has widespread popular support. He is expected to try to capitalize on the
campaign in his presidential run.

<HEADLINE> Money Scandal Hits Israeli President  </HEADLINE>
   By SARI BASHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In six years as Israel's figurehead, nothing seemed to
make a dent in the popularity of Ezer Weizman, the ornery president who
gleefully insulted just about everyone, from women to gays to Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, allegations that he secretly accepted nearly half a million dollars
from a French millionaire before he became president are making some Israelis
question whether Weizman is still the right man for the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls for Weizman to step down are nothing new -- just last week, the
opposition Likud party threatened to impeach him over his active support for
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to trade the Golan Heights for peace with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, however, the president who once suggested that an
aspiring female pilot would be better off darning socks is being investigated
for conduct not merely considered meddling or offensive, but possibly illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Uncharacteristically, Weizman has avoided taking reporters' questions since
an Israeli journalist accused him Thursday of failing to report or pay taxes on
the $453,000 he received from textile magnate Edouard Sarousi. Weizman's lawyer
has issued a terse denial of wrongdoing, saying the money was a nontaxable gift
from a friend of the family who had no interests in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, presiding Monday at an honor guard ceremony welcoming visiting
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, commented for the first time on the news
that Israel's state prosecutor has asked him to hand over documents detailing
the cash deposited into his bank accounts between 1988 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very satisfied that the state prosecutor's office has decided to
conduct a probe,'' Weizman told reporters. ``I will wait until they give their
conclusions, and then I will respond.''
</P>
<P>
	   His comments were prepared in advance and devoid of his trademark, often
biting wit. He would not take questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman's rare silence may be related to how the money was reportedly spent.
According to the daily Yediot Ahronot, Weizman used part of the money to care
for his late son, Shaul, who was seriously injured during fighting with Egypt in
1970. Shaul died in an automobile accident in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The journalist who made the accusations, Yoav Yitzhak, said Weizman's office
pressured him not to release the story, saying that it would threaten peace
talks with Syria and the Palestinians by toppling one of their most vocal public
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   But outrage over the gifts cuts across partisan lines and goes beyond the
affectionate eye-rolling with which Israelis usually greet Weizman's antics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weizman must resign the presidency immediately,'' the liberal Haaretz
daily said in its editorial Monday. ``The president's role is symbolic, and the
symbol must be a role model, not a badge of shame.''
</P>
<P>
	   Politicians from the ruling Labor party, including Barak, have defended the
74-year old Weizman, whose term expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's office reprimanded members of his party who were already discussing
successors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Speculation while a president is in office is unworthy and harms the
office of the president,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other once-avid defenders have become more guarded since the prosecutor's
probe was announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I very much hope that the probe proves that the president behaved
appropriately,'' Environmental Minister Dalia Itzik said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Appropriate'' is a relative term for Weizman, whose outspoken behavior is
an apt symbol for a nation that prides itself on its own maverick irreverence.
</P>
<P>
	   When hard-liners accused him of overstepping the bounds of his position by
using it to push for a return of the Golan Heights, Weizman gloated that ``the
president's job is not defined -- and that makes for unbelievable fun.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bug Bites Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore helped lead the federal response to Y2K, but that
doesn't mean his own Internet operations went bug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer glitch took a tiny bite out of Gore's campaign Web site. The
damage came inside his ``virtual town hall,'' where a message from a supporter
was dated January 3, 19100.
</P>
<P>
	   When 1999 became 2000, some computers decided that the year following 19-99
is 19-100.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign explained that the mistake was visible only on computers
using a certain type of browser and that it was quickly fixed. Besides, they
said, it wasn't exactly a major glitch, even for the man who once claimed to
have invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe a few people saw an error. Most people didn't. It's extremely
minor,'' said Gore spokeswoman Kathleen Begala. ``Be that as it may, we want to
have every person dialing up www.algore2000.com to get the perfect Web site. And
now they will.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Rolls Out Anti-Clinton Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With South Carolina critical to his campaign strategy,
Sen. John McCain's new advertisements there feature a local favorite who takes
aim at President Clinton rather than Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lindsey Graham, who endorsed the Arizona senator in June, touts McCain
as the man to ``bring honor back to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain is the polar opposite of Bill Clinton,'' Graham, R-S.C., says
in a radio ad that began airing in South Carolina on Monday. ``He has absolute
total character and candor -- the missing element during the Clinton years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graham is not quite as direct in a TV ad that begins airing Tuesday,
accusing Clinton of betraying the military. He also mentions McCain's time as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam and his efforts to reform campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign said the ads were being purchased statewide. The
television spot will be seen 10 to 12 times over 10 days by the average viewer,
said one campaign official, declining to say how much the campaign was spending
to air it.
</P>
<P>
	   It was spending about $50,000 a week to air the radio ad, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has pulled at least even with the Texas governor in New
Hampshire, is counting on South Carolinians to keep momentum going when they
vote on Feb. 19. He's targeting his appeal to veterans in the state, hoping his
military service will attract support.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham, one of McCain's most prominent backers in South Carolina, is playing
off his role as one of 13 House Republicans who argued the impeachment case
against President Clinton to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham introduced McCain several times during a recent South Carolina trip
by regaling the crowd with stories about the impeachment trial and his
involvement in Clinton's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an anniversary of sorts,'' he said. ``A year ago, I was looking
through some amazing material,'' he said, referring to independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham was raring to talk about impeachment, said Greg Stevens, who produced
the ads for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He talks about (it) without any prompting from us,'' he said. ``There was
no script.''
</P>
<P>
	   Impeachment, of course, was not popular with most Americans, so there's a
small risk that bringing the topic up could come back to bite McCain. But
outside observers think that's unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For Republican voters, there's not much risk at all,'' said Andrew Kohut,

``I think South Carolina is going to be long forgotten by the time we get to the
general election.''

<HEADLINE> Cost of Raw Materials Is Rising  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. manufacturers say the cost of raw materials is rising
as the nation's economy closes in on a record for the longest expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewed inflation jitters rattled financial markets, with blue-chip
stocks tumbling from record highs and bond yields rising to the highest level in
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's report from the National Association of Purchasing Management
heightened the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in
the weeks ahead to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report is closely watched because it is the first
national reading for December on U.S. industrial performance, a key sector in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The group said its index, based on a national survey of executives who buy
raw materials and other supplies for industry, registered 55.5 percent in
December, down from 56.2 percent in November and below analysts' expectations.
Readings over 50 indicate expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 11th consecutive month of growth, though at a slightly lower rate
than in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "These numbers are very healthy, indicating manufacturing is still
expanding," said Bryan Jordan, an economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that there was "dramatic improvement" in the industrial economy in
1999. "The manufacturing sector recovered as the global economy recovered," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   That puts the U.S. economy in line to set a record. The longest economic
expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106 months, from February 1961 until
December 1969. The current expansion, which began in March 1991, will match the
record if it continues through this month and pass it if it lasts until
February.
</P>
<P>
	   But concerns about inflation, sparked by the report's reading of raw
materials prices, unsettled financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on 30-year government bonds, a barometer for such long-term borrowing
costs as mortgages, shot up to 6.62 percent Monday, reaching the highest level
since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which ended 1999 at an all-time high, fell
139.61 points to close at 11,357.51. But the Nasdaq composite index began the
year by reaching a new high in volatile trading.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest report, 18 of 20 industries reported higher prices for raw
materials. Some 35 percent of the purchasing managers who were surveyed said
prices had risen, while just 6 percent said they were lower. The rest said they
were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The price index rose to 65.7 percent in December from 65.3 percent the month
before. It was the eighth consecutive month with a reading above 50 and the
fourth in a row above 60.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it means is that we still have a lot of inflation concerns," said Gary
R. Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. He noted
that other gauges indicate that most of the price increases are for oil and
related products and added that there's fear these will spread to other
products.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we can't rule out action by the Federal Reserve in February," Thayer
said. "The markets already are assuming they will raise rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Fed policy-makers raised rates three times in 1999 to try to keep the
economy from overheating and igniting inflation. The Fed left rates unchanged
last month because it did not want to upset the economy immediately before the
year 2000 date change. With the economy still roaring ahead with no apparent
disruptions caused by Y2K computer problems, an increasing number of analysts
expect further rates increases this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's next meeting is a two-day session beginning Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Hires Former Sega Executive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. hired Bernard Stolar, the
strong-willed former Sega of America chief, to revive its troubled interactive
toys and software operations, Mattel announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stolar, who engineered the launch of Sega's popular Dreamcast video game
console before leaving in a clash with the parent company, was named president
of Mattel Interactive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mattel division includes The Learning Company, the software maker whose
unexpected $105 million loss in the third quarter stunned investors and
undermined Mattel's 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mattel has some of the strongest brands in the world," Stolar said in a
statement. "I'm looking forward to helping shape Mattel's software and online
product lines."
</P>
<P>
	   Known for independent thinking and a strong relationship with retailers,
Stolar is the sort of leader Mattel needs to pull its interactive division out
of the doldrums, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been around this business for a long time, which is more than you can
say for almost anyone at Mattel, which hasn't been in the (interactive) business
for very long," said Sean McGowan, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody expected Sega to be as successful in the Dreamcast launch as they
were, and I think he deserves a great deal of credit for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Dreamcast was launched in September, Sega has sold 2 million units,
making it the most successful launch of a game device in history, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stolar, 53, left Sega several weeks before Dreamcast appeared in U.S. stores
after strategy disagreements with the Japanese parent, Sega Enterprises Ltd.
Stolar prevailed on the strategy for Dreamcast's U.S. debut, but lost his job in
the process, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mattel, he will play a key role in Mattel chairwoman and chief executive
Jill E. Barad's plan to reshape the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels toys into a
broader family products company with a strong focus on educational software and
high-tech, interactive toys.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of that strategy, Mattel acquired The Learning Company in May for
$3.6 billion. The company, which makes Carmen Sandiego and other popular
software titles, was expected to immediately add $50 million to Mattel's third
quarter revenues, but instead lost more than twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Learning Company Chairman Michael Perik, 42, and President Kevin O'Leary,
45, left Mattel in November.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mattel is expected to benefit from Stolar's experience, his
appointment raises the prospect of clashes with Barad, who also is known as a
strong-willed leader.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bernie is certain to have clashes with Jill. It's just the kind of style he
has, but I think what the company needs is someone who can take the tough
steps," McGowan said. "It's no secret to him it's going to be an issue and it's
no secret to her. I'm sure it's something they have addressed, how to handle
these types of conflicts."
</P>
<P>
	   Before joining Sega in 1996, Stolar was executive vice president for Sony
Computer of America, where he helped launch Sony Playstation, another popular
video game console.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong point has been his ability to build enthusiasm among retailers for
the products he sells, said Jeremy Schwartz, an analyst with Forrester Research.
One task at Sega was to sell Dreamcast to retailers who had been burned by an
earlier Sega flop, the Saturn console.
</P>
<P>
	   "They really needed to convince retailers that this was a viable product.
They had a lot of negative impressions to overcome, and I think he was largely
responsible for winning over the retail chains about Dreamcast," Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Beatty Rules Out Run for Presidency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Bulworth's flirtation with a White House run
appears to be dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Actor-director Warren Beatty set off a frenzy of speculation among political
pundits and the news media last summer when he said he was considering a
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an interview in the February issue of Vanity Fair magazine, he seemed
to rule it out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not running now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't elaborate on whether ``now'' meant he would not run at all in
2000, or that he was not currently running. He didn't immediately respond to
message left at his Los Angeles office Monday by The Associated Press seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the New Hampshire primary less than a month away, Beatty's chances
of successfully running for the nomination are almost nil.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the prospect of making a poor showing prompted Beatty to reject
entering the California and New Hampshire primaries, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
	   Beatty said such an embarrassment might damage his liberal agenda and the
issues that matter to him, including schools and a ban on special-interest money
for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the magazine that he feared his critics would say: ``Look, Mr. Movie
Star was up here and tried to do something with these issues and look how
unpopular they are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beatty left the door open to a run for political office later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the question is: Can I be effective at another time? Whether that
is in a year, or two years, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
	   Beatty, who wrote and starred in the 1998 political send-up ``Bulworth,''
doesn't think his flirtation with running for office was entirely in vain. ``I
feel good about speaking up,'' he said. ``I wouldn't feel good if I hadn't. It
seems to me that the effect has been positive, that I've not yet made too much
of a fool of myself -- at least, I don't think I have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beatty refused to endorse any other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're all good men, but none of them are saying enough of the things
that need to be said,'' he told the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Aliens Detained in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Three Chinese men were ordered held Monday after 12 men were
apparently smuggled into the United States aboard a container ship from Hong
Kong that docked at Harbor Island over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14 for Sheng Deng, Ju Shu Hwang
and Yu Zheng, who were taken into custody Sunday. They were waiting in a blue
van parked near the ship.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials were alerted to the scheme
by the agency's Hong Kong office on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 men arrived on Harbor Island on Sunday aboard the container ship OOCL
Faith -- owned by Orient Overseas Container Line of Hong Kong. They were found
inside a container, where they had been since Dec. 18, said INS spokeswoman
Irene Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
	   All were being detained at the INS center in Seattle, where they will be
interviewed and likely deported to China.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in Long Beach, Calif., 18 suspected illegal immigrants were
detained after being found inside a cargo container aboard a ship that
reportedly left Hong Kong nearly three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Those Chinese immigrants, who were not injured, were found Sunday by crew
members of the Zim Shekou as it was coming into the Port of Long Beach, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Billy Davidson. The ship had docked in British
Columbia before reaching Long Beach.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Begin Primary Sprint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential candidates began a January primary sprint
through Iowa and New Hampshire Monday, their comments promising rough-and-tumble
days ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of the box, Bill Bradley promised a ``new world of possibilities'' after
seven years of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The vice president said the country
needs a tested leader, suggesting that his sole Democratic rival is less than
that.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, George W. Bush's campaign promised to become tougher
on John McCain, who is threatening the GOP front-runner in New Hampshire and
running new campaign ads in South Carolina and Michigan -- critical states in
McCain's uphill battle against Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator plans to air $1 million worth of ads in Michigan before
the Feb. 22 primary. The first, a slick production of his biography that has run
in the earlier primary states, airs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded by agreeing to participate in a GOP debate on Jan. 10 in that
state, viewed as a bellwether for the electorate. It was a replay of the Texas
governor's strategy in New Hampshire, where he agreed to debate there only after
polls showed McCain in a deadheat with the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Michigan forum is one of three GOP debates within five days, starting on
Thursday in New Hampshire and another on Friday in South Carolina. The Democrat
contenders also face-off twice this week, in New Hampshire on Wednesday and in
Iowa on Saturday in a debate-heavy January.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of polls, planes and plans, the campaign shifted into a higher
gear with the dawn of a new year and many voters just beginning to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting begins Jan. 24 in Iowa and Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. Nominees in both
parties could be determined in a blur of activity that peaks March 7, when more
than a dozen states conduct presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The secret to January is managing your campaign message every cycle,''
said Republican consultant Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's failed 1996
campaign. ``You want to be on the offensive, not the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's the strategy of the two Democratic and six Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the campaign's next stage a ``contest of ideas,'' Bush has promised
supporters that he will draw sharper distinctions between himself and McCain,
particularly on taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You will see the governor engage in an upbeat, optimistic campaign, but he
will not shy away from distinctions,'' spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor, leads most state GOP polls by wide
margins but was surprised by McCain's ability to eliminate the gap in New
Hampshire polls. Aides are confident that Bush will win Iowa's caucuses, which
are dominated by party stalwarts, and they still hope to claim New Hampshire's
unpredictable primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They worry, however, that the race will continue to tighten.
</P>
<P>
	   One major fight could be over taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, 10-year tax cut package, which dwarfs a
proposal McCain outlined in June. The Arizona senator plans to beef up his
package this month, but it will still be less than half the size of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing a potential line of attack, a Bush aide says a family with two
children would pay $1,000 more in taxes under McCain than under Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, is prepared to question Bush's commitment to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush would spend a bulk of the federal surplus on tax cuts, McCain
says he would dedicate just 23 percent of Washington's extra money to a
tax-cutting plan. For the rest of the surplus, McCain says 62 percent would
bolster Social Security, 10 percent would go to Medicare and 5 percent would pay
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain has never voted for a tax increase, but he thinks saving
Social Security is the issue,'' campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's rise in New Hampshire polls has improved his fund raising, allowing
him to pour more money into television advertising. A new spot in South Carolina
promotes the endorsement of Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C..
</P>
<P>
	   McCain isn't Bush's only worry. Wealthy conservative Steve Forbes has made
inroads in Iowa and can afford millions of dollars in ads that raise questions
about the Texas governor. Forbes' internal polls show him gaining on Bush in
Iowa, though he still lags 20 percentage points behind.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's risky decision not to compete in Iowa frees him to campaign in
South Carolina and attend a handful of fund-raisers while Bush battles on two
fronts in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is hoping for a quick boost Tuesday with the announcement that failed
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole is backing him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democrats' campaign of tougher talk, Gore and Bradley squared off in
separate states Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that on many issues, he has the wrong plans. And on some
critical issues, he has no plans,'' Gore said of Bradley in a speech to 1,000
people at a high school gym in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to focus on just five big issues: universal health care
insurance, child poverty, more teachers in public schools, tighter gun control
and campaign finance reform. ``Now is not the time to settle,'' he said in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ticks off a laundry list of issues -- the five mentioned by Bradley
plus a strong economy, ``revolutionary'' changes in education, Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley raised more money than Gore in the last quarter and saved up his
money early in the campaign, allowing him to air more ads than the vice
president of late; he outspent Gore 2-to-1 last month in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Papa John's Ordered To Pay Damages  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- A federal magistrate on Monday ordered Papa John's to remove
its "Better Ingredients, Better Pizza" slogan from storefronts and pizza boxes
and pay Pizza Hut $468,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Pizza Hut, the industry leader, claimed the slogan and advertising campaign
unfairly maligned its product. In November, a jury decided Papa John's
advertisements were false and misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Magistrate William F. Sanderson Jr., ruling by fax Monday, ordered
Louisville-based Papa John's International Inc. to stop using its slogan in ads
by Jan. 24, to stop using pizza boxes and other printed material with the phrase
by March 3 and remove it from restaurant signs by April 3.
</P>
<P>
	   The magistrate further forbade Papa John's from ever using the word "better"
to describe its pizza, and he barred the company from even comparing its pizza
to that of Pizza Hut in future ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a landmark victory for consumers and Pizza Hut," said Jonathan
Blum, a vice president and spokesman for Dallas-based Pizza Hut's parent
company, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. of Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's will ask Sanderson to delay his order while it appeals the jury
verdict, a spokeswoman said. She said the company is considering the ruling's
impact on earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't going to change anything we're about," said Papa John's
spokeswoman Karen Sherman. "People buy our pizza because of the pizza, not the
slogan."
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's spent $300 million promoting the slogan since 1995. Ms. Sherman
said the company does not know how much it would cost to remove it.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury also found that two of Pizza Hut's counter ads were false and
misleading in suggesting that Papa John's used substandard ingredients,
including old dough. But the magistrate did not levy damages against Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
	   While Pizza Hut sought $12.5 million, the judge could have tripled the
damages under a federal law known as the Lanham Act.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, Papa John's officials and attorneys argued that the
"Better Ingredients, Better Pizza" slogan was merely puffery -- harmless
boasting that consumers expect to see in commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   Papa John's vice president of marketing, Syl Sosnowski, said the verdict and
Monday's ruling could alter advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can you imagine Chevy being required to prove that its trucks are really
'Like a Rock' ... or Pizza Hut proving it has the 'Best Pizzas Under One Roof,"'
he said, citing current advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Blum, the Pizza Hut spokesman, said the difference was that Papa John's used
ads to compare its product with others and claim superiority, which carries a
burden of proof. Pizza Hut's "Best Pizzas Under One Roof" ads, he said, make no
such comparisons.

<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The U.S. attorney handling the prosecution of a
fired Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets said Monday
he'll resign and turn the Wen Ho Lee caes over to a deputy.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kelly said his resignation was effective Tuesday. Those familiar with
his plans said he was considering a run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked for additional comment on a statement announcing the move, spokesman
Ron Lopez promised Kelly, 52, would have more to say Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dendahl, who heads the state Republican Party, said he was told Kelly,
a Democrat, plans to run for Republican Heather Wilson's seat in the 1st
Congressional District. ``I think he ought to keep his day job,'' Dendahl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state party chairwoman Diane Denish, who has talked to Kelly in
the last few days, said: ``It's my understanding he's looking very seriously at
running and will announce his decision shortly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly's chief deputy for the last six years, Robert Gorence, will be acting
U.S. attorney. The Justice Department will announce the appointment of an
interim U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly is in his seventh year as U.S. Attorney. He was nominated by President
Clinton and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly's authority in the state has been far reaching, covering everything
from prosecuting Lee, accused of breaching security at Los Alamos National
Laboratory by mishandling nuclear weapons secrets, to the Sureno 13 case, which
ended in October 1995, when 24 members of the Los Angeles-based gang were
indicted on charges ranging from murder to racketeering.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey blood banks plan education campaign on importance of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Less than 5 percent of United States residents who
are eligible to donate blood actually do. But New Jersey blood banks, enduring
their typical winter shortages, are trying to get more people to get in the
habit.
<P>
	   A task force of representatives from hospitals and blood banks is expected
to send recommendations to Gov. Christie Whitman in about two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the holidays and an early start to flu season, supplies are so
low at some state blood banks their blood would last only a day if needed for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blood Bank Task Force of New Jersey, which was created six months ago to
increase the number of regular donors, plans an education campaign, said Dr.
Mercy Kuriyan, chair of the panel, which is comprised of seven blood centers and
at least three hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force is considering a widespread blood awareness plan to teach
residents about the need for donated blood, and to teach elementary students
about the importance of donating, although they wouldn't be able to until they
turned 17, Kuriyan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood donations in New Jersey declined between 1992 and 1997, according to
the state Department of Health and Senior Services, so blood is imported from
other states to satisfy demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Donations within New Jersey would have had to increase by more than 32
percent - or 94,000 donations - to meet the demands of people hospitalized in
the state in 1998, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Gosnay, operations officer of the Community Blood Council of New Jersey
in Ewing, said Monday that if just 10 percent of eligible donors contributed
blood, shortages like the current one would be very rare.
</P>
<P>
	   Gosnay, also a member of the task force, said he thinks businesses should
give time off to employees to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are trying to ... create more of a sense of urgency to corporate leaders
to encourage employees to donate more blood," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gosnay said another reason there are so few donors is the fear of needles,
which, he said, "we have to overcome."
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the typical donor is of the "World War II generation," he said, which
is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
	   Gosnay said while donations have been stagnant, demand has increased.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, blood utilization is up because the treatments today are more
sophisticated, like cancer therapy," Gosnay said. Such treatments, which have
increased in New Jersey by about 8 percent in the last five years, require a lot
of blood, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During shortages, doctors are asked to limit the number of elective
surgeries they schedule, said Diana Doherty, component coordinator and recruiter
at the New Brunswick Affiliated Hospitals Blood Center at Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   To donate blood, a person must be in good health and weigh at least 110
pounds. In New Jersey a person can donate blood at age 17 with written parental
consent.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Migrants Returned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two U.S. Coast Guard cutters began a two-day voyage to Haiti on
Monday, returning more than 400 would-be immigrants amid protests from community
activists.
</P>
<P>
	   All but four of the 411 migrants -- 16 Dominican, two Chinese and the rest
Haitian -- who arrived New Year's Day on a rickety wooden boat were headed on
the 600-mile journey back to Haiti, said Coast Guard Lt. Carl Messalle.
</P>
<P>
	   Four Haitian women -- three of them pregnant and another with a high fever
-- were brought ashore for medical reasons and remained in Miami for hospital
treatment, Petty Officer Tony Wells said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those four are expected to be returned later, said Mike Gilhooly, spokesman
for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian activists in Miami criticized their return, saying U.S. laws
shouldn't treat Cuban and Haitian migrants differently. About 200 people
gathered Monday in front of the INS Building in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very disappointed that INS once more has decided to continue its
racist policy vis a vis the Haitians and failed once more to give them the right
to a fair and due process,'' said Marleine Bastien, president of Haitian Women
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S.-Cuba agreement allows Cubans who reach shore to remain in the United
States, while those caught at sea are returned to Cuba. Under a U.S.-Haiti
agreement, all those who are caught without proper documentation are deported.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian advocates also argued that because the boat was intercepted in U.S.
territorial waters, the migrants should have been given an opportunity to pursue
a claim with INS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're urging Janet Reno to end the wet foot-dry foot policy which she put
in place,'' Bastien said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Coast Guard rescued or turned back 363 Haitians and 406
Dominicans trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My concern is that people are leaving for several reasons, and one of them
is that there is political instability in Haiti,'' said Leonie Hermantin, head
of the Haitian American Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The migrants were packed shoulder-to-shoulder on a 60-foot vessel that ran
aground about a mile from shore, shortly after midnight Saturday. The ship
apparently had been at sea for at least five days.

<HEADLINE> Woman's Y2K Stash Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- She was one of those who figured her money belonged
in a safe -- not a bank -- when the world moved into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kansas City, Kan., woman and her husband recently withdrew their money
-- along with some stocks and bonds worth thousands of dollars -- from the bank
and put it into a home safe out of fears the Y2K bug would topple the financial
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Y2K turned out to be the least of their worries: The safe was stolen,
allegedly by four men who used a two-wheeled dolly to take the 5-foot-tall vault
from the couple's home.
</P>
<P>
	   The safe was found last week abandoned in a field, still locked up with its
contents intact -- the money and some guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Four Kansas City, Kan., men -- including one who knew the couple and knew
they had shifted the money from bank to safe -- were arrested on suspicion of
robbery and theft.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the safe didn't earn the couple any interest, it did the job, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They couldn't get it open,'' said Detective Bob Lane. ``Someone had tried
to saw the hinges off, tried to knock the combination tumblers off and had tried
to pry open the door. It was still locked.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A convicted murderer who says he wants vegetarian meals
and soy milk in prison because he is Buddhist should get the special meals even
though such a diet is not a central tenet of Buddhism, a federal appeals court
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert P. DeHart, who is serving a life sentence, filed a lawsuit against
the State Correctional Institution in Greene in 1995. He was seeking extra
servings of vegetables and grains and a cup of soy-based milk.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his interpretation of the Sutras, the Buddhist religious texts,
requires him to follow a vegan diet -- meaning no animal foods or dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. District Court in 1997 denied DeHart's request, saying that
vegetarianism is not mandated by Buddhism. DeHart said he follows the teachings
of the City of 10,000 Buddhas, a religious center based in Talmage, Calif.,
although that group testified that a vegan diet is not a commandment of
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Monday's ruling, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the court
should not interpret religious rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even unorthodox beliefs are afforded protection under the Free Exercise
Clause of the First Amendment, so long as they are sincerely held and religious
in nature,'' the appeals court wrote Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israel and Syria
together Monday for the second time in less than a month, seizing a ``historic
opportunity'' to end half a century of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests in Syria served as a stark reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face. And U.S. officials played down the possibility that the antagonists
would reach an agreement on major issues during this round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's quite unrealistically optimistic to think it can be done in this
round, but it's important to start ... the hard work of narrowing differences,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton was prepared ``to invest as many days as are appropriate and
constructive'' to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin also sought to damp expectations.
But he did not underplay the significance of the negotiations. ``This is an
historic opportunity that may not come again unless it is seized,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before sitting down first with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, the president strolled with them
across a 200-foot-long pedestrian bridge that spanned a dry creek.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Clinton's one-on-one meetings at the National Conservation
Training Center of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, he headed for the main
site of the talks at the semisecluded Clarion Hotel and Conference Center just
outside Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way, he halted his motorcade in the town center and stepped out to
greet scores of cheering residents. He ignored questions about the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Three-way talks were planned later.
</P>
<P>
	   Among issues the delegates will discuss are security -- a major worry for
Israel -- sharing of water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the
strategic Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character of peace
between the two Middle East neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman Rubin said, ``There's real seriousness'' on both
sides, but ``we don't expect to be able to achieve a core agreement'' in one
round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said, ``The president understands we have an historic opportunity
here'' and that the United States ``can act as a facilitator, as an honest
broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the talks began Monday, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day
to day. At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria said they want to see the other side show its
earnestness about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources close to the Syrian delegation as well as Syria's newspapers, which
reflect government thinking, said Damascus views the negotiations as a test of
Israel's intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syrian
President Hafez Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date
for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20,
said Nabil Shaath, planning minister of Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Shaath
said Clinton and Arafat will review implementation of a U.S.-brokered interim
agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinians at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in
September.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Criticizes Clinton Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes
criticized a tax cut suggested by the Clinton Administration, describing it as
too little, too late and too complicated on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who supports a 17 percent flat tax, said his own plan would
eliminate federal taxes for a family of four making less than $36,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year should bring about a new brand of politics, Forbes said, and
throwing out the tax code is the top priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is there anybody in America today who believes this tax code is working?''
he asked. ``It's an atrocity, an abomination. As a free people we should decide
what kind of code we have.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Clinton aide said the president would propose a tax relief package as part
of the fiscal 2001 budget plan. It would target specific groups, including some
in the middle-class.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes also said Elizabeth Dole's expected backing of George W. Bush is
typical of establishment politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, a millionaire magazine publisher, said many in the GOP see him as an
independent threat and are closing their ranks to try to fight him off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's no surprise,'' Forbes said of Dole's expected announcement. ``She's
not even registered to vote here in New Hampshire, so I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was expected to announce in Bedford on Tuesday that Dole, the former
president of the American Red Cross, is endorsing him. Dole dropped out of the
race in October, citing fund-raising troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   George Lovejoy, of Barrington, who heads the Anti-tax Coalition for Forbes,
said Forbes is an anti-establishment candidate in the vein of Theodore
Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and former New Hampshire Gov. Meldrim Thomson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need a leader who is and has been a business leader,'' Lovejoy said.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Trade Accusations  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURINDA KEYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India and Pakistan exchanged angry accusations
Monday over India's claim that its nuclear rival had a hand in the eight-day
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jetliner in which one person was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting the tensions between the two neighbors, a land mine explosion
killed 17 people and wounded 31 in the disputed region of Kashmir. No one
claimed responsibility for the blast in a vegetable market outside
Indian-controlled Srinagar, but Muslim separatists often carry out attacks in
the region. In Pakistani-held Kashmir, five civilians were killed from repeated
Indian shelling, Pakistani officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asian rivals regularly trade fire across Kashmir. Shelling goes on
almost every day and militants frequently carry out bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged the United States and
other world powers on Monday to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, saying India
had evidence proving Pakistan was involved in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   Vajpayee said Washington, which historically has had a closer relationship
with Pakistan than India, should take the initiative in isolating Pakistan, a
predominantly Muslim country under military rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan's active and sustained role in fomenting terrorism in India is
now too obvious to be overlooked by the international community,'' said
Vajpayee. ``India, therefore, strongly urges major nations of the world to
declare Pakistan a terrorist state.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said Monday, though, that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright would have to determine Pakistan's government had repeatedly supported
acts of international terrorism in order for the country to be designated a
terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright ``has not made such a determination with respect to Pakistan,'' the
department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vajpayee's comments were the latest in a series of strong statements by
Indian leaders alleging Pakistani involvement in the hijacking of Indian
Airlines Flight 814 on a Dec. 24 flight from Nepal to New Delhi. However,
neither Vajpayee nor the other officials have provided evidence to back up their
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Nations that declare Pakistan a terrorist state could impose a range of
sanctions against Islamabad, including a ban on travel, restrictions on military
sales and withdrawal of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar dismissed the Indian allegations
Monday as ``trumped-up charges'' and said India had an ``abhorrent record of
state terrorism,'' a reference to its military campaign against Muslim militants
in Indian-held Kashmir who are fighting for outright independence or union with
Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The five hijackers acted in support of the Kashmiri militants, but their
names and nationalities are not known, and they wore masks throughout the
hijacking. Their whereabouts remained a mystery Monday, as did the location of
the three men India released from jail in exchange for 155 hostages held aboard
the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the three prisoners, Masood Azhar, made a telephone call Friday from
Kandahar, Afghanistan, to his family in Pakistan, according to a family member
who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar, who called his family in Bawahalpur in the eastern Pakistan, was
freed along with Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheikh, a Pakistani-born British citizen, and
Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, an Indian from Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men were imprisoned in India for involvement in the bitter and
bloody insurgency in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been several reports, many of them contradictory, about the
whereabouts of the hijackers and the freed prisoners. Afghanistan's Taliban
leaders gave the hijackers 10 hours to leave the country on Friday, the day the
hijacking ended, and Pakistan was considered the most likely destination.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan denies India's charges that it funds, trains and supplies the
militants. On Monday, Pakistan again said it had no knowledge of the hijackers
entering its territory, and challenged India to hand over any evidence it had.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who suggest Pakistan should arrest the hijackers make the naive
assumption that the hijackers have entered Pakistan,'' the Foreign Ministry said
in a statement. ``To the best of our information, such an assumption is
unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India both lay claim to all of Kashmir and have fought two wars
over Kashmir since their independence from Britain in 1947. The two countries,
which exploded underground nuclear devices last year, came close to another war
this summer over Kashmir.

$128,000 fine to the Federal Election Commission to settle allegations that
Chairman William Powers handed out tens of thousands of dollars illegally,
according to documents reviewed Monday.
<P>
	   The hefty fine stems from Powers' distribution of wads of cash during the
1994 and 1996 elections. State party officials say the money paid scores of poll
watchers monitoring the vote in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   FEC officials say there is no way to know exactly who it went to, since
Powers and other top party officials signed sworn affidavits stating they do not
recall specifically who received the cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC alleges that Powers, GOP state party counsel Jeffrey Buley and New
York Federal Campaign Committee treasurer Michael Avella failed to report proper
purposes for disbursement, failed to report the names of recipients and made
cash payments over federal limits.
</P>
<P>
	   "What appears to have happened is that the Committee did not want to create
a paper trail whereby the people to whom it disbursed these funds could be
identified," according to a brief by FEC General Counsel Lawrence Noble.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recipients of hundreds of thousands of dollars in committee funds appear
nowhere on the public record," Noble's brief said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the first time the state Republican Party under Powers has been fined
by the FEC. The party has bragged about paying scrupulous attention to campaign
finance requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. attorney's office in Albany first reported the situation to the FEC
in September 1995 after receiving a tip from "a confidential source who has
long-standing ties to the Republican Party."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said they did not believe distributing money for
miscellaneous expenses was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Instead our concern is that the disbursements were structured to generate a
large amount of cash that was turned over to an individual or individuals in New
York City who did not wish to be identified publicly as working for the
Republican Party," said a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney David Homer to the
FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Party Spokesman Dan Allen said party officials had become more
stringent in the way they distribute money since the FEC investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The FEC has determined we were in the wrong and we've taken steps over the
last elections to correct that," Allen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC subpoenaed information from Powers, Buley, other GOP officials as
well as banks holding the state party's accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FEC, on the day before the November 1994 election - in
which Republican George Pataki defeated then-Gov. Mario Cuomo - four checks were
cashed from the New York Republican Federal Campaign Committee by four state
party officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley and fellow Republican party lawyer David Dudley cashed checks of
$15,000 each, while GOP lawyer Gregory Serio and Mary Obwald, the receptionist
for the party's Albany office, cashed checks of $10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
	   They handed the $50,000 in cash over to Buley, who drove from Albany to New
York City and delivered it to Powers. Powers then distributed the money to
volunteers coming to GOP headquarters. The amount of the disbursements ranged
from a "couple of hundred to a couple of thousand dollars."
</P>
<P>
	   Any expenditure in excess of $200 must be reported by a political committee
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Republican campaign filing listed the expenditures "as election
day expenses," later amending that filing to describe them as "Travel Expense
Reimbursement and Catering Costs" after the FEC asked for more specific
information.
</P>
<P>
	   The state party used similar tactics in 1996 when New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani handily defeated Democrat Ruth Messinger.
</P>
<P>
	   In that election, eight individuals associated with the party cashed checks
totaling $22,500. Again, they handed the money over to Buley who traveled to New
York City where he delivered the cash to Powers who again handed it out to
"dozens of people."
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Powers gave cash to people simply because they told him they were
supposed to get cash from him," the FEC brief said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Will Debate in Michigan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush will join his fellow GOP
presidential hopefuls in a debate next Monday in Michigan, the third debate in
less than a week that will feature all six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's participation in the Grand Rapids debate was announced by John
Truscott, a spokesman for Michigan Gov. John Engler, an early supporter of Bush
and his Michigan campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor originally was to have spoken in Houston to the American
Farm Bureau Convention on Jan. 10. His new schedule has him delivering the
speech by satellite from New Hampshire before flying to Michigan for the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Truscott denied that Bush's decision on the debate was aimed at avoiding
political fallout that accompanied his skipping several early debates in New
Hampshire, where opinion polls place him in a dead heat with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. Truscott also denied that Bush's change of plans indicated weakness in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Opinsky, McCain's spokesman, noted that Bush's decision to
participate in the debate came on the same day he announced a $1 million
campaign ad buy in vote-rich Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's absence from some early debates in New Hampshire contributed to
McCain's strong gains in polls there, Opinsky said, and speculated it may have
influenced the decision on the Michigan debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think clearly Sen. McCain excelled and overtook Gov. Bush because he was
able to hold town hall forums and participate in several debates in New
Hampshire,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Truscott denied Bush was worried about Engler's state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is sitting very solidly in Michigan,'' Truscott said. ``What it comes
down to is that he is the only candidate running a national campaign. When you
change one event on a schedule, it creates a domino effect on the rest of your
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The rest of the candidates are basically living in New Hampshire,''
Truscott said. ``It is pretty easy for them to move things around since they
don't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Grand Rapids debate, the Republican candidates have
debates schedule for Thursday in New Hampshire and Friday in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Manchester Planned Parenthood clinic closed after threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) - A Planned Parenthood clinic was evacuated
Monday morning after a worker opened a letter the author claimed was
contaminated with anthrax.
<P>
	   A female worker discovered the letter while opening the mail, police said.
The FBI, environmental officials and a police hazardous materials team were
called in and workers were ordered out of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that can strike animals and people.
Though deaths are rare with appropriate treatment, the woman who opened the
letter was isolated at the scene. The road outside the clinic was closed for
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests found the letter was not contaminated, police said. The woman who
opened the letter was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar threat was received at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Providence,
R.I. A spokeswoman at the Providence clinic said Planned Parenthood's Washington
office told her clinics in Florida, Virginia, New Jersey, and Illinois also
received similar letters Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the threats were sent through the mail, the FBI was investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic threats of contamination with the potentially lethal anthrax
bacterium date back several years. The FBI said a spate of letters last year
contained a sticky substance or dark powder and the ominous warning: You've been
contaminated by anthrax.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters have been received in almost every region of the nation. They
often arrive in bunches, at 10 or 15 similar targets in a city. The targets have
been quite varied: Abortion clinics, Catholic schools, nightclubs, department
stores, hospitals, post offices, courthouses, news media offices, FBI offices
and even the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore and GOP field begin dash to first contests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The presidential candidates began a January primary
sprint through Iowa and New Hampshire on Monday, their comments promising
rough-and-tumble days ahead.
<P>
	   Out of the box, Bill Bradley promised a "new world of possibilities" after
seven years of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The vice president said the country
needs a tested leader, suggesting that his sole Democratic rival is less than
that.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, George W. Bush's campaign promised to become tougher
on John McCain, who is threatening the GOP front-runner in New Hampshire and
running new campaign ads in South Carolina and Michigan - critical states in
McCain's uphill battle against Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator plans to air $1 million worth of ads in Michigan before
the Feb. 22 primary. The first, a slick production of his biography that has run
in the earlier primary states, airs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded by agreeing to participate in a GOP debate on Jan. 10 in that
state, viewed as a bellwether for the electorate. It was a replay of the Texas
governor's strategy in New Hampshire, where he agreed to debate there only after
polls showed McCain in a deadheat with the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Michigan forum is one of three GOP debates within five days, starting on
Thursday in New Hampshire and another on Friday in South Carolina. The Democrat
contenders also face-off twice this week, in New Hampshire on Wednesday and in
Iowa on Saturday in a debate-heavy January.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of polls, planes and plans, the campaign shifted into a higher
gear with the dawn of a new year and many voters just beginning to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting begins Jan. 24 in Iowa and Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. Nominees in both
parties could be determined in a blur of activity that peaks March 7, when more
than a dozen states conduct presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The secret to January is managing your campaign message every cycle," said
Republican consultant Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's failed 1996 campaign.
"You want to be on the offensive, not the defensive."
</P>
<P>
	   That's the strategy of the two Democratic and six Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the campaign's next stage a "contest of ideas," Bush has promised
supporters that he will draw sharper distinctions between himself and McCain,
particularly on taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will see the governor engage in an upbeat, optimistic campaign, but he
will not shy away from distinctions," spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor, leads most state GOP polls by wide
margins but was surprised by McCain's ability to eliminate the gap in New
Hampshire polls. Aides are confident that Bush will win Iowa's caucuses, which
are dominated by party stalwarts, and they still hope to claim New Hampshire's
unpredictable primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They worry, however, that the race will continue to tighten.
</P>
<P>
	   One major fight could be over taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, 10-year tax cut package, which dwarfs a
proposal McCain outlined in June. The Arizona senator plans to beef up his
package this month, but it will still be less than half the size of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing a potential line of attack, a Bush aide says a family with two
children would pay $1,000 more in taxes under McCain than under Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, is prepared to question Bush's commitment to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush would spend a bulk of the federal surplus on tax cuts, McCain
says he would dedicate just 23 percent of Washington's extra money to a
tax-cutting plan. For the rest of the surplus, McCain says 62 percent would
bolster Social Security, 10 percent would go to Medicare and 5 percent would pay
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "John McCain has never voted for a tax increase, but he thinks saving Social
Security is the issue," campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's rise in New Hampshire polls has improved his fund raising, allowing
him to pour more money into television advertising. A new spot in South Carolina
promotes the endorsement of Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C..
</P>
<P>
	   McCain isn't Bush's only worry. Wealthy conservative Steve Forbes has made
inroads in Iowa and can afford millions of dollars in ads that raise questions
about the Texas governor. Forbes' internal polls show him gaining on Bush in
Iowa, though he still lags 20 percentage points behind.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's risky decision not to compete in Iowa frees him to campaign in
South Carolina and attend a handful of fund-raisers while Bush battles on two
fronts in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is hoping for a quick boost Tuesday with the announcement that failed
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole is backing him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democrats' campaign of tougher talk, Gore and Bradley squared off in
separate states Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that on many issues, he has the wrong plans. And on some critical
issues, he has no plans," Gore said of Bradley in a speech to 1,000 people at a
high school gym in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to focus on just five big issues: universal health care
insurance, child poverty, more teachers in public schools, tighter gun control
and campaign finance reform. "Now is not the time to settle," he said in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ticks off a laundry list of issues - the five mentioned by Bradley plus
a strong economy, "revolutionary" changes in education, Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,"
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley raised more money than Gore in the last quarter and saved up his
money early in the campaign, allowing him to air more ads than the vice
president of late; he outspent Gore 2-to-1 last month in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> 2d Man Charged in Explosives Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A second Algerian man has been arrested in Washington state,
and authorities are looking into a possible connection with an attempt last
month to smuggle explosives into the country from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, was charged Monday with re-entering the United
States without permission and with eluding examination by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials when he entered the country in November at
Blaine, about 100 miles north of Seattle. He was arrested Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, he would face a maximum 2 1/2 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   No link was made in court with the Dec. 14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam, who faces
five federal counts in connection with bomb-making materials found in his rental
car as he entered the country by ferry from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Law-enforcement officials in Washington, D.C., confirmed they were looking
for a connection. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Hamilton declined comment
after Monday's hearing before U.S. Magistrate David E. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Ralph Hurvitz said he had just gotten the case and had not
yet consulted with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha faces a detention hearing on Wednesday. At a subsequent hearing Jan.
14, the government must either indict Tizegha or show cause why he will remain
in custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha, who was denied political asylum in 1997, was arrested Dec. 24 in
Bellevue. His roommate told the FBI he had sneaked across the U.S.-Canadian
border on foot in late November and then caught a bus to Seattle from
Bellingham, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Charging Tizegha with INS violations would allow authorities to keep him in
custody as they investigate whether he had any role in a potential terrorist
bombing plot or a connection to Ressam, said law-enforcement officials in
Washington, D.C., speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   They said Tizegha was in INS custody before federal agents fanned out around
the country last week to question people possibly linked to Ressam. As a result
of that effort, about 15 people -- mostly Algerians -- were either charged with
criminal violations or held in civil detention.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, 32, was arrested as he entered the country by ferry at Port Angeles.
He was charged with trying to bring powerful explosives and other bomb-making
materials into the United States in his rental car.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, another Algerian man, Abdel Ghani, was arrested in New York
City as an accomplice to Ressam. Ghani allegedly traveled to Seattle to meet
with Ressam and had planned to help him raise money.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, federal prosecutors said that Ressam and a Canadian woman caught
crossing the U.S. border in Vermont five days after Ressam's arrest were both
linked to an Islamic militant group in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court documents, Tizegha first entered the country in 1993 as a
stowaway aboard a ship. He stayed in Boston, where he applied for political
asylum. The request was denied in April 1997, and an appeal to the Board of
Immigration Appeals was denied last June.
</P>
<P>
	   He was given 30 days to leave the country, but disappeared instead.
</P>
<P>
	   His Bellevue roommate -- unidentified in court documents -- told FBI agents
on Dec. 30 that he had known Tizegha for about 14 months, since Tizegha moved to
Seattle in the winter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In August of this year, Tizegha went to Vancouver, British Columbia, and
applied for refugee status there -- a request that apparently is still pending.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 23, the roommate said, he wired Tizegha $40, and Tizegha re-entered
the United States about a week later. The roommate said he burned Tizegha's bus
ticket from Bellingham at Tizegha's request.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Open Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks opened higher in the new millennium's first
trading session Tuesday without any Y2K computer problems. The U.S. dollar was
lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 196.34 points, or 1.04
percent, to 19,130.68 in the opening 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the
average closed up 123.76 points, or 0.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 101.72 yen, down 0.36 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
above its late New York level of 101.56 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese financial markets were closed Dec. 31 through Jan. 3 for the New
Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei traded above 19,000 points in intraday
trading for the first time since Nov. 26. The index moved higher as investors
were relieved that there appeared to be no major Y2K computer problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trading is going smoothly without any trouble related to Y2K," said Yasuo
Sakuragi, a spokesman for the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Among early gainers were high-technology issues, including electronics
giants Sony, NEC and Fujitsu. Losers included major banks and drug
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.61 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 11,357.51 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 16.64 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,738.84. The TOPIX closed up
9.93 points, or 0.58 percent, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was lower against the yen from last week in
Tokyo but edged higher compared with its late New York level.
</P>
<P>
	   Market players were bracing themselves for the possibility of another round
of Bank of Japan intervention to stem the yen's strength. Japan's central bank
bought dollars late last month to stem the greenback's retreat against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese business and government officials have said the yen's rapid rise
could hamper the nation's nascent economic recovery by making its products more
expensive in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 104.19 yen, up from 102.70 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.6800
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6550 percent. Its price fell 0.22 point to
101.87. (km-dj)

<HEADLINE> Croat Opposition Party in Lead  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A center-left opposition coalition headed toward
victory Tuesday over the late president Franjo Tudjman's party, according to
early returns from Croatia's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Monday's balloting, Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union was
trailing in nine of the 10 electoral districts in the vote tally, in some cases
by a margin of more than 2-to-1, election commission head Marijan Ramuscak said.
</P>
<P>
	   A coalition victory would spell the end of Tudjman's party's nine-year grip
on power, which began when Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout was a near record, indicating Croats' awareness that the first
vote after the Dec. 10 death of Tudjman would be critical in determining whether
the country will remain on the authoritarian and nationalist path laid down by
the late president or move toward greater democracy and closer ties to the west.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition has promised to shift power from the presidency to the
parliament. Tudjman enjoyed almost monarchial powers, and the opposition has
said it would make sure the next president has a smaller role. Presidential
elections have been scheduled for Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramuscak did not give precise nationwide figures, but he said the
center-left coalition of the Social Democrats and Social Liberals was leading
with 40 to 50 percent of the votes in most of the districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman's party, known by its Croatian initials HDZ, was trailing with 20 to
32 percent in the different regions. Four smaller opposition parties accounted
for the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic, expected to be the HDZ candidate in the Jan.
24 presidential contest, said the ruling party ``clearly has lost'' the
elections and the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate the winners, Granic said. ``We will be a tough
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the headquarters of the Social Democrat-Liberal coalition, the mood was
one of triumph. The two coalition leaders -- Ivica Racan and Drazen Budisa --
raised their arms as their supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan, leader of the Social Democrats and the coalition's choice for prime
minister, said the results ``are realistic,'' adding, ``we were aware of the
citizens' feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll do our best to justify their confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa, a leader of Social Liberals, is the coalition's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Final results may not be known until Friday, Ramuscak said, adding that no
serious irregularities were reported. Some 400 foreign observers monitored the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a contest between generations and classes,'' said Vanja Rebic, a
29-year-old medical student, after he voted. ``The elderly and rural population
are more inclined to keep the status quo, the young and urban population are
prone to change.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believed an opposition victory would restore hope to the younger
generation, which will likely otherwise be forced to seek employment and a
better life abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout was 78.06 percent of the more than 4.17 million eligible Croats.
They were choosing about 150 seats in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-five parties were competing in the election. The exact number of seats
will depend on the size of the expatriate turnout. Expatriates, many of them in
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, began voting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Croatia is at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and most
Croats feel closer to Western Europe. But many fear that joining the European
Union or NATO could cost some of their national identity.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Roars Into the New Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Led by a mouse, Hollywood roared into the New Year after

<HEADLINE> Tornado Rips Through W. Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A strong storm that spawned at least one tornado
ripped through this western Kentucky city on Monday, damaging a shopping center,
homes and a college campus. Several people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Six people were being treated at a hospital for injuries. Their conditions
were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was part of a band of unstable weather that rolled across the
nation's midsection on Monday. Thunderstorms knocked out power and flooded
streets in Arkansas and a storm damaged more than 20 homes in southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky State Police in Henderson received reports of several tornadoes in
the Owensboro area, a dispatcher said. The National Weather Service confirmed
that one tornado touched down in the city of about 54,000.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency was declared in Owensboro, and a curfew was imposed
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday to keep people off the streets as emergency
crews assessed damage and began the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
	   The tornado struck a shopping center, said Jeff Hovis, a weather service
meteorologist in Paducah. There were no reports of injuries at the shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm caused extensive damage to Kentucky Wesleyan College and to some
businesses lining Frederica Street, a main city thoroughfare. High winds tore
off the roofs of several buildings on the college campus, including the
president's home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every road leading on or off the campus is blocked by downed trees or
power lines, so there is no getting in or out,'' said KWC President Wesley H.
Poling.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes don't start until next week, so few students were around.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Hijack Victims Speak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Jeanne Moore says her status as the only American on
board a hijacked Indian Airlines plane made her fear that she would be singled
out by her captors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always felt the pressure of being an American ... and was always
expecting the worst to happen to me,'' the Press Trust of India news agency
quoted Moore, 53, as saying Monday. ``I comforted myself by thinking about my
family and my friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, a teacher and psychotherapist from Bakersfield, Calif., said the
hijackers took her passport, ``and my offer to speak with my government was
turned down, making me more worried.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore left India on Monday for home, 10 days after her flight from Nepal to
New Delhi was hijacked Dec. 24. Her whereabouts weren't publicly known Monday
night. She and 154 other hostages were freed Dec. 31 after India agreed to
release two Kashmiri militants and a Pakistani fundamentalist cleric.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacked passengers and crew were flown to New Delhi, where they were
welcomed by thousands of weeping, cheering friends and relatives. Moore's son,
Jim, a Bakersfield police officer, also had come to India to accompany her home.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore told her parents in a brief telephone call after the hostages were
freed that she had pneumonia, according to her mother, Marie Redding, 85, of
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
	   Hostage Shirley Macklin, a Canadian, had fears similar to Moore's during the
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said, `Well, OK, so who will they kill?' I'm a likely candidate because
I'm Canadian, that's kind of a high-profile country,'' said the 60-year-old
humanitarian aid worker from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Radio from New Delhi,
Macklin said she came to terms with the possibility of dying during the
standoff. She comforted herself by thinking about her family and doing yoga
exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore thought she was going to be killed when the hijackers asked her to
spell coffin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the bad guys approached me and asked, 'What do you call the box to
keep a body?' I thought it was meant for me,'' Moore said. ``I spelled the word,
`coffin,' and wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to them, not knowing what
was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore described riding a roller coaster of emotions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were scared a lot. We never knew what was going to happen to us,''
Moore told the Los Angeles Times. ``It was a very interesting study in people.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also described how the hijackers played on hostages' nerves. ``At one
point of time they used to terrorize us, and then you see them handing over
packets of food. We were confused,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Though they were nice to women and children, I got hit on my head by one
of the hijackers when I tried to bend and blow off a bug which was troubling me
on my hand,'' she said. ``It is truly amazing that anyone can be so cruel.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Press Trust of India quoted Moore as saying, ``the scene in there was
not just like out of a Hollywood thriller, which is dramatic and exciting. It
was terror and bad stuff. They smelled bad.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets Handle Y2K Smoothly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors were surprised to see the date Jan. 3, 100, on
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Web site Monday morning. But the minor glitch
was one of only a few in the first day of trading in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the major brokerage firms and stock exchanges around the world
reported smooth trading Monday and early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As trading resumed in Tokyo after a long holiday weekend, Japan's benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 196.34 points, or 1.04 percent, at the
start of the session, crossing the 19,000 threshold for the first time since
Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street was expected to remain on alert until trading resumes in the
United Kingdom and the New York Mercantile Exchange, as well as a handful of
other overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had glitches here or there, but from a Y2K perspective it's gone very
well," said Edward Goldberg, executive vice president of operations for Merrill
Lynch. "We're just waiting for London and Tokyo to come alive, and if that goes
well, we'll all relax."
</P>
<P>
	   The glitches included phone lines that went down, the occasional piece of
bad data, and delays in reporting -- but then, things like that happen everyday
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In Time Square, the new Nasdaq Stock Market broadcast and educational
facility opened Monday. Trading went off without a hitch -- as it did in other
major U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq ended the day higher, though both the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Other U.S. markets, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade, experienced no problems.
</P>
<P>
	   This Y2K stress-free day in the markets, however, didn't come cheap. U.S.
brokerage firms spent $5 billion and three years upgrading their computer
systems. And the work didn't end Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Schwab said it was answering a flood of calls from customers who
wanted to be assured of their balances and execution of their trades. The
company's Web site also was clogged with 60,000 simultaneous users for most of
the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The date error on the Philadelphia exchange Web site, which was fixed by
lunchtime, was caused by a computer server, said Kelli Crudo, a spokeswoman for
the exchange. The exchange itself opened with a "seamless transition" into the
new year, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the world, the news was similar. Stock indexes in Hong Kong and
Singapore, both of which rang out 1999 at record levels, soared again Monday,
with Singapore's main index up 4.2 percent and Hong Kong shares up 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan, one of the countries experts were most worried about, opened its
stock market with success, as did India.
</P>
<P>
	   Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Poland reported no Y2K problems. Markets in
Japan, China, Switzerland and London were closed Monday, but Britain's Cabinet
Office reported business as usual and Swiss banks noted no signs of
abnormalities.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Convention Faces Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By ROCHELLE OLSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The new chairman of the Reform Party plans a third
vote on the site of the party's 2000 presidential convention to settle a dispute
between factions supporting Gov. Jesse Ventura and Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're starting from scratch,'' Jack Gargan said Monday, declaring he would
set aside earlier votes -- one that would put the convention in Long Beach,
Calif., the other favoring St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Chairman Russ Verney, a Perot ally, criticized the decision by
Gargan, who took over Jan. 1 and is seen as a Ventura ally because the governor
supported him for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a temper tantrum by Jesse's boys up there who want the convention
in Minnesota so they can stack the deck,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Gargan suggested new national committee members who
support presidential candidate Pat Buchanan could sway the coming vote against
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of the new members are Buchanan backers and the governor said some
uncomplimentary things'' about him, said Gargan.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan spokesman Neil Bernstein said the convention site won't change the
candidate's plans. ``We're the only declared candidate right now,'' Bernstein
said. ``Wherever the convention is, we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura said he wasn't worried about the dispute hurting the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a growing pain that we're going through, growing beyond Mr. Perot,''
Ventura said. ``There's going to be infighting. That makes for great politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan said he plans a mail-in vote by the 140-member national committee by
the end of the month so he doesn't have to choose between the two previous
votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The site of the convention has been one of the most visible battles between
the supporters of Ventura and those loyal to party founder Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   Verney conducted the first vote in September. That went for California. In
November, Minnesota Chairman Rick McCluhan and California Chairman Paul Hale
conducted the second vote, a poll of national committee members by mail.
Minnesota won.
</P>
<P>
	   Verney called McCluhan's vote a ``farce'' and put a $2,000 down payment on
the Long Beach site. McCluhan went to federal court and unsuccessfully asked a
judge to rule on Minnesota's behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Verney said the party could lose up to $36,000 by not following through on
the Long Beach contract, but he added, ``It's not the issue of the money. This
is foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura is encouraging other candidates to get into the race. Donald Trump
will be in the Twin Cities on Friday to meet with the governor and attend a
state party fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   Verney believes Ventura supporters -- including Gargan -- want to block a
Buchanan candidacy. If the convention is held in Minnesota, it would be easier
for the pro-Ventura faction to attend and influence the choice of a presidential
nominee to their liking.

<HEADLINE> Church Group To Fight For Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- The representatives of an influential American church
organization met with the father of a 6-year-old boy rescued off Florida's coast
and promised to press the U.S. government to return the child to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to help our president see that the issue is a moral one, a
humanitarian one,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the outgoing general
secretary of the National Council of Churches. ``We need to be concerned for a
small boy rather than politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell spoke with reporters after meeting with Elian Gonzalez' father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the child's four grandparents and great-grandmother in
this coastal town about a two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by Cuban church representatives, Campbell, a Baptist minister,
was clearly affected by her hourlong visit inside Gonzalez' modest two-story
home, built of brick and cement on an unpaved street where horse-drawn carts are
as common as automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very loving family,'' Campbell said, appearing to be on the
verge of tears. ``We are more convinced than ever that this child belongs with
this family. We will work very hard to make sure (Elian) comes back very soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the council is willing to play a mediation role in the dispute and
even to physically transport Elian back to Cuba and turn him over to the Cuban
Council of Churches to be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The council is the United States' largest ecumenical organization,
representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations comprising 52 million
congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials gave temporary custody of Elian to his paternal great-uncle
in Miami in late November after the child was found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast. Elian's mother died in the apparent attempt to illegally
immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has become a political tug-of-war, with Gonzalez demanding that his
son be returned to him in Cuba and the great-uncle fighting to keep the child in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   People on both sides of the Florida Straits have used the case to make their
own political points for or against Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the great things about this country, one of the blessings of
freedom that Elian will enjoy here is that everyone is free to speak their
mind,'' Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Miami relatives said Monday of the
council of churches campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez, who has shunned publicity in recent weeks, said he was grateful
for the council's efforts. He said he understood his son was well, but that he
missed him very much. ``How could I not miss him?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that he met a second time with Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials on Friday, but declined to provide details for fear of harming
his case.
</P>
<P>
	   During an earlier meeting with INS officials in Cuba, Gonzalez provided them
with the boy's birth certificate, photographs and other documents aimed at
proving his paternity and assumption of parental responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was to present his own case to the
INS in Miami before Christmas, but that meeting was postponed until Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said she had informed the White House about the group's trip and
efforts to reunite Elian with his father.

<HEADLINE> McCain Rolls Out Anti-Clinton Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With South Carolina critical to his campaign strategy,
Sen. John McCain's new advertisements there feature a local favorite who takes
aim at President Clinton rather than Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lindsey Graham, who endorsed the Arizona senator in June, touts McCain
as the man to ``bring honor back to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain is the polar opposite of Bill Clinton,'' Graham, R-S.C., says
in a radio ad that began airing in South Carolina on Monday. ``He has absolute
total character and candor -- the missing element during the Clinton years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graham is not quite as direct in a TV ad that begins airing Tuesday,
accusing Clinton of betraying the military. He also mentions McCain's time as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam and his efforts to reform campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, on his way to a town hall meeting in Amherst, N.H., told reporters
the ad was meant to tap into so-called Clinton scandal fatigue, and he admitted
that he would rather have Graham go after Clinton on his behalf than deliver
such criticism himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would be a different kind of commander and chief as far as the military
is concerned,'' McCain said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign said the ads were being purchased statewide. The
television spot will be seen 10 to 12 times over 10 days by the average viewer,
said one campaign official, declining to say how much the campaign was spending
to air it.
</P>
<P>
	   It was spending about $50,000 a week to air the radio ad, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has pulled at least even with the Texas governor in New
Hampshire, is counting on South Carolinians to keep momentum going when they
vote on Feb. 19. He's targeting his appeal to veterans in the state, hoping his
military service will attract support.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham, one of McCain's most prominent backers in South Carolina, is playing
off his role as one of 13 House Republicans who argued the impeachment case
against President Clinton to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham introduced McCain several times during a recent South Carolina trip
by regaling the crowd with stories about the impeachment trial and his
involvement in Clinton's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an anniversary of sorts,'' he said. ``A year ago, I was looking
through some amazing material,'' he said, referring to independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham was raring to talk about impeachment, said Greg Stevens, who produced
the ads for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He talks about (it) without any prompting from us,'' he said. ``There was
no script.''
</P>
<P>
	   Impeachment, of course, was not popular with most Americans, so there's a
small risk that bringing the topic up could come back to bite McCain. But
outside observers think that's unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For Republican voters, there's not much risk at all,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center. As for the fall, should McCain topple Bush:
``I think South Carolina is going to be long forgotten by the time we get to the
general election.''

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Threat Closes Ala. Clinics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- An abortion clinic where a bomb killed a security
guard in 1998 was evacuated Monday after employees were told an anthrax-laced
letter was delivered with the day's mail. Other clinics and offices around the
country received similar threats.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Woman All Women Heath Care Clinic contacted authorities after
receiving a fax informing them of the threat. Police confiscated the letter,
which had not been opened, said Lt. Moody Duff.
</P>
<P>
	   Duff said all but two employees were evacuated from the building while
federal investigators tried to analyze the letter and determine if it were
filled with the deadly bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   An off-duty police officer was killed and a nurse severely injured when the
clinic was bombed in January 1998. Suspected serial bomber Eric Robert Rudolph

<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) - A Planned Parenthood clinic was evacuated
Monday morning after a worker opened a letter the author claimed was
contaminated with anthrax.
<P>
	   Similar threats were received at Planned Parenthood clinics in Birmingham,
Ala., where a bomb killed a security guard in 1998; Providence, R.I.; Naples,
Fla., and a government unemployment office in Immokalee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   A female worker at the Manchester clinic discovered the letter while opening
the mail, police said. The FBI, environmental officials and a police hazardous

<P>
	   Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that can strike animals and people.
The woman who opened the letter was isolated at the scene. The road outside the
clinic was closed for about an hour.

opened the letter was not harmed.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Suggests Y2K Buy Was Hyped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's communist government suggested Monday that the threat
of the so-called millennium bug was hyped by some to make money.
</P>
<P>
	   Juventud Rebelde, the newspaper of the Communist Youth Union, said in a
front-page story that the very few problems worldwide associated with ``the
much-publicized electronic error brings suspicions that that the enormous
investments in computers obeyed an audacious market maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the paper, the government went on to say that Cuba's Y2K efforts had
proved successful and no problems had been reported in the country. Cuba, which
controls the nation's economy, spent three years and $100 million to correct the
Y2K computer glitch.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Drug Trafficking Role Eyed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SWEETWATER, Fla. (AP) -- The Cuban government has been involved in efforts to
smuggle drugs into the United States, witnesses told a House committee on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Masetti, a former Cuban intelligence agent, and Ileana de la Guardia,
the daughter of a Cuban colonel executed in 1989 for drug trafficking, gave
their testimony, adding to what some House members say is a growing account of
the island nation's role in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cuba used the drug trafficking route to send weapons to Colombia and in
exchange they paid them with favors; for example, many of them bring the drugs
through Cuba,'' Masetti, who now lives in Spain, told the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee members want Cuba added to the U.S. government's so-called
``Major's List'' of drug-trafficking countries. Cuba has denied the allegations
of drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, has said there is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Cuban
leadership is involved in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Masetti, who claims the Cuban government helped finance a 1983 robbery of a
Wells Fargo armored truck in West Hartford, Conn., which netted $7.2 million,
also told committee members he saw diplomatic pouches filled with dollars --
presumably drug profits -- in low denominations brought into Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These bags were brought, one half to the Ministry of the Interior, the
other half to Jose Naranjo, aide to Fidel Castro,'' Masetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Guardia, the daughter of Cuban Col. Antonio de la Guardia, testified
that her father took the fall for higher-ups in the government. She said her
father did not have the rank to give drug traffickers' planes free passage
through Cuban air space.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This had to come from a higher level of authority, namely, Raul Castro,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said it was important to hear a witness
``directly corroborate the Cuban government's participation in drug-trafficking
activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee members said there is evidence the Cuban government has been
involved in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., cited the seizure of a 7.5-ton cocaine
shipment by Colombia's narcotics police Dec. 3, 1998. House committee members
said they believe the shipment was destined to pass through Cuban waters before
reaching the United States.

<HEADLINE> 10 Stowaways Dead in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Dock workers in northeastern Brazil unloading
cocoa from a ship discovered the bodies of 10 stowaways, likely victims of
accidental insecticide poisoning, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were found at Ilheus, 500 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro,
federal Police Chief Rubem Patury said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the men were probably trying to enter Brazil illegally. So far none
has been identified. The ship brought cocoa from the Ivory Coast to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Police suspect the victims were poisoned when Brazilian authorities sprayed
the cocoa with insecticide, a routine practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Police expect more bodies to be found as crews continued to unload the 8,700
ton cocoa shipment from the cargo ship, Karonga, which departed from Abdijan
about two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Brown Inaugurated as Houston Mayor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Lee P. Brown, Houston's first black mayor, celebrated his
second inauguration Monday and pledged to turn the city's environmental woes
around.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, 62, marked the beginning of his second term by comparing and
contrasting the Houston of 1900 with the nation's fourth-largest city of today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One hundred years ago, we faced a similar problem, when the federal
government told the City of Houston to clean the sewage in its drinking-water
supply,'' Brown said. ``It took years, but the problem was solved, because we
are a can-do city and have always been about progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The city faces a similar problem since earning the ``unwanted distinction''
of topping the federal government's list of cities with the worst smog and ozone
problems, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said air-quality issues are also important reasons to improve the
city's transportation infrastructure, via highway construction and the
implementation of a light rail system.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown handily won re-election in November with 67 percent of the vote
against two fringe candidates.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Evacuated From Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Authorities began forcing hundreds of people from
their homes Monday, after they remained in a disaster area where mudslides that
last month killed tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
	   Angel Rangel, national civil defense director, said officials planned to
make about 2,500 people leave their homes because they were located in high-risk
areas in Caracas and along Venezuela's Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
	   A Dec. 15 avalanche in the area killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people,
according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of survivors have stayed behind in the disaster zone, saying they
prefer to live in their neighborhoods than in a shelter for flood victims.
Rangel said President Hugo Chavez' had issued the order to evacuate the
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   However, many people also will be allowed to remain in the disaster zone
because their houses are not located in the valleys where avalanches of mud,
rocks, trees and water came roaring down Mount Avila, Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The evacuations were expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, heavy rains and flooding destroyed the homes of 200 people
in the border state of Tachira, forcing its international airport to shut down
and prompting a declaration of a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 2,000 people evacuated their homes and sought shelter in schools
and stadiums, although there were no reports of deaths in the state, Tachira
Gov. Sergio Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
	   A leading Venezuelan human rights group called Monday for an investigation
into allegations that some soldiers and police patrolling the disaster area in
Caracas and along the coast had committed human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, Provea, said it had received reports that police ordered three
people suspected of looting abandoned homes to get on their knees and then shot
them to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Raul Salazar has denied that security forces committed
human rights abuses in the disaster zone.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Begin Primary Sprint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential candidates began a January primary sprint
through Iowa and New Hampshire Monday, their comments promising rough-and-tumble
days ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of the box, Bill Bradley promised a ``new world of possibilities'' after
seven years of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The vice president said the country
needs a tested leader, suggesting that his sole Democratic rival is less than
that.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, George W. Bush's campaign promised to become tougher
on John McCain, who is threatening the GOP front-runner in New Hampshire and
running new campaign ads in South Carolina and Michigan -- critical states in
McCain's uphill battle against Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator plans to air $1 million worth of ads in Michigan before
the Feb. 22 primary. The first, a slick production of his biography that has run
in the earlier primary states, airs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded by agreeing to participate in a GOP debate on Jan. 10 in that
state, viewed as a bellwether for the electorate. It was a replay of the Texas
governor's strategy in New Hampshire, where he agreed to debate there only after
polls showed McCain in a deadheat with the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wasn't sure they were taking the debate real seriously,'' Bush said in
Manchester, N.H., dismissing any suggestion his decision was a sign he is
worried about his standing in Michigan. ``When I heard this was a real debate, I
thought it was important for me to participate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Michigan forum is one of three GOP debates within five days, starting on
Thursday in New Hampshire and another on Friday in South Carolina. The Democrat
contenders also face-off twice this week, in New Hampshire on Wednesday and in
Iowa on Saturday in a debate-heavy January.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of polls, planes and plans, the campaign shifted into a higher
gear with the dawn of a new year and many voters just beginning to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting begins Jan. 24 in Iowa and Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. Nominees in both
parties could be determined in a blur of activity that peaks March 7, when more
than a dozen states conduct presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The secret to January is managing your campaign message every cycle,''
said Republican consultant Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's failed 1996
campaign. ``You want to be on the offensive, not the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's the strategy of the two Democratic and six Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the campaign's next stage a ``contest of ideas,'' Bush has promised
supporters that he will draw sharper distinctions between himself and McCain,
particularly on taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You will see the governor engage in an upbeat, optimistic campaign, but he
will not shy away from distinctions,'' spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor, leads most state GOP polls by wide
margins but was surprised by McCain's ability to eliminate the gap in New
Hampshire polls. Aides are confident that Bush will win Iowa's caucuses, which
are dominated by party stalwarts, and they still hope to claim New Hampshire's
unpredictable primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They worry, however, that the race will continue to tighten.
</P>
<P>
	   One major fight could be over taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, 10-year tax cut package, which dwarfs a
proposal McCain outlined in June. The Arizona senator plans to beef up his
package this month, but it will still be less than half the size of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing a potential line of attack, a Bush aide says a family with two
children would pay $1,000 more in taxes under McCain than under Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, is prepared to question Bush's commitment to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush would spend a bulk of the federal surplus on tax cuts, McCain
says he would dedicate just 23 percent of Washington's extra money to a
tax-cutting plan. For the rest of the surplus, McCain says 62 percent would
bolster Social Security, 10 percent would go to Medicare and 5 percent would pay
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain has never voted for a tax increase, but he thinks saving
Social Security is the issue,'' campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's rise in New Hampshire polls has improved his fund raising, allowing
him to pour more money into television advertising. A new spot in South Carolina
promotes the endorsement of Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C..
</P>
<P>
	   McCain isn't Bush's only worry. Wealthy conservative Steve Forbes has made
inroads in Iowa and can afford millions of dollars in ads that raise questions
about the Texas governor. Forbes' internal polls show him gaining on Bush in
Iowa, though he still lags 20 percentage points behind.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's risky decision not to compete in Iowa frees him to campaign in
South Carolina and attend a handful of fund-raisers while Bush battles on two
fronts in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is hoping for a quick boost Tuesday with the announcement that failed
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole is backing him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democrats' campaign of tougher talk, Gore and Bradley squared off in
separate states Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that on many issues, he has the wrong plans. And on some
critical issues, he has no plans,'' Gore said of Bradley in a speech to 1,000
people at a high school gym in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to focus on just five big issues: universal health care
insurance, child poverty, more teachers in public schools, tighter gun control
and campaign finance reform. ``Now is not the time to settle,'' he said in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ticks off a laundry list of issues -- the five mentioned by Bradley
plus a strong economy, ``revolutionary'' changes in education, Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,''
the vice president said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 139.61; Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- As fears of Y2K computer crashes waned, concern about
rising interest rates returned to Wall Street Monday, holding most stocks lower
on the first day of trading in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Lifting of the Y2K cloud helped boost technology shares as some analysts
predicted a round of corporate spending on high-tech initiatives.That helped
lift the Nasdaq composite index to yet another closing high.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, investors had to weather some wide price swings Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.61 to close at 11,357.51, while
the Nasdaq composite index rose 61.84 to 4,131.15. The Nasdaq opened the day by
rising more than 120 points, then dipped as much as 79 points before recovering.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 14.03 to 1,455.22
</P>
<P>
	   All three market indicators set new closing records on Friday, rounding out
a fifth straight year of double-digit returns. The strong performance, which
escalated in the closing weeks of 1999, set up some stocks for scattered
profit-taking Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many investors had held onto stocks in December to avoid paying capital
gains taxes for 1999. The start of the new year means investors who sell stocks
now won't pay tax on their gains until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks initially rallied Monday as trading began without any Y2K problems.
But the good news for stocks proved devastating to the bond market, which
tumbled as investors bet the Fed will return to a policy of higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed, which raised rates three times last year in an effort to stave off
inflation, opted not to raise rates for a fourth time at the close of 1999,
saying it wanted to ensure monetary stability while Y2K bugs were still
perceived as a threat to the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   With Y2K out of the way, analysts believe the Fed will raise rates as soon
as Feb. 1, when its Open Market Committee next meets. Central bankers received
evidence of the economy's strength Monday, when the National Association of
Purchasing Management said the industrial sector of the economy grew in December
for the 11th consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers' report also said its price index, which measures
the cost of raw materials, rose for the eighth month in a row. Many economists
had expected the indexes to rise more sharply, but the moderate increases
rattled investors nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   "The figures were not sufficiently restrained to suggest that the Fed may
remain on hold," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The report pushed the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond as high as 6.62
percent, up from 6.48 at the close of trading Friday. Bond yields are now at the
highest levels since Sept. 11, 1997, when long-term yields closed at 6.69
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising yields can hurt stocks by presenting an appealing alternative to more
volatile stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "With bond yields rising, it may be time to take back some of the big gains
registered in the stock market last year," said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services companies, which are especially vulnerable to inflation
and interest rate swings, tumbled. American Express fell 8 11/16 to 157 9/16 and
J.P. Morgan fell 5 3/16 to 121 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet technology stocks were mostly higher. Analysts suggested that the
apparent end of Y2K-related worries may prompt a new round of technology
spending in the coming months. CMGI, which invests in young Internet companies,
soared 49 9/16. JDS Uniphase rose 26 11/16 to 188.
</P>
<P>
	   Amgen rose 2 7/8 to 62 15/16 after PaineWebber's chief investment strategist
Ed Kerschner added the biotechnology company to a list of highlighted stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Technology stocks are truly a mania on Wall Street," Meehan said. "I don't
see that changing any time soon."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. markets might have fared worse had financial markets around the world
faltered due to Year 2000-related computer problems. But markets that opened for
trading Monday ran smoothly; France's CAC-40 index fell 0.7 percent and
Germany's Xetra DAX tumbled 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other major stock markets remained closed, extending the New Year's
holiday and allowing an extra day of testing on key computer systems. The Tokyo
Stock Exchange and Britain's stock market will reopen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.17 billion shares, compared
with 541.95 million at the close of Friday's shortened session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.70 to 497.05.

<HEADLINE> 2d Man Charged in Explosives Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A second Algerian man has been arrested in Washington state,
and authorities are looking into a possible connection with an attempt last
month to smuggle explosives into the country from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   A second man has also been arrested in New York in connection with the
smuggling attempt, a source familiar with the investigation said Monday on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, was arrested outside Seattle on Dec. 24. He was
charged Monday with re-entering the United States without permission and with
eluding examination by Immigration and Naturalization Service officials when he
entered the country in November at Blaine, about 100 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, he would face a maximum 2 1/2 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   No link was made in court with the Dec. 14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam, who faces
five federal counts in connection with bomb-making materials found in his rental
car as he entered the country by ferry from Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Law-enforcement officials in Washington, D.C., confirmed they were looking
for a connection. Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Hamilton declined comment after
Monday's hearing before U.S. Magistrate David E. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Ralph Hurvitz said he had just gotten the case and had not
yet consulted with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha faces a detention hearing on Wednesday. At Jan. 14 hearing, the
government must either indict Tizegha or show cause why he will remain in
custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha, who was denied political asylum in 1997, was arrested in the
Seattle suburb of Bellevue. His roommate told the FBI he had sneaked across the
U.S.-Canadian border on foot in late November and then caught a bus to Seattle
from Bellingham, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Charging Tizegha with INS violations would allow authorities to keep him in
custody as they investigate whether he had any role in a potential terrorist
bombing plot or a connection to Ressam, said law-enforcement officials in
Washington, D.C., speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   They said Tizegha was in INS custody before federal agents fanned out around
the country last week to question people possibly linked to Ressam. As a result
of that effort, about 15 people -- mostly Algerians -- were either charged with
criminal violations or held in civil detention.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, 32, was arrested as he entered the country by ferry at Port Angeles.
He was charged with trying to bring powerful explosives and other bomb-making
materials into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, another Algerian man, Abdel Ghani, was arrested in New York
City as an accomplice to Ressam. Ghani allegedly traveled to Seattle to meet
with Ressam and had planned to help him raise money.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who was in the apartment where Ghani was arrested was taken into
custody Saturday as he tried to leave the country for Paris, possibly an attempt
to avoid being called upon as a witness in the case, the source in New York
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The man appeared in federal court Monday during a secret proceeding, an
initial court appearance on a sealed criminal complaint, the source said. A
spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said nothing was on the public record
for him to discuss.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, federal prosecutors said that Ressam and a Canadian woman caught
crossing the U.S. border in Vermont five days after Ressam's arrest were both
linked to an Islamic militant group in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court documents, Tizegha first entered the country in 1993 as a
stowaway aboard a ship. He stayed in Boston, where he applied for political
asylum. The request was denied in April 1997, and an appeal to the Board of
Immigration Appeals was denied last June.
</P>
<P>
	   He was given 30 days to leave the country, but disappeared instead.
</P>
<P>
	   His Bellevue roommate -- unidentified in court documents -- told FBI agents
on Dec. 30 that he had known Tizegha for about 14 months, since Tizegha moved to
Seattle in the winter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In August of this year, Tizegha went to Vancouver, British Columbia, and
applied for refugee status there -- a request that apparently is still pending.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 23, the roommate said, he wired Tizegha $40, and Tizegha re-entered
the United States about a week later. The roommate said he burned Tizegha's bus
ticket from Bellingham at Tizegha's request.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Rips Through W. Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A strong storm that spawned at least one tornado
ripped through this western Kentucky city on Monday, damaging a shopping center,
hundreds of homes and a college campus. Several people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 12 people were treated at hospitals, said Ray Bowman, a state
emergency official. Their conditions were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was part of a band of unstable weather that rolled across the
nation's midsection on Monday. Thunderstorms knocked out power and flooded
streets in Arkansas and a storm damaged more than 20 homes in southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky State Police in Henderson received reports of several tornadoes in
the Owensboro area, a dispatcher said. The National Weather Service confirmed
that one tornado touched down in the city of about 54,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were sitting at home and the wind started picking up, and then it
started pouring down rain and things started to fly,'' said Marti Fenwick, a
mother of three whose home was damaged by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency was declared in Owensboro, and a curfew was imposed
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday to keep people off the streets as emergency
crews assessed damage and began the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm damaged 750 homes and 35 businesses and caused widespread power
outages, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Crittenden County, nearly two dozen homes were damaged, and a
tornado was reported in Webster County as the storms skipped across western
Kentucky and north-central Kentucky throughout Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm caused extensive damage to Kentucky Wesleyan College and to some
businesses lining a main city thoroughfare. High winds tore off the roofs of
several buildings on the college campus, including the president's home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every road leading on or off the campus is blocked by downed trees or
power lines, so there is no getting in or out,'' said college president Wesley
H. Poling.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes don't start until next week, so few students were around.

<HEADLINE> Bush Will Debate in Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush will join his fellow GOP
presidential hopefuls in a debate next Monday in Michigan, the third debate in
less than a week that will feature all six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be three debates in five days and I hope the American public can
stand it,'' Bush joked Monday night after arriving here to start a week-long
campaign swing that takes him to New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and
Michigan -- all early voting caucus and primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's participation in the Grand Rapids debate was announced by John
Truscott, a spokesman for Michigan Gov. John Engler, an early supporter of Bush
and his Michigan campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor originally was to have spoken in Houston to the American
Farm Bureau Convention on Jan. 10. His new schedule has him delivering the
speech by satellite from New Hampshire before flying to Michigan for the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Truscott denied that Bush's decision on the debate was aimed at avoiding
political fallout that accompanied his skipping several early debates in New
Hampshire, where opinion polls place him in a dead heat with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. Truscott also denied that Bush's change of plans indicated weakness in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he decided to join the debate because people were taking it ``real
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I heard this was a real debate, I thought it was important for me to
participate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arriving in Manchester during a downpour, the Texas governor told reporters
he was ``excited to be here'' in the nation's first primary state with a lead
off Feb. 1 contest eight days after the Iowa caucuses. He said his core campaign
themes would be tax cuts and education reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm exicted to be here,'' Bush said. ``I thought I'd rather be fishing,
but now that I'm on the ground, I'd rather be campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who held no campaign events Monday night, was asked by reporters what
he thought about Russia's acting President Vladimir Putin, who got the job after
the surprise New Year's resignation of Boris Yeltsin. Putin has gained support
in Russia by promoting Moscow's military offensive in Chechnya, a breakaway
region, and he is expected to run for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm troubled by the fact that Mr. Putin has gained popularity as a result
of Chechnya,'' Bush said. ``I'm hopeful that he will lead his country to
substantive and real reforms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Opinsky, McCain's spokesman, noted that Bush's decision to
participate in the debate came on the same day he announced a $1 million
campaign ad buy in vote-rich Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's absence from some early debates in New Hampshire contributed to
McCain's strong gains in polls there, Opinsky said, and speculated it may have
influenced the decision on the Michigan debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think clearly Sen. McCain excelled and overtook Gov. Bush because he was
able to hold town hall forums and participate in several debates in New
Hampshire,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Grand Rapids debate, the Republican candidates have
debates schedule for Thursday in New Hampshire and Friday in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore and GOP field begin dash to first contests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The presidential candidates began a January primary
sprint through Iowa and New Hampshire Monday, their comments promising
rough-and-tumble days ahead.
<P>
	   Out of the box, Bill Bradley promised a "new world of possibilities" after
seven years of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The vice president said the country
needs a tested leader, suggesting that his sole Democratic rival is less than
that.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, George W. Bush's campaign promised to become tougher
on John McCain, who is threatening the GOP front-runner in New Hampshire and
running new campaign ads in South Carolina and Michigan - critical states in
McCain's uphill battle against Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator plans to air $1 million worth of ads in Michigan before
the Feb. 22 primary. The first, a slick production of his biography that has run
in the earlier primary states, airs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded by agreeing to participate in a GOP debate on Jan. 10 in that
state, viewed as a bellwether for the electorate. It was a replay of the Texas
governor's strategy in New Hampshire, where he agreed to debate there only after
polls showed McCain in a deadheat with the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't sure they were taking the debate real seriously," Bush said in
Manchester, N.H., dismissing any suggestion his decision was a sign he is
worried about his standing in Michigan. "When I heard this was a real debate, I
thought it was important for me to participate."
</P>
<P>
	   The Michigan forum is one of three GOP debates within five days, starting on
Thursday in New Hampshire and another on Friday in South Carolina. The Democrat
contenders also face-off twice this week, in New Hampshire on Wednesday and in
Iowa on Saturday in a debate-heavy January.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of polls, planes and plans, the campaign shifted into a higher
gear with the dawn of a new year and many voters just beginning to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting begins Jan. 24 in Iowa and Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. Nominees in both
parties could be determined in a blur of activity that peaks March 7, when more
than a dozen states conduct presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The secret to January is managing your campaign message every cycle," said
Republican consultant Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's failed 1996 campaign.
"You want to be on the offensive, not the defensive."
</P>
<P>
	   That's the strategy of the two Democratic and six Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the campaign's next stage a "contest of ideas," Bush has promised
supporters that he will draw sharper distinctions between himself and McCain,
particularly on taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
	   "You will see the governor engage in an upbeat, optimistic campaign, but he
will not shy away from distinctions," spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the two-term Texas governor, leads most state GOP polls by wide
margins but was surprised by McCain's ability to eliminate the gap in New
Hampshire polls. Aides are confident that Bush will win Iowa's caucuses, which
are dominated by party stalwarts, and they still hope to claim New Hampshire's
unpredictable primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They worry, however, that the race will continue to tighten.
</P>
<P>
	   One major fight could be over taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, 10-year tax cut package, which dwarfs a
proposal McCain outlined in June. The Arizona senator plans to beef up his
package this month, but it will still be less than half the size of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing a potential line of attack, a Bush aide says a family with two
children would pay $1,000 more in taxes under McCain than under Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, is prepared to question Bush's commitment to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush would spend a bulk of the federal surplus on tax cuts, McCain
says he would dedicate just 23 percent of Washington's extra money to a
tax-cutting plan. For the rest of the surplus, McCain says 62 percent would
bolster Social Security, 10 percent would go to Medicare and 5 percent would pay
down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "John McCain has never voted for a tax increase, but he thinks saving Social
Security is the issue," campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's rise in New Hampshire polls has improved his fund raising, allowing
him to pour more money into television advertising. A new spot in South Carolina
promotes the endorsement of Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C..
</P>
<P>
	   McCain isn't Bush's only worry. Wealthy conservative Steve Forbes has made
inroads in Iowa and can afford millions of dollars in ads that raise questions
about the Texas governor. Forbes' internal polls show him gaining on Bush in
Iowa, though he still lags 20 percentage points behind.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's risky decision not to compete in Iowa frees him to campaign in
South Carolina and attend a handful of fund-raisers while Bush battles on two
fronts in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is hoping for a quick boost Tuesday with the announcement that failed
presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole is backing him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democrats' campaign of tougher talk, Gore and Bradley squared off in
separate states Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that on many issues, he has the wrong plans. And on some critical
issues, he has no plans," Gore said of Bradley in a speech to 1,000 people at a
high school gym in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to focus on just five big issues: universal health care
insurance, child poverty, more teachers in public schools, tighter gun control
and campaign finance reform. "Now is not the time to settle," he said in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ticks off a laundry list of issues - the five mentioned by Bradley plus
a strong economy, "revolutionary" changes in education, Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,"
the vice president said.

<HEADLINE> Dead Dolphins Wash Ashore in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Scientists are trying to learn why dead
dolphins are washing up on northwest Florida shores.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, three dolphin carcasses a day washed ashore and over the
last month, the average has been about one daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Most were full-grown, had bellies full of fish and many of the females were
pregnant, said George Gray, coordinator for a Fort Walton Beach wildlife rescue
group. That evidence rules out various sicknesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials suspect the deaths may be related to an outbreak of red tide, but
that has not been confirmed pending laboratory tests. Red tide is an algae that
in significant concentrations can be deadly to sealife and harmful to humans.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the dolphins washed up in Choctawhatchee Bay and its connecting
bayous, but a few have turned up dead on Gulf Coast beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   In late summer and early fall, a red tide outbreak near Fort Walton Beach
killed thousands of fish, but no dolphins were affected. Dozens died during a
simultaneous outbreak about 50 miles south near Panama City.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey blood banks plan education campaign on importance of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Less than 5 percent of United States residents who
are eligible to donate blood actually do, according to a blood bank official.
But New Jersey blood banks, enduring their typical winter shortages, are trying
to get more people into the habit.
<P>
	   A task force of representatives from hospitals and blood banks is expected
to send recommendations to Gov. Christie Whitman in about two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the holidays and an early start to flu season, supplies are so
low at some state blood banks their blood would last only a day if needed for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blood Bank Task Force of New Jersey, which was created six months ago to
increase the number of regular donors, plans an education campaign, said Dr.
Mercy Kuriyan, chair of the panel, which is comprised of seven blood centers and
at least three hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force is considering a widespread blood awareness plan to teach
residents about the need for donated blood, and to teach elementary students
about the importance of donating, although they wouldn't be able to until they
turned 17, Kuriyan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood donations in New Jersey declined between 1992 and 1997, according to
the state Department of Health and Senior Services, so blood is imported from
other states to satisfy demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Donations within New Jersey would have had to increase by more than 32
percent - or 94,000 donations - to meet the demands of people hospitalized in
the state in 1998, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Gosnay, operations officer of the Community Blood Council of New Jersey
in Ewing, said Monday that less than 5 percent of the people in the United
States who are eligible to give blood actually donate. If just 10 percent of
those who could contributed blood, shortages like the current one would be very
rare, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gosnay, also a member of the task force, said he thinks businesses should
give time off to employees to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are trying to ... create more of a sense of urgency to corporate leaders
to encourage employees to donate more blood," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gosnay said another reason there are so few donors is the fear of needles,
which, he said, "we have to overcome."
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the typical donor is of the "World War II generation," he said, which
is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
	   Gosnay said while donations have been stagnant, demand has increased.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, blood utilization is up because the treatments today are more
sophisticated, like cancer therapy," Gosnay said. Such treatments, which have
increased in New Jersey by about 8 percent in the last five years, require a lot
of blood, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During shortages, doctors are asked to limit the number of elective
surgeries they schedule, said Diana Doherty, component coordinator and recruiter
at the New Brunswick Affiliated Hospitals Blood Center at Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   To donate blood, a person must be in good health and weigh at least 110
pounds. In New Jersey a person can donate blood at age 17 with written parental
consent.

   By The Associated Press Note: All dollars are Canadian unless otherwise noted
Y2K Stockpilers Clamor to Return Items
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Some Canadians who furiously stockpiled gas masks,
generators and kerosene lamps because of looming Y2K fears were clamoring to
return the items Monday after the much-ballyhooed date passed without incident.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're returning everything they bought,'' said Nicole Foley, who works
at a Canadian Tire store in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Propane, kerosene, flashlights, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hoarding began in earnest in the weeks leading up to the rollover to the
year 2000 amid concerns about computer glitches causing power outages and sewage
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   But now that the calendar change has come and gone with no major headaches,
some consumers are miffed that their fear-fueled purchases are non-returnable.
</P>
<P>
	   Some retailers, in anticipation of a returns frenzy, emphatically warned
that sales of Y2K-related items were final.
------ Organizations Take New Projects Off Shelf
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadian businesses and governments are poised to create a
boom in new information technology projects and innovations, now that the Y2K
holding pattern they've been stuck in is nearly over.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of dollars worth of research and development were frozen by
organizations trying to head off year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Fixing non-compliant software, which involves correcting line after line of
code and then testing systems, monopolized programmers and technicians who are
normally charged with looking for new efficiencies in their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you think about it, the money that was spent on Y2K remediation really
didn't go toward productive uses -- it was something that had to be fixed just
to stay in business,'' said technology analyst David Powers, with U.S.
investment firm Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now going forward, the mindset is these companies will be able to spend
that money on new technologies that will either increase productivity or help
reduce their costs.''
------ Devco Miners Stage Illegal Strike
</P>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Devco miners staged a wildcat strike Monday to
press their demands for better pensions, saying repeated pleas to Ottawa have
fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The men are just fed up -- they're getting no answers,'' said striking
miner Malcolm MacIntyre, one of about 200 men who gathered outside the offices
of the Cape Breton Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest, involving 1,600 workers, effectively shut down coal operations
for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Coal miners began the walkout Sunday night at the Prince Mine. Workers at
other the corporation's sites, including a coal preparation plant, a railway,
and the Phalen mine, joined Monday in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
	   After union leaders warned them of fines, firings and other fallout from
their strike, workers agreed to return to the job Monday night, but only to
provide essential services as required by their union contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, the federal government announced it was closing or selling all
of its Cape Breton coal interests by the end of 2000. ------ Inquiry Continues
at Train Crash Site
</P>
<P>
	   MONT-ST-HILAIRE, Quebec (AP) -- Investigators set to work Monday to find the
cause of a fiery, fatal crash of two CN freight trains last week while delicate
cleanup efforts continued at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Safety Board officials planned to analyze a section of track
along the accident site to determine whether it broke before or after the
collision, which killed two veteran CN employees last Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The next step will be to retrieve the event recorders, or so-called black
boxes, from the two trains in an effort to piece together the moments leading up
to the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   While police have found no signs of criminal action, all other possible
causes must be considered, said senior investigator Mario Peloquin.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the trains is believed to have jumped track before falling on the
second train in this community just east of Montreal.

Former Prime Minister Recovering Well from Pneumonia
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was gaining strength
and could be released this week from a hospital where he has been treated for
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Trudeau, 80, was admitted on New Year's Eve to the Royal Victoria Hospital
with complications from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He continues to respond well to the treatment,'' hospital spokeswoman
Gillian Ross MacCormack said Monday. ``They are still hoping he can be released
later this week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital officials said the pneumonia was never life-threatening, and that
Trudeau had been up and walking despite receiving intravenous antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   Trudeau spent the Christmas holiday with his ex-wife, Margaret, and the
couple's two sons. According to his ex-wife, Trudeau had the flu at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Trudeau was prime minister from 1968 to 1984 except for a nine-month period
when he was out of office. He was recently named newsmaker of the century in a
Canadian Press poll of editors and broadcasters.

<HEADLINE> Galileo Flies by Europa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past
Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any
computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew
within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Europa is really just on the edge of the area we consider hazardous from
the radiation point of view,'' he said. ``We really thought this one would go

<HEADLINE> Tucson Papers Nix Gun Classifieds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The city's two daily newspapers will no longer allow
individuals to sell guns through classified advertisements.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona Daily Star announced its policy change Sunday, and The Tucson
Citizen's editor and publisher confirmed a similar policy Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a front-page notice to readers, Jane Amari, the Star's editor and
publisher, said there was concern that people buying guns through classifieds
circumvent background checks now required by law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In an age of increasing gun violence, it is difficult to defend our part
in the transaction,'' Amari's notice said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both newspapers will continue to accept ads placed by registered gun
dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Hatfield, editor and publisher of the Citizen, said the policy change is
intended to help keep guns from falling into the wrong hands -- but not to stem
the sale of guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers have separate newsrooms and editorial policies, but have a
joint operating agreement for their circulation, production and advertising
departments. The morning newspaper, the Star, is owned by the Pulitzer Inc. and
the evening Citizen is owned by Gannett Co. Inc.

U.S. Spent About $100B on Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moved by fear that Y2K technology problems could disrupt
everything from telephone calls to electricity, the United States, easily the
most technology-dependent nation, spent roughly half the world's total repair
costs. America's bill for buying new computers and repairing billions of lines
of software code came to an estimated $100 billion -- or about $365 for each
resident. But three days into the new century, a well-cheered victory of man
over machine is raising questions about whether the government and corporate
America threw too much at the problem, especially considering apparent victories
overseas where far less was spent.

rebels mounted attacks against federal troops in two Russian-held towns, and
Russian planes and artillery bombarded southern areas of the breakaway republic,
where rebels are dug into the rugged mountains. Russian troops entered Chechnya
in September after militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan and were

cloud of suspicion spreading over Kohl's successor at the helm of the Christian
Democrats, some were asking whether the country's main opposition would collapse
under the taint of corruption. Kohl, who headed the Christian Democrats for a
quarter century, has admitted taking up to $1 million in off-the-books
contributions in the 1990s. If convicted on charges of breach of trust, Kohl
could face a fine or jail sentence of up to five years.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leads Tudjman Party  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- An opposition coalition headed toward victory
Tuesday in Croatia's parliamentary election, a result that would end the
nine-year grip on power held by the party of late president Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   With 61 percent of the returns from Monday's vote counted, Tudjman's
Croatian Democratic Union party was trailing in eight of the 10 electoral
districts, in some cases by a margin of more than 2-to-1, Croatian state
television said.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout was a near record, indicating Croats' awareness that the first
vote after the Dec. 10 death of Tudjman would be critical in determining whether
the country will remain on the authoritarian and nationalist path laid down by
the late president or move toward greater democracy and closer ties to the west.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, election commission head Marijan Ramuscak confirmed that the
opposition was on a winning trend. He did not give precise nationwide figures,
but said the center-left coalition of the Social Democrats and Social Liberals
led with 40 to 50 percent of the votes in most of the districts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the capital of Zagreb, state television said the Social Democrat-Social
Liberal coalition won between 45 and 51 percent compared with 22 percent for
Tudjman's party, known by its Croatian initials HDZ. And the ruling party was
trailing with 20 to 32 percent in the remaining regions. Four smaller opposition
parties accounted for most of the rest of the votes.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Croatian television said Tudjman's party was ahead by 11 percent in
the region around the eastern town of Vukovar and was roughly tied with the
coalition in a rural region of central Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition has promised to introduce democratic reforms and radical
changes to erase corruption and mismanagement, and to cut government spending by
halving the salaries of legislators and some senior officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition has also pledged to shift power from the presidency to the
parliament. Tudjman enjoyed almost monarchial powers during his party's tenure,
which began when Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991. The opposition has
said it would make sure the next president has a smaller role. Presidential
elections have been scheduled for Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic, expected to be the HDZ candidate in the Jan.
24 presidential contest, said the ruling party ``clearly has lost'' the
elections and the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate the winners, Granic said. ``We will be a tough
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the headquarters of the Social Democrat-Liberal coalition, the mood was
one of triumph. The two coalition leaders -- Ivica Racan and Drazen Budisa --
raised their arms as their supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan, leader of the Social Democrats and the coalition's choice for prime
minister, said the results ``are realistic,'' adding, ``we were aware of the
citizens' feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll do our best to justify their confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa, a leader of Social Liberals, is the coalition's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Final results may not be known until Friday, Ramuscak said, adding that no
serious irregularities were reported. Some 400 foreign observers monitored the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a contest between generations and classes,'' said Vanja Rebic, a
29-year-old medical student, after he voted. ``The elderly and rural population
are more inclined to keep the status quo, the young and urban population are
prone to change.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believed an opposition victory would restore hope to the younger
generation, which will likely otherwise be forced to seek employment and a
better life abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout was 78.06 percent of the more than 4.17 million eligible Croats.
They were choosing about 150 seats in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-five parties were competing in the election. The exact number of seats
will depend on the size of the expatriate turnout. Expatriates, many of them in
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, began voting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Croatia is at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and most
Croats feel closer to Western Europe. But many fear that joining the European
Union or NATO could cost some of their national identity.

<HEADLINE> Miranda Gets Boost in California  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Miranda warnings, under scrutiny in the Supreme
Court, got a boost Monday from a federal appeals court, which reaffirmed its
decision allowing suits against police for deliberate Miranda violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said none of its 22 active judges
voted to reconsider a judicial panel's decision last November that declared the
Miranda rules to be a clearly established right of defendants based on the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1966 Miranda case, the Supreme Court required police to advise
suspects in custody of their right to remain silent, to speak to a lawyer and to
have a lawyer appointed without cost if necessary. Any statement taken without
giving those warnings or abiding by a suspect's decision to remain silent cannot
be used as direct evidence in the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
	   In Richmond, Va., another federal appeals court has ruled that the Miranda
warnings were not constitutionally based and were overturned by Congress in a
1968 law.
</P>
<P>
	   That law, never enforced, would allow federal courts to consider evidence of
all voluntary confessions, regardless of whether suspects were advised of their
right to remain silent. The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether that law
is constitutional by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
	   In November's ruling, the appeals court panel said the Miranda warnings
protected the constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination, and
were so clearly established that police and cities could be sued for deliberate
violations.

<HEADLINE> Putin Fires Yeltsin's Daughter  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH INGRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin fired Boris Yeltsin's
daughter Monday in one of his first official acts, moving quickly to distance
himself from Yeltsin's scandal-tinged administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The speedy removal of Tatyana Dyachenko from her Kremlin post as ``image
adviser'' sent a clear message to the Russian public that Putin wants nothing to
do with the widespread corruption that has plagued Russia and may be the single
biggest obstacle to the country's development.
</P>
<P>
	   The terse announcement of Dyachenko's dismissal marked Putin's first
personnel change since taking office Friday. He also fired three other members
of Yeltsin's inner circle, whom many Russians have come to despise.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyachenko had been accused of exercising undue influence over government
policy, and has recently been a focus of an investigation into allegations of
Kremlin bribery.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who is seen as the strong front-runner in presidential elections
expected March 26, has indicated that one of his main goals is to clean up the
widespread corruption that may be the single biggest obstacle to Russia's
development. He has sternly warned government bureaucrats that he won't tolerate
criminality or favoritism.
</P>
<P>
	   But many analysts have questioned whether he will go beyond window-dressing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem of anti-corruption campaigns is that unless you start at the
top, there's no point,'' Margo Light, a Russia expert at the London School of
Economics, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin granted Yeltsin immunity from prosecution on Friday, almost
immediately after the aged president resigned unexpectedly and named him acting
president. However, while the decree protected Yeltsin and made it impossible to
subpoena his papers, the immunity did not extend to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the substance of Dyachenko's job nor the extent of her influence
were ever clear. Regardless, it was a position that gave the former computer
engineer a Kremlin office, access to her father in an official capacity and a
great deal of behind-the-scenes influence.
</P>
<P>
	   She shied away from public attention, but Russian media persistently linked
her to several powerful businessmen who have allegedly used their wealth and
media holdings to try to manipulate government policy and acquire privatized
state assets through sweetheart deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin's erratic moves -- especially his abrupt firing of four successive
prime ministers -- often provoked speculation that his daughter and her allies
were pulling strings.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently, Dyachenko has been at the center of a probe into allegations
of massive kickbacks that plagued the Kremlin during Yeltsin's last year in
office.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss and Russian prosecutors have been investigating allegations that
Dyachenko and her sister Yelena Okulova, as well as other Kremlin officials,
took bribes from a Swiss company, Mabetex, that won lucrative Kremlin
construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to $1 million allegedly went to Kremlin property manager Pavel Borodin,
who oversaw the renovation work, and was made available to Yeltsin and his
family, according to some press reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss prosecutors have focused on allegations that Yeltsin and his daughters
were provided with credit cards funded by Mabetex and that hundreds of thousands
of dollars were allegedly charged to them. Mabetex, Yeltsin and his family have
consistently denied the allegations and nobody has been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   In October the Swiss Banca del Gottardo confirmed that it provided
guarantees credit cards for Yeltsin and his two daughters on instructions from
Mabetex. The bank stressed that it did not provide actual credit cards and that
the guarantee -- which would come into force if bills went unpaid -- was never
invoked.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss authorities were also reportedly monitoring a bank account opened by a
Svetlana Dyachenko, which they suspected was actually set up for Tatyana.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the corruption allegations against Yeltsin and his administration
have been swirling for months, nobody has been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin removed three other officials from their Kremlin posts on Monday:
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin, protocol chief Vladimir Shevchenko, and
presidential office chief Valery Semyonchenko. However, Kremlin chief of staff
Alexander Voloshin then appointed Yakushkin as one of his deputies.
</P>
<P>
	   Yakushkin told Echo of Moscow radio on Monday that Yeltsin would maintain an
office in the Kremlin, and that he would continue meeting with officials on an
informal basis.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the White House reaffirmed its support for democratic and market
reform in Russia. ``This is an important time,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said,
referring the presidential elections due in three months. ``But the Russian
people will have to speak.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who was in Shepherdstown, W. Va., to mediate between
Israel and Syria, called Putin from the White House on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the president congratulated him on his designation as acting
president,'' but noted there were areas of disagreement, including the war in
Chechnya, Lockhart said. Putin has promoted the Russian military offensive in
Chechnya, a drive that has widespread popular support. He is expected to try to
capitalize on the campaign in his presidential run.

</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart declined to comment on the mood of the talks, but said, ``After the

the best way to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials had billed the talks as a ``historic opportunity''
to end a half-century of hostility between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   But at day's end, Barak and al-Sharaa had only gotten together for a brief
picture-taking session with the president.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin said a three-way meeting had never
been scheduled, that it had only been an expectation. ``I wouldn't exaggerate
the significance of it'' not happening, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The feeling is that these are very hard issues, that you cannot have a
fully scripted procedure in a discussion that is complex,'' Rubin said. ``Today
has been serious and substantive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among issues on the table are security -- a major worry for Israel --
sharing of water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character of peace between
the two Middle East neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, Clinton was prepared
``to invest as many days as are appropriate and constructive'' to reach a
settlement, Lockhart said. There was no indication whether he would return to
the talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, the president strolled across a 200-foot-long pedestrian
bridge with the two Mideast officials, after sitting down first with Barak and
then al-Sharaa at the National Conservation Training Center of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
	   As he headed for the main site of the talks at the semi-secluded Clarion
Hotel and Conference Center, Clinton halted his motorcade in the town center and
stepped out to greet scores of cheering residents. He ignored questions about
the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman Rubin said, ``There's real seriousness'' on both
sides, but ``we don't expect to be able to achieve a core agreement'' in one
round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said, ``The president understands we have an historic opportunity
here'' and that the United States ``can act as a facilitator, as an honest
broker, as we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the talks began Monday, Lockhart said, ``We're going to take it day
to day. At the end of the week, we'll take stock of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has made Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
for the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Israel and Syria said they want to see the other side show its
earnestness about peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources close to the Syrian delegation as well as Syria's newspapers, which
reflect government thinking, said Damascus views the negotiations as a test of
Israel's intentions.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syrian
President Hafez Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date
for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20,
said Nabil Shaath, planning minister of Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Shaath
said Clinton and Arafat will review implementation of a U.S.-brokered interim
agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinians at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in
September.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Threat Closes Ala. Clinic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- An abortion clinic where a bomb killed a security
guard in 1998 was evacuated Monday following a claim that an anthrax-laced
letter was delivered with the day's mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Other clinics and offices around the nation received similar threats Monday,
the latest in a series that date back several years. Some of the letters were
determined to be hoaxes while testing continued on others.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Woman All Women Heath Care Clinic contacted authorities after
receiving a fax informing them of the threat. Police confiscated the letter,
which had not been opened, said Lt. Moody Duff.
</P>
<P>
	   Duff said all but two employees were evacuated from the building while
federal investigators analyzed the letter to determine if it was filled with the
deadly bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   An off-duty police officer was killed and a nurse severely injured when the
clinic was bombed in January 1998. Suspected serial bomber Eric Robert Rudolph
has been charged with the bombing, but has not been captured.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that can strike animals and people.
Deaths are rare with appropriate treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other locations involved were the Planned Parenthood clinics in
Providence, R.I., Manchester, Conn., Fort Wayne, Ind., and Naples, Fla., and a
government unemployment office in Immokalee, Fla. Tests on the Connecticut
letter found it was not contaminated, and the FBI called the Indiana threat a
hoax. It was not known if the other letters truly contained anthrax.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI agent Doug Garrison said the threatening letter will be sent to the FBI
lab in Washington. ``We'll process this thing for evidentiary value because
there may be fingerprints or something,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   Char Wendel, the executive director of the Planned Parenthood office in
Naples, Fla., said the typewritten letter said: ``You've been exposed to
anthrax. You're going to die in less than 24 hours. We need to get rid of you.
We're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic threats of contamination with the potentially lethal anthrax date
back several years. The FBI said a spate of letters last year contained a sticky
substance or dark powder and the ominous warning: You've been contaminated by
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters have been received in almost every region of the nation. They
often arrive in bunches, at 10 or 15 similar targets in a city. The targets have
been varied: Abortion clinics, Catholic schools, nightclubs, department stores,
hospitals, post offices, courthouses, news media offices, FBI offices and even
the Old Executive Office Building beside the White House.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Tears Through Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A strong storm that spawned at least one tornado
ripped through this western Kentucky city on Monday, damaging hundreds of homes
and a college campus. Several people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 12 people were treated at hospitals, said Ray Bowman, a state
emergency official. Their conditions were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was part of a band of unstable weather that rolled across the
nation's midsection on Monday. Thunderstorms knocked out power and flooded
streets in Arkansas and a storm damaged more than 20 homes in southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   Tornadoes also touched down in Mississippi, destroying homes and injuring
about a half-dozen people, including a couple whose manufactured home was
flipped off its foundation near New Albany. The couple were in stable condition
at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky State Police in Henderson received reports of several tornadoes in
the Owensboro area, a dispatcher said. The National Weather Service confirmed
that one tornado touched down in the city of about 54,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were sitting at home and the wind started picking up, and then it
started pouring down rain and things started to fly,'' said Marti Fenwick, a
mother of three whose home was damaged by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency was declared in Owensboro, and a curfew was imposed
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday to keep people off the streets as emergency
crews assessed damage and began the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm damaged 750 homes and 35 businesses and caused widespread power
outages, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Crittenden County, nearly two dozen homes were damaged, and a
tornado was reported in Webster County as the storms skipped across western
Kentucky and north-central Kentucky throughout Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm caused extensive damage to Kentucky Wesleyan College and to some
businesses lining a main city thoroughfare. High winds tore off the roofs of
several buildings on the college campus, including the president's home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every road leading on or off the campus is blocked by downed trees or
power lines, so there is no getting in or out,'' said college president Wesley
H. Poling.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes don't start until next week, so few students were around.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Neck-and-Neck in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. AP) -- A month before New Hampshire's leadoff presidential
primary, Republican contenders Sen. John McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
were running neck-and-neck in the state, according to a poll conducted during
the last days of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain received support from 36 percent of likely Republican voters
participating in a survey conducted by The New Hampshire Poll. Bush was three
percentage points behind at 33 percent. Fifteen percent were undecided and the
remaining 16 percent said they would vote for other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, of Arizona, led Bush by nine percentage points in a New Hampshire
Poll survey completed Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore also are in a statistical dead heat
in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bradley received 42
percent, and Gore received 39 percent. Nineteen percent said they were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore trailed Bradley by 12 points on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Hampshire primary will take place Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Hampshire Poll conducted surveyed 600 likely Democratic voters and
600 likely Republican voters from Dec. 29 to Dec. 31 by telephone. The margin of
error was plus or minus four percentage points.

<HEADLINE> McCain Would Threaten Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMHERST, N.H. (AP) -- Citing Vladimir Putin's ``disturbing'' path to power,
Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain said Monday that the acting
Russian president should be urged to end the conflict with Chechen militants
under threat of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be talking about Chechnya every day'' were he president, McCain,
R-Ariz., told reporters aboard his campaign bus. ``I'd state unequivocally that
there would be no more (U.S.) Export-Import (bank) loans, that the United States
would not support any further IMF funding until this thing is brought to some
kind of reasonable conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
	   During his new year return to the campaign trail in this first-in-the-nation
primary state, McCain said he wished former Russian President Boris Yeltsin had
resigned closer to the country's presidential elections, expected March 26.
Yeltsin's resignation last week gave Putin an edge, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The acting president's test, McCain said, will be whether he aggressively
moves to stamp out his country's rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's going to be business as usual, then they have further to fall,''
McCain said. ``If he wants to control the country then he's got to take care of
the corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   But it's Putin's role in Chechnya that prompts McCain's mistrust the most,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin enjoys widespread public approval because of his no-nonsense style and
his tough handling of the Russian offensive in separatist Chechnya. Many
Russians support the war as the only way to protect the nation from terrorist
attacks such as the apartment bombings -- blamed on Chechen militants -- that
killed over 300 people in September.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's terribly disturbing to see how Mr. Putin trod this path to power. It
was through Chechnya,'' McCain said. ``A year ago, nobody had heard of Putin.
Now he orchestrates this incredibly brutal offensive in Chechnya, and the
popularity of his government skyrockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Touching down a few miles away in Manchester, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
voiced similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   It was McCain's first appearance back on the campaign trail since spending
the holiday with his family in Costa Rica. Polls showing he has a shot at
beating Bush here next month had McCain chanting from a cartoon he watched over
the break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Happy, happy, joy, joy!'' he sang as he climbed on the bus.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's first campaign stop of the new year was a town hall meeting at
Amherst Middle School's cafeteria, which was packed with several hundred
residents. Former Sen. Warren Rudman was at his side.
</P>
<P>
	   Appealing to the season of holiday bill-paying, McCain told those present
that he would work hard to abolish Internet taxes. His aides said that during
the 1999 holiday season Americans paid about $600 million in Internet taxes on
$10 billion to $12 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said he long had expected his former competitor, Elizabeth Dole,
to endorse Bush, the front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination. Her support would
``probably ... be of some help to Governor Bush,'' McCain acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think endorsements are very helpful to a degree,'' he added.
``Especially in a state like New Hampshire, they judge you on you.''

<HEADLINE> More Explosives Than Expected Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities investigating the theft of explosives from
a police bunker recovered a larger, more dangerous cache than they expected to
find -- and they don't know what else may still be missing. Five suspects were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   A task force led by the Fresno County Sheriff's Department found enough
explosives ``to fill the bed of a pickup truck,'' including booby traps, hand
grenades, blasting caps, fuses and other detonating material, Sheriff Richard
Pierce said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of the recovered materials were hidden beneath the floorboards of
an abandoned building, with the rest scattered in three other locations.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally, officials estimated about 200 pounds of dynamite, gunpowder and
the military explosive C4 were stolen from the bunker in the days around
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   The development prompted Police Chief Ed Winchester to suspend Lt. Andy Hall
of his duties as bomb squad commander on Monday until an internal investigation
looks into the shoddy record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force arrested a juvenile and four 18-year-olds. Each was charged
with burglary and possession of a destructive device, and ordered held on
$110,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
	   No motive has been determined. None of the suspects are believed to have any
ties to any militia groups or other organizations. Authorities would not comment
on whether any of them have been in trouble before.
</P>
<P>
	   The theft had raised fears of a Y2K attack and prompted authorities to
revamp security plans for millennium celebrations.

	   Kentucky State Police in Henderson received reports of several tornadoes in
the Owensboro area, a dispatcher said. The National Weather Service confirmed
that one tornado touched down in the city of about 54,000.
</P>

	   ``We were sitting at home and the wind started picking up, and then it
started pouring down rain and things started to fly,'' said Marti Fenwick, a
mother of three whose home was damaged by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency was declared in Owensboro, and a curfew was imposed
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday to keep people off the streets as emergency
crews assessed damage and began the cleanup.

Israeli-Syrian Talks Open in W. Va.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israeli and Syrian
negotiators to the West Virginia countryside today for a fresh round of peace
talks, but there were no face-to-face negotiations between the two antagonists.
Even before the planned three-way session with Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was canceled, officials
played down the possibility that an agreement would be reached. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met separately
with Barak and al-Sharaa and those sessions "went longer than anticipated."

U.S. Spent About $100B on Y2K Bug
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moved by fear that Y2K technology problems could disrupt
everything from telephone calls to electricity, the United States, easily the
most technology-dependent nation, spent roughly half the world's total repair
costs. America's bill for buying new computers and repairing billions of lines
of software code came to an estimated $100 billion -- or about $365 for each
resident. But three days into the new century, a well-cheered victory of man
over machine is raising questions about whether the government and corporate
America threw too much at the problem, especially considering apparent victories
overseas where far less was spent.

Opposition Leads Croatian Election
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- An opposition coalition headed toward victory
Tuesday in Croatia's parliamentary election, a result that would end the
nine-year grip on power held by the party of late president Franjo Tudjman. With
61 percent of the returns from Monday's vote counted, Tudjman's Croatian
Democratic Union party was trailing in eight of the 10 electoral districts,
Croatian state television said. The turnout was a near record, indicating
Croats' awareness that the first vote after the Dec. 10 death of Tudjman would
be critical in determining whether the country will remain on the authoritarian
path laid down by the late president or move toward greater democracy.

	   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Rebels Monday repelled Russian troops as they
attempted to penetrate the center of Chechnya's capital. Outside the capital,
rebels mounted attacks against federal troops in two Russian-held towns, and
Russian planes and artillery bombarded southern areas of the breakaway republic,
where rebels are dug into the rugged mountains. Russian troops entered Chechnya
in September after militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan and were
blamed for ensuing apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia.

Miranda Gets Boost in California

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Miranda warnings, under scrutiny in the Supreme
Court, got a boost Monday from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
reaffirmed its decision allowing suits against police for deliberate Miranda
violations. In the 1966 Miranda case, the Supreme Court required police to
advise suspects in custody of their right to remain silent, to speak to a lawyer
and to have a lawyer appointed without cost if necessary. Any statement taken
without giving those warnings or abiding by a suspect's decision to remain
silent cannot be used as direct evidence in the prosecution's case.

<HEADLINE> Former Intern Appears on CNN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Focusing on her new role as a weight-loss spokeswoman,
Monica Lewinsky says she hopes her involvement in the scandal that led to
President Clinton's impeachment trial becomes a shrinking historical footnote.
</P>
<P>
	   In an appearance Monday on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' the former White House
intern said she bears some responsibility for what happened to Clinton, but now
she wants to put that part of here life behind her.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Lewinsky, 26, described herself as ``a young woman who had made some
private mistakes and who is very sorry for those mistakes, but was also part of
some other forces that she certainly couldn't control.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her new role as a spokeswoman for the diet company Jenny Craig and her own
weight-loss efforts were frequent topics during the interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Lewinsky steered away from questions concerning her feelings about
former friend Linda Tripp, but she did mention first lady Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a lot of personal remorse for what she's gone through and I'm sure
what their daughter, what Chelsea has gone through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about her lawyers and her remaining legal bills, Ms. Lewinsky
became visibly uncomfortable, but she said she was thankful for the efforts that
obtained her legal immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am terribly, terribly grateful for all of the hard work that everybody
put into this and there isn't a feeling that that people shouldn't be
compensated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she's working with a therapist on several ``issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel like I'm on the right path now,'' Ms. Lewinsky said in an interview
published in the Monday editions of USA Today. ``I may not be where I want to
end up, but at least I'm sort of on the right path, and that feels really good
to me.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leads Tudjman Party  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- An opposition coalition headed toward victory in
Croatia's parliamentary election Tuesday, after campaigning with promises to
bolster democracy and end what it called the autocratic rule of late president
Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   With 61 percent of the returns from Monday's vote counted, Tudjman's
Croatian Democratic Union was trailing in eight of the 10 electoral districts,
in some cases by a margin of more than 2-to-1, Croatian state television said.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout was a near record, indicating Croats' awareness that the first
vote after the Dec. 10 death of Tudjman would be critical in determining the
direction of the country, led by the governing party since breaking away from
Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, election commission head Marijan Ramuscak confirmed that the
opposition was on a winning trend. He did not give precise nationwide figures,
but said the center-left coalition of the Social Democrats and Social Liberals
led with 40 to 50 percent of the votes in most of the districts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the capital of Zagreb, state television said the Social Democrat-Social
Liberal coalition won between 45 and 51 percent compared with 22 percent for
Tudjman's party, known by its Croatian initials HDZ. And the ruling party was
trailing with 20 to 32 percent in the remaining regions. Four smaller opposition
parties accounted for most of the rest of the votes.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Croatian television said Tudjman's party was ahead by 11 percent in
the region around the eastern town of Vukovar and was roughly tied with the
coalition in a rural region of central Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition has promised to introduce democratic reforms and radical
changes to erase corruption and mismanagement, and to cut government spending by
halving the salaries of legislators and some senior officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition has also pledged to shift power from the presidency to the
parliament. Tudjman enjoyed almost monarchial powers during his party's tenure.
The opposition has said it would make sure the next president has a smaller
role. Presidential elections have been scheduled for Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic, expected to be the HDZ candidate in the Jan.
24 presidential contest, said the ruling party ``clearly has lost'' the
elections and the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I congratulate the winners, Granic said. ``We will be a tough
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the results were ``far below our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the headquarters of the Social Democrat-Liberal coalition, the mood was
one of triumph. The two coalition leaders -- Ivica Racan and Drazen Budisa --
raised their arms as their supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Racan, leader of the Social Democrats and the coalition's choice for prime
minister, said the results ``are realistic,'' adding, ``we were aware of the
citizens' feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll do our best to justify their confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa, a leader of Social Liberals, is the coalition's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Final results may not be known until Friday, Ramuscak said, adding that no
serious irregularities were reported. Some 400 foreign observers monitored the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a contest between generations and classes,'' said Vanja Rebic, a
29-year-old medical student, after he voted. ``The elderly and rural population
are more inclined to keep the status quo, the young and urban population are
prone to change.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believed an opposition victory would restore hope to the younger
generation, which will likely otherwise be forced to seek employment and a
better life abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnout was 78.06 percent of the more than 4.17 million eligible Croats.
They were choosing about 150 seats in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-five parties were competing in the election. The exact number of seats
will depend on the size of the expatriate turnout. Expatriates, many of them in
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, began voting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Croatia is at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and most
Croats feel closer to Western Europe. But many fear that joining the European
Union or NATO could cost some of their national identity.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Defends Risky Cuban Mission  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba accused the United States on Monday of tolerating
illegal acts against the island, singling out the New Year's Day scattering of
political pamphlets by a Vietnamese-American pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The communist government first acknowledged the Saturday flyover in an
editorial published Monday in the communist workers daily, Trabajadores.
</P>
<P>
	   The article, with the headline ``Madman, Unhinged, Drugged, or Vulgar
Mercenary,'' said the United States was ``a violator of international law,
tolerant of crime, a liar without morals that stimulates craziness and is
incapable of controlling it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tong, a 51-year-old New Orleans resident with a history of anti-communist
actions involving airplanes, dropped 50,000 leaflets urging Cubans to overthrow
``the old dinosaur Fidel Castro'' by launching a general strike, seizing radio
and television stations and protesting outside military installations.
</P>
<P>
	   The pamphlets were signed ``Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary
Anti-Communist Forces of the World,'' followed by an illegible signature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This crazy man could have dropped explosives on us, flammable material or
viruses or bacteria,'' the editorial said, and criticized Tong for dropping the
pamphlets on New Year's Day, which was the 41st anniversary of the Cuban
revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cuban exiles in Miami Monday night honored Tong for the daring flight,
giving him plaques and pins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We salute this man of great courage. We admire him and what he did,'' said
Jose Basulto of the anti-Castro group Brothers to the Rescue. Basulto and his
Cessna escaped when Cuban military jets shot down two unarmed civilian planes in
1996, killing four men.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong in turn responded to the Cuban government's editorial, saying, ``Tell
him (Castro) this message: Only crazy people can change the world, and I want to
change Cuba's destiny.'' He said after the flight that he wanted to make similar
trips over China and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials questioned Tong after the flight into Cuban air space, but
released him without charges, U.S. Customs officials said. He surrendered his
two-week-old pilot's license to the Federal Aviation Administration before his
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said Tong had engaged in a ``provocative and reckless
action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tong is a former South Vietnamese air force fighter pilot who was shot down
by the North Vietnamese in 1975 and jailed for five years in a ``reeducation
camp.''
</P>
<P>
	   He escaped from the camp and made a 17-month trek through mountains and
jungles across five nations. He reached the United States in 1984, earned a
master's degree in political science from the University of New Orleans and
became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1992, he hijacked a Vietnam Airlines jet from Thailand and
dropped 50,000 anti-government leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon,
the old South Vietnamese capital.
</P>
<P>
	   He parachuted to the ground, apparently thinking he would lead a revolution,
but was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released in
September 1998 as part of a mass amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian, Clinton Round Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israel and Syria back
to the peace table Monday for the second time in less than a month, but the two
antagonists failed to meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said there was disagreement over the
timing of discussions on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- at the
beginning of the talks, as Syria wanted, or at the end, which Israel preferred.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, as did Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. The only face-to-face meeting between the Israeli and the Syrian was
at a picture-taking session with the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the talks began, administration officials were playing down the
possibility that 50 years of differences would be resolved during this round of
talks. Protests in Syria served as a stark reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face.
</P>
<P>
	   Among issues on the table are security -- a major worry for Israel --
sharing of water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character of peace between
the two Middle East neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why an expected three-way negotiating session did not occur, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Albright meetings went ``longer than
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The feeling is that these are very hard issues, that you cannot have a
fully scripted procedure in a discussion that is complex,'' State Department
spokesman James Rubin said. ``Today has been serious and substantive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``There is not a reluctance on either part to have joint meetings,
and the job of the facilitator here is to try to decide what the right rhythm
amd the pace of the discussions is.''
</P>
<P>
	   After Clinton and his team decided against trying to bring the two sides
together Monday night, the president held another separate session with
al-Sharaa before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials had billed the talks as a ``historic opportunity''
to end a half-century of hostility between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, Clinton was prepared
``to invest as many days as are appropriate and constructive'' to reach a
settlement, Lockhart said. There was no indication whether he would return to
the talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the president joined the two Mideast leaders in a stroll across a
200-foot-long pedestrian bridge at the National Conservation Training Center of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, as he headed for the main site of the talks, the semi-secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center, Clinton halted his motorcade in the town
center and stepped out to greet scores of cheering residents. He ignored
questions about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
of the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syrian
President Hafez Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said
the talks under him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date
for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20,
said Nabil Shaath, planning minister of Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Shaath
said Clinton and Arafat will review implementation of a U.S.-brokered interim
agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinians at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in
September.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Key Stock Index Up  </HEADLINE>
    By KOZO MIZOGUCHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index finished the new
millennium's first trading session at a 28-month high Tuesday amid no Y2K
computer problems. The dollar slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the half-day session at
19,002.86, a gain of 68.52 points, or 0.36 percent. On Thursday, it closed up
123.76 points, or 0.66 percent. Tuesday was the first time since Aug. 21, 1997
that the Nikkei ended above 19,000 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 101.65 yen at late morning, down 0.43 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 101.56 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese financial markets were closed Dec. 31 through Jan. 3 for the New
Year's holiday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange traditionally trades for half a day in
the first session of the year. It will return to a full day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening of the Tokyo market, Asia's biggest, was one of the last major
tests of the Y2K computer bug. Yasuo Sakuragi, a spokesman for the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said that trading opened smoothly without any computer trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nikkei index started higher on buying of blue chips and
telecommunication-related issues, rising about 200 points before losing some
early gains on profit-taking toward the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise in Tokyo came one day after Asia's other big stock markets in Hong
Kong and Singapore soared in their first trading sessions of the new year. Both
closed Monday at record highs for the second consecutive session, and no Y2K
glitches were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.61 points, or 1.2
percent, to 11,357.51 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,717.47. The TOPIX closed up
9.93 points, or 0.58 percent, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher compared with its late New
York level as Japan's central bank bought dollars to stem the yen's surge.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, Haruhiko Kuroda,
confirmed that the Bank of Japan intervened in the Tokyo currency market Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuroda said that the Ministry of Finance will continue carefully watching
foreign exchange moves and will take more "decisive steps" if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the intervention, the dollar jumped from around 101.64 yen to
around 102.50 yen, but later gave back those gains. The amount of the
intervention was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese business and government officials have said the yen's rapid rise
could hamper the nation's nascent economic recovery by making its products more
expensive in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 104.96 yen, up from 102.70 yen

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Focus on Schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Matching promises at long distance, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley pledged radical, ``revolutionary'' school improvements Monday at the
beginning of a January drive toward the first Democratic presidential showdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, while touting his experience in the White House, also promised the
nation ``a new era of progress'' if elected. Bradley, set to release his budget
proposal, took a shot at Gore's plan, contending the vice president's campaign
promises would run up $350 billion in red ink.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Bradley will propose eliminating corporate tax shelters, special
subsidies and tax loopholes worth about $125 billion over 10 years, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was campaigning in New Hampshire and trying to make the case that he
is proposing far more aggressive policies than a timid Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need leadership that is prepared to take risks,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore focused tightly on education, and later in the day was courting women
voters as he sought support from key Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a challenge also in helping hardworking families find the time
that they want and need for their children without sacrificing their standard of
living,'' said Gore, speaking to cheering students and supporters packed into a
high school gymnasium in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Gore worked hard to court women activists, telling about 250, ``I
need you, I need your help.''
</P>
<P>
	   He drew sharp contrast with Republicans in vowing to support a pro-choice
position on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the ways we honor women is to honor the choices they make,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both rivals focused on traditional Democratic issues with an eye on the
first nomination tests, in Iowa Jan. 24 and New Hampshire eight days later.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore promised ``revolutionary improvements in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's rhetoric matched the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must radically improve our education system, for that is and always has
been the engine of growth and change in our society,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Gore called Bradley ``a good and decent man.'' But he quickly added
that his opponent ``has the wrong plans and on some critical issues he has no
plans.''
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Bradley said campaign finance reform was needed ``to fight
the disease of money in our politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, much criticized for his fund-raising activities in 1996, said Bradley
``has labored to draw an artificial distinction on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have supported tough campaign finance reform for 20 years now,'' Gore
told backers.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point in the day, Bradley's campaign released what it said was a
study of Gore campaign proposals on health care, Medicare and education -- a
study that said the proposals would outspend the nation's budget surplus by ``as
much as $350 billion over 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Leadership is about being honest with people about what can be achieved,''
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore argues that Bradley's proposals are even larger and would run up more
red ink in the budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The back-and-forth was predictable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our numbers are from independent sources and Gore's are not,'' said
Bradley aide Jim Farrell. ``We don't trust his numbers at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He seems to have as much difficulty with our budget numbers as he does
adding up his own health care numbers,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``We
practice what we preach, we've been doing it for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also stressed racial harmony, the environment and arms control as he
returned to the campaign trail after a holiday break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot afford to say that meeting one of these challenges is enough,''
said Gore. ``All of them are within our reach ... if we make good decisions with
good leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaigned at an interactive youth center focusing on universal
health insurance, child poverty, teacher hiring, gun control and campaign
finance reform. He was underscoring his appeal as a Washington outsider, though
he spent 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Only those who have never left Washington have missed the lessons of the
last decade,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Bradley's vision was limited.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley seems to believe America can address only one thing at a
time,'' he said. ``The vision of the American people should not be limited by
those who lead us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning will be virtually nonstop leading up to Iowa's precinct caucuses
and New Hampshire's opening primary. The candidates have their fourth debate
Wednesday in New Hampshire and meet in debate again Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley didn't mention Gore in his speech, his campaign quickly did it
for him. Gore was less subtle, going after Bradley directly during his stump
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates were choosing their words carefully. Bradley used a
TelePrompTer to read a six-page speech, while Gore carefully read from a
seven-page speech with little of the spontaneity of earlier events.

<HEADLINE> Computer Malfunction Delays Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- A computer malfunction at the Federal Aviation
Administration's Boston Center here delayed flights at airports in
Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The main computer at the air traffic control center went down around 7 p.m.,
said Jim Peters, spokesman for the FAA in New England. He said the problem was
corrected by about 10 p.m. The center used a backup computer system during the
outage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a result of the outage we incurred extensive delays throughout the
Northeast, both for flights arriving and departing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said FAA officials would not know what caused the malfunction until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without knowing what has caused the problem, it would be premature to
speculate,'' he said. ``It may turn out to be something other than Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Eliot Brenner, FAA assistant administrator for public
affairs, said: ``The problems in Boston are not Y2K related and they are over
now.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Center controls flights over more than 160,000 square miles of
air space from the Atlantic Ocean to western New York and from the Canadian
border to south of Long Island in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Departures and arrivals at Logan International Airport in Boston were
delayed by at least 30 minutes because of the malfunction, according to airport
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Departing flights at both Kennedy International Airport in New York City and
Newark International Airport in New Jersey were delayed by up to 75 minutes,
said Sgt. Reinaldo Gonzalez of the Port Authority police. Shorter delays were
experienced at La Guardia Airport in New York, Gonzalez said. The Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey runs all three airports.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chicago, radar displays used to direct traffic into O'Hare International
Airport went down for about two minutes Monday afternoon, causing minor delays.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA said air traffic controllers never lost audio contact with the five
planes in the air and the five on the ground at O'Hare at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI, which runs the system that failed, blames the outage on a power surge
at an O'Hare generator. FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said the problem was not
Y2K-related, and planes were never in jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Three Japan Traders Link Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top trading houses have agreed to combine certain
areas of their administrative operations to reduce costs, the three companies
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui and Co., and Sumitomo Corp. said they will join
their fixed line telephone, public telephone, and remote access services in
April.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination will reduce joint telecommunications costs by 25 percent
annually, from the current combined level of $98 million, they said, citing an
increasingly competitive business environment for the move.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies are also considering cooperating in personnel, accounting, and
computer system operations, said Mitsubishi spokesman Yasuhito Hirota.
</P>
<P>
	   The three trading giants, however, won't be working together in their sales
divisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We remain rivals, and we won't cooperate on aspects that concern generating
sales," Hirota said.
</P>
<P>
	   General trading houses all suffered a drop in sales in the first half of the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30, due largely to a prolonged economic downturn in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's general traders played a major role in the country's economic
development after World War II, but have been hit by declining sales and profits
in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Daily Refuses to Print Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's biggest newspaper announced Tuesday it will no longer
carry racy ads for two popular weekly magazines because it believes the ads are
offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yomiuri Shimbun said on the front page of its morning editions it will
no longer publish ads for the Weekly Post and Asahi Geino magazines due to their
"frequent use of extremely sexually explicit language."
</P>
<P>
	   The Yomiuri and other major newspapers have carried advertisements for the
magazines and other similar publications for years. But, in explaining its
decision, the Yomiuri said it felt that to continue to do so would not be in
keeping with the current social climate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot judge whether a magazine's content is sexually degrading or not,
but we can assess whether or not a publication's ad is suitable for our paper,"
said Yomiuri spokesman Tsunekazu Momoi.
</P>
<P>
	   Editors at the Weekly Post were unavailable for comment as the magazine was
on holiday. The editor of Asahi Geino was also not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   Momoi said the Yomiuri, which has a daily circulation of 10,250,000, had
received numerous letters from readers saying the ads were degrading to women
and inappropriate to papers that are delivered to the home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yomiuri said a revision of Japan's Equal Employment Opportunity Law last
April also led it to reconsider its policy on ads that could be considered
sexually demeaning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest daily, said in December that it
would tighten its criteria for judging the content of ads that could be deemed
as sexually degrading. But the paper has yet to cancel any.
</P>
<P>
	   Ads for the magazines, which are among the most popular weekly magazines in
Japan, do not generally contain nudity, but frequently use explicit sexual
language.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazines also are known for their racy advertisements on commuter
trains and subways.
</P>
<P>
	   Advertising is the biggest source of income for all newspapers in Japan, and
the ban on the two magazines' ads will be a blow to Yomiuri's revenue, Momoi
said.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Tears Through Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A strong storm that spawned at least one tornado
ripped through this western Kentucky city on Monday, damaging hundreds of homes
and a college campus. At least 18 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The springlike storm that struck on a balmy winter day also downed trees and
power lines and unleashed flash flooding in this city of about 54,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were sitting at home and the wind started picking up, and then it
started pouring down rain and things started to fly,'' said Marti Fenwick, a
mother of three whose home was damaged by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 18 people were treated at Owensboro Mercy Hospital, said supervisor
Janice Sweeney. Police and emergency medical services were going door to door
and more injuries were possible, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was part of a band of unstable weather that rolled across the
nation's midsection on Monday. Thunderstorms knocked out power in Arkansas and
tornadoes and thunderstorms moved through southeast Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Twisters also touched down in Mississippi, destroying homes and injuring
about a half-dozen people, including a couple whose manufactured home was
flipped off its foundation near New Albany. The couple were in stable condition
at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Thunderstorms and a possible tornado damaged more than 20 homes in southern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky State Police in Henderson received reports of several tornadoes in
the Owensboro area, a dispatcher said. The National Weather Service confirmed
that one tornado touched down in Owensboro.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency was declared in Owensboro, and a curfew was imposed
between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday to keep people off the streets as emergency
crews assessed damage and began the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm damaged 750 homes and 35 businesses and caused widespread power
outages, said Ray Bowman, a state emergency official.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Crittenden County, a state of emergency was declared with as many
as 100 homes damaged, and a tornado was reported in Webster County as the storms
skipped across western Kentucky and north-central Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm caused extensive damage to Kentucky Wesleyan College and to some
businesses lining a main city thoroughfare. High winds tore off the roofs of
several buildings on the college campus, including the president's home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every road leading on or off the campus is blocked by downed trees or
power lines, so there is no getting in or out,'' said college president Wesley
H. Poling.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes don't start until next week, so few students were around.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian, Clinton Round Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton brought Israel and Syria back
to the peace table Monday for the second time in less than a month, but the two
antagonists failed to meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did meet separately with Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, as did Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The only face-to-face
meeting between the Israeli and the Syrian was at a picture-taking session with
the president.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said there was disagreement over the
timing of discussions on an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- at the
beginning of the talks, as Syria wanted, or at the end, which Israel preferred.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, before coming here, cautioned that Israel
could not negotiate a withdrawal without first taking up with Syria the kind of
peace President Hafez Assad was offering as well as security arraangements on
the two countries' borders.
</P>
<P>
	   But an Israeli source, insisting on anonymity, told The Associated Press
that Barak was calling on all parties to take steps needed for the process to
move forward.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The procedure and the substance are wrapped together at this stage in the
discussion,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin. ``They have not
agreed on a work plan yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the talks began, administration officials were playing down the
possibility that 50 years of differences would be resolved during this round of
talks. Protests in Syria served as a stark reminder of the difficulties the two
sides face.
</P>
<P>
	   Among issues on the table are security -- a major worry for Israel --
sharing of water resources, the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights, a timetable for that pullout and the character of peace between
the two Middle East neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why an expected three-way negotiating session did not occur, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Albright meetings went ``longer than
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The feeling is that these are very hard issues, that you cannot have a
fully scripted procedure in a discussion that is complex,'' Rubin said. ``Today
has been serious and substantive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``There is not a reluctance on either part to have joint meetings,
and the job of the facilitator here is to try to decide what the right rhythm
amd the pace of the discussions is.''
</P>
<P>
	   After Clinton and his team decided against trying to bring the two sides
together Monday night, the president held another separate session with
al-Sharaa before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials had billed the talks as a ``historic opportunity''
to end a half-century of hostility between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mideast peace a top foreign policy goal for 2000, Clinton was prepared
``to invest as many days as are appropriate and constructive'' to reach a
settlement, Lockhart said. There was no indication whether he would return to
the talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the president joined the two Mideast leaders in a stroll across a
200-foot-long pedestrian bridge at the National Conservation Training Center of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, as he headed for the main site of the talks, the semi-secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center, Clinton halted his motorcade in the town
center and stepped out to greet scores of cheering residents. He ignored
questions about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Israeli and Syrian delegates have for the first time joined the
talks, enabling the two sides to address the technical issues before them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to have an opportunity to discuss all of
the ... issues that have not been discussed face-to-face with experts in all the
areas,'' Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks held under U.S. auspices last month in Washington -- the first after
an almost four-year hiatus -- did not go deeply into the key subjects, but
focused on procedural issues, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In these negotiations, the devil is in the details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the talks were under way, about 50 protesters, mostly university
students, staged a sit-in in Syria at the offices of the International Committee
of the Red Cross, denouncing Israel and demanding the release of Syrian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace as long as Israel keeps our men imprisoned,'' said
Maymouna al-Maqet, whose two brothers have been jailed in Israel since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Israel expects Syria's
Assad to agree in the near future to meet with Barak. He said the talks under
him broke off in 1996 over Assad's refusal to settle on a date for a meeting
with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The reclusive Assad rarely appears in public, even at home, and his trips
abroad are even rarer. In addition, he may be waiting until he is sure of
success before associating himself with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 following a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Assad wants to recover the Golan Heights, a border
enclave that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has indicated he is prepared to give up some land but has not said
whether he was willing to meet Assad's demand for territory all the way to the
Sea of Galilee, the storehouse of Israel's valuable water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   A breakthrough in the negotiations would lead to an agreement between Israel
and Lebanon since Syria controls Lebanon's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is pressing for a revival of the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River
peace accords, over which he presided in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20,
said Nabil Shaath, planning minister of Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Shaath
said Clinton and Arafat will review implementation of a U.S.-brokered interim
agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinians at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in
September.

    NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Salome Hector came off the bench to score a career-high
29 points and lead No. 19 Tulane to a 91-77 victory over Southern Mississippi on

</P>
<P>
	   Burse finished with 28 points and 20 rebounds, while Grace Daley scored 11.

demonstrated against the recent World Trade Organization meetings.

	   About 525 misdemeanor cases were filed, most charging failure to disperse or
interfering with pedestrians by blocking streets during the four-day
international conference.

<P>
	   Anti-WTO protesters had vowed to stop the WTO delegates from attending

<HEADLINE> Falcons Lead 49ers 31-15 After 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Tim Dwight score three touchdowns in the first three
quarters to help the Atlanta Falcons take a 31-15 lead over the San Francisco
49ers on Monday night in the final regular season game of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Lined up near the right sideline opposite Darnell Walker, Dwight scampered
past the San Francisco cornerback and ran to midfield, where he caught
Chandler's pass at the 35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight, who entered the fourth quarter with 7 catches for 162 yards,
stiff-armed the 49ers' last defender, linebacker Lee Woodall, and completed the
60-yard score to make it 31-7.
</P>
<P>
	   A former Big Ten track champion at Iowa, Dwight electrified the Georgia Dome
crowd with 12 seconds left in the second quarter by breaking off a 70-yard punt
return that put the Falcons up 17-7 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight raced untouched down the right sideline and then cut across the field
past five 49ers defenders for the score. He also caught a 5-yard touchdown pass
from Chris Chandler in the first quarter to give the Falcons a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   With 21 seconds left in the third quarter, the 49ers drew within 31-15 on
Travis Jervey's 1-yard run and a two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Garcia, who set up the score by completing a 47-yard pass to Terrell
Owens, hit J.J. Stokes for the pass conversion.
</P>
<P>
	   Chandler and Terance Mathis connected for a 19-yard touchdown pass with 9:28
left in the third quarter as the Falcons took a 24-7 lead. The touchdown catch
was the 50th of Mathis' career.
</P>
<P>
	   With 1:08 left in the second quarter, the Falcons went up 10-7 on a 49-yard
field goal by Morten Andersen after Gerald McBurrows recovered a fumble by
Garcia at the Atlanta 46.
</P>
<P>
	   Andersen had a 50-yard attempt blocked by San Francisco's Brentson Buckner
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia hit Owens for a 4-yard touchdown pass at the 13:50 mark of the second
quarter to forge a 7-7 tie. The 12-play, 63-yard drive was interrupted by the
Falcons unsuccessfully challenging an incomplete pass by Garcia to Jerry Rice at
the Atlanta 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Falcons coach Dan Reeves thought the ball, which was tipped by Ray Buchanan,
was caught by safety Eugene Robinson, but the replay concluded otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia's touchdown pass to Owens in the left corner of the end zone
highlighted an otherwise horrible first half for the 49ers, who had eight
penalties for 55 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The final game of the NFL's regular season matched two 4-11 teams long since
eliminated from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
	   The Falcons, who reached their first Super Bowl in 1999, had not won
back-to-back games all season. San Francisco will miss the playoffs for the
first time since 1991 and suffer their first losing season since 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   The 49ers were stopped on their first possession, handing the ball over at
the Atlanta 34 after the punt. The Falcons went 66 yards in 10 plays for the
game's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Chandler hooked up with Dwight on passes of 25 and 20 yards before going to
the speedy receiver again on third-and-goal at the 5. Dwight beat corner Ramos
McDonald off the line and grabbed a perfect throw by Chandler in the left side
of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams could be facing the end of an era. San Francisco's Jerry Rice,
the leading receiver in NFL history, and Atlanta linebacker Jessie Tuggle, the
league's active leader in tackles, might be salary-cap victims after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Falcons were trying to snap a 10-game losing streak on Monday night,
their last victory coming in 1981. Overall, Atlanta's record in these prime-time
games was 5-17.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 109, Nuggets 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 33 points and Bryon Russell added
17 as the Utah Jazz defeated the Denver Nuggets 109-89 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jazz rookie Quincy Lewis added a career-high 14 points, and John Stockton
handed out 18 assists as Utah won its 11th game in its last 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess led the Nuggets with 24 points, and Nick Van Exel and George
McCloud each added 16 as Denver dropped to 3-10 on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz, who have won five straight at home, have defeated the Nuggets in
11 of their last 12 meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets tied the game at 75 with 2:15 left in the third quarter after
trailing by as many as 13 points early in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   But Utah outscored Denver 27-12 in the final quarter to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel had 10 assists, but also turned the ball over five times.
</P>
<P>
	   With Utah leading 84-81 with 9:12 remaining, Lewis scored five unanswered
points to put Utah up 89-81.
</P>
<P>
	   That started an 11-2 run that got the Jazz ahead 95-83 with 6:29 to play.
McDyess scored two unanswered baskets to pull the Nuggets within 95-87. But the
Jazz reeled off eight straight points to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah squandered a 13-point lead it built two minutes into the half. After
cutting the lead to 75-66 with 5:06 left in the third, the Nuggets outscored the
Jazz 9-0, led by Van Exel's four points, to tie it at 75 at the 2:15 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek's basket and Lewis' 3-pointer gave the Jazz an 82-77 lead at
the end of the third quarter. Van Exel scored 12 in the period on 5-of-6
shooting, and McDyess added 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone had 23 points at halftime, including 10-of-11 from the free-throw
line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz led 27-14 with 1:45 left in their first quarter, their biggest lead
of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver cut it to 35-30 with 5:29 left in the half, as McDyess keyed an 11-4
run with four points. But the Jazz rebuilt the lead to 56-47 by the end of the
half, with Malone scoring nine points, including a 3-pointer.

    	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) - A computer malfunction at the Federal Aviation
Administration's Boston Center delayed flights at East Coast airports Monday
night.
<P>
	   Jim Peters, spokesman for FAA New England, said the main computer at the air
traffic control center went down around 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a result of the outage we incurred extensive delays throughout the
Northeast, both for flights arriving and departing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said FAA officials would not know until Tuesday what caused the
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without knowing what has caused the problem, it would be premature to
speculate," he said. "It may turn out to be something other than Y2K."
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was corrected by about 10 p.m. The center switched to a backup
computer system during the outage, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the malfunctioning computer was installed in the Nashua office last
summer and similar systems are used at the FAA's 22 control centers around the
country. He said the other centers did not experience any problems Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Peters said he did not know how many flights were affected by the problem or
what the average delay was.
</P>
<P>
	   Departures and arrivals at Logan International Airport in Boston were
delayed by at least 30 minutes because of the malfunction, according to airport
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Center controls flights over more than 160,000 square miles of
air space from the Atlantic Ocean to western New York and from the Canadian
border to south of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Departing flights at both Kennedy International Airport in New York City and
Newark International Airport in New Jersey were delayed by up to 75 minutes,
said Sgt. Reinaldo Gonzalez of the Port Authority police. Shorter delays were
experienced at La Guardia Airport in New York, Gonzalez said. The Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey runs all three airports.

<HEADLINE> BCS Mulling ABC Contract Extension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Bowl Championship Series is mulling over a four-year
contract extension offer from ABC reportedly worth as much as $400 million.
</P>
<P>
	   If the deal is accepted, it would probably keep the current BCS system in
place, meaning there wouldn't be a playoff to determine the college football
national champion until at least 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the ABC offer before us. Our membership is in the process of
talking about it," Mike Tranghese, Big East commissioner and a member of the BCS
committee, said Monday, a day before Florida State and Virginia Tech were to
play for the national title.
</P>
<P>
	   Tranghese said he wasn't sure when a final decision would be made, but added
that it would be "soon."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC refuses to comment publicly about negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The current contract, which began last season, pays the BCS about $79
million a year for four bowl games. The deal runs out after the 2002
championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   The new contract would be worth about $100 million a year, an increase of
more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It is also less than one-fifth of what CBS agreed last year to pay the NCAA
for rights to the men's basketball tournament. However, there are 63 games in
the NCAA tournament played in 26 television windows for CBS, as opposed to four
BCS games.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Steady Growth  </HEADLINE>
    By ELAINE KURTENBACH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- The deflation that has plagued China for two years appears
to have bottomed out and growth should hold steady at around 7 percent this
year, a senior official overseeing the economy said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dampening speculation that the government might loosen controls on its
currency, the yuan, this year, State Development Planning Commission chairman
Zeng Peiyan said improved trade figures meant the exchange rate could remain at
its current level, which is about 8.26 yuan per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Growth in China's gross domestic product -- the total value of all goods and
services -- was 7.1 percent in 1999 while its trade surplus reached over $30
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeng declined to give a specific estimate for growth in 2000, saying that
figure would be approved in March during the annual session of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can achieve the growth rate of 1999. We are confident this will not be a
problem," Zeng told reporters at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   China will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure such as
transportation systems, irrigation and flood control to help stimulate economic
growth, Zeng said. Last year, the government spent almost $24.2 billion on
infrastructural projects intended to promote development, improve efficiency and
stimulate private consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   He forecast that the deflationary trend that has dragged on the economy
since late 1997 will flatten out. "By the end of this year, there will be a
balance rather than a minus or positive change," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has raised salaries for many workers, especially the urban
poor, and reformed policies to encourage more spending on housing, cars and
other consumer products.
</P>
<P>
	   But state-owned factories are laying off millions of redundant workers,
leaving many Chinese reluctant to spend out of fear they might lose their jobs.
Zeng said the government planned to increase its piecemeal social welfare
systems and cut taxes and "irrational fees" charged by some government organs.
</P>
<P>
	   "After those guarantees, ordinary people will gladly spend more money," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeng acknowledged, however, that halting the decline in prices was difficult
due to the oversupply of many industrial and agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is most pronounced in the rural areas, where incomes have lagged
and bumper harvests have driven market prices ever lower, accentuating the cycle
of poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Urban per capita disposable income in 1999 was $709, while per capital rural
incomes remained at around $266. In many areas, it is much lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeng noted that the government planned to accelerate its long-term strategy
of developing the resource-rich but backward western regions of the country to
help counter the problem and promote overall national growth.
</P>
<P>
	   However, apart from recent cuts in the cost of rural electricity facilitated
by improved power distribution and output, Zeng did not name any specific new
policies to help raise rural incomes.
