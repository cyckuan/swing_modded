Swan song may be Classic tear-jerker

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It's been a long, wonderful journey, and now
it's turning sentimental. Carolyn Hine says she's already started
crying about her dappled gray horse Skip Away reaching the end of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Today he will wear a saddle for the last time as Jerry Bailey
climbs into the irons to send him out for the 1\-mile Breeders' Cup
Classic at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Hine and her 67-year-old husband, Sonny, who trains the
horse, have toured the nation to allow as many people as possible
to cheer for one of the sport's most illustrious champions.
</P>
<P>
   A third-place finish in the $5.12 million Classic would push
Skip Away's career earnings past $10 million, breaking Cigar's
record. And then the money will keep coming in, as the 5-year-old
son of Skip Trial retires to Kentucky to begin stud service. He has
been syndicated for $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to take him everywhere,'' Sonny Hine said. ``We
took him to Texas because they had a new racetrack there, and they
said we could help them out.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance at Lone Star Race Park in April 1997 was not one
of his better performances. He ran third in the Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is he hasn't been the most consistent winner _
18-of-37 for his career. But Hine on numerous occasions has raced
him when rest might have been in order. Skip Away is an equine Cal
Ripken. ``An iron horse,'' said Bob Baffert, who trains Skip Away's
main rival, Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing fourth in his first race, Skip Away has been out
of the money only once.
</P>
<P>
   But that was at Churchill Downs, in the 1996 Kentucky Derby,
when he finished 12th. And that's one reason Silver Charm iss also missing are new homes to entice buyers instead of
just renters. A few infill projects have been started, but th only
real new housing in the area will be apartments for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   That's why young professionals, people without hildren or empty
nesters are the most likely to move downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Because he needs more room and wants the tax write-off of home
ownership, Stirdivant is moving away though he loves the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could buy a home down here I would stay,'' said
Stirdivant, who is moving to a house near the Biltmore area. ``I
have pets and lots of things and need lots of space and a yard.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic neighborhoods near downtown are thriving because of
people's desire to be closer to work and the action beginning to
happen in the city's core.
</P>
<P>
   Many people moved away from central Phoenix in the 1980s lured
by emerging suburbs, but long commutes have driven them back to be
closer to their work. &QL;

Williams, Nguyen deserve hardware
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Hoouston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   They are friends and rivals, bound for a collision of epic
proportions somewhere on a fading patch of green turf come
Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They are the biggest reasons the Aggies and Longhorns are proud
again, winning again and simultaneously ranked among the nation's
best again.
</P>
<P>
   They have lifted their teams upon their shoulders and boldly
carried them to a return to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as Ricky Williams walks off the field in Austin _ no
doubt after another brilliant performance _ some 100 miles away Dat
Nguyen will walk onto the turf at Kyle Field, no doubt ready to
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns face a slight test against Oklahoma State,
followed by a scary proposition next week at Texas Tech. The Aggies
figure to trounce Oklahoma tonight, then face a big test next
weekend against underrated Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, surely, the Texas running back and the Texas A&AMP;M
linebacker are headed for a facemask-to-facemask showdown. Their
paths will cross, and when they do, it should be photographed,
framed and locked away, not just because of the talent and stakes
involved, but because of the character and renaissance these two
represent.
</P>
<P>
   They are the unlikeliest of heroes for the most traditional
Texas football powers. One is a dreadlocked California kid, the
other an undersized son of Vietnamese refugees.
</P>
<P>
   At giant state schools where Texas legends have been born,
Williams and Nguyen came from faraway places to spark the rebirth.
And if the Aggies and Longhorns really mean it this time _ if they
finally fulfill hopes and carry football in this state back to the
top _ these two should be thanked and remembered as much as Texas
coach Mack Brown, the Aggies' R.C. Slocum or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   They are putting on remarkable performances and pumping life
back into winning traditions. They have proved more than anyone to
be deserving of the Heisman Trophy and Butkus Award in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even consider anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Williams by far leads the nation in rushing and soon will have
more career yards on the ground than any other Division I player
ever. He is Division I's all-time leading scorer and tops the
country this year with 18 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   But more that that, Williams stayed in school when millions of
NFL dollars beckoned, and he did it because Texas football mattered
to him. Finishing the job mattered. Reviving a program mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, without the hype of Ohio State's Andy Katzenmoyer, has
logged more tackles, tackles for losses, sacks, fumbles forced,
fumbles recovered, passes broken up, interceptions and general
havoc wreaked than the Buckeyes' supposed Butkus front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen spent the summer choosing graduate-school courses after
earning his agricultural development degree in May. Katzenmoyer
spent it trying to pass golf, music appreciation and AIDS awareness
in order to stay eligible.
</P>
<P>
   If it is a model for the Sports Illustrated cover or a Calvin
Klein commercial you're looking for, Nguyen would be the last one
picked behind the likes of Katzenmoyer and Florida's Johnny
Rutledge. But if it's a football player, take the little guy who
plays every snap as if he's been mainlining Habaero peppers.
</P>
<P>
   It not only would be justified for Williams to win the Heisman
and Nguyen the Butkus, it would be appropriate. They are the best
things to happen to these teams in years. And they star at the
positions that once made these teams great.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the untouchable running back, much like Steve
Worster, Roosevelt Leaks and Earl Campbell. Nguyen is the fierce,
backbreaking linebacker, in the tradition of Ed Simonini, Aaron
Wallace, John Roper and Quentin Coryatt.
</P>
<P>
   Both are at their best in big games. Williams pounded Nebraska's
defense a week ago. Nguyen, among the great tacklers in NCAA
history with 10.2 per game, has made even more, 12.5, against
ranked teams. Against UCLA in last season's Cotton Bowl, he had 20
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the field, Williams and Nguyen are equally impressive,
knowing how college football players are supposed to act. Williams'
season-long tribute to former SMU great Doak Walker is less about
public relations than it is about a young man touched by a Texas
football legend. Nguyen, meanwhile, has had similar moments.
</P>
<P>
   When Nguyen heard about a 10-year-old Vietnamese immigrant
having an impossible time adjusting to life in his new country, he
went to the boy's Bryan elementary school and began speaking
Vietnamese. Nguyen told the boy: ``Nobody will hurt you here. You
are safe. You will be fine here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen visited the boy several times more, helping him master
the English language and U.S. culture.
</P>
<P>
   They are Williams and Nguyen, friends and rivals. Give them
their trophies.

 &HT;    Time for the tough part: Coming in for a landing
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ Today comes the hardest part of
John Glenn's return to space: his return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's 77-year-old body has spent nearly nine days adjusting to
life without weight. If the effects have been the same on him as
they are on other astronauts, his heart, muscles and bones are
weaker, and his senses are attuned to an environment where there's
no sensation of ``up'' or ``down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how space flight affects someone Glenn's age _
whether the effects are milder, just the same or more severe.
Finding that out, and maybe discovering new clues to why aging
itself has some of the same effects, was the main scientific reason
for Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter is scheduled to land at 12:04 p.m. today at Kennedy
Space Center in Florida, but NASA has activated its backup landing
site at Edwards Air Force Base in California in case Kennedy's
weather gets too cloudy or windy.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will feel weight again for the first time when the space
shuttle Discovery fires its engines to slow down. Gliding back into
the atmosphere, the winged orbiter will rapidly lose speed as it
plows through the thickening air.
</P>
<P>
   The G-forces of deceleration will build slowly until Glenn's
body feels twice its weight on Earth _ weight it hasn't felt in
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It progressively feels heavier and heavier,'' retired U.S.
Sen. Jake Garn recalled on the day of Glenn's launch. Garn, R-Utah,
who was the first lawmaker to fly in space, was 52 when he flew in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   After re-entry will come the constant, inescapable heaviness of
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most surprising thing to me was how heavy normal gravity
is,'' Garn said. Walking off the orbiter after landing was
difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even younger astronauts need a few weeks to get used to gravity
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes you probably a couple of weeks, depending on the
individual, to have your energy level back up and feel pretty much
back to normal,'' mission commander Curtis Brown said from space
Wednesday. Now a veteran of five space flights, Brown said
astronauts follow a program that slowly rebuilds their strength and
endurance over three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Parazynski, a physician and astronaut who also is on
Glenn's flight, echoed Brown's sentiment about Glenn's coming
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you come back to Earth's gravity, that's when you have to
work again, and your body is used to living and working in zero
gravity and all of a sudden you not only have to lift your own body
weight, but you have to lift your launch and entry suit, which is
about 70 or 80 pounds,'' Parazynski said before the flight. ``I've
always felt like a 100 year old man the first moments after getting
back home.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he added his enthusiasm for seeing how Glenn does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientifically speaking, that is a really interesting part of
the study, how an older person recovers from the challenge of space
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew's flight surgeons declined an interview request. But
Dr. Stanley Mohler, director of Wright State University's aerospace
medicine program and an aviation medical examiner, predicts Glenn
will be fit enough to walk off the shuttle after landing _ and will
insist on doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever saw a healthy, energetically performing individual,
it's Glenn,'' Mohler said from Wright State, where he has been
following Discovery's flight on NASA television.
</P>
<P>
   NASA flight surgeons and astronauts who are medical doctors go
through Wright State's aerospace medicine program, the only such
civilian program in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that if he wants to and the scientists let him,
he'll walk off the shuttle like everyone else,'' Mohler said.
</P>
<P>
   David Liskowsky, the scientist overseeing Glenn's aging
experiments, said, ``He has the option of walking off.''

RANGERS GO AFTER JOHNSON, ROGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers are ready to present free-agent
pitcher Randy Johnson with a contract offer, but are also pursuing
Oakland Athletics pitcher Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are one of several teams who have expressed an
interest in Rogers, who has formally asked the Athletics to trade
him and is looked at by teams as a cheaper alternative to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers spent much of their time yesterday preparing a
contract offer for Johnson, the free agent left-hander who remains
their primary target in a quest for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make what we feel is a competitive offer,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to disclose details. Officials in major-league
baseball said Johnson is expected to command a three- to four-year
deal with an average salary of $10 million to $12 million, similar
to what Pedro Martinez and Greg Maddux are making. Those two are
the highest-paid pitchers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he talked to Oakland general manager Billy Beane a
week ago and said, ``I told him that if Kenny were available we
would talk. But it doesn't look like we have a match. But we'll
probably talk at the general managers' meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics are looking for young starting pitching and
right-handed hitting in return, and the Rangers could offer
right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who was acquired from the Pittsburgh
Pirates in July. But the Athletics are looking for more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league officials said the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland
Indians also have interest in Rogers. The Rangers talked about
acquiring the left-hander last off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is in the final year of the four-year $20 million
contract originally signed with the New York Yankees after he left
the Rangers as a free agent. He was 16-8 with the Athletics, who
finished last in the American League West. His 3.17 earned-run
average was the third-lowest in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has the right to demand a trade because he was traded
during the middle of a multiyear contract. The Athletics must trade
Rogers by March 15 or he becomes a free agent. Oates, Melvin get
extensions The Rangers announced yesterday they have given Melvin
and manager Johnny Oates one-year contract extensions through the
year 2000. Both were already signed through 1999, but the Rangers'
policy has been to have their top baseball people signed to
two-year contracts entering a season.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has never had more than a two-year contract since becoming
the Rangers manager in 1995, but said, ``I'm a firm believer if I
do the job then I don't have to worry, and if I don't do the job, I
don't deserve to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 329-301 with two division titles since Melvin
and Oates took control after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see \Rowner\S Tom Hicks has confidence in us,''
Melvin said. ``I think the organization has done a good job, not
only at the major-league level, but on the minor-league level. I
think we'll have the best group of young prospects at big-league
camp that we've ever had.''

 &HT;    Florida next in line for Powerball
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida has accepted an invitation to become
the largest member of the 20-state Powerball lottery, setting up
potential world-record jackpots exceeding $296 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery Secretary Marcia Mann had not signed the contract with
the Multi-State Lottery Association as of Friday evening, but a
spokesman said all that remained was a review by lawyers, a
formality.
</P>
<P>
   A news release said plans were underway for sales to begin early
next year. Odds of winning: 80 million to 1, compared to 14 million
to 1 for Florida Lotto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I travel, that is one question that players almost
always ask, `Why don't we have Powerball?' '' Mann said. Its large
jackpots have attracted widespread interest, she noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was once too large to join. The 20 medium-sized states
and the District of Columbia that are part of Powerball decided
this year to expand their game by removing a ban on members with
population greater than 7 million. They invited Florida to join in
September, Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   But state Republican leaders, irked they were not consulted on
the deal, are threatening to hold hearings. They say the lottery
has a huge impact on the state's education budget, contributing
around $800 million per year, and there are plenty of unanswered
questions. Republicans, who control both legislative chambers, won
the governor's race Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terribly disappointed the lottery secretary has entered
into this contract without consulting members of the legislature or
the governor-elect,'' said incoming House Speaker John Thrasher,
R-Orange Park. He has already called for some committees to meet
Nov. 18, the day after the organizing session.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery spokesman Ed George said existing law gives Mann the
power to enter into multi-state contracts, so no consultation was
legally necessary. She planned to brief Bush but had not had a
chance to meet with the transition team, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was coincidental,'' said Edie Ousley, spokeswoman
for Gov. Lawton Chiles, who appointed Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to save her job,'' said state Sen. William
``Doc'' Myers, R-Hobe Sound, referring to expectations Gov.-elect
Jeb Bush will replace Mann. ``It might be a good idea to look at
all the ramifications of this. We've got a lot in motion with
Bright Futures scholarships and other things the lottery pays
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not decided who if anyone to appoint as lottery
secretary, said press secretary Cory Tilley. For now, he just wants
to learn more about the Powerball deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be getting more information on this today and he
(Bush) will study it over the weekend,'' Tilley said. ``A lot of
legislators are wary, it sounds like. This is something that could
have a lasting impact on the state for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann acknowledges that Powerball could ``cannibalize'' Lotto
sales. But she says that should not make a difference, because 38
cents of ever dollar on Powerball tickets sold in Florida will
still go education, as with Lotto. Indeed, she argues, Powerball
may well excite an increased overall interest in the lottery. Lotto
sales have been flagging the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Big jackpots tend to produce the biggest tickets sales, and that
is Powerball's greatest lure. In July, it rolled over to a record
$296 million jackpot. The 13 machine-shop workers in Ohio who won
opted to take $161.5 million in a lump sum rather than the full
payment over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The largest payout by Florida Lotto was $106.5 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum jackpot for Powerball is expected to be $10 million,
growing larger each time it rolls over without a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the big jackpot, Powerball has nine prize levels, with
chances to win prizes from $3 to $100,000. Florida is projected to
have an average of three $100,000 winners each week and sales of
$200 million in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will be $1, with drawings on Wednesday and Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball is offered in Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, District
of Columbia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

GINGRICH SAYS HE'S STEPPING ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also REPUBS-GINGRICH) 
(htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the
Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 and presided this year over
what at times seemed like the political destruction of President
Clinton was himself driven from office Friday by a party that
swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise,
Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other
Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker and would
leave Congress altogether when his term expired in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is
in the system,'' Gingrich said, according to a party official who
heard one of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision to resign was a stunning reversal for one of
the most combative and personally confrontational politicians in
America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one
Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style
through Tuesday's elections with last-minute commercials reminding
voters of the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday night.
In his second conference call, according to several members who
listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall.
Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take
control of Congress, they have become his most bitter critics in
the last two years of his tumultuous tenure as speaker. On Friday
night he called them cannibals who had ``blackmailed'' him into
quitting, said those who has listened to the call.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who
had marginalized the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism.
He said, `Refer to the clips.' He's blaming others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the conference call this way: ``He started off very
statesmanlike, but then you could see the anger building. When
someone asked him why he was leaving, he said, `A handful of
members have blackmailed the conference.' He said, `They're
hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been feuding with party conservatives for the last
few years. They have complained that he is not a true conservative,
that he has capitulated to Clinton on spending issues and has not
advanced conservative causes like tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision set up a scramble for a successor in the
powerful post. The speaker, who is second only to the vice
president in line for succession to the presidency, controls the
legislative agenda, committee assignments and chairmanships in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced his resignation just hours after Rep. Robert
L. Livingston, R-La. announced he would challenge Gingrich for the
job, putting himself forward as a level-headed manager who did not
have Gingrich's propensity for self-created crises.
</P>
<P>
   After Gingrich's bombshell, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, announced
he was considering his own run. Livingston and Archer are chairmen
of the two most powerful committees in the House, Appropriations
and Ways and Means, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, in a reflection of the wide-open possibilities
that other members suddenly see for advancement, Rep. Christopher
Cox of California, chairman of the Republican policy committee,
also announced his candidacy for speaker, on CNN's ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Gingrich said, ``The Republican conference needs
to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward.'' He said he
hoped his colleagues would pick a successor ``who can both
reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning
from Congress because ``Marianne and I are tired. We need time off
to get to know each other again.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   He did not specify why he was leaving Congress as well as not
seeking re-election as speaker. But his supporters conceded that
after being speaker and after consolidating more power in the
office than anyone in recent decades, he would probably find life
as a backbencher unbearable. Since he just won re-election this
week, a special election will have to be held in his Georgia
district to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative
attention to himself and to his party. ``If I stay,'' he told his
colleagues Friday night, ``my controversial nature would overshadow
any successes we might have,'' an understatement to those who
recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown of
the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the
back of Air Force One on a trip with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Republican who took notes on the second call,
Gingrich said: ``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the
members. So long as I am around, I will always be a target in the
news media, which would mean we would never be able to get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   For friends and foes alike, it was not clear that Gingrich had a
message this year beyond relying on the Clinton scandal to propel
Republicans to greater gains that never materialized. The bracing
reality is that it is Gingrich, not Clinton, who is leaving
Washington in disgrace. The next few weeks are sure to be
politically awkward for him as the House plays out the process that
he as House leader set in motion to impeach Clinton. The House
Judiciary Committee is to consider articles of impeachment
beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans took the opportunity to portray Gingrich as a
visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York said that in the
first conference call, ``there was shock and surprise and strong
expressions of appreciation for leading us to the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.David Dreier, R-Calif., called it a ``courageous'' decision.
``There were a number of members in the Republican conference that
were not prepared to ever provide support for him. And it shows
what a good man he is. He is desperate to see unity and solidarity
ahead in January.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said the speaker had the votes to win
re-election, an election to be conducted by secret ballot on Nov.
18. But they agreed that the party's slim six-vote majority meant
every vote on the House floor would be a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Duberstein, a former official in the Reagan
administration, said, ``I have no doubt he had the votes to be
speaker, but I'm not sure he had the votes to govern.'' He said
that because of the deep rifts in the party, Gingrich would not
have been able to implement his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Arkansas, said in a statement Friday
night, ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary,'' adding,
``Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we
were able to work together in the national interest, especially
Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing
leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's
resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had
fostered. ``I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker
will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was
wrought on this institution over the last four years,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would
set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than
began Wednesday morning with the disappointing election returns.
``There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne who will test the
waters,'' said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich for
re-election. ``There won't be any shortage of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's name gained currency earlier Friday when conservatives,
who were already furious with Gingrich, said they were dissatisfied
with Livingston as well.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's actions Friday captured the dizzying pace at which
events unfolded _ and the appeal of having Gingrich out of the
race. His aides said Friday afternoon that Archer was ``reviewing
his options'' and that if he decided to run, he would announce his
candidacy next week. They faxed a statement at 7:29 Friday night
saying that Archer was ``saddened'' by Gingrich's resignation.
Eleven minutes later, they faxed a statement from Archer saying he
was ``actively considering'' running for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh of Indiana, leader of a group of
conservatives in the House who had considered running for speaker
himself, said Friday that he would not run and threw his support to
Archer.
</P>
<P>
   He said Archer had the ``solid, seasoned leadership to unify our
party, chart a positive agenda during the next two years and lead
us to expand our majority in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that time was of the essence, with just 12 days
until the election, Cox announced his candidacy on ``The Larry King
Show.'' He vowed to bring order to the now-chaotic budget process
and said: ``I don't think my job is to unify the party but to unify
the Congress and the country behind an agenda that is good for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Livingston has a huge head start. He had been campaigning
for speaker anyway on the chance that Gingrich might step aside to
run for president. Since Tuesday, he has converted those long-range
plans into an extensive and immediate telephone campaign to shore
up support. He has contacted not only Republican House members but
an array of prominent Republicans across the country, including
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the Capitol Friday afternoon,
Livingston, an ally of the speaker for two decades, said he was
running for speaker now not cheerfully but resolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ideas have gotten lost, perhaps our message has gotten
lost, in the haze of high rhetoric and miscast priorities, lost in
a management style where process is subordinated to polls and
self-initiated crises,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   He cast himself as someone who could make the trains run on time
and who would not lose himself in the high-blown revolutionary of
Gingrich, who has spent much of his time traveling and raising
money. ``I'll be more of a stay-at-home type of speaker who wants
to get the job done,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich remained in his home district Friday, calling members
and seeking their support. His press secretary, Christina Martin,
issued a statement Friday afternoon saying: ``As architect of the
Republican majority, Speaker Gingrich is determined to correct the
mistakes of the past and implement a positive, issue-oriented
legislative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in an interview Friday night that Gingrich had broached
the possibility of resigning with his wife on Thursday evening and
that he had reached a decision Friday afternoon. His staff was
caught by surprise. ``This office was in full vote-counting mode,''
Ms. Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's plans beyond resignation were uncertain. He said he
would take six months off next year. But he made no mention of his
earlier notion of running for president, a path that many of his
friends said they presumed was now impossible because of the
circumstances of his departure from Congress, bearing the brunt of
blame for the party's electoral losses and the perception of him as
a divisive figure who made a better insurrectionist than leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, suggested that
Gingrich replace Jim Nicholson as chairman of the Republican
National Committee. ``I would love for Newt to become our national
chairman right now,'' he said. In a sign of the turmoil aswirl in
the party, the governor said Gingrich would be more adept at
handling the press than Nicholson. ``The media circus surrounding
politicians is not his strength,'' he said of Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he spoke by telephone with Gingrich. ``He's weary
and said he was tired,'' Engler said. ``It's been a grueling
campaign.''

JACK HARTMAN, 73, LONGTIME KANSAS STATE BASKETBALL COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., N.M., Ill.)   (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Hartman, who led Kansas State to more basketball victories
than any other coach in school history, and who coached the Knicks'
great Walt Frazier at Southern Illinois, died Friday morning at St.
Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   According to a radio report, the cause of death was heart
failure, but the hospital would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, who had celebrated his birthday on Thursday, coached 16
years at Kansas State, compiling a 295-169 record before retiring
after the 1985-86 season. He came out of retirement in 1996 when
the Kansas State women's coach was suspended, and he served as
coach for the season's final seven games, posting a 3-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman had served as a color analyst for the Wildcat Television
Network for the past 11 years. He tried to leave the university
once, accepting a job at his alma mater, Oklahoma State, in 1977.
But a day after accepting a five-year contract at the school where
he had played for the legendary Hank Iba, he decided to remain in
Manhattan, Kan., citing ``a hasty and rash decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman went to Kansas State in 1970 and led the team to three
Big Eight Conference titles and two conference tournament titles.
He had eight 20-victory seasons and seven NCAA tournament berths.
In 1981, a season that included a victory over Oregon State, then
ranked No. 2 in the nation, Hartman was named coach of the year by
the National Association of Basketball Coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he was head coach of the U.S. gold-medal winning Pan
American Games team that included Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman suffered a heart attack on Jan. 13, 1985, then had
quadruple-bypass surgery and missed the final 15 games of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at Kansas State, he compiled a 144-64 record in
eight seasons at Southern Illinois, guiding the Salukis to a 24-2
record in 1967, when, with Frazier in the backcourt, they won the
NIT championship. He was named coach of the year by The Sporting
News that year. He began his career at Coffeyville (Kan.) Community
College, where his 1962 team went 32-0 and became the first
unbeaten junior college team to capture the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an influence on me, not only from a player's standpoint
of being coached by him, but also off the floor,'' said Lon Kruger,
the current Illinois coach who played for Hartman at Kansas State
from 1971 to 1974 and then succeeded him as coach. ``He stressed
playing unselfishly, taking care of your responsibilities and doing
it in a very ethical way. Character was so important to him. He
took such satisfaction in beating those who cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman is survived by his wife, Pat, and three daughters, Jana,
Davy, and Jackie.

THERE'S A WINNER IN TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Nine games is nothing. Nine games is a hiccup, not a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless . . .
</P>
<P>
   You've got a winner in town.
</P>
<P>
   `There are a lot of steps to go,` Keith Tkachuk said. `But at
least we're on the right track.`
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the Coyotes crossed a bridge. They lost Dallas
Drake eight minutes into the game. They didn't play particularly
well. They relied on their goaltender, leaned on their new mission.
They simply did enough to beat the defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   Enough to equal the best start in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   `Nice to be a part of,` Jeremy Roenick said. `Now I'm looking
forward to being 7-2-1.`
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many of these lately, games that transcend
the schedule and become civic mileposts. Those that were left
behind a trail of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State rolled over for Notre Dame. The Cardinals needed
eight turnovers to edge the Bears. The NBA lockout erased a
potential visit from Michael Jordan and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on a rare night when a hockey game became an event, the
Coyotes legitimized their record, their quick break from the gate.
When they awake this morning, they will find they have created a
buzz in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   How far it goes is up to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a beautiful day (today),'' Roenick said. ``And I
hope we ruined it for everyone of those Detroit Red Wings fans that
were out there with red shirts on.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the pre-game denials, this was an important evening for
the Coyotes. Facing their first four-game losing streak in five
years, it was an important night for the visitors, too.
</P>
<P>
   The champions knew where to prod, where to poke. They tested the
Coyotes' maturity. They came in high, with elbows out. They knocked
Drake into La La Land. They doubled up on Tkachuk, high and low.
They did anything they could to bring back the penalty-crazed
Coyotes of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   After a brilliant opening period, the hosts staggered for a
while in the second. Bad penalty here, bad penalty there. But the
mistakes were contained, minimized, covered up by gritty effort. In
the third period _ and this was the best sign of all _ the Coyotes
refused to let go of the victory.
</P>
<P>
   `Everybody's stepping up their play,` Tkachuk said. `We didn't
have that last year. Guys were falling asleep.`
</P>
<P>
   Last time the Red Wings were in town, Nikolai Khabibulin was on
the shelf. Injured, physically and emotionally. Unable to stay
healthy, unable to put a team on his shoulders, unable to join the
fraternity of elite netminders.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Khabibulin, a man whose silence belies his pride. He is
still making the acrobatic save. Now, he's also playing the angles,
making all the consistent stops. On Friday, he was simply
sensational. Since opening night, he has held every opponent to two
goals or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   `Khabibulin played unbelievable,` Tkachuk said. `He carried the
load, and we found a way to win. That's what we've got to do.
That's what good teams do. They find ways to win.`
</P>
<P>
   Last time the Red Wings were in town, they closed the lid on the
Coyotes' season. Bounced from the playoffs, inside a dressing room
heavy with the silence of failure, the losers talked about
improving. About commitment. About abandoning their
self-destructive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games into the season, they're doing what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Bobby Smith for making the right moves. Credit Jim
Schoenfeld for tightening the screws. Credit Tkachuk for glimpses
of real leadership. Credit Roenick for making the top line work.
Credit Rick Tocchet for a level of professionalism rarely seen in
sports. Credit Bob Corkum for all the little stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For now, credit everyone. For realizing, accepting and living
the law of teamwork and the law of the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   That the strength of the pack is the wolf. And the strength of
the wolf is the pack.

COMMENTARY: LOVERS &AMP; HATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a new spirit wafting through the land.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, baby, we're talking about love power.
</P>
<P>
   The voters have chosen the lovers over the haters. The meanies
with the jangly names _ Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Lauch Faircloth,
Fob James, ``B-1'' Bob Dornan _ are toast. So are the guys like Al
D'Amato, who sneered and jeered and used ethnic and anatomical
epithets. So are the Christian zealots. And obsessive special
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic lover boys, like Bill Clinton, and the Republican
preachers of compassion, like the Bush boys, are being embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse ``the Body'' Ventura may have been a body-slamming,
pile-driving bad boy in the ring, but the big lug just seems so
darn huggable when he says he will continue to be a volunteer high
school football coach even after he starts work at the Minnesota
statehouse. And you've got to figure a governor in a fringed jacket
is not going to do anything too Draconian.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the Gingrich fall is this: When politicians behave
like wrestlers, caricature villains who are only out to destroy
their opponents, then the voters might as well get the real thing.
Even if Ventura makes a mess in Minnesota, he can't possibly rival
the mess the GOP House leadership has made in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as he slipped the first shiv into the speaker's back,
Bob Livingston tried to drape his palace coup in lacy doilies: ``I
love him dearly. He's my friend.'' He sounded more like Rosie than
Brutus. He called ``his dear friend'' Newt ``a man of Churchillian
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the moment he was threatening Gingrich, the bland
Livingston did not seem very threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent, the boyish Hall-of-Fame football player from
Oklahoma who wants to topple Armey, said the Republicans had to
recapture that twinkling, leading-man magic of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Far from throwing bombs and raving about impeachment, Largent
promoted himself for the job of House majority leader by saying he
shares a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood with two Democratic
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the nasty Armey, who ``slipped'' and called Barney Frank
``Barney Fag,'' Largent claimed he actually liked working with
liberals and moderates _ and had met with Barney Frank, Gerry
Studds and David Bonior in an effort to ``build the relationship
and the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr made a monumental mistake. They were
not merely content with punishing the president for having an
affair in the Oval Office with an intern. They wanted to kill off
the lax moral spirit of the '60s and stomp on what Gingrich in 1994
disdainfully called the ``Great Society, counterculture
McGovernik'' legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Both men thought they could banish situational ethics and
restore '50s black-and-white morality. But gray is the fashion this
fall. While baby boomers are more conservative, sexually and
politically, and more materialistic than they once were, they don't
want to go back to McGuffey Readers and twin beds. And a lot of
them remember the '60s fondly.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation is mod. The extremes are extremely out. The message
of the election was more kisses and hugs, fewer vendettas and
wired-up girlfriends. More terms of endearment, fewer articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is in shock this weekend. It's hard to believe that
we are already in the post-Newt era. With a brief statement issued
on Friday night, the history professor was history.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House there is already galloping Newt nostalgia.
The day after the election, West Wing strategists were salivating
over the prospect of running Al Gore against Newt Gingrich and Ken
Starr, no matter who won the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With the speaker dumped and Starr's feet sticking out from under
the house like the Wicked Witch of the East after the tornado,
Democrats may have gotten too much of what they wished for. Clinton
has so far been blessed with the overreaching of his enemies. The
spotlight will now shift away from the president's enemies to the
president himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mad, mad world. Who would have ever thought that the man
Monica would bring down would be Newt?

DISAPPOINTMENT GREETS NEWS IN GINGRICH'S DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (See also REPUBS-GINGRICH, REPUBS-LEADERSHIP) 
(lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSWELL, Ga. _ In other places, perhaps, Newt Gingrich stands
for other things, for fervid conservative political ideals that
seem to exclude some Americans. But here in Roswell, where the
suburban sprawl has etched itself deep into the mountains, Gingrich
stood mostly for independence.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the people here in his suburban Atlanta congressional
district felt that Gingrich believed, as they did, in a person's
paying his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich believed ``in giving people the responsibility for
living their own lives,'' said Ray Uecker, a landscape consultant
who lives in Roswell. ``People here don't look to the government
for their well-being. That's the way it should be. Gingrich
believed that. It works. It really does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Gingrich's district, people _ many of them the mostly
white, middle-class families and retirees who made up his power
base _ reacted with disbelief and disappointment when they heard
that the speaker had said he was stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was more than a political leader here. He took their
philosophy of self-reliance and shook it in the face of people who
had different political ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed, but I don't blame him,'' said Uecker, 57.
``He always had a bum rap from the press, from day one. He was
always attacked by the liberal Democrats. But he was just a smart
man with some good ideas, and they were afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Uecker added: ``He spoke frankly. He didn't pander to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   They had hoped that some day he would be the president. Now that
possibility is almost certainly lost.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich became synonymous with the subdivisions of nearly
identical but neat suburban houses where people for decades have
turned to get away from what many of them considered the urban
blight of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   People here cannot understand what is wrong with enjoying the
life that they worked for, with having a nice house, a nice car and
schools a cut above the inner city, things that they believed
Gingrich had helped create and protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like him,'' said Jon Shamroe, 39, a salesman, as he
gassed up his white Mercedes. Shamroe, who said he always votes
straight Republican, said the news came unexpectedly. He knew
Gingrich was under fire but hoped he would weather this crisis as
he had weathered others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been real good in Roswell,'' Shamroe said. ``I
have a nice house. I have a good job.'' Gingrich, he added, stood
for that kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a Chinese restaurant here, a young couple with two small
children were having an enjoyable night out until they heard about
their favorite politician. Paul Bishop, a computer programmer, and
his wife, Cheryl, reacted with the same word: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   They regard Gingrich not just as a powerful Washington
politician, but as the man who always rode in Roswell's Youth
Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed him this year,'' Mrs. Bishop said. It might have
been a sign of worse things to come for his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bishop was just as surprised as everyone else, he did
think that some changes in the Republican Party might come after
the poor showing in Tuesday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that the party had to come out more strongly
for issues that it supports, and not just issues that it is
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party is just trying to find out what
it is for,'' he said. ``They're pro-life, pro-family, for fiscal
responsibility. Those are the things that he stood for.''
</P>
<P>
   But like a lot of people in this district, they believe that
someone's head had to roll after the elections, and they were
saddened that it was their candidate, their champion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People here were stunned that in a time when President Clinton
seemed to be hanging by the thinnest of threads, it was Gingrich
who had been dropped, even if by his own hand, from the national
political scene. That sickened people like Uecker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is getting a high percentage of support at the
same time people think he is a liar and cheat,'' he said. ``That's
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's announcement left 24-year-old Claudia Gurra feeling
hopeless. ``I can't believe this,'' said Ms. Gurra, who works for
Nationsbank and lives in Roswell. ``This gives me no hope at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Mack Mattingly, who described himself as having
known Gingrich for more than 20 years, said that he was surprised
by the timing of the announcement but that Gingrich had said he was
``tired,'' and also said ``being attacked consistently wears you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel badly for him, but he made his choice,''
Mattingly said. ``He also said Congress won't change. Congress
doesn't define strategy; the party does. All this changes is who is
at the helm.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - It was a night that brought back a lot of memories,
but fortunately for the Phoenix Coyotes, their 3-1 victory over
Detroit on Friday night didn't bring back memories of the Red Wings
dumping them from the Stanley Cup playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Memories?
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the victory pushed the Coyotes' record to 6-2-1,
the franchise's best NHL start since the 1982-83 season, when it
was in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's loss was its fourth straight, matching the Wings'
longest losing streak since October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' Jim Cummins scored his first goal since March of
the 1996-97 season to give Phoenix an early 1-0 lead at 6:33
minutes of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it the first point that Cummins, a native of the
Detroit suburb of Dearborn, has scored as a Coyote since joining
the team last March via trade, but also the 15th goal of his
career. Three of them (20 percent) have come against Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin couldn't change history, but he
helped erase the memories of his poor playoff showing against
Detroit last year with a brilliant showing in which he blocked 30
shots, including 10 power-play shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niki played a fantastic game,'' said Coyotes Captain Keith
Tkachuk, who scored the game-winner at 16:48 of the first period
after taking a tape-to-tape pass from Bob Corkum and beating Chris
Osgood on a breakaway. ``He carried the load, and we found a way to
win. That's what we've got to do, and that's what good teams do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great measuring stick to play the best team in hockey
and get out with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   And, last but not least, for Coyote Dallas Drake, it brought
back memories of last year, when he knocked Detroit's Darren
McCarty silly with a hard check.
</P>
<P>
   It happened at exactly the same spot on this ice, but this time,
the roles were reversed. It was Drake who was helped from the ice
at 8:03 of the first period. He suffered cuts on his nose and
mouth, and he took a seat for the rest of the game because of a
mild concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's exit, coupled with a second period fraught with Phoenix
penalties, had Coach Jim Schoenfeld throwing out a mishmash of
lines the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what was happening,'' Coyotes center Jeremy
Roenick said. ``I was just hoping that Schoney wasn't going to put
me in net.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said his mad on-the-fly chemistry was a product of
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of things there,'' Schoenfeld said.
``Drake goes down and it messes up the first line. Then we had a
lot of faceoffs in our zone, and Corkum was out taking them, and if
we don't get him off, his line isn't ready to go, which upset our
equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to change centers on the (Daniel) Briere line because
he wasn't as sharp tonight as he was in Los Angeles. It was a
situation with so many penalty kills, and with Dallas out and so
many penalty-kill faceoffs, there weren't many times when we had
the next line rested and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game in which Phoenix played two superb periods and
took a walkabout in the second period, when the Coyotes were forced
to kill four penalties after coming out of the first period with a
2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cummins' goal kind of typified the night,'' Schoenfeld said.
``It was a hard-working goal, and in order for us to win the hockey
game, we really had to dig deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Dig deep as in Khabibulin's defense. He blocked 13 shots before
they reached him, with Gerald Diduck stopping five.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the goal by Cummins, the Coyotes enforcer, was an
awkward, two-handed backhand after winning a 30-foot one-on-one
battle with defenseman Mathieu Dandenault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have decent skills and can contribute,'' Cummins
said. ``It's not all about being physical and fighting. With the
game being on ESPN and a lot of my friends at home watching, and
playing my old team, yeah, it made it extra special.''
</P>
<P>
   Corkum was an iron man. He was 11 for 23 on faceoffs, but he
also played 31 shifts and nearly 20 minutes, finally getting a much
deserved empty net goal with 36 seconds remaining in the game. &QL;

DEVO BOLTS TO LA, D-BACKS NOT UNHAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the Diamondbacks begin their second season on the
road April 5 and play their home opener one week later at Bank One
Ballpark, Devon White will be in center field.
</P>
<P>
   But not for them.
</P>
<P>
   He will be wearing Dodger blue.
</P>
<P>
   White, the Diamondbacks' MVP and the team's first representative
in the All-Star Game, departed the desert Friday and signed a
three-year, $12.4 million free-agent contract with the Los Angeles
Dodgers. The Dodgers will have a team option for a fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who acquired White in a trade with Florida on
Nov. 18, the day of the expansion draft, had lukewarm interest in
having him return.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that was due to the money and length of contract he
would demand. Another factor was the Diamondbacks' interest in
signing Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees to a free-agent
deal. A third reason: age. White will turn 36 in December.
</P>
<P>
   Some media outlets reported Friday that the Diamondbacks already
have offered Williams a seven-year contract for almost $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. admitted having
discussions with Williams' agent, Scott Boras, but said no offers
have been made. Friday was the first day that teams could make
contract offers to free agents other than their own. Williams and
Boras are due to visit the Valley next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also have a strong interest in left-handed
starter Randy Johnson and have indicated that he is their top
priority. But signing both Johnson and Williams would be extremely
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   As for White's agreement with the Dodgers, Garagiola said, ``The
deal he got was not someplace we could have gotten, both for years
and money.''
</P>
<P>
   White's salary in 1998 was $3.5 million, but the Diamondbacks
only had to pay about half, with Florida picking up the rest. With
the Dodgers, he will receive $2.5 million in 1999, $4 million in
2000 and $5 million in 2001. The team has a $5.5 million option in
2002 with a $900,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Because White is a Type A free agent, the Diamondbacks will
receive two draft choices as compensation, one in the first or
second round and one as a sandwich pick.
</P>
<P>
   White was unavailable for comment. He is with a major league
all-star team that opened a series in Japan on Friday. White's
agent, Eric Goldschmidt, said the Dodgers were his first choice.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first move by Kevin Malone in his role as the new
general manager of the Dodgers. Los Angeles also has shown interest
in Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a major piece to the puzzle,'' Malone said.
``He (White) is a very good fit. We needed to make a move quickly,
I think, to get a player of this guy's ability. We're now locked in
for the next three years with a premier, premier center fielder.
That's comforting to know.''
</P>
<P>
   White, a seven-time Gold Glove winner, showed great range in the
field for Arizona with an average arm. He had one of his best
offensive seasons, hitting .279 with 22 homers, 85 RBIs, 32 doubles
and 22 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season started, there were questions as to how much
he had left, but he had a great year. We thank him and wish him
well,'' Diamondbacks Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier Friday dealing with the team's
operating expenses, debt and ticket prices, Colangelo said the team
had to find creative ways to gain flexibility in improving its
product on the field while keeping salaries within reason.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know that the Dodgers would help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes flexibility happens by choice, sometimes by things
out of control. Who would have thought?'' he said. ``Obviously, we
now have a void to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   How will that be accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   Williams is an option, although he likely will command at least
$12 million per season. Garagiola said current Arizona players Andy
Fox, David Dellucci and Karim Garcia could step in, but a more
permanent solution is desired.
</P>
<P>
   Another free-agent possibility is San Diego's Steve Finley.
Garagiola said Arizona has a strong interest, and he has spoken to
Finley's agent.
</P>
<P>
   At 34 on opening day next season, Finley is four years older
than Williams. But even if Finley got a raise from his $3.4 million
in 1998, the salary still would be dwarfed in comparison to
Williams'.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also could make a deal with San Francisco for
Dante Powell, who was the Giants' No. 1 draft pick (22nd overall)
in 1994. He played for the Triple-A Phoenix Firebirds in 1996 and
1997. &QL;

MOSTLY PAIN, LITTLE GLORY  
 SENIOR FREEDMAN REFLECTS ASU'S SEA SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - He is the poster boy for Arizona State's season.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised. Battered. And unable to live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Mitchell Freedman is one of 16 seniors who will suit
up today for their final home game. The players say they are united
in trying to salvage the season. A homecoming victory over
California is a necessary step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done,'' Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. The Sun Devils are banged up, led by J.R.
Redmond's sprained ankle. The tailback is expected to start, but
that also was the case a week ago against Oregon State and he
managed just two carries. Freedman, too, will start, despite a rash
of injuries that has slowed his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitchell is really stubborn,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said.
``He wants to play, period. I think we'd have to shoot him for him
not to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of him. He said to me, `There are not many
people who believed I'd get this far.' . . . If there's anybody who
has the ability to overcome whatever pain it might be, it would be
Mitchell Freedman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (4-4, 3-2 Pac-10) need this game. They must win
two of their remaining three to be bowl eligible, and the Golden
Bears (5-3, 3-2) are regarded as the lighter of the three
opponents. Road games against Oregon and Arizona remain.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's seniors never dreamed their final home game would carry
such implications considering their past three seasons were winning
ones. The Sun Devils were a combined 20-4 in 1996 and 1997 and were
a Top 10 pick in many preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   But unrealistic expectations, injuries, academic casualties and
the absence of leadership contributed to a 2-4 start. ASU appears
to have turned the corner, but is it too late?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Losing) is hard to get used to, and I don't want to get used
to it,'' senior wide receiver Lenzie Jackson said. ``It kind of
took me by surprise. I expected the team to do well. We were ranked
so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing. I learned to cope with it. But I don't
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has felt the impact of a slow start. His numbers are
down, primarily because of the team's early offensive struggles. He
has 32 catches for 425 yards and three touchdowns, compared with 41
for 574 yards and four touchdowns at this point last season.
</P>
<P>
   He will face his stiffest challenge of the season today. The
Bears lead the conference in pass defense and allow just 180 yards
per game. California's overall defense is ranked second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just telling our receivers this is going to be the best
defensive back crew we've faced,'' Jackson said. ``They're really
physical. They get at you. Into the fourth quarter, they're still
trying to hurt you, shut you down.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be an intriguing meeting with an ASU offense that has
scored 82 points in its past two games.
</P>
<P>
   So who has the edge?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's necessarily a winner and a loser in
that scenario,'' Bears Coach Tom Holmoe said. ``A lot of factors
come into play. It might come down to one or two players. But
there's no question our defense has played a major role in our
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Snyder, ``I think in the history of football, people would
rather have an outstanding defense than an outstanding offense. In
today's world, with the ability to score points so fast, it may not
be as true. But I still believe as the course of the game goes on,
it's your defense that makes the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the key will be ``how well we can block their
movement. And field position.''
</P>
<P>
   California's offense has struggled and ranks last in the Pac-10
in every category. In 30 trips inside the 20-yard line, the offense
has scored just 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Justin Vedder and wide receiver Dameane Douglas, who
leads the Pac-10 in receptions (71), will try to exploit a
secondary that has allowed a conference-high 16 touchdowns and has
recorded the second-fewest interceptions (five). &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Holmoe may start freshman Saleem Muhammad at fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Randy Leaphart, who has missed the past six games because
of a right knee sprain, is expected to start at right guard. Troy
Davis will start at right tackle. &QL;

UA ATTEND ANCE NOT ROSY  
 SMALL CROWDS FAC TOR INTO PASADENA'S PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Arizona's surprising season has been loaded with
big victories and bigger plays. It's been a biggie in every way but
one:
</P>
<P>
   Hometown crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Pac-10 Conference media poll in September? It was
right on in one respect. The Wildcats, second in the league's
current football standings, were picked to finish fifth. That's
exactly where they rank in the conference's home attendance race.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth and phooey.
</P>
<P>
   It raises a difficult question:
</P>
<P>
   Can there be a Rose Bowl season if nobody is there to see it?
</P>
<P>
   With the Wildcats heavily favored to go 9-1 tonight against
Washington State at Arizona Stadium, the possibility of their first
Rose Bowl ever is still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   But they might have to win the conference outright to get there,
which is not an impossibility if UCLA's difficult victory last
Saturday at Stanford is a hint that the league-leading Bruins are
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of argument, let's say UCLA recovers and wins
impressively enough to jump back to either first or second in the
Bowl Championship Series poll and earns a trip to the Tostitos
Fiesta Bowl. Arizona, 10th in the BCS, also wins its final three
games and is in sole possession of second in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl, under no obligation to take the league's second
team, looks around. It sees more than 12,000 empty seats at Arizona
Stadium for the Wildcats' 38-3 victory over nationally ranked
Oregon for second place in the Pac. It sees nearly 10,000 empty
seats tonight. About 48,000 are expected for Washington State, the
Wildcats' homecoming game during a week when they cracked the
national Top 10 in the BCS and Associated Press polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' highest home-crowd attendance average ever was
56,562 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   An unwritten rule in any bowl consideration of teams is simply
this: Have fans, will travel. The invitation goes to Wisconsin or
Notre Dame instead of the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   If fans can't travel Tucson's streets to Arizona Stadium, the
Rose Bowl's selection committee has no reason to believe they'd
make the trek to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's disappointing crowd has generated debate and
theories as to why the Wildcats don't draw bigger crowds.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Halloween theory. The day came on the same evening
of Arizona's impressive victory over Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were just a lot of people where trick-or-treating was
really big,'' said Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, whose Wildcats (8-1,
4-1 Pac-10) are 23{-point favorites over Washington State (3-5, 0-5
Pac-10). ``If I have young kids, I'm going to watch the game on TV
and take the kids trick-or-treating.''
</P>
<P>
   From a man with uncommon common sense in a crazy business,
Tomey's argument is reasonable. For one night. But what about those
other nights? What about tonight?
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing theory is that Tucson is a basketball town.
Football is just a way to spend time before the Wildcats make their
next run at The Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona's lone loss, 52-28, to UCLA, remarks in the press
box and among departing fans shouted as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the basketball season can start,'' somebody said while
heading for the press box elevator at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the game represented Arizona's high-water mark in
attendance, 58,738, this season. The capacity crowd arrived for a
game against a traditional basketball power a week after
quarterback Oretge Jenkins, a reserve guard on the Arizona
basketball team, said he ``used his basketball abilities'' for his
fabled flip at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jenkins needs to attempt another flip.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it just takes time.
</P>
<P>
   An example is Oregon. The Ducks earned a Rose Bowl trip in 1994
during a season in which crowds averaged 34,058, about 10,000 shy
of Autzen Stadium's capacity. The next season, 1995, Oregon's home
crowds jumped to an average of 44,421.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Wildcats are flipping, throwing and running for a
33-point-per-game average and scoring from everywhere but the
seats. &QL;

SWINDELL SOUGHT FOR BULLPEN HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks are moving closer to adding a
left-hander to their pitching staff, but it isn't who you might
think.
</P>
<P>
   While a decision from  &UR; Randy Johnson is at least two weeks away,
the team is trying to shore up its bullpen via free agency with
veteran
 &UR; Greg Swindell, who in 1986 was the second overall pick in the
amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, who recently moved to the southeast Valley, began the
1998 season with the Minnesota Twins and was dealt to the Boston
Red Sox at the July 31 trading deadline. He finished with a
combined record of 5-6 with a 3.59 ERA and two saves in 90 innings.
He has a career record of 115-108.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona used two primary left-handers out of the bullpen during
its inaugural season. &UR; Omar Daal began the season there, then moved
into the starting rotation after a shoulder injury to
left-hander &UR; Joel
 &UR; Adamson. &UR; Alan Embree was acquired from Atlanta in a June trade and
filled the left-handed spot thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Swindell, who turns 34 in January, would not
necessarily mean that Embree would be headed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give us more flexibility,'' Diamondbacks General
Manager
 &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell also could provide flexibility as an occasional
starter. After being selected by Cleveland with the second overall
pick in 1986 out of the University of Texas, he went on to start
269 games through 1997. His best season as a starter came in 1988,
when he finished 18-14.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said that he had been in touch with &UR; Alan and &UR; Randy
 &UR; Hendricks, Swindell's agents, advising them of the Diamondbacks'
interest, although the two sides could not exchange salary figures
until Friday. Swindell made $1.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also indicated interest in us. Now we'll see where that
takes us,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendricks brothers did not return phone calls to ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also are seeking versatility in their position
players, much the same as the role filled by &UR; Andy Fox in 1998. A
potential target is &UR; Greg Colbrunn, who could provide a solid
right-handed bat off the bench, give Travis Lee a breather at first
base and see action at other positions.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn, 29, was a sixth-round pick by the Montreal Expos in
1987. He also played for Florida and Minnesota and in 1998 split
time between the Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves. He was one of
the National League's top pinch-hitters and finished with a .307
average, three home runs and 23 RBIs in 166 at-bats. He made
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definite interest on Greg's part,'' agent  &UR; Steve
Schneider said. ``He wants to know what his role might be because
he wants the opportunity to play as much as possible. He's a guy
who's capable of playing multiple positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola will leave today to attend the annual general managers
meetings in Naples, Fla. Schneider expects further discussions when
Garagiola returns late next week. &QL; 
Colangelo on tickets &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managing General Partner  &UR; Jerry Colangelo said Friday that the
team's 12 percent ticket price increase for 1999 was justified, but
he acknowledged that announcing the increase during Fan
Appreciation Weekend was terrible timing.
</P>
<P>
   He said team and ballpark expenses have been so high that the
franchise is just breaking even despite ranking in the top fifth in
revenue this year. &QL; 
Brede released &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks released outfielder-first baseman  &UR; Brent Brede,
who agreed to a contract with the Japanese Pacific League's Chiba
Lotte Marines. Brede, selected from the Minnesota Twins in the
expansion draft, hit .226 in 98 games. &QL;

WHITE TURNS TO DODGER BLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone wasted no
time getting involved in the free-agent market, signing center
fielder Devon White to a three-year, $12.4 million contract Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a club option for a fourth year at $5.5
million with a $900,000 buyout. White was unavailable for comment
because he is touring Japan with a major-league all-star team.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said it was important to begin putting the pieces
together for the Dodgers' 1999 team on the first day clubs were
allowed to sign free agents from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a major piece to the puzzle, it's a very good
fit,'' Malone said. ``We had to make a move quickly to get a player
of that ability. He's a player with speed, he's a run-producer,
he's one of the best defensive center fielders in the league. Three
times he's been on a world championship team. He's a good fit for
what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said signing the first free agent is crucial to setting
the tone for future signings, and that's why a deal was struck so
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of my professional career, I like
to establish the market,'' Malone said. ``I like to get out there
and have everybody catch me. I like to set the pace. We'll continue
to evaluate the market and strategize as we look at what other
clubs are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us in a positive position to make another deal. It
creates flexibility and opens up a lot of directions we can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Malone earlier stated that the Dodgers would look into
signing center fielder Bernie Williams, Malone found White more to
his liking considering Williams would demand more than $10 million
per season. That leaves Malone with still an adequate amount of
money to pursue Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown and Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had numerous discussions with Bernie Williams,'' Malone
said. ``I was on the phone with (Williams' agent) Scott Boras for a
long time (Thursday) night, talking baseball in general. I just
felt Devon White was the best fit for the next three years, maybe
the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who turns 36 on Dec. 29, hit .279 with 22 homers, 85 RBI
and 22 stolen bases for the Diamondbacks last season. He began his
major-league career with the Angels in 1985, was traded to the Blue
Jays before the 1991 season, then signed with the Marlins as a free
agent before the 1996 season. He was a part of the Toronto teams
that won back-to-back World Series titles in 1992 and '93, and was
on the Marlins' World Series champion in 1997. He's a seven-time
Gold Glove winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important facts about Devon White is that he's
a National League player,'' Malone said. ``He knows the ballparks,
he knows the National League pitchers. He's a National League
All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't hurt that White is an ex-Marlin, which means he
knows Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson and Bobby Bonilla, also
ex-Marlins now with the Dodgers. With White in center field, Malone
said Sheffield will have no problem playing left field and letting
Raul Mondesi go back to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dodgers manager) Davey (Johnson) had a long conversation with
Mr. Sheffield earlier in the week,'' Malone said. ``He assured us
he'll play wherever Davey wants him to play, whether that's left
field, third base, first base, wherever. Anywhere Davey wants him
to play, he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   According to White's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, the negotiations
went smoothly because there was a mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin right out of the gate expressed interest in Devon and
said he was their first choice as far as center field,''
Goldschmidt said. ``And L.A. was Devon's first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said where White hits in the lineup will be up to Johnson
but said he expected White to hit second behind leadoff hitter Eric
Young.

DRAKE SUFFERS MILD CONCUSSION

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes right wing  &UR; Dallas Drake suffered a mild
concussion during a first-period hit from Detroit's  &UR; Darren McCarty
and missed the rest of Friday night's game at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Drake will be re-examined today. It isn't known how long he may
be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The play occurred eight minutes into the game when McCarty
flattened Drake a couple of seconds after the Phoenix forward
passed the puck in the Detroit zone. McCarty, whistled for charging
on the hit, steamrolled into Drake and swung an elbow, bloodying
Drake's face.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said he will not send a
tape of the hit to the NHL office for review. Drake said he didn't
think it was a dirty play. &QL; 
Fedorov's slump &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After collecting $26 million in bonuses from his $38 million
contract last spring, Detroit center  &UR; Sergei Fedorov will now have
to be comfortable living on $2 million a year for the next five
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem. But his production is starting to become
one. After being held pointless Friday against the Coyotes, he has
just two goals and four assists in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing well at all,'' Fedorov said. ``I'm not kidding
myself. I'm looking for some answers about how I can draw more from
myself on the ice, about how I can be more successful, about how I
can be more productive. I'm looking for answers and I'm searching
for them very hard.'' &QL; 
Petit, Lemieux activated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Michel Petit and right wing  &UR; Jocelyn Lemieux were
activated off the injured, non-roster list and cleared to play
Friday after missing the first eight games and all of the
preseason. Petit was out with a concussion, Lemieux with a
fractured right collarbone. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat
who for almost five decades has been a fixture of American politics
as a presidential adviser, scholar and member of Congress,
announced Friday that he would not run for re-election when his
fourth term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have been 24 years,'' Moynihan said in an interview,
adding: ``I've been very happy, and there was a very positive note
to this last election. It's time to make room for others.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Moynihan, 71, who has been among the state's
most popular elected officials for years, is certain to trigger
fierce competition in both major parties to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, a dozen of the state's best-known
politicians were being mentioned as possible candidates for the
seat, including New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, and
Democrats H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller; Andrew Cuomo, the
U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Donna Shalala,
the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement comes at moment when New York's
congressional delegation has been steadily losing seniority and
influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. In the last two
years, six members of the state's 31- member House delegation have
resigned or announced plans to retire, including its three most
powerful Republicans: Susan Molinari of Staten Island, Bill Paxon
of Buffalo and Gerald Solomon of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the last remaining
Republican in the Senate from the metropolitan region of New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut, was defeated by Rep. Charles Schumer, a
nine-term Democrat from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Moynihan first made his announcement that he would
retire, during an interview with Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV in New
York, New York Republicans had been warning that the entire
metropolitan area would lose much clout in Congress if D'Amato was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Democrats said that Tuesday's election, in which
their party gained five House seats, had led them to believe that
they could recapture control of the House in 2000 and of the Senate
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same general trends which elected Chuck Schumer and which
produced a complete Democratic Senate delegation in the metro area
will be working in 2000,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement prompted a flood of news releases from
Gov. George Pataki, Giuliani and New York City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone praising his 22 years in office and bemoaning his
decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting an assessment of Moynihan in the Almanac of American
Politics, Giuliani called the senator ``the best thinker among
politicians since Lincoln and the best politician among thinkers
since Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has had a chilly relationship with President Clinton,
but on Friday the president released a statement praising the
senator. ``Senator Moynihan's decision to retire comes as sad news
for all of us who have worked with him and learned from him during
his long career of public service,'' the president said. ``Pat
Moynihan has been a larger-than-life figure in the Senate, ably
filling the seat once held by Aaron Burr, Martin Van Buren and
Robert F. Kennedy.'' Moynihan has had one of the most varied
careers of any member of the Senate. He started as an aide to Gov.
W. Averell Harriman in the 1950s, was assistant secretary of labor
in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, chief domestic adviser
to President Nixon and chief representative to the United Nations
under President Ford. He has also been ambassador to India, taught
urban studies at Harvard University and written or edited 18 books.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he is the ranking Democrat on the powerful
Finance Committee, where he has played a leading role in shaping
tax, health care and Social Security policies. He was also the main
author of a 1991 law that set aside billions of dollars for highway
and mass transit projects across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But arguably Moynihan's impact was greater as a writer and
thinker than as a legislator. Known for his tweed jackets, knit
ties and untamed shock of white hair, he often expounded on the
floor of the Senate and to reporters on issues as far-ranging as
race relations, welfare policy, nuclear arms proliferation,
relations between India and Pakistan and the history of
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' which he wrote with Nathan Glazer
in 1963, Moynihan analyzed the impact of ethnic rivalries on
American politics. In a 1965 report, he warned about the growth of
single-parent families. And in his most recent book, ``Secrecy: The
American Experience,'' he warns against the dangers of government
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Pressman, Moynihan said his wife and
closest political adviser, Elizabeth, had ``made up our mind four
years ago'' about not running. ``I'll have served four terms in the
Senate, just as dear Jack Javits had done,'' he said, adding
parenthetically, ``I wished he had let it stay at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan noted in the interview that he had read a news article
last week in which McCall, the state comptroller, mused about
running for the Senate in 2000. Looking into the camera, Moynihan
said, ``This is to say, Carl, I won't be in that primary _ I hope
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., the Senate's only
black member, was defeated on Tuesday, Moynihan said that McCall
``may decide that he owes it to his community'' to run. ``I hope he
does,'' he continued. ``It's not right that the U.S. Senate should
be all white.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many New York politicians had thought it unlikely that
Moynihan would seek a precedent-setting fifth term _ he had done
very little fund raising to prepare for a race _ few expected him
to declare his plans so soon after the 1998 elections. Privately,
many Democrats said they were relieved that he had made the
announcement early, thereby giving candidates time to raise money
and support before the 2000 primaries.

PENALTY KILLERS BURY RED WINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Killing penalties in the NHL is like having to
duplicate the Sistine Chapel with finger paints while hanging from
your toes. Blindfolded. It's a thankless job. Sometimes, an
impossible job.
</P>
<P>
   No hockey team will go through a season without allowing its
share of power-play goals. When you're skating a man down and
diving to the ice to block shots, throwing your body around while
looking over your shoulder for the open man, and trying to clear
out the crease for the goalie, odds are you're going to get beat on
the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at America West Arena, the Coyotes' penalty-killing
unit was beaten only once, and that was the difference in an
impressive 3-1 Phoenix win that smacked of playoff atmosphere
before an energized sellout crowd of 16,210.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PK played great. They won the hockey game for us,'' said
center Jeremy Roenick, who helped take turns along with several
others in killing off five of six Detroit power plays.
</P>
<P>
   Skating with an extra attacker, Nicklas Lidstrom managed to find
the net against red-hot Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin in the
second period after Phoenix had built a 2-0 lead on goals by Jim
Cummins and Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Wings, who typically are armed with one of the most
potent power-play assaults in the league, were shut down three
straight times after that. The penalty killers also contributed on
offense, as versatile center Bob Corkum cashed in with a goal and a
picture-perfect lead assist on Tkachuk's breakaway, second-year pro
Juha Ylonen added two assists, and defensemen Teppo Numminen and
Gerald Diduck chipped in with one assist apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, the penalty killing was a key. Especially against
a powerhouse power play like the Red Wings have with guys like
Lidstrom, (Sergei) Fedorov and (Brendan) Shanahan,'' Corkum said.
``The biggest key to the penalty killing, though, is Niki. He just
had a huge, huge game.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, who had 30 saves, and the rest of the Coyotes are
paying the price defensively, game in and game out. They haven't
allowed more than two goals for the eighth straight time in pushing
their record to 6-2-1 to equal the best start in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very good last year. That was the bottom
line,'' Tkachuk said. ``This year, everybody's stepping it up.
People are stepping up their game, putting things aside, and we're
getting a team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called chemistry. A lot of times, it's built on the penalty
kill, when you find yourself in a hole and only teamwork will bail
you out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always great when you see the PK working so well,'' said
defenseman Jyrki Lumme, noting that Phoenix has killed off 41 of 47
penalties overall. ``It can be tough, but it's a great confidence
builder, and it's contagious.'' &QL;

KINGS' BLAKE OUT 6-8 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Kings' epidemic of serious injuries
reached its most distressing level yet Friday with the news that
captain Rob Blake, the NHL's best defenseman last season, has a
broken right foot and will be sidelined for six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Blake suffered the injury eight days ago in a 3-0 loss to Tampa
Bay when he was struck by a puck. X-rays were negative, and he
played 27 minutes, 57 seconds in a 3-0 loss to Phoenix on Sunday
and 22:26 in Thursday night's 2-2 tie with St. Louis. All the
while, severe pain persisted, and an MRI on Friday revealed the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (4-5-3), who play host to Dallas at 6:30 tonight, are
down to five healthy defensemen as a result of Blake's injury and
the broken hand suffered Sunday by Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   To bloster their defense, the Kings recalled 22-year-old Jan
Nemecek of the Ice Dogs after Long Beach's game Friday. He has
never appeared in an NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do any mistakes on the ice, that's my plan,'' Nemecek
said. ``I am surprised it happened. It's just nice to get the
chance to go up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, relatively healthy last season, have been hit hard by
injuries this season, with extended absences by goalies Stephane
Fiset and Jamie Storr (groin strains); Blake, Bodger, centers Ian
Laperriere (knee injury) and Jozef Stumpel (hip-flexor strain) and
wingers Sandy Moger (back strain) and Steve McKenna (abdominal
strain).
</P>
<P>
   Bylsma's back: McKenna was hurt in a first-period tussle
Thursday with St. Louis tough guy Tony Twist, and will be sidelined
indefinitely. As a result, the Kings recalled role-playing winger
Dan Bylsma from the Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any profession, you want to strive to be at the highest
level, and that's being in the NHL,'' Bylsma said. ``That's my goal
at the beginning of the season, the end of the season and all the
time. To get sent down is certainly a disappointment. It's my job
just to get a positive out of any situation, and when I get the
opportunity, to do the best I can and prove I deserve another
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Coach Larry Robinson and general manager Dave
Taylor met Friday afternoon with Kings co-owner Philip Anschutz,
the purpose of the meeting undisclosed. The latest trade rumor,
this one in a Calgary Sun article, has the Kings hotly pursuing
Flames free-agent-to-be Theo Fleury. Taylor has declined to answer
questions about trade possibilities.... Stumpel has skated the last
three days but won't be back for a week or two. Storr is closer to
returning than Fiset, and could be cleared to play by Monday.
Whether his first action will be with the Kings or Ice Dogs has yet
to be announced.

CARDINALS NEED DEEP THREAT TO SUCCEED _ MOORE OR LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - It's a simple theory: An injured Moore means
less, and a healthy Moore means more.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's nothing theoretical about it. It's a fact with
which the Cardinals have lived. Wide receiver Rob Moore is a
walking domino effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have a good running game and a good intermediate
passing game,'' offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said. ``But
unless you have the threat of going deep, it's hard to run and
harder to throw the intermediate passes. The defense just closes
down on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the good teams, they can go deep and run the
ball, and everything else kind of takes care of itself. When you
can run and have the deep threat to loosen up the whole defense, it
makes a coach's job easier and play selection much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the fact that the Cardinals offense ranks 29th _ next
to last _ is a reflection of two things:
</P>
<P>
   Until last week against Detroit, Moore, who represents the deep
threat, has gimped about at less than 80 percent since midway
through the second game at Seattle because of a pulled hamstring
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The team hurt itself by failing to position itself to have a
solid deep threat behind Moore via the draft or free agency.
</P>
<P>
   What about Eric Metcalf, you ask? While Metcalf owns the speed
to stretch a defense, it isn't his forte. And having to practice at
Moore's position for insurance hurt his progress in the role he
should play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at Eric as a deep guy,'' Trestman said. ``I see
him more as a guy who catches the ball in space and makes plays.
But when Rob was hurt, Eric was relegated to working at wide
receiver all week and we couldn't develop our package to get him
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the past couple weeks, he hasn't been able to practice, so
we haven't gotten things from him we wanted, which is catching two
or three balls a game. It's a trickle-down effect without Rob.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf missed Thursday's practice because of tendinitis in his
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody realizes Moore's value more than quarterback Jake
Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just an all-around receiver who makes things totally
different on a defense,'' Plummer said. ``You really have to
respect his big-play ability because he's a big-play receiver who
makes it easy for others.''
</P>
<P>
   After catching four passes for 84 yards in the opener at Dallas,
Moore didn't top the 40-yard mark again this season until he caught
four for 52 yards in Game No. 7 vs. New York. He broke out in the
second half against Detroit, catching five for 107 yards, including
a 36-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After eight games last season, a healthy Moore had 48 receptions
for 730 yards and three touchdowns, compared with 29 catches for
399 yards and two touchdowns this season.
</P>
<P>
   His 28-yard reception from Plummer on the first play of the
second half in Detroit opened the door and awakened a slumbering
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got more out of that (going deep) last week and it's
probably the first time we've had him healthy,'' Trestman said.
``But that was in just one half. Hopefully, we can put two halves
together and use that second half against Detroit as a catapult
into the second half of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, just as Moore has regained health, he'll
face Darrell Green, one of the NFL's best corners, on Sunday. &QL;

MURRELL, DISHMAN TO RETURN AS STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Two starters have recovered from injuries
sufficiently to return to the lineup Sunday, and a third will play
a significant role against the Redskins, Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell, who gained 415 yards in seven
appearances before straining a calf, and left guard  &UR; Chris Dishman,
a first-year starter who was having his best game at St. Louis
before straining his neck, practiced at full speed Friday and are
ready, Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback  &UR; Tom Knight, whose most recent injury (lower
hamstring attachment strain) has kept him out of action for four
games, will be used initially in nickel coverages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; J.B. Brown will start in Knight's corner spot for the fifth
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just because you start that way doesn't mean that you will
finish that way,'' Tobin said. ``We'll see how they both play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that Tommy is back to normal, but we do know that
he is capable of playing without undue risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman is among 15 Cardinals starters who came into the season
with two or fewer years of NFL experience.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman opened several fourth-quarter holes for Murrell to seal
an early win over Philadelphia. Murrell gained a season-high 145
yards in that game, the last in which the entire starting unit was
on the field together.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said return specialist/third receiver  &UR; Eric Metcalf
(tendinitis, knee) also is expected to play. Metcalf had missed
practice earlier this week. &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
The Cardinals announced that only a few hundred single tickets are
available for their Nov. 15 game against Dallas at Sun Devil
Stadium. If the game is sold out by next Thursday, it will lift the
NFL's local television blackout and allow the game to be seen on
Channel 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' first four inactives this week are defensive
tackle  &UR; Eric Swann (arthroscopic surgery, knee), offensive tackle
 &UR; Anthony  &UR; Clement (surgery, herniated disk), linebacker  &UR; Terry
 &UR; Irving (coach's decision) and  &UR; Allen DeGraffenreid (coach's
decision). Tobin gave Irving the day off because Irving and his
wife, Frankie, are expecting their second child any day. Tobin
added that Irving likely would have been a Sunday inactive
regardless of his family situation. Three more players will be
declared inactive on game day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have forced a league-leading 25 turnovers,
compared with only four by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals outside linebacker Jamir Miller gained notoriety last
week by running down Detroit Lions back Barry Sanders in the open
field. This week, with Redskins starter Terry Allen (ankle)
questionable, Miller and Co. face Skip Hicks, who came to UCLA the
year after Miller left. &QL;

BUSY BROADCASTER'S LUCK HOLDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - A week after being thrown to the Lions, Jeff
Kennedy is breathing a little easier. So is Tom Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was pressed into action as a play-by-play man at
the Cardinals-Detroit Lions game when Dillon was late getting to
the Pontiac Silverdome, will be back in his normal routine today,
doing pre- and post-game shows from Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Dillon ran into flight delays after broadcasting
the Arizona State-Washington State game on Fox Sports Arizona from
Pullman, Wash. He didn't arrive at the Cardinals game until late in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   With both teams in town this weekend, all that potential stress
was removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't done play-by-play in six years, and John Mistler (the
color analyst) told me at breakfast that Tom wasn't going to be
there on time,'' said Kennedy, a talk-show host on KDUS-AM (1060).
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Cannon (producer for KDUS-AM and KSLX-FM) told me I'd be
doing the game. It's a part of the business I really do miss. I
love sports talk . . . but there will always be a hole in my career
until I can do play-by-play on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, who has somehow managed to keep his two-team commitment,
admitted he has had luck on his side. But it almost ran out Sunday
after landing in about an hour before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   He hailed a cab and told the driver to turn on the football game
so he could get a handle on what was happening before he got to the
Silverdome, about an hour away from the airport. But the driver
didn't understand English, so Dillon was in the dark, but he
learned a few new tunes: ``The driver just wanted to listen to jazz
music.''
</P>
<P>
   When the cab arrived at the stadium, the driver didn't know
where to drop off his fare. When Dillon finally picked up his pass,
he also received wrong directions to the broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon entered the booth with six minutes to go in the half and
went on the air after the two-minute warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as hard starting at that time that I thought it
would be,'' Dillon said. ``Fortunately, I did a lot of reading and
memorizing. But I wasn't able to say that someone just caught his
fourth pass, or that was the third time Jake Plummer was sacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, he will do the play-by-play for the San Jose
State-Arizona State basketball game for Fox Sports Arizona on
Friday night, fly to Eugene, Ore., for the ASU-Oregon football game
Saturday and then return to Phoenix for Sunday's Cardinals-Cowboys
game. &QL;

HEARING IS DEF INITELY BELIEV ING  
 TURF PARADISE'S VOICE RINGS TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Beneath the sturdy and capable hands of jockey Manny
Ortiz Jr., Tiara Magic alertly breaks free from the gate, grabbing
an early lead in an opening day race at Turf Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   At the precise moment Tiara Magic and four rivals begin the
6-furlong and 1 minute, 13 1/5-second journey, a booming but
clearly audible voice bellows through the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off and running,'' the voice says.
</P>
<P>
   And in the clubhouse sitting next to a friend, an elderly woman
inches forward in her chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyesight isn't too good anymore,'' she says, requesting
anonymity. ``It's even hard for me to see the (television
monitors). So I listen to the (track) announcer. There's nothing
wrong with my hearing. And he's got a good voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice belongs to Luke Kruytbosch.
</P>
<P>
   Kruytbosch has been Turf Paradise's announcer since 1993.
Although it is a mostly thankless position, it also is one of the
industry's most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is under the gun more than announcers,'' Turf Paradise
President Lonny Powell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do they have to inform, they have to make sure they
don't get in the way of the show. And they have to facilitate
excitement when needed. Luke does that about as well as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes Kruytbosch one of the sport's top announcers
is an ability to memorize a horse's name when there are as many as
12 in each race and only about 20 minutes between races.
</P>
<P>
   Kruytbosch, however, has a trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use word association,'' he says. ``If a horse's name is
Sinful Sue and has red silks, I'll picture a girl named Sue in a
red dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to take forever to memorize all the horses in a race.
Now I can usually do it in two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, however, mistakes will be made, Kruytbosch says. And
when one is made, it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ruins my day if I do or say something wrong,'' Kruytbosch
says.
</P>
<P>
   Kruytbosch's worst flub occurred a few years ago at a New Mexico
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two horses were running stride for stride, then one
began outdistancing itself from the other one,'' Kruytbosch says.
``But all the time I'm calling the wrong horse in the lead. I
didn't realize it until they crossed (the finish line).''
</P>
<P>
   Kruytbosch's most embarrassing moment also happened in New
Mexico, referring to a bay gelding as a gay gelding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't stop hearing about that for days,'' says Kruytbosch,
37.
</P>
<P>
   But because Kruytbosch makes so few blunders, and because he has
a resounding voice that ``cuts through a racetrack's chatter,'' he
is considered one of the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   And in Powell's eyes, as good as Trevor Denman, longtime voice
of Santa Anita (Calif.) Park. Denman also used to be track
announcer at Hollywood Park, but when he chose to cut back on a
busy schedule two years ago, a permanent replacement was
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   There were auditions and Kruytbosch was chosen. He splits most
of the yearly racing season between Turf Paradise and Hollywood
Park, where he will be starting Wednesday. Kruytbosch returns to
Turf Paradise in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important responsibility for an announcer is to be
very accurate,'' says Kruytbosch, whose idol is Tom Durkin, today's
Breeders' Cup announcer. ``And when the moment calls for it, be
exciting and descriptive. But don't get in the way of the race. Let
the race unfold on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've done that, you've done your job.'' &QL;

BCS: BRUINS COULD SURVIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streams of unconsciousness while wondering if the Bowl
Championship Series (BCS) needs a math tutor:
</P>
<P>
   Now that the BCS has thoroughly confused everyone in college
football, it may be hard for some teams to see the tunnel, much
less a light at its end.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA should not be one of them. Having already enjoyed the
quartile experience, the Bruins' focus is clear. It has four games
left, starting with today's matinee at Oregon State, and the last
three teams on the schedule have status in the BCS world perennial
power Washington, 6-3 USC and a Miami team that should be no worse
than 7-3 when the teams meet Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Irony of ironies, the Bruins may go into that game, an add-on to
the end of the season courtesy of a hurricane, knowing that a win
will cinch a berth in the national title match. The other
contenders can't look at their schedules and say that.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is 8-0, but the best team left on its schedule is a
Michigan team that plays Penn State and Wisconsin before meeting
the Buckeyes. If the Wolverines, averaging a meager 15 points a
game the last four weeks, lose their next two, they'll be 6-4 when
they visit Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (8-0) will approach its game against Nebraska as a
Holy War, but the reality is that Nebraska, for once, is just
another 6-2 team. The Wildcats end the season against Missouri,
which is 6-2 now, but has games against Colorado and Texas A&AMP;M
before it meets K-State.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (7-0) has UAB, 7-0 Arkansas, Kentucky and Vandy left.
If the Vols clear that modest quartet, they'll be a two-touchdown
favorite against Mississippi, Mississippi State or Arkansas again
in the SEC title game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins play well and win their last four, they'll get
where they want to go. ...
</P>
<P>
   No one should have been surprised that Stanford slugged it out
with UCLA last week. The series between the two teams has always
been competitive, and Stanford's offense wasn't the cause of its
1-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone keeps taking shots at UCLA's quite flexible
defense, three of their last four opponents came into the game with
scoring averages of 31.8 (Arizona), 50.6 (Oregon) and 25.7
(Stanford). ...
</P>
<P>
   Parlay of the year: The Trojans could enter their last two games
with a chance to knock UCLA out of the Fiesta Bowl and Notre Dame
out of the Rose Bowl, and likely earn themselves a trip to the
Aloha Bowl in the process. ...
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Ricky Williams has pretty much locked up the
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy, and frankly I believe Cade McNown is happy about
it. He never seemed particularly interested in campaigning for the
award. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers solved two problems at one time in signing Devon
White to a sensible three-year, $12.4 million deal. They now have a
leadoff hitter and defensively solid center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it looks like they will now go hard after
Boston's Mo Vaughn in hopes of filling their need for a left-handed
power hitter. But that obviously would lead to Eric Karros'
departure, which is sad.
</P>
<P>
   Karros has played well and played hard since he arrived, and
stepped up countless times in a clubhouse that had a lot of
gophers. If Karros goes, the Dodgers' lineup in 1999 may include
only one player who was with the team on opening day of 1997, Raul
Mondesi. ...
</P>
<P>
   For those who could not read between the lines, the Dodgers were
able to keep Jeff Shaw by agreeing to pay the closer at least two
million more dollars per year than any other team.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cubs re-signed Rob Beck and the Indians expressed no
interest, Shaw was looking at playing here for $5.5 million a year
or in Cincinnati or elsewhere for maybe $3 million per. ...
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for all the optimists among Angel fans who believe
Disney is going to open its wallet and start signing some pricey
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney's way. Plus, signing a Mo Vaughn at $13
million a year could lead to a clubhouse revolt among those
players, like Tim Salmon, who agreed to small dollar deals in
exchange for security and team loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine, too, that Disney still has a few years to go before
it can write off its expense in turning the Big A into the Big Ed.
The passing of Gene Autry might also cost them, since they now have
to start considering when they exercise their option to buy the
rest of the team. ...
</P>
<P>
   If I'm a baseball general manager, I look at Kevin Brown and
Randy Johnson as great pitchers worthy of nothing more than a
three-year contract. They're both in their mid-30s, and Johnson has
had back problems and lost a few mph off his fastball last year.
...
</P>
<P>
   I have it on good authority that David Stern and the NBA owners
created the lockout at the request of Michael Jordan. His Airness
has grown tired of the 82-game grind, so the league figured out a
way to cut it to a 41-game season.
</P>
<P>
   Just a thought. ...

NAU FORCED TO SETTLE  
 LUMBERJACKS SET SIGHTS ON .500 MARK

   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - Take the almosts and what-ifs, and Northern
Arizona would be challenging for the Big Sky championship, and
today's game against Weber State could have been the biggest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lumberjacks (4-5, 1-5 Big Sky) are struggling and
saddled with a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State knows the feeling. The Wildcats (5-4, 3-3) have lost
four straight.
</P>
<P>
   NAU was in great position to win its past two games but failed
to hold the lead against Cal State-Sacramento two weeks ago, and
lost to conference leader Montana State last week in the closing 15
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montana State made the plays it had to make to win the game,
and we didn't,'' NAU Coach Jerome Souers said. ``Unfortunately,
that has been the scenario for us over the last few weeks. It is
not a question of playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A win today in its last home game of the season and a victory
over Portland State next week would give the Lumberjacks a winning
season in Souers' first year. Weber State's first-year coach, Gerry
Graybeal, would need a split in the Wildcats' last two games to
finish better than .500.
</P>
<P>
   NAU's running game appears to be in high gear with Marcus King
and Tavon Cooper. Last week, King, a freshman, had his best game,
rushing for 142 yards on 25 carries. Cooper, a junior from Peoria,
carried only eight times but had 81 yards, including a 51-yard
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Lumberjacks quarterback Travis Brown has thrown for almost 800
yards against Weber State in two previous games, and his 1997
effort (452 yards) was the second-best passing game in NAU history.
In 1996, Brown threw for 474 yards against Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State's weapon is running back Morgan Welch, who enters
the game ranked seventh nationally in rushing with a 152-yard
average. He has 1,371 yards, only eight short of the team's single
season record, and he's second in the Big Sky in rushing and third
in all-purpose yards. &QL;

UNHAPPY BRUINS HOLD POLL FATE IN OWN HANDS

   PHOENIX - UCLA's drop from first to third in this week's Bowl
Championship Series standings prompted a level of outrage usually
reached only after you arrive home and realize the kid at Taco Bell
has messed up your takeout order.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins Coach  &UR; Bob Toledo, joined by a chorus of columnists and
commentators across the country, maintains it's not fair that a
team should fall in the polls after winning on the previous
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to the undefeated Bruins, who beat the
Pac-10's worst team, Stanford, by four points last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You not only have to win in this day and age, you have to win
convincingly, and that doesn't seem right to me,'' Toledo said.
``That kind of logic leads you to run up the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Coach  &UR; Phil Fulmer, whose team benefited from UCLA's
drop, agreed. ``I think it's a sad state of affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the arguments of Toledo, Fulmer and others are as thin as
corn tortillas. Being ranked first one week isn't like a lifetime
appointment to the Supreme Court. You have to play every week and
you have to look good doing it. That's the way it's always been and
the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins looked terrible against Stanford and would have lost
if not for a tremendous defensive play in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's fall in the coaches' and AP polls, however, wasn't likely
a product of one bad Saturday. In the past three weeks, the Bruins
have struggled to beat Oregon, California and Stanford, while the
other three undefeated teams at the top of the polls _ Ohio State,
Tennessee and Kansas State _ won handily.
</P>
<P>
   The polls and BCS formula worked exactly the way they should
have. If the Bruins have a problem with that, they have a chance to
do something about it on the next four Saturdays. &QL; 
Coaching wonders &QL; 
There are two ways a coach can turn around a program. He can do it
the usual way, by taking over a team lacking in talent and
direction, working diligently for three or four years, then
enjoying the fruits of his labor.
</P>
<P>
   That's how people such as ASU's  &UR; Bruce Snyder and Missouri's
 &UR; Larry
 &UR; Smith achieved success at their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Or, a coach can succeed by taking over a program that has a
solid talent base, but with no direction and confidence, and infuse
those qualities through his personality and organization.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening this season at Arkansas and Texas, where
new coaching staffs have made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-ranked Razorbacks (7-0) were picked to finish last in
the Southeastern Conference West division. But Arkansas, with 19
starters back from a 4-7 team, has a chance to play Tennessee in
the SEC title game Dec. 5. Most of the credit goes to first-year
Coach  &UR; Houston Nutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been superb at playing one game at a time,''
Nutt said. ``I know that sounds cliche, but they really do play
with blinders. They don't worry about the outside distractions, the
polls or who we're playing. They just play every week.''
</P>
<P>
   At Texas,  &UR; Mack Brown inherited a team with 17 starters
returning, including running back  &UR; Ricky Williams, who is sure to
win the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown put together a solid staff and the Longhorns might be the
most improved team in the country since losing early this year to
Kansas State and UCLA. Last week, Texas (6-2) upset Nebraska in
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so far ahead of what I thought we'd be,'' Brown said.
``At halftime of the UCLA game, I didn't know if we'd win another
game.'' &QL; 
The congeniality award &QL; 
Say what you will about Nebraska fans _ and we have _ you can't
fault their manners.
</P>
<P>
   After watching their team lose to Texas last week, a large
number of the Cornhusker faithful hung around and applauded Texas
running back Williams as he walked to the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, are they classy,'' Brown said. ``I don't know whether
I've ever been around fans after a loss who have shown more class
than Nebraska fans. It's something all of us can learn from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scoreboard after the game said, `Congratulations Texas.
Good luck next week at Oklahoma State.' I've never seen anything
like that before. I thought we were home.'' &QL; 
No rivalry &QL; 
Florida State is in it sixth season as a member of the Atlantic
Coast Conference, but the Seminoles have yet to develop a decent
rivalry with any other team in the league .
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's dominance in the league has everything to do
with. The Seminoles have lost just two league games, including one
this season to North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   No ACC team has played the Seminoles tougher than Virginia,
which plays at Florida State today. The Cavaliers are the only
other ACC team to beat Florida State, and the Seminoles have scored
fewer points (88) against Virginia than any other ACC team.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State quarterback  &UR; Chris Weinke hasn't thrown an
interception in seven games, a streak of 202 pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, said Coach  &UR; Bobby Bowden, throws deep better than any
other quarterback Bowden's coached at Florida State. Still, teams
are crowding the line of scrimmage to stop the run, daring Weinke
to take advantage of man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to get the ball to one of our receivers or backs
out of the backfield in a hot situation,'' Weinke said. ``Some
people still don't believe I can do that. That's fine with me. I'm
going to keep hurting them until they decide to drop back and do
something else defensively.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL; 
There has been much speculation about the possibility of four teams
finishing the season undefeated. That hasn't happened since 1973,
when Alabama, Miami of Ohio, Notre Dame and Penn State all went
unbeaten during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State kickers have missed 10 of 16 field goals, but they
aren't the only ones struggling. UCLA has made just 3 of 10 field
goals, Arizona 4 of 11 and California 7 of 16. And the kicking is
so bad at Washington that the Huskies rarely attempt a field. They
are 3 of 8.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in the league have to be upset for missing out on Oregon
kicker  &UR; Nathan Villegas, a junior college transfer, has made all 13
of his field goals and all 38 PATs. Four of Villegas' field goals
have come from 40 yards and beyond.

FANS SWAMP PIR LINES ABOUT TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Switchboard operators have been busy at Phoenix
International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have they been hearing from callers regarding the
snarled traffic that marred the NASCAR Winston Cup race two weeks
ago, some disgruntled fans are peeved because of a substantial
increase in their season ticket packages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for four separate race events during the 1997-98
season, the cheapest season ticket sold for $135 and the most
expensive was $335.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 1999 season ticket package, which includes three
events _ Copper World Classic, the combined Indy Racing League and
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races, and the Winston Cup/Busch
Series weekend _ those seats are $190 for the least expensive and
$390 for the most expensive, up 40 percent per seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand fans' concerns about the increases,'' said
 &UR; Robin
 &UR; Braig, newly appointed PIR executive vice president and general
manager. ``But we need the increases to support the many
improvements we plan on bringing to PIR and making it a better
place for fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by bringing the Busch Series to PIR, that becomes a more
expensive ticket for us. The prize fund, the sanctioning fee and
television all cost more for a Busch race than a truck race.''
</P>
<P>
   By deleting the Desert Star Classic (trucks, U.S. Auto Club
Sprint cars and NASCAR Winston West), PIR's season ticket package
was reduced to three events from four. The American Motorcyclist
Superbike weekend never has been offered as a season ticket
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The truck race was transferred to the Indy Racing League event,
and a second truck race held in conjunction with the Winston Cup
event was scrapped and replaced with a Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   So, essentially, PIR added a Busch race for one truck race, the
USAC sprints and the Winston West series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we've explained our strategy to callers, they've been
very understanding,'' Braig said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic update &QL; 
OK, here is the final word on the massive traffic woes that plagued
the Winston Cup race two weeks ago:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Department of Transportation workers posted a sign at
83rd Avenue directing race traffic to exit at 99th Avenue because
the 115th Avenue off ramp was closed because of a 5:45 a.m.
accident. Also, excessive traffic at the Litchfield Road and
Estrella Parkway exits was backing up on Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   ADOT's priority is to keep I-10 traffic as uncongested as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although spectators could have stayed on I-10 and proceeded
toward the Litchfield and Estrella exits, most chose to exit at
99th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Diverted 99th Avenue traffic then proceeded to 115th Avenue,
where most turned southward toward the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Had those same fans been instructed or informed they could have
proceeded further westward to Litchfield Road and Estrella Parkway
via roads running parallel to I-10, a huge bottleneck on 115th
Avenue likely would have resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans didn't reach their grandstand seats until 45 minutes
into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have an alternative plan in place next year if
it happens again,'' Braig said. ``We need to correct this.''
</P>
<P>
   While PIR officials are at it, they also should devise a plan to
relieve congested traffic after the race. &QL; 
NASCAR updates &QL; 
NASCAR officials have changed test session rules for the 1999
season. Although teams still have seven tests, four must take place
at Daytona International Speedway, Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway,
Charlotte Motor Speedway and Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The
remaining three tests can be at any NASCAR track.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials will monitor the sessions, and the
manufacturers (Ford and General Motors) will run them. Teams also
can bring only two cars to each test, and the tests can only be two
days.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie drivers can have 12 tests, two more than this season. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
IRL fans have selected  &UR; Arie Luyendyk of Scottsdale the most
popular driver for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   IRL car owner  &UR; John Menard has chosen  &UR; Greg Ray as the team's
new driver. Ray signed a five-year contract. No word on whether
Menard will field a second IRL car, but it's doubtful. Rumors are
Menard will put  &UR; Robby Gordon in a Championship Auto Racing Teams
car for about a half-dozen races next year. &QL;

`TORNADO' TOUCHES DOWN  
 MCSPADDEN ENTERS ARIZONA AUTO RACING HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - No one ever walked away feeling cheated from a race
starring Lealand McSpadden.
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden was Evel Knievel on four wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was a sprint car, a midget, a supermodified or even a
modified stock, McSpadden always drove as if the laps would be his
final ones.
</P>
<P>
   And, my, it was entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lealand tried hard on every lap he ever drove,'' said Ron
Shuman, whose sprint car battles against McSpadden are legendary.
``Unlike me, he was very, very aggressive. I think I won a couple
of Western World (Sprint Car Championships at Manzanita Speedway)
that I shouldn't have won, only because Lealand crashed or broke
while I was leading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lealand was like my brother, Billy. With Billy, the most
important thing was to win. Maybe that meant Lealand tried too hard
sometimes. But it doesn't matter because he was a great racer.
There's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no doubting McSpadden's place in the Arizona Auto
Racing Hall of Fame, into which he will be formally inducted
tonight at the Sprint Car Racing Association Hall of Fame Classic
at Manzanita Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will get a little emotional for me,'' said
McSpadden, nicknamed the Tempe Tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Although McSpadden, 52, hasn't officially tossed in the
retirement towel, it's unlikely he again will climb into a race
car. One machine he won't belly up to again is a sprint car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything I can in a sprint car,'' said McSpadden,
a Tempe machinist by trade. ``And with my driving style, which is
driving hard and aggressive, I'm just asking for something (bad) to
happen after not racing the past two year. Face it, it's a young
man's sport.''
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden last drove three years ago, finishing fourth in an
SCRA race at Ventura (Calif.) Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I decided to stop racing sprint cars (in 1995), I told
myself it probably would be the end of my racing career unless I
could put a (NASCAR) truck deal together,'' McSpadden said. ``But
when that didn't happen, I told myself I wouldn't go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord gave me 26 good years of racing, and I just
better take what I got and enjoy what I had. But I don't know. If I
could put together a (NASCAR) Southwest Tour, Winston West or truck
deal, I think I would give it a try just to see if I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a racer, always a racer. And few were better than
McSpadden.
</P>
<P>
   Among McSpadden's major wins were the 1978 Western World title,
the Chili Bowl Midget Nationals, the Belleville Midget Nationals,
the Hulman 100 at the Indiana State Fairgrounds and two Dirt Cup
Championships at Skagit (Wash.) Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden also was the 1992 California Racing Association
champion and the 1995 SCRA titlist. He won the Arizona Racing
Association sprint car crown in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, McSpadden showcased his many talents, winning main
events in five different classes at Manzy. That season, McSpadden
won eight sprint car races, three midget and supermodified races,
two in sprint buggies and one in modified stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing that finally convinced me I could drive almost anything
competitively,'' McSpadden said. ``It didn't matter what car I got
in, I was able to make it go to the front. That was very
satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden finished with 77 career SCRA and CRA victories and
nearly 100 more wins at Manzy.
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden places no victory over another, but if pressed, he
would pick the Western World title.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great season for me,'' McSpadden said. ``At that
time, the Western World was one of the three biggest sprint car
races in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the other two big sprint races that year, I finished second
(at the Knoxville Nationals) and was leading the Pacific Coast
Nationals (at Ascot Park in Gardena, Calif.) and broke a rear end
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never dreamed I would win as many races as I did or be
as dominant as I was at Manzy for so many years. I always said I
didn't have as much talent as other people, but I worked real hard
at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older I got, the better I got because I just became more
confident and knew what to do with a race car.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the time that meant never letting up off the
throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did things with a race car that you didn't have to do, but
it was like I had to prove to myself I could do it,'' McSpadden
said. ``Maybe that's not the smartest thing to do, but I got a lot
of enjoyment out of being able to do things nobody else ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in the 1984 Western World, we were 33 laps into a
40-lapper and (Shuman) and I had lapped everyone in the race. And I
was probably a half or two-thirds of a lap ahead of Ronnie. Then, I
flipped the race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who didn't know me asked why I was going so fast
with such a big lead. I said, `Because I don't race everybody else.
I race myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And now McSpadden is racing into the Hall of Fame, where
everyone knows he belongs. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE'S ABRAHAM RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Cal State Northridge women's basketball
coach Michael Abraham resigned and men's basketball coach Bobby
Braswell was named administrator-in-charge of the athletic
department, the school announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The school will remain without an athletic director for the next
few weeks as the university attempts to recruit an acting athletic
director to replace Paul Bubb, CSUN president Blenda Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, CSUN's athletic director for three years, and associate
athletic director Judy Brame resigned under pressure from the
administration in the wake Abraham's Oct.27 arrest on the CSUN
campus. Abraham was charged by the FBI with conspiracy to
distribute and possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or
more of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham appeared in court Friday in front of U.S. Magistrate
Judge Robert Block, who said the 39-year-old former coach will
answer the charges in Omaha, Neb. An arraignment date was set for
Nov.23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made this painful decision (to resign) out of respect
for the university and the fine student-athletes with whom I have
had the privilege of being associated,'' Abraham said in a
statement issued by his lawyer. ``My family and I are grateful for
the support that has been offered to us during this very difficult
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Abraham's first public comment since his arrest. Abraham,
who was 23-59 in three seasons at CSUN, remains free on bond. He
was on paid administrative leave from the school.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN announced Wednesday that assistant coach Frozena Jerro
would be the acting women's coach this season.
</P>
<P>
   William Watkins, assistant vice president for student life, will
offer administrative support for Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful to coach Braswell for taking on this
assignment,'' Wilson said. ``His presence will put a steady hand at
the helm of the athletic department. And the short duration of the
role also will allow him to focus on the upcoming season.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of Bubb and Brame became effective at the end
of Friday's work day. Bubb severed ties with the university while
Brame was reassigned to the kinesiology department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our university, our athletic department, our students and our
coaches are working very hard, and the news we've had the last few
weeks hasn't been good news,'' Braswell said. ``It's about time we
had some good news. What I hope to give the department is some
leadership and some direction so that the coaches and student
athletes here don't feel like we're stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any big, huge policies that are going to
change things drastically, but there are some little things. We
need to be more supportive of one another and we need to support
our teams that are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, 36, is a CSUN graduate with a bachelor's degree in
English. Wilson said the agreement is short-term so Braswell can
concentrate on the upcoming basketball season. He begins his third
season with the Matadors on Nov.14 at Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's coaching contingent voted to endorse Braswell as the
acting athletic director on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good choice,'' CSUN football coach Ron Ponciano
said. ``He has experience, has been a part of Division I programs,
and knows how they operate. It's a real good choice.''

GINGRICH SAYS HE'S STEPPING ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 4th, 5th &AMP; 14th grafs to clarify.)  (See also REPUBS-GINGRICH) 
(htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the
Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 and presided this year over
what at times seemed like the political destruction of President
Clinton was himself driven from office Friday by a party that
swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise,
Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other
Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker and would
leave Congress altogether when his term expired in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is
in the system,'' Gingrich said, according to a party official who
heard one of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision to resign was a stunning reversal for one of
the most combative and personally confrontational politicians in
America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one
Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style
through Tuesday's elections, approving last-minute commercials
reminding voters of the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday
night. In his second conference call, said several members who
listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall.
Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take
control of Congress, they have become his most bitter critics in
the last two years of his tumultuous tenure as speaker. On Friday
night he called them cannibals who had ``blackmailed'' him into
quitting, said those who has listened to the call.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who
had marginalized the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism.
He said, `Refer to the clips.' He's blaming others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the conference call this way: ``He started off very
statesmanlike, but then you could see the anger building. When
someone asked him why he was leaving, he said, `A handful of
members have blackmailed the conference.' He said, `They're
hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been feuding with party conservatives for the last
few years. They have complained that he is not a true conservative,
that he has capitulated to Clinton on spending issues and has not
advanced conservative causes like tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision set up a scramble for a successor in the
powerful post. The speaker, who is second only to the vice
president in line for succession to the presidency, controls the
legislative agenda, committee assignments and chairmanships in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced his resignation just hours after Rep. Robert
L. Livingston, R-La. announced he would challenge Gingrich for the
job, putting himself forward as a level-headed manager who did not
have Gingrich's propensity for self-created crises.
</P>
<P>
   After Gingrich's bombshell, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, announced
he was considering his own run. Livingston and Archer are chairmen
of the two most powerful committees in the House, Appropriations
and Ways and Means, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, in a reflection of the wide-open possibilities
that other members suddenly see for advancement, Rep. Christopher
Cox of California, chairman of the Republican policy committee,
also announced his candidacy for speaker, on CNN's ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Gingrich said, ``The Republican conference needs
to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward.'' He said he
hoped his colleagues would pick a successor ``who can both
reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his wife, he explained to his colleagues why he was
resigning: ``Marianne and I are tired. We need time off to get to
know each other again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He did not specify why he was leaving Congress as well as not
seeking re-election as speaker. But his supporters conceded that
after being speaker and after consolidating more power in the
office than anyone in recent decades, he would probably find life
as a backbencher unbearable. Since he just won re-election this
week, a special election will have to be held in his Georgia
district to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative
attention to himself and to his party. ``If I stay,'' he told his
colleagues Friday night, ``my controversial nature would overshadow
any successes we might have,'' an understatement to those who
recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown of
the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the
back of Air Force One on a trip with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Republican who took notes on the second call,
Gingrich said: ``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the
members. So long as I am around, I will always be a target in the
news media, which would mean we would never be able to get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   For friends and foes alike, it was not clear that Gingrich had a
message this year beyond relying on the Clinton scandal to propel
Republicans to greater gains that never materialized. The bracing
reality is that it is Gingrich, not Clinton, who is leaving
Washington in disgrace. The next few weeks are sure to be
politically awkward for him as the House plays out the process that
he as House leader set in motion to impeach Clinton. The House
Judiciary Committee is to consider articles of impeachment
beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans took the opportunity to portray Gingrich as a
visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York said that in the
first conference call, ``there was shock and surprise and strong
expressions of appreciation for leading us to the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.David Dreier, R-Calif., called it a ``courageous'' decision.
``There were a number of members in the Republican conference that
were not prepared to ever provide support for him. And it shows
what a good man he is. He is desperate to see unity and solidarity
ahead in January.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said the speaker had the votes to win
re-election, an election to be conducted by secret ballot on Nov.
18. But they agreed that the party's slim six-vote majority meant
every vote on the House floor would be a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Duberstein, a former official in the Reagan
administration, said, ``I have no doubt he had the votes to be
speaker, but I'm not sure he had the votes to govern.'' He said
that because of the deep rifts in the party, Gingrich would not
have been able to implement his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Arkansas, said in a statement Friday
night, ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary,'' adding,
``Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we
were able to work together in the national interest, especially
Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing
leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's
resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had
fostered. ``I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker
will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was
wrought on this institution over the last four years,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would
set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than
began Wednesday morning with the disappointing election returns.
``There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne who will test the
waters,'' said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich for
re-election. ``There won't be any shortage of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's name gained currency earlier Friday when conservatives,
who were already furious with Gingrich, said they were dissatisfied
with Livingston as well.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's actions Friday captured the dizzying pace at which
events unfolded _ and the appeal of having Gingrich out of the
race. His aides said Friday afternoon that Archer was ``reviewing
his options'' and that if he decided to run, he would announce his
candidacy next week. They faxed a statement at 7:29 Friday night
saying that Archer was ``saddened'' by Gingrich's resignation.
Eleven minutes later, they faxed a statement from Archer saying he
was ``actively considering'' running for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh of Indiana, leader of a group of
conservatives in the House who had considered running for speaker
himself, said Friday that he would not run and threw his support to
Archer.
</P>
<P>
   He said Archer had the ``solid, seasoned leadership to unify our
party, chart a positive agenda during the next two years and lead
us to expand our majority in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that time was of the essence, with just 12 days
until the election, Cox announced his candidacy on ``The Larry King
Show.'' He vowed to bring order to the now-chaotic budget process
and said: ``I don't think my job is to unify the party but to unify
the Congress and the country behind an agenda that is good for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Livingston has a huge head start. He had been campaigning
for speaker anyway on the chance that Gingrich might step aside to
run for president. Since Tuesday, he has converted those long-range
plans into an extensive and immediate telephone campaign to shore
up support. He has contacted not only Republican House members but
an array of prominent Republicans across the country, including
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the Capitol Friday afternoon,
Livingston, an ally of the speaker for two decades, said he was
running for speaker now not cheerfully but resolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ideas have gotten lost, perhaps our message has gotten
lost, in the haze of high rhetoric and miscast priorities, lost in
a management style where process is subordinated to polls and
self-initiated crises,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   He cast himself as someone who could make the trains run on time
and who would not lose himself in the high-blown revolutionary of
Gingrich, who has spent much of his time traveling and raising
money. ``I'll be more of a stay-at-home type of speaker who wants
to get the job done,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich remained in his home district Friday, calling members
and seeking their support. His press secretary, Christina Martin,
issued a statement Friday afternoon saying: ``As architect of the
Republican majority, Speaker Gingrich is determined to correct the
mistakes of the past and implement a positive, issue-oriented
legislative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in an interview Friday night that Gingrich had broached
the possibility of resigning with his wife on Thursday evening and
that he had reached a decision Friday afternoon. His staff was
caught by surprise. ``This office was in full vote-counting mode,''
Ms. Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's plans beyond resignation were uncertain. He said he
would take six months off next year. But he made no mention of his
earlier notion of running for president, a path that many of his
friends said they presumed was now impossible because of the
circumstances of his departure from Congress, bearing the brunt of
blame for the party's electoral losses and the perception of him as
a divisive figure who made a better insurrectionist than leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, suggested that
Gingrich replace Jim Nicholson as chairman of the Republican
National Committee. ``I would love for Newt to become our national
chairman right now,'' he said. In a sign of the turmoil aswirl in
the party, the governor said Gingrich would be more adept at
handling the press than Nicholson. ``The media circus surrounding
politicians is not his strength,'' he said of Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he spoke by telephone with Gingrich. ``He's weary
and said he was tired,'' Engler said. ``It's been a grueling
campaign.''

NORTHRIDGE HAS OWN TALK SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Vito Clemente says Donnell Day has a big
mouth and talks too much. Day says Clemente doesn't talk much on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   As far as spouting interesting material, Clemente, the strong
safety, belongs in Cal State Northridge's Hall of Fame. And even
Day, a cornerback and on-field chatterbox, gets a chuckle out of
Clemente's brash, upfront personality off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every thought they have comes out their lips,'' CSUN coach Ron
Ponciano said. ``Oh, yeah, I laugh. But I've ripped them, too. We
have an interesting relationship, but they are fun to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. Day and Clemente, both seniors, work
terribly hard and thoroughly enjoy football. But their
entertainment value only begins when the game ends.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there will be more than a tinge of sadness in the
air prior to, and following, today's game with Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   Unless CSUN reaches the playoffs, and hosts a game (most
unlikely), this is the final home game of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll make it a point to let everyone know it's going to
be my last home game,'' Clemente said. ``I'll make a point of it.
I'll be telling everyone before the game, `Yo, this is my last one.
I don't want to go out a loser.'''
</P>
<P>
   Count on Clemente's point coming across loud and clear. Very
loud. He's always heard. Like his quick take on Montana, which CSUN
beat earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, Montana can lose three games and then win two in a row
and all of a sudden they're back, ranked,'' Clemente said.
``They've won four in a row so they're back in the hunt.
(Quarterback Brian) Ah-Yat's back. Oh my God, John Elway. That's
how it is. They go by tradition instead of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crazy thing is he doesn't talk a lot on the field,'' Day
said. ``He screams a lot, though. Maybe to hype himself up. But,
no, he doesn't say much on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is in contrast to Day, whose mouth is in constant motion
once a game begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donnell's in there saying, `Don't throw the ball on me because
it's not going down,''' Clemente said. ``When I first came here he
was M&AMP;M. They had a nickname for him, `Mean Man.' And then I was
out here messing with him one day and I said, `Hey, Mad Man.' He's
like, `What? What are you talking about.' I just laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   During practice, or in the locker room during the week, both can
become overbearing, though not in a malicious way.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ponciano relaxes in his office, even he lets out a
chuckle when thinking of his flamboyant defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they talk too much? Yes,'' Ponciano said. ``Do they play
hard? Heck, yes. Are they good football players? Yes, sir-ree. And
I'm certainly glad they're on this team.''

USC SUSPENDS AUGUSTINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   USC point guard Kevin Augustine has been suspended from the
Trojans' basketball exhibition opener tonight, after not attending
practice for the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   According to Augustine's father, the sophomore saw a doctor this
week because he hasn't been feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has what I consider, hitting the wall,'' Irby Augustine
said. ``When you're out of it a little. He didn't have any energy.
We're a little concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Irby Augustine said his son might also be suffering from stress.
``He's been lethargic,'' Augustine said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Henry Bibby said Augustine would not play tonight but
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Irby Augustine said his son had no plans to transfer or quit the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a problem with (him) playing basketball,'' Irby
Augustine said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Augustine, freshman Brandon Granville will start at
point guard and be backed up by Quincy Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   USC plays its exhibition opener tonight at 7 against the Slam
and Jam All-Stars at the Lyon Center.

CLAYTON'S DEMANDS UNREALISTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agent Arn Tellem had a bitter week this week. NBA commissioner
David Stern suggested that he was trying to put the league out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, therefore, maybe it wasn't such a good time for
the Rangers to ask Tellem to put a price tag on one of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Because he did, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem, based in Southern California, has told the Rangers that
free agent shortstop Royce Clayton wants a contract worth $25
million over five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That's $5 million per season, even in dog years. But let's put
it in a more appropriate perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Clayton batted .251 last season, that annual salary
breaks down to $36,764.71 per base hit. Or, dividing it up into
what might be deemed an essential task for a shortstop, that's
$94,339.62 per base on balls. Or, to put it in more linearly
accelerated terms, that would be $208,333.33 per stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a bargain, now, is he?
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it sounds like one of those questions on the
SAT. You know _ circle the name that doesn't fit:
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle. Latrell Sprewell. J.R. Rider. Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, how did a sharp, seemingly responsible young man
like Clayton get mixed up, like the others, with Agent Arn-ge?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can't sign Clayton for either $5 million a year or
for five seasons. The former would be squandered money and the
latter would be foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's funny, but I pegged Clayton as a smart kid who
understood that. I thought his hustle was genuine. I thought his
words were sincere, when he talked about how gratifying it was to
come to the Rangers from St. Louis, and to play for a legitimate
playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Winning was important, Clayton told me on the last day of the
season. He liked what he had seen of the organization in the two
months he was here. And he seemed to like the fact that the Rangers
liked what they had seen of him.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin announced that getting Clayton
signed was his first order of off-season business.
</P>
<P>
   And then Agent Arn-ge decided his client was the next Barry
Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers countered with a more modest proposal _ four years
at slightly more than $4 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Even that seems too high for a player whose calling card is
mostly defense. Larkin earned $5.3 million from the Cincinnati Reds
last year, but Larkin batted .309, had 61 extra-base hits and
remains a career .300 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton earned $3.5 million last season. Do all .251 hitters get
a 43 percent raise?
</P>
<P>
   Tellem's demand suggests that Clayton, an eight-year veteran at
age 29, wants to be rewarded for his lifetime achievements to
baseball. Fine. But send the bill to Tony La Russa in St. Louis,
because Clayton only played here for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin hyperventilates when players start asking for multiyear
contracts, although he'd probably would like one himself.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term contracts are best spent on All-Stars like Pudge
Rodriguez, John Wetteland and Juan Gonzalez. A long-term contract
can be a thrill one day _ and Will Clark the next.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another number. Cleveland's great Omar Vizquel, who has
helped lead his team to two World Series, made $3 million this past
season.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has announced that in the wake of Clayton's salary
demands, the Rangers might have to explore other options. In
shortstop language, those options are a gravel road.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin of the Brewers? Borrr-ing.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez of the Giants? The guy has played eight major-league
seasons, and he has walked more than 20 times only once. He also
stole as many bases last season as I did _ none.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing name that has echoed off walls lately belongs to
Minnesota's Pat Meares. The Twins want to dump salary, and Meares'
$2.5 million has reportedly become expendable. The Rangers might
interest the Twins in a name or two off the Triple-A Oklahoma
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Tellem wants to shop around his client, let him
use that Albert Belle catalog, the one with the 800 number that
never rings. Of all the acknowledged contenders that Clayton wants
to toil for, only the San Diego Padres would seem to have their
shortstop spot in any state of flux.
</P>
<P>
   But add it up. The Padres aren't going to sign center fielder
Steve Finley, third baseman Ken Caminiti, starting catcher Carlos
Hernandez and staff ace Kevin Brown ... but they have $25 million
for a new shortstop?
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are reported to have just offered their World Series
linchpin, free agent Brown, a four-year contract. Not a five-year
contract. Four.
</P>
<P>
   All the signees of this past week _ Darryl Hamilton, Devon
White, Dave Burba and Moises Alou _ confined their deals to three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Not five. Three.
</P>
<P>
   Official statistics tell you that the average shortstop in the
American League last season batted .274 with roughly 48 extra-base
hits and 70 RBI. Clayton's offensive stats reek of the norm.
</P>
<P>
   But would you pay $25 million over five years for, in essence,
defense? Not when your primary shopping list includes pitching and
more pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but I had Royce Clayton pegged as being smart enough to
realize that.

OREGON GAME MAGNIFIES INCREASING PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Back in 1900, Washington and Oregon got together
in this leafy college town to begin their football rivalry. They
didn't meet until Dec. 1, which must have really messed up the Bowl
Championship Series, and the Ducks won 43-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight years later, they're at it again Saturday, renewing
a series that has been pocked with some of the strangest
occurrences:
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1962, Oregon's Larry Hill entered the end zone in Seattle
looking for a pass to break a 21-21 tie on the last play of the
game. Instead, he encountered Husky fans who had spilled out of the
stands. Forget the nickel and dime, this was the Susan B. Anthony
of pass defenses.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1973, Oregon won 58-0. The next year, Washington won 66-0.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1994, Kenny Wheaton ran an interception almost the length
of the field to beat the Huskies. Strange? What was really weird
was Washington throwing the deep out from the far hash at Oregon's
8-yard line and ignoring Napoleon Kaufman in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1995, Jim Lambright, who must not have had enough video to
watch that day, made a public appeal for his Husky team to be
selected for the Cotton Bowl over the Ducks. It failed, and he
invited at least another half-century worth of bile from Oregon
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what sort of surprise may await Saturday. But the
Huskies, 5-3 to Oregon's 6-2, enter this game with a defensive
personality that in itself is confounding.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: How does a team that is far and away the national leader
in sacks manage to be strafed so ruthlessly by the pass in the last
two games? Good thing Akili Smith, the Oregon quarterback, is not a
freshman; freshmen quarterbacks from Oregon State and USC have hung
748 yards passing on the Huskies the past two weeks, and those two
offenses rank ninth and sixth in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie's tearing his hair out,'' said Randy Hart, the UW
defensive coordinator, speaking of defensive backs coach Ron Milus.
</P>
<P>
   As the Huskies explain it, their two-game, 26-sack assault
against Utah State and Cal has alerted opponents that they must get
the ball off early. Simultaneously, the play of the secondary has
plummeted, a deficiency underscored by the injury loss of Jermaine
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pass rush is there, but sometimes, myself included, we
miss tackles,'' said rover/cornerback Nigel Burton. ``We were
making plays earlier in the season and the pass rush was getting
there for an unbelievable number of sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now teams are going, 1-2-3, fire, and sometimes we're not
making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Husky pass rush is good, but it was flattered by horrible
offense from Utah State (Idaho had 10 sacks against the Aggies) and
by Cal (the lowest-scoring team in the Pac-10).
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we hit 30 sacks,'' said Hart, ``that ended a whole
lot of sacks, because they (offenses) said, `Hey, wait a second,
the ball's got to be gone.' It's a three-step drop or a quick
five.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies also ran into more mobile quarterbacks in Oregon
State's Jonathan Smith and USC's Carson Palmer, young though they
are. What that does is raise a flaming red flag, because Oregon's
Smith is the most dangerous two-way quarterback in the league,
Brock Huard and Marques Tuiasosopo in one volatile package.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time since the Utah State game Oct. 10, the
Huskies will give a freshman his first start in the secondary.
Anthony Vontoure will open at Burton's rover spot, with Burton
moving to corner to shore up the troublesome vacancy left by
Jermaine Smith's knee injury Oct. 3 against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While the UW secondary signature in the '90s has been man-to-man
coverage, it has frequently been zone in which the youthful
defensive backs have been burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, zone coverage is as much of an art as man-to-man,''
Hart said. ``A lot of the passing yards have been given up in zone
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see the ball in the air repeatedly Saturday. The
Huskies threw it 68 times last week at USC, and with Oregon's
outstanding running back, Reuben Droughns, out for the season, the
Ducks haven't maintained the balance they knew earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this could be D-Day for the Husky rushing
game. Oregon coach Mike Bellotti observed this week that in scheme,
the Huskies remind him of a Montana team that visited Oregon a few
years ago. No offense to Missoula, but surely that comparison did
not excite the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, with a smallish defensive front, has been exploited by
the run, and Washington may conclude if it isn't going to run
Saturday, it isn't going to run, period. The Ducks have allowed
162.8 yards per game rushing, eighth in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are in the unfamiliar position of being expected to
win this game. A series which Washington dominated through the '70s
and '80s has turned, with Oregon winning three of the last four.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this team, I don't think it makes much difference,''
Lambright said. ``All the way along, we've tried to get better each
week. I don't feel (odds) have much to do with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much he'd like to beat Oregon, Huard said, ``First, I
get motivated from my internal perspective (faith). No. 2, I really
want to get after this one for coach Linehan. He's suffered through
a tough week. Third, at 5-3, we need a win more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Scott Linehan was back and forth from his
parents' home in Sunnyside this week after his father died. He will
be calling plays again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, a co-captain trying to hold together the shaky UW
secondary, was more succinct than Huard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Oregon,'' Burton said. ``Enough said.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Trying to picture the Mariner baseball executives at
the general managers meetings in Florida, I can't get this singular
image out of my head.
</P>
<P>
   I see an eccentric bag lady, wearing two scarves and three
coats, shuffling through used-clothing bins at a thrift shop. Time
passes, and I see a story in the paper that Thusnelda Frapperty,
age 86, died and left a $50 million estate to her cats.
</P>
<P>
   The image is a little exaggerated. Bag ladies don't need coats
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, at least 20 major league clubs would enjoy operating
with the Mariners' alleged 1999 player payroll of about $53
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners don't act the part of landed gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new stadium, a large, proven fan base, perhaps the
game's two best players, and an ownership group whose collective
worth outstrips nearly all of their contemporaries, the baseball
brass enters the commencement of free agency and the trading period
with a can't-do list.
</P>
<P>
   Can't do Kevin Brown. Can't do Bernie Williams. Can't do Mo
Vaughn. Could have done Randy Johnson, but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Probably can't do Todd Stottlemyre. Probably can't even do Tim
Belcher, even though they did him once, back when he was a
34-year-old kid, and made the American League Championship Series
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, on what purports to be a can-do list, is something
that rightfully should be on the can't-do list: either trading
David Segui or moving the first baseman to left field.
</P>
<P>
   I could be wrong, but my recollection was that Segui joined Ken
Griffey Jr. and Dan Wilson last year as Mariners who regarded a
ball batted or thrown toward them as less than a life-threatening
event.
</P>
<P>
   But one plan under consideration this offseason is to move Segui
from first, where he saved the Mariner infield from being the most
error-prone aggregation since the bridge crew of the Titanic, to
the outfield, where he has rarely played.
</P>
<P>
   The move is to allow first to be played by Jay Buhner, whose
offseason arm surgery permits him to hit but not resume his normal
right-field spot until deep into the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   While Buhner is a good glove man, his adjustment to the infield
as a 34-year-old with creaky knees will be just slightly faster
than global warming. Meantime, Segui will be added to the Griffey
collection of clueless left field partners, whose number NASA
scientists expect to agree upon when research concludes early next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than improving the team, this Mariner plan sets out to
weaken 25 percent of the regular field positions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the diaphragm of the Mariner fan spasms completely from
the brilliance of this move, there is an alternative _ trading
Segui for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they might get one or more prospects for Segui is beside
the point. In the last few seasons, most of these types of trades
by Woody Woodward, M's vice president of baseball operations, have
worked into liabilities, if not disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are that Segui set career highs in numerous offensive
categories and was an exceptional fielder (one error in 1,162
chances) until his August knee injury. Presuming a return to good
health, he is one of the best free-agent signings in club history
and only slightly less a contributor than Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   A trade makes him the Seattle professional heir to Omar Vizquel
and Tino Martinez _ somebody else's All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rumors suggest the Mariners are thinking about trading him
for multiple lesser players from Pittsburgh. The Mariners can't get
his equivalent from the Pirates because they don't have it, so
again Seattle is contemplating giving up great for maybe good.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the reasons this time aren't primarily money or age,
because Segui, 32, makes a relatively reasonable $2.5 million. His
departure would be mostly to resolve a situation with an older,
injured favorite, Buhner, whose deal is up after '99 (the club
holds an option for 2000). Even for a club with a grand tradition
of shortsightedness, trading Segui for multiple ordinary players
would require an electron microscope to detect virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The more the Mariners trade for younger players, the more they
squander the present (see 1998) and the less the atmosphere appeals
to Griffey and Rodriguez, both of whom have declared plainly their
desire to play for a winning team before re-upping.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners head down to Florida having nearly talked
themselves out of the market for significant free agents, the only
alternative for improvement is trades. But unlike the Yankees,
Dodgers, Braves and a few others, the Mariners simply don't have
the veteran quality depth that allows for successful swaps of prime
major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fat, just meat, such as Segui.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining alternative is another trip to the discard table
of Tony Fossas, Pat Listach and Rick Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Items to fill the bag lady's cart. And secure the cats' futures.

SEAHAWKS, CHIEFS SEEK U-TURN LANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson labels Sunday's
game against the Kansas City Chiefs ``double do or die.'' Even
Marty Schottenheimer, the always-optimistic coach of the Chiefs,
admits making the playoffs will become ``far more difficult'' for
the loser of this sold-out game at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the one word that best describes being 4-4, Chiefs
quarterback Elvis Grbac offers, ``Sucks.'' Seldom a man of few
words, Seahawks running back Ricky Watters needs only a few to
summarize the importance of Sunday's game: ``We have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks and Chiefs, two teams full of preseason promise who
jumped out to 3-0 and 4-1 starts, have used turnovers and mistakes
to dig themselves into the same 4-4 hole. Only one can crawl out
headed in the right direction, and it will use the other as a
stepping stone.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Sunday's game will remain on the fringe of the
playoff picture. The loser will be 4-5 and looking at winning six
of its final seven games to have any chance of sneaking into the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever comes out of this game with a loss is going to be in
trouble,'' Watters said. ``I mean, I wouldn't say the season is
completely over, but they'll be in some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, these two teams already are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have lost four of their past five games, and their
turnover ratio in the losses is minus-8. The Chiefs have lost three
straight and are minus-7 in turnovers in their four losses.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover disparity is even more glaring considering that the
Chiefs (19) and Seahawks (18) rank 2-3 in the AFC in takeaways. But
the Seahawks have lost 11 fumbles, tops in the conference and
second-highest in the league; the Chiefs have lost 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three games, since returning from a separated right
shoulder, Grbac has thrown six interceptions and lost a fumble.
Three of the picks came in Sunday's three-point loss to the New
York Jets at rain-soaked Arrowhwead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, I've got to go out and have a good game,'' Grbac
said. ``I haven't played up to my potential yet. I've just got to
go out there and eliminate the mistakes. . . . Right now, it's a
big disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs' 16 turnovers have stalled drives, but they also have
led to only 20 points by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have turned the ball over twice in their four wins
and 14 times in their four losses. Opponents have scored 37 points
off the 16 turnovers, including 17 by the Raiders in their 31-18
win over the Seahawks on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to get to that next level where we want to
go unless we cut down on the penalties and the turnovers,'' Watters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The football isn't the only thing the Chiefs and Seahawks are in
danger of losing.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, one columnist already has called for
Schottenheimer to be fired. And Grbac was the big loser in a poll
conducted by the Kansas City Star this week where more than 24,000
readers voiced their opinion on who the starting quarterback should
be. Grbac got 28 percent of the votes, to 72 percent for backup
Rich Gannon _ who was 3-1 as the starter while Grbac was sidelined,
including a 17-6 win over the Seahawks in Kansas City five weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Erickson has been the favorite target for newspaper
columnists and callers to sports-talk radio shows this week.
</P>
<P>
   The best of times these are not. For either team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say frustration and disappointment is where we are,''
Schottenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have booked themselves into the same mental state.
Like the Chiefs, the Seahawks were expecting more than they have
produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pieces of the puzzle are in place,'' Watters said.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: LB Hillary Butler, the former University of
Washington player who was signed to the practice squad Wednesday,
was added to the 53-man roster. To clear a spot for Butler, OG
Andrew Green was released. . . . Watters (bruised thigh) was able
to participate in the first part of practice Friday and should
start, Erickson said. . . . FS Kerry Joseph was added to the injury
report as questionable with a groin injury. But Erickson said he
expects Joseph to play. . . . Rookie LBs Anthony Simmons and
DeShone Myles practiced after missing time with knee injuries and
could play. . . . Named inactive: C Kevin Glover and FS Eric
Stokes, who are injured; DT Riddick Parker; and WR Bobby Shaw, who
was signed off the practice squad Wednesday. . . . The practice
play of the week was turned in by Shawn Springs, who made a
one-handed interception of a pass from scout-team QB Jon Kitna on
Thursday. The ball seemed to levitate at Springs' right hand for a
blink before the left-handed cornerback corralled it. ``That was my
1,000th career interception against Kitna. So I had to do that
special for Kitna,'' Springs joked in the locker room as Kitna was
walking by. . . . In Kansas City, CB Dale Carter was named
inactive. Mark McMillian will start for Carter and be replaced as
the nickel back by rookie Robert Williams.

REIGN WINS ABL OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A seven-point lead with less than two minutes left
dwindled to one Friday night, putting the Reign on the verge of
losing its third straight ABL opener.
</P>
<P>
   But in the frantic final seconds at McNichols Arena, the
Colorado Xplosion missed two desperation shots as the Reign held on
for a 64-63 victory before 4,038.
</P>
<P>
   A questionable offensive foul on Reign center Val Whiting with
20 seconds remaining gave the Xplosion the ball and a chance. They
worked for one shot. And got two.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Robinson tried to force her way into the key, but
Shalonda Enis played tough defense, forcing Robinson into an
off-balance shot. Clank. Three Reign players had shots at the
rebound before the ball caromed to Colorado guard Debbie Black,
whose close-range shot with two seconds remaining rolled off the
rim.
</P>
<P>
   There were no more shots and a lot of sighs of relief from the
visiting Reign, which beat the Xplosion for the first time in nine
games in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if we won by one point or 100,'' Reign coach
Tammy Holder said. ``It means so much for this team to go home for
our (home) opener (Sunday night against San Jose) with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle opened with a win after going 0-3 in preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely overjoyed,'' said guard Niesa Johnson. ``To
win a game by one point is such an ego booster. We know we're a
good team, and this win is going to help our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition losses were forgotten in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone through so much the last two years with so many
close games, missing the one ingredient it takes to win,'' Holder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she didn't identify that ingredient, Holder added, ``In
this game, everyone decided their girl wasn't going to score the
winning basket and one of us were going to get the rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than the Reign wanted, but Whiting grabbed
Black's last-second miss.
</P>
<P>
   For Enis, her defensive work on Robinson was the highlight of
her game. Enis, who averaged 18 points a game as last year's ABL
Rookie of the Year, finished with a career-low four points on
2-for-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shalonda didn't have a great game, but she has been battling
the flu,'' Holder said. ``She missed three practices this week, so
we knew she wouldn't be at full strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Enis, ``I have been working hard on my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the offense fell into others' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting and forward Angela Aycock each finished with 14 points.
Sparkplug guard Johnson added 13 points, reserve Astou Ndiaye
contributed 10 crucial points and Kate Starbird scored all nine of
her points in the third quarter when the Reign recovered from a
horrible second quarter and 30-26 deficit to lead 50-45 entering
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's acrobatic shot crossing the key with 3:32 remaining
hiked the Reign lead to 64-57. Missed shots and turnovers hounded
Seattle the rest of the way as the Xplosion roared back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have put ourselves in that position,'' said
Colorado's Tari Phillips, a former Reign player, who sang the
national anthem. ``We gave up a lot of open shots and we missed a
lot of open shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reign, which had an ABL-worst 15-29 record last season,
played well in building a five-point, first-quarter lead. Seattle
looked horrible in the second with 3-for-13 shooting and six
turnovers, but was much more fluid in the third and fourth quarters
before the hectic final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, playing for her third ABL team in three seasons,
provided the penetration Holder is looking for, but Johnson's
teammates weren't always ready for her passes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had eight turnovers, but should have had no more than
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my style is different than what the team is used to,''
Johnson said. ``I either have to slow it down or they have to speed
it up. Since I had the eight turnovers, I had better slow it down
until they catch up.''

 ARIZONA THINKS TWO QBs BETTER THAN ONE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The two-headed quarterback, once feared as the first
sign of a dysfunctional offense, is no longer such a monster to
many Pac-10 coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Arizona's Dick Tomey, have employed it all season
with great success. Others, like Washington State's Mike Price,
have reluctantly tried it out of futility.
</P>
<P>
   When the two teams meet Saturday night in Tucson, statisticians
should have their hands full just keeping up with whose head is
behind center.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins quarterback the
Pac-10's most efficient passing offense, hitting on a combined 60
percent of their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both very similar,'' Price said. ``They are very
athletic, they both run like crazy. Smith right now seems to be
playing a lot better, but that thing can change and they flop back
and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   For WSU (3-5), Steve Birnbaum and Paul Mencke quarterback a
passing offense that has plunged from first in the conference last
year to eighth this season. The two have combined for 45.3 percent
accuracy on their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play two quarterbacks that do a lot of the same things,
but we are not sure what direction they are going to go this
week,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (8-1) will start Smith, the 5-foot-11, 200-pound junior
who's been hitting on 69 percent of his passes and has had the
hotter hand of late. But Price still marvels at the play of
Jenkins, who scored the memorable, game-winning touchdown against
Washington earlier this season by doing a somersault into the end
zone in the Wildcats' 31-28 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jenkins is the hero of all heroes against the University of
Washington. It was probably the number one best athletic play in
college football this year,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a 6-2, 214-pound sophomore, is no stranger to the
Cougars. He led the Wildcats into overtime against WSU last year
only to lose when he fumbled a two-point conversion attempt that
would have won the game. Afterwards, he provided the Cougars with
some still-lingering bulletin-board material by declaring that they
weren't as good as Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But with Jenkins' numbers dropping (49.7 percent completion
rate, 121 efficiency ranking, compared to Smith's 172), Smith
likely will be the quarterback the Cougars see most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith has been so consistent this year,'' Tomey said. ``He is
throwing very accurately and making big throws when he has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Price believes Arizona's two-man QB system is based more on
psychological factors than athletic ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just kind of like mood swings with these two guys,'' he
said. ``One just goes off. One goes nuts and the other one doesn't,
and the next week it's the other way. But they're both tremendous
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Price has scripted certain plays for each of his quarterback and
will use them according to a set game plan.
</P>
<P>
   After alternating Birnbaum and Menke on every offensive series
last week, Price plans to modify his approach. Mencke will start
the game, but Birnbaum will come in within the first 10 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mencke (9 of 19 for 178 yards and three TDs) appeared
to outplay Birnbaum (4 of 11 for 104 yards) in the Cougars' 38-28
loss to Arizona State, he made one critical error that makes Price
hesitant to play him full time. That came in the fourth quarter
when Mencke threw an interception that went for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the position, I thought it played better than it
has for a while,'' Price said. ``It's just that when the left guard
makes a mistake, it's not so critical. But when the quarterback
makes a mistake, like Paul did throwing into double coverage, it's
just critical. He's just got to learn to take care of the football
better and not make those bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   After charting the number of plays from the ASU game, Price
found that Mencke was the quarterback for 46 plays, while Birnbaum
had about 25 plays. The result was 482 yards in total offense,
including 282 yards passing, the Cougars' best offensive output in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could happen again, and I wouldn't be opposed to that
kind of ratio (against Arizona),'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   MAN ON MAN: One of the key matchups today could be when Arizona
cornerback Chris McAlister lines up against WSU's Nian Taylor,
who's averaging 19.9 yards per reception and has seven touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``McAlister against Nian, that could be a real matchup,'' Price
said. ``If (only) we could hide Nian. Put him in a different
jersey, something like that. Change his height and shrink him down
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, however, wants to stand out on his own merits. ``I love
competition. He's supposed to be real, real good, and I need to go
up against somebody who is real, real good just to see where I'm
at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MISSING GLEASON: Linebacker Steve Gleason, captain of the Cougar
defense, has been missed on the field and in the huddle after he
suffered an infection to his sprained knee last week. But Price
expects him to return to action today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed him when things go bad in settling the team down,''
Price said. ``When the team needs to get riled up, he gets them
riled up. He also gets people aligned properly. (Against ASU) we
had some misalignment defensively, and we just don't do that when
he's in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleason's position was filled by junior Grady Emmerson, who had
13 tackles against ASU. Gleason will start today, but Price said
Emmerson will see plenty of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   TUUPO RETURNS: Expected to start at linebacker going into the
season, Tupo Tuupo had his season cut short when he broke a
shoulder blade in practice Aug. 24. Already having redshirted his
freshman year last year, Tuupo didn't have the option of sitting
out another season and will now see his first action today in
limited duty.
</P>
<P>
   Price said losing the 6-foot-2, 245-pound linebacker was an
early blow. The shoulder has healed, but he's not the player he was
during summer practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty ready to go last fall,'' Price said. ``He was in
tip-top shape. . . . He had intensity and was a real flashy player,
striking like Gleason only bigger.''

   MIDEAST-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ A red Fiat belching smoke sent
shoppers fleeing moments before it exploded outside a bustling
marketplace Friday morning, killing the two bombers and wounding 24
other people. The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended
deliberations on the Wye peace memorandum, calling on Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he was cracking down on
terrorism. By Deborah Sontag. (With photos and map)

   RUSSIA-FOOD (Moscow) _ It is a mark of Russia's anxiety that
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov's aides put aside their pride on
Friday and concluded an agreement to buy $625 million worth of
grain, meat, milk, soybeans and other food assistance. According to
the senior U.S. Agriculture Department official who helped

DUCKS SETTLE FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Mighty Ducks came into Friday night's game with
some things to prove.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to prove to their coach that they were willing and
able to work hard for 60 minutes. The Ducks also wanted to show San
Jose they they are no longer bait for the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose goalie Steve Shields proved he's more than just
another backup goalie. Shields, who backed up Dominic Hasek in
Buffalo the past two seasons and is Mike Vernon's understudy this
season, stopped a career-high 45 shots in a 2-2 tie before 15,958
at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 minutes, it looked as if the evening would be a complete
success for the Ducks. But Dave Lowry's shot off a faceoff with
9:33 left was good enough for the Sharks to salvage a point,
despite being outshot 47-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed, but over the course of the year those
things even out,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said. ``We stole a
point in St. Louis we didn't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep working, you will end up on the positive end of
these things at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who lost all six games to the Sharks last year and
haven't defeated San Jose since the final night of the 1996-97
season, came out hitting, skating and shooting, things they did
very little of in a 3-1 loss to St. Louis on Wednesday that drew
the ire of coach Craig Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim never really let up, but the Ducks could only solve
Shields twice. The San Jose goalie stopped shots every way
imaginable, including taking a shot by Steve Rucchin off his mask
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked so much harder and smarter than we did the other
night,'' said Hartsburg. ``We battled the way we can... now we just
can't take a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Sandstrom scored a power-play goal in the first period,
Ruslan Salei added one in the second and the Ducks appeared to be
in complete control.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose took advantage of a turnover by Teemu Selanne and
scored on a breakaway with 51.8 seconds left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well, but we still had a 2-0 lead, we should have
closed them out,'' said Paul Kariya, who along with linemates
Selanne and Rucchin combined for 18 shots but no goals. ``We made a
couple mistakes and that cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute before Lowry beat Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert
on the stick side after Ron Sutter beat Rucchin cleanly on a
faceoff, Shields foiled Marty McInnis' bid for his first goal as a
Duck. He somehow stretched his leg across to the right post and
stopped the shot that was set up by Sandstrom on a shorthanded
two-on-one break.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great save,'' Kariya said. ``That would have put it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   With Marcus Ragnarsson in the box for interference, Selanne set
up the game's first goal midway through the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis half-shanked Selanne's centering pass, but Selanne
circled behind the San Jose net, jumped on the loose puck and fired
it through the crease to Sandstrom, who fired his fourth goal of
the season into a half-empty net at 10:15.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, who beat Dallas on Wednesday despite getting only
nine shots on goal, had six shots in the first period Friday, but
none of them really tested Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' penalty box was visited by a couple of unusual guests
as both Selanne and Kariya were penalized. It was Selanne's first
penalty of the season and Kariya's third. It is only the third time
the two have been called for penalties in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four seconds after Selanne was sent off for holding,
Sandstrom was called for high-sticking Owen Nolan, giving the
Sharks a 1:26 two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks got six shots, but Hebert was rock solid. He stopped
four shots in a final flurry by San Jose, including one critical
shot after McInnis had lost his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert's stops proved to be critical as they allowed the Ducks
to take a 2-0 lead at 8:50 when they scored another power play
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Salei, who missed the first five games of the season due to a
suspension, took a cross-ice pass from Fredrik Olausson and
one-timed a shot from the right point that beat Shields as Kariya
was skating through the slot providing a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks continued to control the action with plays like a rare
end-to-end rush by defenseman Jason Marshall, but the Sharks got
close in the final minute of the period.
</P>
<P>
   With the teams playing four-on-four, Bill Houlder forced a
turnover from Selanne and sent out Friesen on a breakaway. San
Jose's all-time leader in goals, assists and points made no mistake
easily tucking a backhander by Hebert with 51.8 seconds left.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE TRUE THEMES OF THE '98 VOTE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 8.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rather than prepare a political pudding from the
results of the midterm voting, it might be better to follow Winston
Churchill's advice and send the results back to the kitchen for
lack of a binding theme.
</P>
<P>
   Spin chefs, having quaffed too many historical analogies at the
expectations bar, insist we pundits must down our pudding after
such a lugubrious campaign meal. But in Nevada (where the voters
appropriately broke down the middle), gamblers no doubt sense what
transpired: the elections were a push.
</P>
<P>
   A push pains the networks, who demand their anchors enunciate a
clear story line. But the right thing to do, as President Clinton
might say, requires them to take their money off the table.
</P>
<P>
   There's time enough to place bets on the 2000 elections. In the
meantime, here are a half-dozen side wagers on what lies ahead:
</P>
<P>
   1. Clinton won't be able to get his policy agenda enacted into
law.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason behind this coming failure is so obvious that,
as with the emperor's outfit, it's rarely observed: the president
lacks the votes. His deficiency, however, won't deter newshounds
from letting forests fall and the airwaves resonate with breathless
reports about the upcoming State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   2. While the Republicans still control both houses of Congress,
they can't get their agenda enacted either.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of Clinton vetoes are potential circuit breakers. But
deep ideological fault lines within the party also deter action.
Newt Gingrich's decision to call it quits underscores the
deep-seated divisions within the party. Those splits spawn
negotiating leverage for the Democrats, no matter who succeeds him.
</P>
<P>
   3. To the extent Clinton's actions do matter, it will mainly be
in the foreign policy arena. On domestic initiatives, his
participation will matter to the degree he splits policy
differences with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents enjoy wide freedom of action abroad; most of them
have used those chits. Domestically, Social Security reform is an
salient area for such a bipartisan bargain; campaign reform remains
more iffy.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't stick a fork in Kenneth Starr yet. He isn't quite done.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tormentor called time out for the elections. Now he's
back in the game. More indictments are coming. Their impact on the
impeachment process depends on how closely, as the Elizabethans
would have put it, they touch on the royal person.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Republicans still have the will to put Clinton on trial,
but they lack Senate votes to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Even if Starr is compromised at
the House Judiciary hearings, Republicans are likely to press their
case. News stories about what kind of president Al Gore would make
should remain spiked, however.
</P>
<P>
   6. Sooner or later, some totally unexpected event will come
along to alter the Washington calculus.
</P>
<P>
   Most pundits dutifully conclude that what is to come follows
what came before. But life isn't that way, as George Bush found in
1990 when the Iraqis stormed into Kuwait. There's somebody out
there now who also isn't bluffing, as the new Congress and the old
president and the recycled pundits will in due course discover.

JESSE VENTURA: EX-WRESTLER BRINGS MUSCLE TO GOVERNOR'S MANSION  
 
 REPEATING FOR ALLTHOSE NEEDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ He's given up body-slamming Hulk Hogan.
He's quit wearing a pink feather boa and glitter tights. He no
longer pummels alien invaders with Arnold Schwarzenegger or plays
characters who snarl things like, ``I ain't got time to bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, Jesse Ventura _ former ``bad boy'' on the pro wrestling
circuit, action-flick actor, Navy SEAL, and talk radio shock jock _
says he's ready for a new nickname. He doesn't want to be called
``the Body'' any more. ``I'm Jesse the Mind now,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ventura _ the strapping, chrome-domed,
gravel-throated sports-celluloid celebrity _ has a new job. In an
earth-rattling political upset Tuesday that left politicians and
prognosticators shellshocked, Ventura became the next governor of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to resist, David Letterman instantly offered up a Top Ten
list of slogans for the new chief of state, including ``Building a
steroid-enhanced bridge to the 21st century,'' and ``C'mon, don't
you want to see Newt Gingrich in a chokehold.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ventura, who ran as a third party maverick against two
respected and established major-party candidates, strutted a little
through his victory party as if he had just whacked Jimmy
``Superfly'' Snuka.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said a vote for me was a wasted vote,'' he said. ``Well
guess what? Those wasted votes wasted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's breathtaking victory _ with 37 percent of the vote _
marked the first time a Reform Party candidate has ever won
statewide office and makes him the highest ranking elected official
in Ross Perot's party. And it was a huge humiliation for his rivals
_ the Democrat, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III,
son of the former vice president, who got 28 percent, and the
Republican, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who got 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, it's stunning,'' said Chris Gilbert, chairman of
the department of political science at Gustavus Aldophus University
in St. Peter, Minn., one of a legion of experts who initially
thought Ventura was just a ``curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how we try to explain it, it's a really
stunning, striking outcome for Minnesota and the nation, to have a
Reform Party candidate break through and for the Democrats and
Republicans in the state to essentially see all their core
supporters taken away from them,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   A few observers were not as shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse's victory proves that people want a real man in power to
lead, not a play plastic puppet like other politicians,'' said Hulk
Hogan, who played good guy to Ventura's bad guy. (He added: ``I'd
love to get him in the ring one time before he becomes
president.'')
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Minnesota, the Jesse phenomenon might seem comical.
But inside the state, at least in 20-20 hindsight, it actually
seems to make sense. Behind it is a streak of protest vote, a trace
of the national backlash against politicians. But Ventura was able
to cobble together a number of other advantages.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Ventura, 47, had tremendous name recognition,
primarily from his talk-radio show, and that made up for his lack
of campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   While Coleman and Humphrey were both competent and
well-regarded, they lacked luster and began to snipe at each other
in what, for Minnesota, was a negative campaign. Ventura, on the
other hand, is an appealingly colorful mixture of affable bravado
and plainspoken drive. In one of his television commercials
children play with a Jesse Ventura action figure who scuffles with
Evil Special Interest Man.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, voters with low expectations were pleasantly
surprised when Ventura, who served four years as the mayor of
Brooklyn Park, a suburb of Minneapolis, turned out to be a
substantive candidate too, able to clearly articulate opinions on
almost every issue, many of them refreshingly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as a fiscal conservative with liberal and
moderate social views, Ventura supports abortion rights and gay
rights. He refuses money from special interest groups, and opposes
school vouchers, merit pay for teachers and taxpayer funding for a
new baseball stadium. He even mused publicly about legalizing
prostitution and drugs, although he says he's not suggesting he
approves of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELN-MINN-VENTURA-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; BLOOMINGTON, Minn.: approves of the idea. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a populist affection for political mavericks _
Ross Perot got 24 percent of the presidential vote here in 1992 _
all this went over like gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotasek, a 32-year-old baker from Bloomington, said he was
persuaded to vote for Ventura precisely because the other
candidates seemed to marginalize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about him running, I thought it was going
to be a stunt,'' said Gary Isakson, a 30-year-old sales
representative for a Minneapolis concrete company. ``But I hear him
in these debates and he really won me over. I'm sick of
professional politicians voting for specific bills just because
they have to vote along party lines. I liked what he said about if
a bill comes across his desk, he'll sign if it's good for
Minnesota. He just talks straight from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Body'' was born James George Janos, still his legal name,
but he began to call himself Jesse Ventura at the start of his
professional wrestling career in 1975. ``Ventura'' sounded like it
fit the bleached-blond surfer-wrestler image he was cultivating
after coming out of a stint as a Navy S.E.A.L in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't really a very good wrestler, but he had charisma,''
said Dave Meltzer, publisher and editor of Wrestling Observer
newsletter. ``His best move was standing on the apron yelling at
the fans while his tag team partner did all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura believes that wrestling has laid a foundation for his
politics because it made him comfortable ad-libbing and performing.
Others see different advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of wrestling is that when you make move A and
someone blocks move A, you've got to make move B, C or D,'' said
Nick Bockwinkle, four-time heavyweight wrestling champion who lives
in Minnesota. ``You've always got to have alternatives and I think
that translates to the political structure as well.'' (Sounds like
he'd make a good cabinet member in a Ventura administration).
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ventura left wrestling and began to get small roles in
films like ``Batman and Robin'' and ``Predator'' with
Schwarzenegger. He went on to be Brooklyn Park mayor from 1991 to
1995. He and his wife Terry own a thoroughbred horse ranch outside
Minneapolis. He says he will continue to be the conditioning coach
a high school football team, where one of his mantras is ``What is
pain? Pain is good!''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's greatest challenge will be to work with the state
legislature _ a Democratic Senate and, as of Tuesday, for the first
time in years, a Republican House. But the man who as a candidate
once replied to a question about getting along with the legislature
by baring his grapefruit-sized bicep, seemed unfazed by that
conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've jumped out of an airplane 34 times,'' he said. ``I've
dove 212 feet under water. I've done a lot of things that defied
death, and this isn't defying death. It's just common sense and
hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ventura, who said he was ``awestruck'' and punchy
from exhaustion, met with Gov. Arne Carlson, whose staff had
briefing books ready. Then he did an hour of his radio show _ live
in a packed sports bar _ fielding calls from, among others, the
owner of the Vikings, who offered him his pick of seats, saying
``you can body slam me on the 50-yard line if you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he never even got so much as a press pass before.
``You know,'' he said, ``I'm beginning to kind of like this gig.''

COMMENTARY: LOVERS AND HATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a new spirit wafting through the land.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, baby, we're talking about love power.
</P>
<P>
   The voters have chosen the lovers over the haters. The meanies
with the jangly names _ Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Lauch Faircloth,
Fob James, ``B-1'' Bob Dornan _ are toast. So are the guys like Al
D'Amato, who sneered and jeered and used ethnic and anatomical
epithets. So are the Christian zealots. And obsessive special
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic lover boys, like Bill Clinton, and the Republican
preachers of compassion, like the Bush boys, are being embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse (the Body) Ventura may have been a body-slamming,
pile-driving bad boy in the ring, but the big lug just seems so
darn huggable when he says he will continue to be a volunteer high
school football coach even after he starts work at the Minnesota
statehouse. And you've got to figure a governor in a fringed jacket
is not going to do anything too Draconian.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the Gingrich fall is this: When politicians behave
like wrestlers, caricature villains who are only out to destroy
their opponents, then the voters might as well get the real thing.
Even if Ventura makes a mess in Minnesota, he can't possibly rival
the mess the GOP House leadership has made in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as he slipped the first shiv into the speaker's back,
Bob Livingston tried to drape his palace coup in lacy doilies: ``I
love him dearly. He's my friend.'' He sounded more like Rosie than
Brutus. He called ``his dear friend'' Newt ``a man of Churchillian
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the moment he was threatening Gingrich, the bland
Livingston did not seem very threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent, the boyish Hall-of-Fame football player from
Oklahoma who wants to topple Armey, said the Republicans had to
recapture that twinkling, leading-man magic of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Far from throwing bombs and raving about impeachment, Largent
promoted himself for the job of House majority leader by saying he
shares a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood with two Democratic
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the nasty Armey, who ``slipped'' and called Barney Frank
``Barney Fag,'' Largent claimed he actually liked working with
liberals and moderates _ and had met with Barney Frank, Gerry
Studds and David Bonior in an effort to ``build the relationship
and the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr made a monumental mistake. They were
not merely content with punishing the president for having an
affair in the Oval Office with an intern. They wanted to kill off
the lax moral spirit of the '60s and stomp on what Gingrich in 1994
disdainfully called the ``Great Society, counterculture
McGovernik'' legacy. Both men thought they could banish situational
ethics and restore '50s black-and-white morality. But gray is the
fashion this fall. While baby boomers are more conservative,
sexually and politically, and more materialistic than they once
were, they don't want to go back to McGuffey Readers and twin beds.
And a lot of them remember the '60s fondly.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation is mod. The extremes are extremely out. The message
of the election was more kisses and hugs, fewer vendettas and
wired-up girlfriends. More terms of endearment, fewer articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is in shock this weekend. It's hard to believe that
we are already in the post-Newt era. With a brief statement issued
on Friday night, the history professor was history.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House there is already galloping Newt nostalgia.
The day after the election, West Wing strategists were salivating
over the prospect of running Al Gore against Gingrich and Starr, no
matter who won the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With the speaker dumped and Ken Starr's feet sticking out from
under the house like the Wicked Witch of the East after the
tornado, Democrats may have gotten too much of what they wished
for. Clinton has so far been blessed with the overreaching of his
enemies. The spotlight will now shift away from the president's
enemies to the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mad, mad world. Who would have ever thought that the man
Monica would bring down would be Newt?

COMMENTARY: IN THE WAR ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are times when Dr. Warren Hern feels more like a combat
veteran than a physician. Here is what he says about a normal
workday: ``I walk out of my office and the first thing I do is look
at the parking garage that the hospital built two doors away and
see if there is a sniper on the roof. I basically expect to be shot
any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his close friends have been shot. ``My dear friend,
Garson Romalis in Vancouver _ he was the first of the Canadian
doctors to be shot. They almost shot off his leg. He nearly died on
his kitchen floor.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the fall of 1994. Dr. George Tiller was another
friend. He was shot in both arms in Wichita, Kan., in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Other doctors have fallen. Dr. David Gunn was shot to death in
Pensacola, Fla., in 1993, and Dr. John Britton was shot to death,
also in Pensacola, in 1994. Dr. Barnett Slepian was shot to death
in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst a little over two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are big headlines whenever a doctor who performs abortions
is killed, but the relentless terror and gruesome violence that
continue to plague abortion providers and the people who assist
them take place below the level of consciousness of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Few people know about Robert Sanderson, the Birmingham, Ala.,
police officer moonlighting as a security guard whose body
literally was blown to pieces in the bombing of a clinic last
January. Or about the widely circulated ``Army of God'' manual that
gives detailed information on the construction and use of bombs and
other murderous devices, and recommends that if you don't kill
doctors who perform abortions you should at least render their
hands useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a war zone,'' said Hern, who runs the Boulder Abortion
Clinic in Boulder, Colo. ``It's very frightening and it ruins your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The terror frightens everyone. Hern said: ``We had this
absolutely fantastic candidate for a front-desk job in my office.
She was ready to accept, but because of the assassination of
Slepian she decided not to work here. She talked to her friends and
family and decided she could not live with that kind of fear. I
didn't blame her. That has happened on numerous occasions. We've
had people leave here because of the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means, said Hern, is that the violence and the terror
are working.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we provide these services to women,'' he asked, ``if
those who would help us are terrified?''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion terrorists get much aid and comfort _
sometimes openly, sometimes covertly _ from various right-wing
political elements, including members of the Christian right, the
militia movement and the white supremacy movement. The moral fervor
of the right, so loudly proclaimed, is selective indeed. The
feeling of many on the right is that if violence and terror result
in the curtailment of abortion, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Hern is the author of ``Abortion Services,'' the principal
textbook on abortion for doctors in the U.S. and a number of other
countries. He is also an associate clinical professor of obstetrics
and gynecology at the University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He lost count of the death threats against him many years ago.
They started as soon as he began doing abortions back in the early
1970s. ``I slept with a rifle beside my bed,'' he said, ``because I
lived up in the mountains and was afraid I would be attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   He wears a bulletproof vest at some of his public appearances.
In 1988 someone fired five shots into his office. ``I had to
install bulletproof windows,'' he said. He'd already hired private,
armed security guards. The harassment, the demonstrations and the
terror continued. The office at times was surrounded by 50 to 100
peace officers of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' said Hern, ``a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the hard right has been dealt a setback. The extremists have
faltered, at least momentarily. Newt Gingrich is packing his bags
and the Republican Party is searching frantically for a friendlier
demeanor. This can only help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the radical right lost a lot of ground in the
election and that's very encouraging,'' said Hern. ``There clearly
are Republicans out there who don't agree with that agenda and they
should be running the party. Then people can get a little balance
back.''

   WASHINGTON _ What a difference a decade makes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Democrats fretted that they
had been soundly thrashed in three successive presidential
elections because the party had become too closely associated with
black people, thus driving away white voters. To counter that
impression, groups like the centrist Democratic Leadership Council,
and its one-time chairman, Bill Clinton, wanted their votes but
went out of their way not to be seen as pandering to blacks and
even engaged in some public rebukes.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate in 1992, Clinton told blacks to take more
``personal responsibility'' for improving their lot and he
chastised Sister Souljah, a black rap artist who once suggested
that blacks should kill whites. As president, he told parishioners
of a black church in Memphis that the high homicide rate among
blacks would shame the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This year, blacks have became the Democrats' new best friends.
</P>
<P>
   The party spent millions of dollars advertising on black radio.
Congressional candidates were urged by party leaders to make as
many appearances as possible in black neighborhoods. In the closing
days of the campaign, the president chatted on the Tom Joyner Show,
a nationally syndicated black radio program, spoke before a black
church in Baltimore and appeared on Black Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson campaigned for black and white candidates
and, perhaps more significantly, in black and white communities for
Democratic candidates in 35 states _ a sharp contrast for a man
whose presence was once so troubling that even L. Douglas Wilder, a
black candidate for governor of Virginia in 1989, did not want
Jackson to campaign in his state.
</P>
<P>
   The effort paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 blacks made up 19 percent of Georgia's voters. This year
they accounted for about 29 percent. In Maryland, blacks went from
12.5 percent of all voters in 1994 to 21 percent this year. In
Michigan, the black share of the vote leaped from 13 percent four
years ago to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Black turnout also jumped dramatically in North Carolina,
Alabama, South Carolina and Illinois, providing the margin of
victory in several Senate and gubernatorial races _ although an
overwhelming black vote in Illinois could not save Carol Mosely
Braun, the only black U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer a problem with the Democratic Party being
associated with black voters _ none,'' said David Bositis, a senior
fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies,
which analyzes issues involving black people. ``Before it was:
`We've got a problem. We've got to divorce ourselves from the black
community.' Now, it's no longer a problem. It's an asset.''
</P>
<P>
   The courting of blacks this year did not stop with Democrats. In
Florida, Republican Gov.-elect Jeb Bush boasted that his victory
stemmed from his ability to appeal to all groups _ blacks included.
</P>
<P>
   Will the wooing continue? Turnout this year was the lowest since
1942. And in low-turnout elections political strategists make
special efforts to bring out their most loyal voters _ blacks in
the case of Democrats. It's an open question whether the Democrats'
current embrace of blacks will be as tight in a presidential
election when appeals must be made to a broader electorate.
</P>
<P>
   And while blacks tended to vote for Democratic moderates this
time to defeat conservative Republicans, there is a question
whether liberal black leaders, flush from the bravura performance
of black voters, may try to push the party to the left once more _
and, by doing so, once again turn off Southern whites and Northern
blue-collar ethnics. Already, the results of last week's elections
caused Jackson to contemplate challenging Vice President Al Gore
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The journey from pariah to savior represents a remarkable shift
in the way blacks are viewed by Democrats _ and perhaps by the
country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists say the change stems from a realization
that blacks remain the party's most loyal bloc of voters and that
when their turnout is low, as it was in 1994, Democrats suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94 it became clear that most Democrats can't win nowadays
without doing well with African Americans,'' said Democratic
pollster Ron Lester. ``Some people had to learn that through hard
knocks and bad experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   But the patching up of the fractious alliance did not take place
in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   With crime rates falling, out-of-wedlock birth rates plummeting
among black women and welfare rolls declining, many of the issues
that _ fairly or not _ have been associated with blacks have lost
potency. And although Washington state passed a ballot initiative
banning race and gender preferences, the victories of Democrats
there indicate that the issue of affirmative action didn't
demonstrably turn whites against the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think back to the 1980s, what was it that allowed race
to work so much against the Democrats? It was a perception of
people getting something for nothing,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a
professor at the Kennedy School of government and a former aide to
Gore. ``When you change the welfare system to a work system, you
suddenly get rid of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks now hold 38 seats in the House, a large enough bloc to
convince the House Democratic Caucus that targeting black voters
was a priority.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Charles Rangel of New York's Harlem parlayed his
position as the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee to
raise more than $1 million for his own campaign, mainly from
corporate political action committees. He then donated $100,000 to
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and sprinkled at
least another $50,000 into the coffers of Democratic candidates
around the country. Rangel also raised another $1.3 million for the
congressional campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision was made to target black voters, Democrats
found a receptive audience. Polls conducted by Lester and the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies showed that blacks were
becoming even more partisan than they had been in the past _ turned
off by Republican oratory and policies and turned on by their
improving economic lot, for which they gave President Clinton
credit. Once a message was delivered to black voters that
Republicans were trying to impeach and remove the President, blacks
turned on the Republicans with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real lesson is that black people will vote,'' said Lester.
``If you give them a reason to and make the effort to get the vote
out, you can make a difference. We know how to do this.''  &QL;

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Amid the hundreds of exhibits at the World Gaming
Congress and Exposition in September, no new products better summed
up gambling's place in the American psyche than the ``Pedal 'N
Play'' cycle and the ``Money Mill'' treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to get the heart pounding and the palms
perspiring than to wager money while exercising? The stationary
cycle and the treadmill both have slot machines attached, allowing
casino customers to sweat and bet at the same time, or as they say
in gambling parlance, to ``stay in action,'' even while they're
working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going crazy about this,'' said Kathy Harris,
president of Fitness Gaming Corp. of Fairfax, Va., the company that
created this latest way of efficiently separating gamblers from
their money. Ms. Harris pointed out that the machines were wired so
``you can't gamble unless you're peddling and you can't peddle
unless you're gambling.'' The company's motto: ``Put your heart
into gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   To visit the gambling industry's September extravaganza, which
drew more than 23,000 casino operators, entrepreneurs and
government officials from over 100 countries, is to totally forget
that legalized gambling itself is undergoing a re-examination by
politicians and law-enforcement officials around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm that caused the industry to mushroom throughout
the 1980s and early 1990s is slowly giving way to trepidation, as
local governments learn that casinos are no panacea for their
economic infirmities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a presidential commission is expected to release a
report next year on gambling's impact on the nation. And casino
operators themselves have even banded together to finance studies
about compulsive gambling. The effort of the casino operators has
as much to do with controlling the damage that full awareness of
compulsive gambling could have on their industry's reputation as
with any desire to expose the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, studies continue to show that a majority of people
support some form of legal betting. A recent survey by American
Viewpoint, an opinion research company, and Gtech, the powerful
lottery company, found that 7 out of 10 Americans believe that
legalized gambling is an ``acceptable form of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   And with one or more types of betting now legal in nearly every
state, it is little wonder that the frontiers of wagering were on
full display at the gambling exposition.
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center was filled with slot
machines and table games, wildly colored casino floor carpeting and
furniture, the latest technology in automated teller machines and
coin counters and the gigantic fake trees, rocks and animatronics
that have transformed the nation's gambling halls into alluring
wonderlands.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of new games were displayed, and their enterprising
creators used prize giveaways, free beer and seductive models to
corner and cajole wide-eyed casino operators and government
regulators into giving these new games a home in a casino. At the
Digital 21 exhibit, which featured a new game of virtual Blackjack,
a model attracted plenty of interest, although many of the players
who crowded around her table were clearly having a difficult time
paying attention to the cards.
</P>
<P>
   One casino advertising and marketing company even beckoned
delegates by packing its small booth with young women in tight
clothing and posting a sign offering a drawing for ``a free exotic
dancer in the privacy of your room.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrities at the convention was the pop star Michael
Jackson, who has recently expressed an interest in investing in a
Detroit casino. Priscilla Presley, his former mother-in-law, showed
up to help promote a new Elvis slot machine, which allows gamblers
to wager while they watch a video of The King himself in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days after the convention ended, the Flamingo
Hilton in Kansas City, Mo., became the first customer to order the
Pedal N' Play and the Money Mill, according to Ms. Harris. Other
potential customers are making plans to include the machines inside
their casino hotel spas or create exercise areas on the casino
floor itself.
</P>
<P>
   And in Las Vegas, where slot machines can already be found at
just about every two-bit bar and convenience store, Ms. Harris
hopes to do what any health-conscious American entrepreneur would
do: convince local health club owners to get gaming licenses and
put her company's machines next to the weights, stair-climbers and
aerobic exercise floors.

Timothy L. O'Brien, a reporter for The New York Times, is the
author of ``Bad Bet'' (Times Books, 1998), a look at gambling in
America.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When California voters approved a measure last week giving
Indian tribes broad permission to run casinos unhampered by state
control, it was a big loss for the Coalition for Unregulated
Gambling, one of the measure's fiercest opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the coalition disapproves of gambling; in fact, it
was financed largely by gambling companies based in that granddaddy
of gambling states, Nevada. Why did Nevada's gambling bigwigs, many
of whom have pushed aggressively for the acceptance of gambling in
other parts of the country, work so hard to keep California from
joining the club? Raw fear.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of Nevada's casino patrons come from
California, and many of them will stay closer to home if Native
Americans offer a more enticing menu of table games and slot
machines, which the ballot measure permits. You don't need to be a
bookie to know how bad that would be for business in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   California's tribes could end up with legal casinos with about
20,000 gaming devices, about 5 times the number at Foxwoods, the
Indian casino in Connecticut, according to William Eadington, an
economist at the University of Nevada at Reno. Foxwoods is the
biggest gambling joint in the Western Hemisphere. Legislators in
California may now feel compelled to legalize or expand gambling at
card clubs, race tracks, bars and taverns, and other recreation
centers. ``All of this would indeed be bad news for Las Vegas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevadans also know that wagering is now a national industry and
that the explosive growth of the business has made it available
everywhere _ on street corners, on the Internet, and all along the
Mississippi River. By the year 2000, 90 percent of Americans will
live within 200 miles of a legal casino, the Las Vegas Convention
and Visitors Authority noted in a recent report that pointed out
challenges facing a town that is still regarded as the mecca of
American gambling. Only a generation ago gamblers had few choices
but Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But all gambling moguls, not just those based in Las Vegas, are
looking over their shoulders. Gambling's ubiquity is forcing the
industry's impresarios to fret about the best ways to drum up new
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have all the gambling they want,'' said Eugene
Christiansen, a gambling analyst with Christiansen/Cummings
Associates in New York. ``The driver of growth over the past three
decades _ the satiation of unsatiated demand _ is no longer
there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steve Wynn's new $1.9 billion Las Vegas casino, the
Bellagio, aims to attract new gamblers with luxurious rooms, posh
shops and a collection of Picassos and Matisses, analysts expect
most gambling concerns to focus on something more basic to stir up
new business: gamblers' thirst for action and the fast-paced,
mindless devices like slot machines and video lottery games that
quench that thirst most effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Even if its growth slows, gambling is still a colossal business.
Americans bet $638.6 billion legally in 1997 and lost about $51
billion of that amount _ more than the loot pulled in by the
recording, movie and theme park businesses combined. Those losing
bets were also up 70 percent from the $30 billion gamblers forked
over in 1992, according to International Gaming &AMP; Wagering
Business, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   But that money is being lost in a lot more places now. In 1989,
nearly all casino gambling took place in Atlantic City, N.J., and
Las Vegas; now it's just over half. Riverboat gambling is now far
bigger than the action in Atlantic City. And the boats are no
longer confined to rivers. Last week, voters in Missouri approved a
measure legalizing slot machines in casinos floating in artificial
basins.
</P>
<P>
   So most gambling concerns are now focused on a core mission:
pushing games that appeal to gamblers' need for speed. Speed sells.
Speed hooks gamblers. Slot machines have long since replaced the
plodding table games of craps and roulette as the mainstays of the
casino business.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone walking into a casino a few decades ago, when the Rat
Pack was in full swing in Las Vegas, would have encountered a room
full of table games like blackjack and craps with slot machines
relegated to the periphery where the little old ladies played.
Today, slot machines dominate the floors of every casino and the
allegiance of most gamblers _ especially retirees parked in front
of the slots at their local gambling den. Slot machines are fast
and simple; crap games are not. So slots and other electronic
gambling devices accounted for about 70 percent of the money that
gamblers lost in casinos last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many state lotteries, the recent Powerball mania
notwithstanding, are encountering gamblers who are increasingly
blase about huge jackpots. The lottery industry calls it ``jackpot
fatigue,'' and many lotteries are relying on the speed of
instant-ticket games to snag more gamblers. If piles of money
aren't enough to get gamblers' attention, the adrenaline blast from
a quick gambling hit usually will do the trick. The New York
lottery, the largest state lottery in the nation, now gets more
money from instant games than it does from its better known Lotto
games that offer big jackpots and snare the lion's share of media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And online lottery games like New York's Quick Draw game _
labeled ``video crack'' by its critics _ let gamblers play a new
game every few minutes. Video lottery terminals, though legal in
only five states, generated a quarter of all lottery sales
nationwide last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that when you make these machines
available, people use them,'' said Christiansen, the gambling
analyst. ``The other side of this is that with increased gambling
you create social friction like compulsive gambling. It's a
legitimate policy concern.'' The stakes in all of this are high,
because compulsive gambling is still a fuzzy issue and is one of
the key concerns of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission,
which is currently examining the industry. It is expected to report
its findings next year.
</P>
<P>
   When criticized, the gambling industry rightly points out that
most gamblers wager within their budgets and just do it for fun.
Still, a significant number of gamblers _ about 20 percent in most
markets _ lose the lion's share of the money, about 80 percent,
according to casino executives. And within this core group, a
sizeable though unquantifiable chunk are compulsive or problem
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that about 5 percent of the adult
population, or some 10 million people, are compulsive gamblers.
That is, they are hooked on gambling like others are hooked on
nicotine, heroin or alcohol. But terms like compulsive and problem
gambling are notoriously fuzzy, given that they are used to
describe a wide variety of behaviors that do not fit easy
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Harvard Medical School published a study
indicating that about 1 percent of the adult population and 6
percent of youths are what could be described as active compulsive
gamblers. The same study found that about 3 percent of adults and
15 percent of youths are what could be described as problem
gamblers, those who regularly wage beyond their means but are not
addicted.
</P>
<P>
   The same study also found that gambling disorders in the United
States have been increasing over the last two decades. Needless to
say, the growth in gambling problems coincides with the expansion
of the gambling industry, and with faster games. It is the faster,
repetitive games that tend to be the most addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, attempts to put the brakes on gambling have little
success. New York state Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, sponsored
legislation earlier this year to limit gambling, but it failed.
``Compulsive gambling disorders,'' he said, ``may be for Generation
X what cocaine and crack were for their parents' generation.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is supposed to be the Age of the Finance
Minister. In the mythology of the 1990s, they are the titans of
this unnamed era following the Cold War. In many countries these
days, the guardians of the treasury are running the show.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the case in Europe, where the imminent
introduction of a single currency is giving enormous power to the
institutions that must make it work.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joked
recently that it only seems as if the Treasury Department has taken
over vast swaths of U.S. foreign policy. ``Treasury Secretary Rubin
assures me that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But as finance and diplomacy merge, the job of finance minister
is becoming riskier.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few finance ministers _ long accustomed to
limousines, antique-stuffed offices and lavish meals paid for by
Wall Street firms eager to cut deals _ have discovered that when
economic globalization goes bad, the finance minister goes down.
The unluckiest have swapped pinstripes for prison stripes, fall
guys for long-brewing trouble that erupted on their watch.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring case _ one that will haunt President Clinton's
trip to Asia this week _ is that of Anwar Ibrahim, the 51-year-old
former finance minister of Malaysia. Anwar was the darling of
American industrialists, the like-minded buddy of Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, and the heir-apparent to Malaysia's testy,
unpredictable leader, Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Asian crisis struck. Anwar advocated going with the
flow of a global economy that had turned Malaysia into a phenomenal
production site for high-tech goods. He said it was time to tighten
belts and follow the prescriptions of the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir denounced the West and currency speculators, but he
went along with Anwar's strategy until things really turned bad in
September. Then Anwar was arrested, the strategy was reversed, and
the government imposed controls on the flow of currency across its
borders. Days later Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and
lacerations from beatings he said had been meted out by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with Anwar is terribly, terribly troubling,''
Rubin said last month. ``He is a highly respected member of the
international financial community. He has really been a great force
for great good, in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon other finance ministers and World Bank president James
Wolfensohn also rallied around their imprisoned comrade.. At his
trial, which began last week, the country's top police intelligence
official admitted he would lie under oath about Anwar's activities
if ordered to do so by his superiors. But of course, the trial is
really about the direct political challenge to Mahathir's iron
control that Anwar's supporters have mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar is not the only finance minister in the dock. In South
Korea, Kang Kyong-shik, a 62-year-old politician was arrested
because he was unlucky enough to be in the finance minister's chair
last year when the country had to turn to the IMF for an emergency
bailout. Since then the Korean currency has partly recovered, but
the country is headed into deep recession. And Kang, who
unquestionably sat on his hands as the situation grew worse, has
become the scapegoat for a decade of financial sins in South Korea,
a country where bureaucrats and the heads of Hyundai and Samsung
have a lot more power than any mere finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kang sat in jail for months after his arrest this year, charged
with abuse of power and negligence of duty, before he was released
to prepare for his trial. The prosecution says he should have
informed Korea's president at the time, Kim Young-sam, that the
country was on the brink of financial ruin. They have a point: The
Finance Ministry was covering up the fact that it had wasted most
of the country's currency reserves in a failed effort to prop up
the Korean won. But if Kim didn't know Korea was in deep trouble,
he wasn't reading the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that I should be tried in this sort of
situation,'' Kang said earlier this year. Others familiar with his
case say they fear that if economic mismanagement suddenly becomes
a crime, finance ministers around the world will be paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since the global economic crisis began 16 months ago,
it has become difficult to find people willing to become finance
ministers. No Japanese politician wanted to get near the job when
it came open in August. It was finally foisted on former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who at age 78 isn't exactly putting his
political future at risk. And anyway, Japanese finance ministers
don't go to jail for mismanagement; if they did, Japanese
construction firms would be building new jails the way they once
built car factories.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Russia, which in September made an example of
Boris Fyodorov, who was the nation's chief tax collector and top
economic policy maker. Fyodorov was a wealthy investment banker and
former finance minister, and his elevation to the job of head of
the State Tax Service in May seemed like a sign to the West that
the country was finally getting its act together. But then he did
something no Russian tax collector had ever really done before: He
began collecting taxes, including from Gazprom, the natural gas
monopoly. He even joined high-publicity raids on deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that in a country desperate for revenues,
Fyodorov would be a hero. But the Communists who came into the new
government, led by Yevgeny Primakov, demanded Fyodorov's head. When
he refused to go quietly, he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Still hanging on, if by a thread, is Guillermo Ortiz, whom the
United States credits for engineering the $60 billion bailout of
Mexico's banking system after the 1995 peso crash. Now opposition
parties say the bailout was an illegal rescue of rich bankers at
the expense of poor workers, and Ortiz is trying to dodge
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Rubin himself? Last summer his Cabinet colleagues
were predicting his imminent resignation, noting that he made his
name on Wall Street by selling at the top of the market. But he has
stayed on, through a period of rough times for both the president
and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Dow is back up, and so are the Democrats. And the rumors
are circulating again that he will leave, before he is hit with the
curse of the finance ministers.

RECONCILING IN SOUTH AFRICA: NEXT UP FOR AMNESTY _ THE
UNREPENTANT

 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The deal that South Africa's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess
your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free. If you don't
come forward, you will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era
atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report
naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the
gore but never applied for amnesty. So the prosecutions should
begin soon, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. The study was barely in the hands of President
Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties _
including the ruling African National Congress _ have key officials
who could end up in the dock because of the report. Suddenly, there
is lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of
politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are
betting that an agreement ``of mutual benefit'' is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three major political parties are calling for some kind
of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door. ANC spokesman
Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to talk of a general
amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an
amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans
against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with
bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style
trial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped
for an idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and
receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able to move on,
its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a model watched closely
around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle
themselves from the grudges of a brutal past.
</P>
<P>
   But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators
did not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they were
frustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their
report may seem.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's
South Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment,
crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind
up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives
amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for
all concerned to move on.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity in
many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South
Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and
to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome
details of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers
told of smashed genitals and near suffocations. And the
commission's work added much to the knowledge about what happened
in South Africa between 1960 and 1994. But it will be years before
the effect of the commission can truly be judged.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist?
No one can answer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear, however: Four years after South Africa
held its first non-racial elections, a growing number of South
Africans want to be done with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter,
Southern Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up
during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the
issue from next year's election campaigns. ``You simply can't have
this country torn apart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody is
going to be howling for an amnesty. They already are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman,
delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new
amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move would be highly
unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead that there
be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would in
effect get amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit
prosecutions. More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy
groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as
``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a Truth Commission emerged as a compromise from the
long negotiations that brought about South Africa's peaceful
transition from a white supremacist state to a non-racial
democracy. During the talks, the white National Party government
pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only about 250 former police officers came forward,
most of them foot soldiers. And only two high National Party
officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in ordering
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the commission called the apartheid state the
``primary perpetrator'' of gross human rights violations and held
such high ranking former officials as former President P.W. Botha,
his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligence
chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and others of lower
rank, have not applied for amnesty
</P>
<P>
   For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible
prosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assaults
and abductions. Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The
ANC is held responsible for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC's problems are further complicated by its efforts to
make peace with the largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.
Virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty.
Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with the white
government, was responsible for widespread slaughter in
KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party
officials stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. But
prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may be
the result of still another factor: The judicial system is already
overwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheid
era is old. So why spend the time and the money?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, only one political party is opposed to any form
of new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party, a
liberal group that was not involved in the violence. Its head, Tony
Leon, says a new amnesty would only prove that ``the more thuglike
your behavior, the more you get away with.'' But he concedes that
his is a lonely voice. ``At this point,'' he says, ``there is
little enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past.''

RECONCILING IN SOUTH AFRICA: NEXT UP FOR AMNESTY _ THE
UNREPENTANT

 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The deal that South Africa's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess
your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free. If you don't
come forward, you will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era
atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report
naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the
gore but never applied for amnesty. So the prosecutions should
begin soon, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. The study was barely in the hands of President
Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties _
including the ruling African National Congress _ have key officials
who could end up in the dock because of the report. Suddenly, there
is lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of
politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are
betting that an agreement ``of mutual benefit'' is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three major political parties are calling for some kind
of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door. ANC spokesman
Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to talk of a general
amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an
amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans
against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with
bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style
trial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hoped
for an idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and
receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able to move on,
its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a model watched closely
around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle
themselves from the grudges of a brutal past.
</P>
<P>
   But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators
did not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they were
frustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their
report may seem.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's
South Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment,
crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind
up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives
amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for
all concerned to move on.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity in
many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South
Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and
to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome
details of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers
told of smashed genitals and near suffocations. And the
commission's work added much to the knowledge about what happened
in South Africa between 1960 and 1994. But it will be years before
the effect of the commission can truly be judged.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist?
No one can answer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear, however: Four years after South Africa
held its first non-racial elections, a growing number of South
Africans want to be done with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter,
Southern Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come up
during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the
issue from next year's election campaigns. ``You simply can't have
this country torn apart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody is
going to be howling for an amnesty. They already are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman,
delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new
amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move would be highly
unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead that there
be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would in
effect get amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit
prosecutions. More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy
groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as
``unconscionable.''

MODERNIZING BRITISH LAW: SUITS OF ARMOR NOW ALLOWED

   LONDON _ Britain may have passed for the moment on joining
Europe's new currency, the Euro, but this doesn't mean Brits are
immune to the winds of change. Even the Royal Family will feel the
bite of progress this month when the monarchy loses its
centuries-old right to all whale carcasses found on England's
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   This little known provision of English law _ which further
stipulates that the head goes to the king and the tail to the queen
_ is but one of hundreds of obscure laws that will become null and
void when Parliament passes The Statute Law Repeals Act of 1998, as
it is expected to do in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Victorian era, Londoners should
soon be free to fly kites, beat a rug in public or roll a cask on
the sidewalks without risk of arrest. Ships in British waters will
no longer flout an 1824 anti-slave-trade law when they carry
``cooking vessels of an unusual size.''
</P>
<P>
   Even legislators will benefit, by finally eradicating the 14th
century act that forbids them from showing up at Westminster in
full suits of armor.
</P>
<P>
   Shoveling away what some call ``statutory sludge'' falls to John
Saunders, who heads the British Law Commission's Statute Revision
Team and describes himself as a ``legal refuse collector.'' Since
the British legal system lacks a self-cleaning mechanism that
automatically sweeps dusty laws off the books, the Law Commission
periodically presents Parliament with a compendium of out-of-date
statutes destined for the rubbish bin.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been hoary relics (such as the ban on fish frying on
boats docked in the River Thames); others were only recently
enacted. To track down quarry, Saunders and his three colleagues
hunt through history books, transcripts of Parliamentary debates
and yellowing legal treatises that are often written in Latin or
Norman French. ``People think that all we do is laugh ourselves
silly all day over legal oddities.'' Saunders said recently during
an interview in his tidy, London office. ``That is not so.''
</P>
<P>
   Scuppering useless laws is not unlike transporting
nitroglycerin. ``Laws which have been lying like a sleeping dog
sometimes wake up and bite,'' noted Saunders, citing a
long-forgotten law that London squatters resurrected in the 1970s
to block landlords from repossessing their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Revision Team, much as it might like to, cannot cut and
slash with abandon. Its charter imposes a time-consuming burden of
consensus gathering that forces the lawbusters to seek permission
from a bewildering array of interested parties _ from Scottish dog
wardens to multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   And sticklers sometimes protest when they think, mistakenly,
that revocation erases actions born during the law's tenure. (A
grandfather clause prevents that from happening.)
</P>
<P>
   Saunders lamented that not all government officials share his
sense of urgency when it comes to reining in the bulging British
statute book, which dates back to the 13th century. ``It is quite
difficult to persuade government departments to find time'' to look
at the team's correspondence, he said, ``so we try to help them as
much as possible, which means writing up a full research note on
the specific law. We don't want to give government departments an
excuse to procrastinate.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there is no shortage of outdated laws awaiting
Saunders' chopping block. ``We could be here for another 10
years,'' he suggested, seeming to relish that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Scrapping some laws, he acknowledged with a proud smile, gives
him great pleasure: ``I particularly enjoyed rescinding The
Enticement To Mutiny Act of 1797,'' he reminisced wistfully. ``The
government of the day was in a panic to stop an outbreak of
mutinies. So they passed draconian laws intended to stop not only
mutinies, but anyone trying to incite someone to mutiny. It was a
knee-jerk reaction with heavy penalties. Very much enjoyed that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders bristled at the mention of sentimental antiquarians who
would preserve all quaint statutes as if they were priceless
artifacts. ``A statute that stays on the books past its usefulness
_ no matter how charming _ is really telling a lie,'' he said. ``We
have a duty to maintain the statute book by a regular pruning in
the same way that someone has a duty to maintain a garden in good
working order.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are limits, he conceded. ``There might be the
occasional Act so steeped in history that it would be churlish to
repeal it,'' he said. Asked for an example, Saunders paused
reflectively and answered with a chuckle, ``I suppose one might be
slow to repeal the Magna Carta.''

 UNDATED: long ago.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The height, the weight, the speed _ he fit the perfect
stereotype of the guy who can't play quarterback,'' said Ozzie
Newsome, the Baltimore Ravens vice president and chief of player
personnel. ``How many under-6-foot quarterbacks have been
successful in this league? That is why the NFL didn't believe. He
is a huge exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every one Doug Flutie there are 20 that didn't make it and
couldn't do it. And the thing about it is that many quarterbacks
have shown that they can play three or four games and be good.
Bobby Hoying, Danny Kanell, Jake Plummer _ they all did that last
year. Look at them this year. Teams start circulating that tape and
these defensive coaches come up with things to make it tough. If
Flutie can sustain what he has done over the next 10 or 12 games,
he will really be the exception. And, let me make this clear _ I'm
not saying he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is the top-rated passer in the American Football
Conference with a 102.7 passer rating. He has thrown 10 touchdown
passes and only 3 interceptions. He has completed 62.8 percent of
his passes. In Canada, he was a similar star and more: In his eight
seasons there he won the league's most outstanding player award six
times and his teams won the league championship three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug is the new guy on the block, a new story,'' said Wade
Phillips, Buffalo's head coach. ``He's like Mighty Mouse _ he's
come in to save the day. He's a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, the Bills' mighty defensive end, said: ``To be
honest, I don't think anyone in their right mind could foresee what
was going to happen in the last five weeks. We lost three straight,
won five straight, we're in first place and Doug Flutie is our
starting quarterback. He does things that can't be done up there on
the chalkboard. In boxing, they call it ring management. He
improvises and takes control. He has a heart as big as any
300-pound linemen I've ever played against.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Bills say they wanted Flutie to remain the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if something happens to Doug that we have a great
quarterback in Rob who can come right in and win for us,'' said
Bills defensive end Marcellus Wiley. ``But the coaches' decision
reflects the players. We are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie gives the Bills mobility at quarterback. Defenses today
fiercely pursue quarterbacks and Flutie counters that with
elusiveness and breaks down defenses. His arm strength is good, his
play-fakes and ball-handling are special and his intelligence is
supreme. That is his real game, his smarts and his experience. And
the combination of all of that enables him to find unique and
uncanny ways with his talent to win.
</P>
<P>
   He makes others around him who have more talent, who have more
speed, work harder, produce more. They see little Doug Flutie
busting to win and they think, ``Gee, I'm twice as big as him,
twice as fast _ why can't I do that? I can!'' They do.
</P>
<P>
   So Buffalo rolls. Flutie rolls. Others are at the forefront.
Receiver Eric Moulds is making big plays. Fullback Sam Gash brings
extra oomph. Running back Thurman Thomas, in a reduced role, still
makes big Thurman Thomas plays. The former Dallas receiver Kevin
Williams contributes. The Bills' offensive line is having an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets this afternoon will most likely command that their pass
rushers stay in their lanes, remain disciplined, and force Flutie
to beat them from the pocket with passes down field. No mad
scrambling. The Jets will attempt to make Flutie's fame fleeting
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie knows the ride can derail. His plan, though, is to keep
sticking, keep socking. It was A.J. Smith, the Bills' director of
pro personnel, who sold the owner Ralph Wilson and the Bills on
Flutie. Smith saw the winner, and, simply, the football player that
Flutie is. Flutie initially wondered if his new teammates would,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first arrived in minicamp in May,'' Flutie said, ``I
knew I could play. But I didn't know what to expect from the team.
I didn't know if they would treat me like a rookie or a veteran.
But I think I've showed them something.''
</P>
<P>
   Showed them all.

FASSEL FACES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS SLUMPING GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Fassel knows what they are saying about him as his
unraveling Giants lurch into the second half of their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to laugh,'' he said, standing beneath the
Giants Stadium grandstand after Friday's practice. ``Last year, I'm
the coach of the year. Half a season later, people are wondering if
I have any clue what I'm doing. How did I get that dumb that
fast?''
</P>
<P>
   There are other things they are saying about Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Why is his offense so conservative? Why can't he fix this mess
of a Giants season? Has he, in his second year as the coach, lost
control of his team? Or lost the magic that put a glow on last
season?
</P>
<P>
   Is Fassel, like his Giants, having an off year?
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has heard those questions, too. He nods calmly when they
are recited to him. And he has answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in control, I'm not a raving idiot, not out of sorts like
I saw Ray Handley towards the end of his time here,'' Fassel said.
``I'm not any different this year, although my wife says I'm more
intense than I was last year. It's natural when you lose, all kinds
of things start to surface and people are going to analyze
everything you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me more determined. I stand tall. I know what I want
to do. I know where I want to go and nobody's going to change my
course.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a vexing week for Fassel, the first in his Giants' tenure
in which adversity was so evident, with an ill mood enveloping
everyone on the Giants as they prepared to take their 3-5 record to
Dallas for Sunday's game with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Fassel responded disdainfully when a reporter
questioned why he doesn't ``just open the offense up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks you just go back and throw the ball up in the
air and guys make catches and all that stuff,'' Fassel answered.
``That's not the way it works. You've got to start by executing
basic plays and build on that. End of conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he berated his players for their poor practice
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be ready to fight,'' he said. And from the look
on his face, he might have been ready to demonstrate what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fassel, who is normally effusive around his players,
spent some parts of practice aloof from them, quietly walking with
his head down and his hands deep in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, Fassel insisted his grip on the Giants was no
less firm and his personal vision for the team no less clear than
it was a year ago. If he is suffering through a sophomore jinx as
coach, he does not feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel did acknowledge that despite his reputation as an
offensive football guru, he has failed so far to repair the Giants'
broken offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed that we haven't been able to unlock that
thing,'' he said of the offense, which is ranked 28th in the
30-team National Football League. ``I feel bad about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in answer to a familiar question _ Why don't the Giants
throw the football deep more often? _ Fassel was not as contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the games, you see how many downfield passes are thrown,''
he said. ``Not how many are called.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer is a variation on Fassel's reproach of quarterback
Danny Kanell after the team's loss to Washington. He said then that
Kanell was rushing his decision-making and ignoring open receivers
down field.
</P>
<P>
   To Fassel, the Giants' season has been a misadventure with one
reoccurring subplot _ his team is the youngest in the league. That
was also true a year ago when the Giants were 10-5-1, but the 1997
team seemed to listen better to their new coach, whom they regarded
as a savior.
</P>
<P>
   That team, in retrospect, played well above its talent level.
This season's team is playing as one would expect a young team to _
erratically because of inconsistent mental preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   One recent criticism of Fassel has been that he neglected to
recognize that his players may have been taking their
division-winning season of a year ago for granted, leading to an
impassive approach to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is 20-20,'' he said. ``I had no reason to believe we
weren't mentally tough. Besides, in training camp, I'm trying to
get leaders to stand up and assert themselves because we need them.
If I ride them too hard, if I'm dominating everything again, I
might step on those potential leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I assumed they were going to be soft, that might not have
worked either. We might be 1-7 now instead of 3-5.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has hardly given up trying to fix this season. A loss
Sunday would all but mathematically eliminate the Giants from
playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wake up in the morning, I don't think about what I'm
going to wear or what I'm having for breakfast,'' he said. ``I
think about what I could be doing to get this turned around. It's
the last thing I think about before I go to bed.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN THE SIZE STRUGGLE OUTREACHES THE CLASS
STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen to the daunting questions in the silence of the hoops,
questions we never have time to ponder because the beat of a
bouncing basketball is usually so insistent this time of year. Is
Doug Flutie too short, is Bill Bradley too tall, is Katarina Witt
too naked, is Mike Tyson too crazy, and should the pro football
conglomerate be renamed the National Felony League?
</P>
<P>
   By delaying its opening from last week to possibly next year,
the National Basketball Association has given us time to think
beyond Allan Iverson's crossover dribble and Michael Jordan's
crossover image. The sport has also provoked a general disgust
among its most sophisticated fans. Tony Kornheiser of The
Washington Post described the impasse as ``a fight between tall
millionaires and short millionaires.'' Sam Smith of The Chicago
Tribune likens it to ``watching two limousines collide.''
</P>
<P>
   They are absolutely right, yet so are both sides in this size
struggle. And that's what it is, a size struggle, which is even
bigger than the class struggle. If you are a short millionaire who
slunk into your family's business after being cut from your church
or synagogue basketball team, you feel a genetic need to stand up
to those ungrateful giants who never had to kowtow to Dad or meet a
payroll. What do they know about the work ethic; they've been on
scholarship since junior high.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a tall millionaire who grew up pushed to dribble and
dunk instead of learning to read books, it's time to strike back at
four-eyed bitty-bullies who made snide remarks in class.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of human-interest basketball news _ what's new on
Latrell Sprewell's victimization, Michael's full-scale
investigation of Nike atrocities, Dennis Rodman's body parts? _ has
been a boon. The former Senator Bradley, who is deciding whether to
fulfill the promise of his Knicks rookie year by running for
President, will not suffer guilt by association. His new book,
``Values of the Game'' (Artisan), implies that the virtues he
learned on the hardcourt in short pants have made him the open man
for the next election.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be good to read about all the other tall men who
went through the same hoops but came out more fit for the nut house
than the White House. The upset gubernatorial victory in Minnesota
of Jesse (the Body) Ventura, a former pro wrestler, helps set the
stage for bigger pols.
</P>
<P>
   The current Playboy spread on Witt also raises an issue of size:
If the public responds in a positive fashion to the layout, it
could change the size of future ice skaters and perhaps even
gymnasts. If larger, more developed and, most important, older
women become those sports' stars, the exploitation of elfs and
gnomes might end.
</P>
<P>
   Size is key. Flutie was not exiled from the National Football
League because he was too short to see over his line, he was exiled
because he was the same size as, or smaller than, many owners and
coaches. He was a reminder of their failure to start on their
college, even their pee-wee teams. They had always blamed their
``lack of size'' when it was their lack of will, talent, need. Some
fans feel this way, too, which is why Flutie's middle name is
``Hail Mary pass,'' so that people think that he rates on luck or
divine lagniappe. You don't have to be a Jets fan, only a size fan,
to hope that Vinny Testaverde, who looks much less like you, wins
today.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is size; it's the only way to explain the reluctance
to hire Flutie while murderers, rapists, kidnappers and
wife-beaters make the roster if they are big enough. In their new
book, ``Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL'' (Warner
Books), Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger claim that one out of five
currently active NFL players have been charged with a serious crime
(traffic offenses, disturbing the peace, shoplifting not included.)
They came to this conclusion by researching the criminal histories
of 509 players whose records were accessible. Of that sample, 109
had been arrested a combined 264 times.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, a Boston law student who has become something of the
jocks' Javert in recent years, believes that a league that suspends
players for gambling or using steroids should also ban players who
commit felonies. While the new book is provocative and important,
Benedict's shiny idealism is not exactly saleable; sports on TV is
sold by crunch and stomp, and crooks and nuts may hit the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   It's size. People whose muscles _ or wallets _ are big enough
can make crime pay.

JETS LOOKING TO PUT THE SPECIAL BACK INTO THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their reputation seems to have outrun them.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago the Jets' special teams were the toast of the
club, arguably the most important units in a surprising franchise
resurgence. Indeed, they were probably the best in the league with
Leon Johnson returning punts, Aaron Glenn dashing back on kickoffs,
players such as Chris Hayes tackling opposing kick-returners, and
John Hall launching oval missiles into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the special magic has not been there this season, even
though the Jets are a better club. And that is probably the reason.
When they take the field at the Meadowlands Sunday to start the
season's second half against the Bills, the offense will be
expected to score points, the defense will be expected to stuff the
Bills, and the special teams ... well, they will try to improve in
some areas that have simply become mediocre, and they will have to
do it without their punt return specialist, Leon Johnson, and with
a new punter, John Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's injury is the latest to hit the special teams, where a
domino effect has been at work all season. The biggest impact has
been to the linebackers, a unit that lost Marvin Jones and the
rookie Casey Dailey to injuries during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of those injuries, the Jets had to curtail the
special teams play of two of their best players on kick coverage
teams, Dwayne Gordon and Chad Cascadden because they became virtual
starting linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Those difficulties were further compounded when Cascadden was
injured, knocking him out of action for three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other teams have definitely been doubling up on Marcus
Coleman and me,'' said Hayes, a proud man who looks at
special-teams play as ``my chance as a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cascadden returns Sunday, but with Johnson out with a sprained
knee, the domino effect continues. Dedric Ward will take Johnson's
place returning punts and Ward's place next to Glenn on the
kickoff-return unit will be taken by Kevin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries serving as the great equalizer, the falloff of the
special teams is evident in the statistics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year, the Jets had 3 returns for touchdowns. This year
they have none.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year Johnson's longest punt return was 66 yards. This
year, 19.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year Johnson's longest kickoff return was 101 yards. This
year, 37.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year no opponent had a return for a touchdown. This year,
1.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets' punting ranks 29th in the league and the field-goal
percentage is 26th at 64.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Jets' punt returns will improve in the colder
weather that is sure to come. Coach Bill Parcells theorizes that
return men are likely to break longer runs ``in bad weather, when
players don't like making tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also claims that the Jets are victims of their success
last season; he says that opposing teams are now kicking the ball
straight up rather than risk a return.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Jets' opponents have had the lowest punting average
against them of any team in the league _ 41. That indicates that
the strategy has been to kick it high and force a fair catch or
middling return. Thus, Johnson's average has sagged from 12.1 yards
_ sixth-best in the league _ to 7.8 yards, well below the league
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bills punter Chris Mohr is likely to use the same tactic despite
the absence of Johnson. Mohr has been trained to get his punts
high, allowing his coverage team to pounce on the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what a team will do week to week,'' Ward said.
``Just because the Bills have covered a certain way all season, it
doesn't mean they won't change this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have not fared any better punting the ball away either.
Brian Hansen, the 38-year-old punter, was unloaded in favor of
another veteran, John Kidd, after Hansen shanked punts in
consecutive games for the first time in his career and his punting
average skidded to 29th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who is 37, said his instructions are ``to do what's right
for the situation _ if we're backed up to our goal-line, kick it
far, if we're near the other goal-line, kick it high.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has another valuable talent _ he is a good holder. Last
year, when Hansen was out for parts of two games, quarterback Glenn
Foley spotted the ball for Hall. Hall made only one of five
field-goal attempts with Foley holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got John comfortable in a short time,'' Kidd said. ``The
first day of practice, John kicked 19 of 20, and that gave him
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who kicked the winning field goal in Kansas City last
Sunday as time ran out, said he is feeling pretty good about
himself. Yet his field-goal average is even lower than last year's
so-so mark of 68 percent, and his kickoffs do not go into the end
zone as consistently. He has 12 touchbacks this season, but last
year at the halfway point had 22. Still, he said, ``I don't want to
change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Jets kickoff unit has remained a strength. Glenn
came up with a critical return in the last game when he brought a
kickoff back 62 yards to set up a critical touchdown in the Jets'
victory at Kansas City. And the Jets are the only team in the
league that ranks in the top five both in returning kicks and
halting the opposition's kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with cold weather returning to the region, perhaps Parcells
will be right and the rest of the special teams will find their
stride.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, for one, believes that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens the second half of the season,'' said
Hayes. ``They're going to need us to come up big at some point.''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CHREBET NO SURPRISE TO FORMER HOFSTRA PASSERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he turns on his television Sunday afternoon and sees Vinny
Testaverde drop back to pass against the Buffalo Bills, Carlos
Garay will think, ``Lucky man.'' He knows whom the Jets'
quarterback will have the pleasure of looking for, particularly on
third down-and-trouble. Somewhere in the defensive backfield, he
knows Wayne Chrebet will be waiting for the ball that does not have
to be targeted like a jump shot, or a pitcher's precise delivery,
mound to mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motto was just to put it in an area where he could make a
play,'' said Garay. ``Make it humanly catchable, and he'll catch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Garay threw 21 touchdowns for Hofstra University.
Chrebet caught 16 of them, including 5 in the last game of an 8-1-1
season against Delaware, matching Jerry Rice's collegiate record.
By that time, Garay was telling teammates that this gritty little
receiver who once reminded him of a nerdy film character named
Lucas was good enough to play for the professionals practicing on
their Hemsptead, N.Y. campus. Most responded by wondering, in so
many words, if Garay was making his own plans to visit the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chrebet is an $11 million star, and Garay moonlights in the
spring and summer Arena Football League for the New Jersey Red
Dogs. But he also gets to play Monday morning quarterback with
another former Hofstra quarterback, George Beisel, at their day
job, with RCG Information Technology, a computer firm in f New
Jersey. Beisel was Hofstra's quarterback in Chrebet's sophomore and
junior years. Small world for two guys who benefited from throwing
to an undersized receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, at Hofstra, no one really looked at Wayne as little,
or tiny,'' Beisel said. Unless Chrebet was disappearing from
tackler's view on his way into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   If there is justice in the pump-me-up playground known as the
National Football League, then Chrebet will one day be Doug
Flutie's downfield target in a Pro Bowl. Could happen later this
winter, the way things have been going, but Sunday, it will be
Vinny from Long Island whose standing is enhanced by Chrebet's
knack for catching most balls that are humanly catchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just find guys every day who go after the ball the
way he does,'' said Garay. ``He makes the catch that decides the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Where, for instance, might Testaverde and the Jets have landed
last Sunday in Kansas City had Chrebet failed to hang on to a
late-game ball thrown slightly behind him, to the right sideline,
on third-and-3, with the blitzing Chiefs in Testaverde's face? As
Chrebet turned to locate the ball, it was up on his right shoulder
pad, a typically difficult play compounded by pressure, rain, wind,
and a defender, Mark McMillian, who crunched Chrebet out-of-bounds
a split-second after the ball hit him in the hands.
</P>
<P>
   Those sure hands, merely proportionate to his 5-feet-10-inch
body, held on. From the Chiefs' 30, the Jets went on to drive
closer for the field goal that freed them from the clutches of
mediocrity to a four-way divisional tie for first.
</P>
<P>
   Only a quarterback who has had hands-on experience with Chrebet
can fully appreciate his magnetism, as it relates to the thrown
ball. ``His eyes and concentration are amazing,'' said Garay. ``I
don't remember him dropping anything, not one, unless it was my
fault, a really bad throw.'' Neither could Beisel, for that matter,
and nor could they recall one truly memorable Chrebet catch. There
were just so many; they tended to look alike.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson, now there's a wideout whose receptions are
more of the highlight film, in-full-stride variety. Conversely,
Chrebet looks like one of those guys in Australian Rules Football,
two hands around the ball, diving to the turf, usually past the
third-down marker he is again slipping past with the best of them
this season in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly enough, what Beisel and Garay seem to remember most
about their one-time target are snapshots of the qualities that
make the man. One Saturday night when Beisel was a sophomore and
Chrebet a freshman, they both played in what Beisel believes was
their first game. Beisel was cut and needed stitches. Chrebet wound
up with a concussion. There Beisel sat, in a hospital emergency
room, with this quiet New Jersey kid who kept telling his father
that he was fine, just fine, and would be ready to play again next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Beisel did remember one touchdown pass he
made to Chrebet, though only because Chrebet ``got drilled'' and
went back to the hospital with another concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pointing out that Chrebet is a killer basketball player
who can dunk, Garay's premier college flashback was a forced
scramble, into the secondary when, all of a sudden, Chrebet was in
position to make a key block. ``He absolutely de-cleated this
kid,'' Garay said. ``After all the hits he took, I know he
remembers that one.''
</P>
<P>
   They arrived at Hofstra together, and Garay couldn't help but
like ``this tough little white kid who had to be extraordinary to
be noticed.'' The Bills will notice him, but he will find a way to
get open. Testaverde will throw a ball behind him, but he will
manage to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Chrebet does. He makes big catches and he makes
quarterbacks better. Anyone who has played or practiced at Hofstra
knows that.

ANALYSIS: A MAN OF A THOUSAND IDEAS FALLS PREY TO HIS OWN FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Conn., Ga., Ind., Okla., Texas)  (js) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Ph.D. in history, a futurist and a street
fighter, a careful, sometimes eloquent planner and an impulsive
loudmouth, Newton Leroy Gingrich often seemed to have more ideas,
all at once, than the 49 men who served before him as speaker of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Like his singular boyhood ambition to reach the speaker's chair,
he pursued some ideas for years _ lowering taxes, to name just one.
But others he discarded in minutes, like a short-lived scheme to
give every child in America a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich knew he talked too much. But his ability to curb the
inflammatory language he had used in opposition was fleeting, like
a smoker's New Year's resolve to quit. His most famous gaffe came
when he complained about a bad seat on the Air Force One flight to
Israel for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, in 1995. But even last month he
won no friends when he needed them, by attacking critics of his
latest budget deal as ``perfectionists'' and ``petty dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   A central complaint last week as Republicans plotted against him
_ and as he jumped before being pushed _ was that he gave the party
no focus, no agenda, as he took it into the elections. It was an
odd, though accurate, mark against the man who calculated and
nationalized the 1994 congressional election more skillfully than
anyone ever had before, making a unifying statement of the
``Contract With America,'' with its pledges of less regulation and
lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But that lack of focus dogged his time as speaker. In an
interview in January 1996, after his strategy of forcing a
government shutdown had blown up in his party's face and set
President Clinton on the road to re-election, he conceded he had
tried too much: ``I set out to do a very unusual job, which was
part revolutionary, part national political figure, part speaker,
part intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to be speaker (or the part of the job that
requires leading all of the House and not just one party) because
for years he had also been part, and a very big part indeed,
hatchetman.
</P>
<P>
   He had punctuated his career by attacking Democrats, and a very
rare Republican or two, for alleged corruption. His biggest scalp
of all was that of Jim Wright of Texas, the Democratic speaker of
the House forced to resign in 1989, after an ethics inquiry
engineered by Gingrich found financial irregularities in sales of a
pseudo-book Wright used to get around outside earning limits.
</P>
<P>
   That success left Democrats seething. They paid him back in 1995
and 1996 with an ethics probe of their own, one that ended on Jan.
21, 1997, when the House formally reprimanded him and fined him
$300,000 for using tax-exempt funds to promote Republican goals and
giving the ethics committee untrue information about it. Since
Wright had quit before a verdict, Gingrich was the first speaker to
be punished by the House.
</P>
<P>
   As he clawed his way up the Republican ladder, Gingrich had also
scorned his own party's leaders as too timid. In 1990, he fought
President George Bush's agreement to a budget deal that included
tax increases. In 1992, he announced he would run for Rep. Robert
Michel's job as minority leader two years later. Michel, one of the
last of the oldtime House leaders who could debate an issue in the
morning and golf with the other side in the afternoon, heard it
first from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he ascended to the speaker's chair on Jan. 4, 1995,
the first Republican to sit there since Joseph Martin Jr., 40 years
before, he wanted to be inclusive. He told Republicans ``it was the
liberal wing of the Democratic Party that ended segregation'' and
he called Franklin Delano Roosevelt ``the greatest president of the
20th century.'' And he told Democrats that they should re-examine
their programs' results and ``reach out to the humans and forget
the bureaucracies.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just in his first speech _ though later, at a press
conference, he said Democrats were ``pursuing a fairly stupid
strategy of cheap and nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has always been an eclectic _ some would say, rootless
_ thinker. It often seemed that ideas, like personal attacks, were
just weapons to be used to win political wars. But since he was
fighting a dominant party whose works he could scorn as ``the
welfare state,'' he was often taken, both by liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans, as an arch-conservative.
</P>
<P>
   And that reputation took deeper root after the 1994 Republican
landslide swept some of the most rigid members of the Christian
right into the House.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the one faction that never entertained the right-wing
image of the speaker was the House's dwindling band of moderate
Republicans. They found him more open and often more sympathetic
than his leadership colleagues like Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, the
Texans who serve as majority leader and majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when angry young conservatives and his fellow leaders
mounted a coup against him in the summer of 1997, it was
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, a moderate, who warned Gingrich
of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the coup failed, conservatives like Reps. David
McIntosh of Indiana and Steve Largent of Oklahoma, and outsiders
like the Rev. James Dobson, a religious broadcaster, were ready
with long, sharpened knives on this last Wednesday, after the
election loss of five seats was known.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That may have been inevitable. After 40 years in the House
minority, Republicans lacked experience in compromise _ especially
among themselves. The ideological span from McIntosh to Shays is as
broad as the distance Senate Democrats once found between James
Eastland of Mississippi and Robert Kennedy of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich sought to overcome this by being a strong speaker, in
the mold of a parliamentary leader. He tried to wield more power
than any speaker since Joe Cannon left office in 1911, choosing
committee chairmen himself, as Cannon did.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. politicians are not trained in parliamentary
discipline. The bell tolled ominously for Gingrich's future on
Thursday when Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona said he and six others
would not vote for him as speaker even if their caucus chose him.
Their mutiny would have prevented his election.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Gingrich has sought ways to spread his
ideas. He pioneered the use of congressional television to
broadcast after-hours polemics to a dedicated conservative
audience, and he opened his speaker's press conferences up to
television (before canceling them altogether).
</P>
<P>
   He often railed at reporters for overemphasizing conflict. Last
week, astonishingly, he blamed the press for excessive attention to
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, even though he had helped
organize the impeachment inquiry over the issue. But Washington
reporters often found him unusually attentive listening to their
questions and trying to answer them directly rather than with the
capital's staple of all-purpose soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Catchy phrases have always meant a great deal to him. From
labeling the Democratic Party as ``a coalition of big-city
machines, trial lawyers, left-wing activists and political
incumbents'' to calling the House Bank's rubber checks ``systemic,
institutional corruption'' or comparing Clinton's health care plan
to ``Soviet Communism,'' he was never skilled at understatement.
</P>
<P>
   But there was probably more than hyperbole at work on Friday
night when he told Republicans that he was quitting because, ``I'm
not willing to preside over people who are cannibals.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection was almost surely subconscious, but many who
heard it recalled a May 31, 1989, appeal to the House that ``All of
us in both political parties must resolve to bring the period of
mindless cannibalism to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what Jim Wright said when he resigned as speaker.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 8, moved Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds VENTURA-REVIEW and JEFFERSON-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   The previously budgeted CALIF-GAMBLING-REVIEW is now
GAMBLING-MANIA-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-REVIEW _ After a year of misery and distraction, White
House aides repeated this joke with unabashed, glee given their
surprising good fortune in last Tuesday's elections: ``The Monica
Strategy: It worked.'' The reality is that _ intended or not _ an
election that had been billed as a referendum on Bill Clinton ended
up as much a referendum on the Republican Party. The verdict: A
traditional and pragmatic Republican agenda of fiscal conservatism
is in. A single-minded focus on social issues is out. By Richard L.
Berke. WITH GRAPHIC. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-REVIEW _ After more than two years of hearings into
apartheid-era atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a
3,500-page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to
their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty. So, the
prosecutions should begin soon, right? Not so fast. The five volume
study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela before
talk of new amnesty deals had begun. It seems that virtually all of
South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African
National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock
because of the commission's report. Suddenly, there is lots of talk
about how the country really can not withstand a round of
politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are
betting that an agreement ``of mutual benefit'' is in the offing.
By Suzanne Daley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINANCE-MINISTERS-REVIEW _ This is supposed to be the Age of the
finance minister. In the mythology of the 1990s, they are the
titans of this unnamed era following the Cold War. In many
countries these days, the guardians of the treasury are running the
show. By David E. Sanger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-MANIA-REVIEW _ Gambling is now a national industry
whose explosive growth has made it available everywhere _ on street
corners, on the Internet, and all along the Mississippi River. But
its ubiquity is forcing the industry's impresarios to fret about
the best ways to drum up new business. ``Americans have all the
gambling they want,'' said gambling analyst Eugene Christiansen.
``The driver of growth over the past three decades _ the satiation
of unsatiated demand _ is no longer there.'' By Timothy L.
O'Brien. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-BLACKS-REVIEW _ What a difference a decade makes. In the
late 1980s and early 1990s, Democrats fretted that they had been
soundly thrashed in three successive presidential elections because
the party had become too closely associated with black people, thus
driving away white voters. This year, blacks have became the
Democrats' new best friends. The party spent millions of dollars
advertising on black radio. Congressional candidates were urged by
party leaders to make as many appearances as possible in black
neighborhoods. By Steven A. Holmes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-WORKOUT-REVIEW _ Amid the hundreds of exhibits at the
recent World Gaming Congress and Exposition, no new products better
summed up gambling's place in the American psyche than the ``Pedal
'N Play'' cycle and the ``Money Mill'' treadmill. What better way
to get the heart pounding and the palms perspiring than to wager
money while exercising? The stationary cycle and the treadmill both
have slot machines attached, allowing casino customers to sweat and
bet at the same time, or as they say in gambling parlance, to
``stay in action,'' even while they're working out. By Brett
Pulley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-LAW-REVIEW _ Britain may have passed for the moment on
joining Europe's new currency, the Euro, but this doesn't mean
Brits are immune to the winds of change. Even the Royal Family will
feel the bite of progress this month when the monarchy loses its
centuries-old right to all whale carcasses found on England's
beaches. This little known provision of English law _ which further
stipulates that the head goes to the king and the tail to the queen
_ is but one of hundreds of obscure laws that will become null and
void when parliament passes The Statute Law Repeals Act of 1998, as
it is expected to do in the next few weeks. By David Wallis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANES-REVIEW _ A natural disaster as terrible as Hurricane
Mitch, which killed more than 10,000 people in Central America in
the past two weeks and left nearly a million more homeless, teaches
a lot about the way a society does or does not work. Some
institutions and individuals rise to the occasion; others topple
like palm trees in the wind. But the nations of the region always
seem to respond in ways that illuminate their history and
character. By Larry Rohter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON-REVIEW _ The content of Jefferson's character is
revealed at last, or is it? Excerpts from historians before and
after the recent DNA disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA-REVIEW _ Jesse the Body, Jesse the Mind, Jesse the
Governor. By Pam Belluck.

<P>
   As voters reaffirmed democracy last week, a report was released
that seemed like lab results on a 200-year-old paternity suit
against one of the Founding Fathers. DNA tests matched descendants
of Thomas Jefferson with those of his beautiful slave Sally
Hemings. This turned Jefferson scholarship on its ear; from the
19th century on, most historians insisted that a man of Jefferson's
character could not have had a sexual relationship with Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   The study in the scientific journal Nature by Eugene Foster, a
retired Tufts University pathologist, showed Jefferson fathered
Eston Hemings at 65, an age associated more with retirement from
life than with the creation of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings' descendants had long claimed Jefferson as an
ancestor, and a few books have tried to document the liaison. But
Jeffersonian scholars preferred to discount the claim, specifically
that contained in a memoir by Eston Hemings' brother, Madison. The
scholars relied less on facts than on their understanding of
Jefferson's character. Assessments of his character _ written
before the DNA test _ follow.

Administration of Thomas Jefferson,'' Charles Scribner's Sons,
1889.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the admitted standards of greatness, Jefferson
was a great man. After all deductions on which his enemies might
choose to insist, his character could not be denied elevation,
versatility, breadth, insight and delicacy . . . he fairly reveled
in what he believed to be beautiful, and his writings often
betrayed subtile feeling for artistic form, _ a sure mark of
intellectual sensuousness. He shrank from whatever was rough or
coarse, and his yearning for sympathy was almost feminine.''

Brown and Co., 1970). Malone, who died in 1986, was considered the
Jefferson authority.
</P>
<P>
   (The charges of a sexual relationship with Sally Hemings) ``are
distinctly out of character, being virtually unthinkable in a man
of Jefferson's moral standards and habitual conduct. . . . It is
virtually inconceivable that this fastidious gentleman whose
devotion to his dead wife's memory and to the happiness of his
daughters and grandchildren bordered on the excessive could have
carried on through a period of years a vulgar liaison which his own
family could not have failed to detect.''

</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation,'' (Oxford University
Press, 1970).
</P>
<P>
   `` Unless Jefferson was capable of slipping badly out of
character in hidden moments at Monticello, it is difficult to
imagine him caught up in a miscegenous relationship. Such a mixture
of the races, such a ruthless exploitation of the master-slave
relationship, revolted his whole being. It is of no historical
importance, but the best guess is that Sally's children were
fathered by Peter Carr. '' (Jefferson's nephew)
</P>
<P>
   FAWN M. BRODIE wrote ``Thomas Jefferson, an Intimate History''
(W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.) and famously re-ignited the Jefferson-Hemings
question in 1974, using a Freudian approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the important reasons that Jefferson's true nature has
remained elusive is the insistence of all his previous biographers
that after the death of his wife he never felt any lasting
affection again for any woman. Gilbert Chinard stated the theme in
1928 when he wrote bluntly that though Jefferson corresponded with
many women ``there is no indication that he ever fell in love
again.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   But does a man's sexuality atrophy at 39, especially if he has
already demonstrated that he was capable of very great passion? . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Freud warned long ago (in ``Leonardo da Vinci: A Study in
Psychosexuality''): ``Biographers frequently select the hero as the
object of study because for personal reasons of their own emotional
life, they have a special affection for him from the very outset.
They then devote themselves to a work of idealization.'' . . . This
kind of canonization dominated 19th-century biography, and even
today the Jefferson scholars wary of the impulse to sanctify are
nevertheless often its victim; they glorify and protect by nuance,
by omission, by subtle repudiation, without being in the least
aware of the strength of their internal commitment to canonization.
This we see particularly in their treatment of the story of Sally
Hemings. This liaison, above all others in Jefferson's life, is
unutterably taboo. . . . Black historians, however, have long
accepted the story as accurate, and it is one of the most ironic
aspects of the Jefferson image today that the blacks who repudiate
him as a hero, because of his ambivalence over slavery,
nevertheless believe the historical Jefferson to have been a man of
great sexual vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   GARRY WILLS, in ``Uncle Thomas' Cabin'' (New York Review of
Books, April 18, 1974), attacked Professor Brodie's book. But some
of his statements about Hemings commented indirectly on Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet there is no scrap of evidence for this passion, except
perhaps the fact that he retained Sally at Monticello after stories
about her had been widely circulated. Still, what was he supposed
to do? Kill her? Freeing or selling her would make her more likely
to talk, or to be tricked into talking. It was safer to keep her
nearby. She was apparently pleasing, and obviously discreet. There
was less risk in continuing to enjoy her services than in
experimenting around with others. She was like a healthy and
obliging prostitute.''
</P>
<P>
   JOEL WILLIAMSON, in ``New People: Miscegenation and Mulattoes in
the United States'' (The Free Press, 1980), argued against lumping
Jefferson with other slave owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to a point Jefferson fits neatly the pattern of the widower
as miscegenator exemplified by his father-in-law. One ought not to
be greatly surprised to find that he had a mulatto lover among his
slaves, but if he did, it probably was not Sally. If it was, he
departed the role in two important respects: he did not avow
paternity . . . and he did not seem to maintain the relationship
with the mistress until death did them part.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH J. ELLIS, whose 1997 book, ``American Sphinx: The
Character of Thomas Jefferson'' (Alfred A. Knopf) won the National
Book Award, included the appendix, ``A Note on the Sally Hemings
Scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Hamilton and both Adamses understood about Jefferson, and
what my own immersion in the historical evidence has caused me to
conclude as well, is that for most of his adult life he lacked the
capacity for the direct and physical expression of his sexual
energies. Henry Adams put it most explicitly when he said that
Jefferson's temperament was ``almost feminine.'' When scholarly
defenders like Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson claimed that
Jefferson was ``not the kind of man'' to engage in illicit sex with
an attractive mulatto slave, they were right for reasons that went
deeper than matters of male gallantry and aristocratic honor.
Jefferson consummated his relations with women at a more rarefied
level. . . .
</P>
<P>
   He was, to be sure, capable of living with massive
contradictions, but his psychological dexterity depended upon the
manipulation of interior images and personae; he was not that
adroit at the kind of overt deviousness required to sustain an
allegedly 38-year affair in the very center of his domestic
haven.''
</P>
<P>
   ANNETTE GORDON-REED, a professor at New York Law School, sifted
through the existing evidence and put her findings in ``Thomas
Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy'' (University
Press of Virginia, 1997). She concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to look more closely into the identities of the
parties involved, the too ready acceptance and active promotion of
the Carr brothers story, the reliance upon stereotypes in the place
of investigation and analysis, all indicate that most Jefferson
scholars decided from the outset that this story was not true. . .
. In the most fundamental sense, the enterprise of defense has had
little to do with expanding people's knowledge of Thomas Jefferson
or the other participants in the story. The goal has been quite the
opposite: to restrict knowledge as a way of controlling the
allowable discourse on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Professors Ellis and Gordon-Reed appeared on PBS'
``Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' to discuss the DNA research linking
Hemings' last born to Jefferson. Accompanying the report in Nature
was an article by Ellis and Eric Lander, a geneticist. Asked on the
program if he had a change of heart, Ellis said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a change of heart, but this is really new
evidence. And it _ prior to this evidence, I think it was a very
difficult case to know and circumstantial on both sides, and, in
part, because I got it wrong, I think I want to step forward and
say this new evidence constitutes, well, evidence beyond any
reasonable doubt that Jefferson had a longstanding sexual
relationship with Sally Hemings. Even though the match is only with
one of the Hemings' descendants, Eston Hemings, it's inconceivable
that Jefferson, who was 65 when Eston was born, would have made a
one-night stand here.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Professor Gordon-Reed said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the moral of this story is the thing this shows very
clearly is that we're not two separate people, black and white; we
are a people who share a common culture, a common land, and it
turns out a common blood line, and this is something that we
haven't wanted to deal with openly. And talking about Jefferson,
which people like to do, I think is a good vehicle for exploring
that question.''

<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ In one campaign ad, Jesse Ventura wore only
gym shorts and posed as Rodin's ``The Thinker.'' In another, a
Jesse Ventura action figure battled Evil Special Interest Man.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it worked. Now Jesse (The Body) Ventura, the former pro
wrestler, suburban mayor, movie actor and talk radio shock jock, is
the next governor of Minnesota, having beaten two respected
political players, state Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III
and St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota voters may have thought that a man who could put the
likes of Hulk Hogan in a headlock would be able to bust through
legislative gridlock in a heartbeat. They liked his
straight-talking style, his charisma and his refusal to be
marginalized by the mainstream candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they just have a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's commercials were surely the oddest and funniest in a
campaign season better known for snarling attack ads. One Ventura
spot features a young boy confronting a slick lobbyist with a Jesse
action toy. The boy deepens his voice and announces, ``I don't want
your stupid money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rodin commercial is almost silly: With a soprano warbling an
aria in the background, Ventura's near-naked body is explored from
nearly every angle by the camera. Jesse the Sensitive Sphinx.
</P>
<P>
   Then he winks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the White House has taken notice of Ventura's
political magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you're going to have a lot of politicians
spending time in the gyms now,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And White House chief of staff John Podesta had this to say:
``I've decided to change my nickname from Skippy to John (The Body)
Podesta.''
</P>
<P>
   That should be fine because Ventura now wants to be known as The
Mind.

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ A natural disaster as terrible as Hurricane
Mitch, which killed more than 10,000 people in Central America in
the past two weeks and left nearly 1 million more homeless, teaches
a lot about the way a society does or does not work. Some
institutions and individuals rise to the occasion; others topple
like palm trees in the wind. But the nations of the region always
seem to respond in ways that illuminate their history and
character.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua, for instance, is still grappling with many of the
same problems it could not resolve in the 1980s, when the
Sandinista National Liberation Front was trying to fend off
U.S.-backed Contra rebels in a bloody civil war. In that polarized
political climate, the relief effort here last week was hampered by
petty partisan squabbling; the conservative government and the
Sandinistas, who are now in opposition, even disagreed over whether
it would be more appropriate to declare a ``national disaster'' or
a ``state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   As people in Posoltega, where more than 1,500 people died in
mudslides, waited for help alongside other devastated towns, the
two camps jockeyed for control of the distribution of food and
medicine _ and the political benefits to come with that.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the week, with popular discontent rising, the damage
caused by the partisanship seemed to impress even some politicians.
President Arnoldo Aleman said he would cede the supervision of
relief activities to the Roman Catholic Church, while Gen. Joaquin
Cuadra, the Sandinista who commands the armed forces, belatedly
called for national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent storm, Hurricane Georges, provided insights that
are at least as striking in September. Faced with the threat of
135-mile-per-hour winds, three Caribbean island societies that have
adopted radically different social and political models, even
though they were all once Spanish colonies, responded in
conspicuously different ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, a U.S. possession, the government leaped into
action as soon as the first hurricane watch was issued. Television
stations repeatedly broadcast warnings to stay indoors and put up
hurricane shutters, provided advice on stockpiling food and water
and showed footage of past storms to remind the island's 3.5
million residents of what they might face. As soon as Georges
passed, utility repair crews were out restoring service and federal
Emergency Management Agency teams were preparing reports and
sending money.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in the Dominican Republic, disorganization was the
watchword. Newspapers there have complained that the civil defense
chief, Elpidio Baez, failed to issue storm warnings because he did
not want to alarm people. He denies that, but television and radio
stations continued to broadcast soap operas and merengue
competitions until just before the storm struck. Some people who
went to hurricane shelters found them closed and were turned away
by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There are even reports that officials opened a dam on the verge
of buckling without advising residents living downstream, some of
whom later drowned. The government denies those accounts, but an
official of the U.S. Agency for International Development said it
was clear that overall, ``when the thing hit, they were totally
unprepared to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane then moved on to Cuba, which, true to form for a
militarized totalitarian state, responded as if the storm were an
enemy to be vanquished. President Fidel Castro instructed residents
of affected zones to evacuate, an order that was enforced by the
military and local security watchdogs and may have saved many
lives. Afterward, the Communist Party newspaper Granma praised
Cubans for their ``revolutionary discipline'' and successful
``combat'' against Georges, whose ``destructive force'' amounted to
``a kind of invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Caribbean basin, though, there is also a common
thread. Just as it seems that hurricanes striking the United States
inevitably gravitate toward trailer parks, here the poorest are
also the most vulnerable and seem to suffer the most, regardless of
who governs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived through earthquakes, a pair of civil wars,
volcanic eruptions, tidal waves and now this, all in the last 25
years,'' said Maria Lourdes Rodriguez, a peasant who lives north of
here. ``When is God going to take pity on us?''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a year of misery and distraction, White House
aides repeated this joke with unabashed glee, given their
surprising good fortune in last Tuesday's elections: ``The Monica
Strategy: It worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that _ intended or not _ an election that had
been billed as a referendum on Bill Clinton ended up as much a
referendum on the Republican Party. The verdict: A traditional and
pragmatic Republican agenda of fiscal conservatism is in. A
single-minded focus on social issues is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very bad day for the ideological, litmus-test
Republicans,'' said Kenneth Duberstein, a chief of staff for
President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most conservative candidates had already been
knocked off in primaries, and there were more casualties Tuesday:
Alabama Gov. Fob James, a champion of fundamentalists who had
pressed for posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms; and Sen.
Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., a favorite of the Christian Coalition.
Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis., who repeatedly invoked his support for
banning late-term abortions, lost his bid for the Senate. Jim Ross
Lightfoot, who in a television blitz blasted his opponent for
favoring nude dancing, lost what had been considered an easy
election for governor of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that was a high priority for religious conservatives,
Tom Bordonaro, described by former President Gerald R. Ford as
``one of those extreme right-wing'' candidates, lost his drive to
oust Rep. Lois Capps of California.
</P>
<P>
   And the retiring California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, said
he was convinced his party's candidate, Dan Lungren, fell to
Democratic nominee Gray Davis in part because Lungren opposed
abortion rights. ``He was attacked by Davis relentlessly in
television ads,'' Wilson said. ``It was practically a mantra.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more bad news in ballot initiatives: Nineteen
statewide referenda asked voters to choose between generally
liberal and generally conservative positions on taxation and social
issues like abortion, affirmative action, gambling and gun control;
voters picked the more liberal side in 14.
</P>
<P>
   And in a New York Times/CBS News Poll a month before the
election, most Republicans (including many self-described
conservatives) said they wanted the new Congress to tackle problems
like education before matters like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans of the late '90s are the mirror image of the
Democrats of the late '80s,'' said Al From, president of the
Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group founded in 1985 to
try to marginalize, if not kill off, the left wing of the party _
unions, minority caucuses and gay rights advocates _ that had
become its political base. ``We drove off the left side of the road
in the '80s and they're driving off the right side of the road. The
party that stays in the middle dominates American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is even a Republican Leadership Council, founded early
last year to do for Republicans what From's group did for
Democrats. And Mark Miller, the Republican group's executive
director, is singing From's tune. ``The Democrats got to a point
where they finally thought that the fringe of their party was in
the driver's seat and it was driving them off the cliff,'' he said.
``And we may be at that point in our party.''
</P>
<P>
   But identifying the problem is far easier than fixing it. The
predicament for Republicans is that the party's supposed millstone
_ social and religious conservatives _ is also one of its greatest
strengths. These voters are among the most active and involved in
state party organizations, and their support is essential for
Republicans who want to win their party's Presidential nomination.
Republicans have run up against the old adage: There is no such
thing as a raging moderate. The point is that it is harder to
motivate people from the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the matter further, many Republicans contend that
the party's problem is that it has not been conservative enough.
Newt Gingrich's stunning decision Friday to step down as speaker of
the House came after his fellow Republicans blamed him for the
showing Tuesday. They believe that, if anything, he has been too
cozy with moderates.
</P>
<P>
   And the parallel with the Democrats is not entirely apt. The
Democratic left gradually took over a party in power, leaving a
potent, if often frustrated, moderate group in state houses (like
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton) and in Congress. Republicans, by
contrast, gained power from the ideological right, first in the
White House with Reagan, then in Congress through Gingrich.
Moderates were few, and they were harshly pushed aside, so there is
much less on which to build.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy for Republicans might be, of all things, for them to
find a leader like Clinton (a former head of the Democratic
Leadership Council) who can disentangle the party from the demands
of its conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, at least, those who have tried to move toward the
center have found it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves, for one, had a scare last August when
David Miller stepped down as chairman of the state Republican Party
and tried to oust him in a primary, accusing him of not being
conservative enough. ``I'm not tooting my own horn,'' the governor
said. ``But we pulled in 73 percent in the primary and got 73
percent in the general election. You have to ask yourself: What was
the state party chairman thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Graves asks: ``How badly do we want to win the presidency?
And are we willing to nominate a more centrist candidate who can
win? Or is our goal to martyr our party over some principles that a
good portion of our party may not believe in?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet conservative leaders argue that the election was not a
repudiation of their agenda. They blame the losses on the lack of
an issue-based Republican message and a preoccupation with the
Clinton scandal. Family Research Council president Gary Bauer said
the party not only surrendered economic issues to Democrats but
``seemed to cave in on social issues and values issues, and the
sanctity of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans contend that voters do not mind conservatism,
and some moderate voters can tolerate candidates who oppose
abortion. But they are put off by politicians who appear to be
trying to impose a moral agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And part of the difficulty in the campaign this year may not
have been that the Republicans lacked issues to talk about, but
that in their zeal to focus on scandal they allowed Democrats to
define them as extremists.
</P>
<P>
   That is why many party leaders are citing as an example the
brothers Bush: Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who easily won
re-election, and his brother, Jeb, who was elected governor of
Florida. Both oppose abortion, for example, but they couch their
conservative stands in ways that do not threaten those who are not
hard-core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a longtime friend of the Texas
governor, said they chatted the day after the election about the
need for leadership modeled after the optimistic approach of
Reagan. ``George Bush could hardly be called a liberal or a
moderate _ he's a conservative,'' Dreier said. ``Yet he does so in
such an upbeat, positive, happy way. That's really what I see as
necessary for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was showered with balloons and confetti last week, Gov.
Bush, who did strikingly well with blacks, women and Hispanic
voters, sounded what could be a theme for a presidential quest:
``Tonight's resounding victory says a leader who is compassionate
and conservative can erase the gender gap and open the doors of the
Republican Party to new faces, new voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is far from the only Republican who thinks he or she can
run for national office by widening the appeal beyond social
conservatives. After a failed run for the Republican nomination in
1996, Wilson, who supports abortion rights, said the outcome
Tuesday made him even more tempted to try again. ``The results
indicated that people who have pretty much my views and record did
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the party to recover, the feuding factions may not have to
compromise. But they will have to learn to coexist _ perhaps even
with Democrats _ something that is anathema to many.
</P>
<P>
   There is one great incentive. ``A near-death experience,''
Duberstein said, ``has the tendency to focus the mind.''

   MAGNITOGORSK, Russia _ Ten years ago, when economic reform began
its uneven march through Russia's industrial heartland, the most
visible landmark in this steel town was a deadly multicolored plume
that hung over the vast Magnitogorsk Metal Works.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on a misty autumn morning, the sky is still, a welcome
breath of fresh air for the scarred lungs of the 430,000 people who
live here on the banks of the Ural River.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the changes that have swept Russia under the
banner of free-market reform. Directors of the mill, now
privatized, have done what Moscow's all-powerful central planners
refused to let them do: They have spent their own profits to
replace 11 of the mill's 35 aged and filthy open-hearth furnaces
that heat iron into steel with two cleaner oxygen furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason for the clear skies, one that
illustrates why so many Russians have come to associate economic
reform with economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Today Magnitogorsk _ once the largest mill in the former Soviet
Union _ is producing less than half the raw steel it did a decade
ago, with about the same work force. It is a story repeated across
Russia, whose gross national product has slumped 42.5 percent since
1989, the most abrupt decline in any major industrial country since
the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   And new clouds loom on the horizon. The Magnitogorsk Metal Works
is bracing for a blow that could shut off its sales to the United
States, where it now sells 49 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. steel producers, who say they are being undercut by imports
from Russia, Japan and Brazil, have brought a trade case accusing
the foreign competitors of ``dumping'' _ or unfairly selling steel
in the United States for less than it costs them to produce it. A
preliminary ruling is expected in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As winter approaches, workers here are collecting only half
their wages in cash, with the rest provided as credit at stores
owned by the mill. And there are fears that this crisis, more than
others before it, will hit home _ hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose our exports,'' said Anatoly Tamchuck, deputy
chairman of the local Mining and Metallurgical Union, ``the drop in
production will be about 50 percent, and layoffs could be about the
same. This is the most frightening thing. Since Soviet times, we
never have had mass unemployment. This is a new situation. The
steel mill is the main enterprise in the city. There is no other
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all Russia's problems, the most vexing lie in its Rust Belt,
an interlocking series of industrial giants now living off barter
and choking on bloated work forces. Many of the industries are
pillars of communities that have no other reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Devalued Cash, Vanishing Assets
</P>
<P>
   Solving these problems without causing social upheaval will be a
key test for Russia's new government, headed by Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and staffed with old-style Soviet ministers who
have pointedly set out to rescue Russian industry _ or, as they put
it, the ``real'' economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the communist era, Russia's heavy industry was
already heading for a slump. But many fault President Boris
Yeltsin's team of young free-market reformers for failing to
anticipate the economic disarray _ and corruption _ that followed
their lifting of state controls.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, the bottom has fallen out of
Magnitogorsk's domestic market. Steel consumption in Russia, once
one of the highest in the world at 970 pounds per capita annually,
has dropped to less than 265. Russian factories that buy steel _
makers of tractors, tanks, railroad ties, ships and industrial
machinery _ have verged on bankruptcy, struggling to sell what
Russians either do not want or cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say that the real problems in Russia's
once-formidable metals industry run deep in a Soviet-era mentality
that continues to regard steel production in terms of targets
rather than markets, that views outsiders with suspicion and that
shares information reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian steel mills on the whole haven't managed to make the
final leap,'' observed James May, the Russia specialist at the
London-based Metal Bulletin, a trade newspaper. ``They haven't
grasped the fact that just producing for the Motherland is not
enough. They have to look at their markets, at their costs. Mainly,
there is a failure to grasp the bull by the horns, and come to
terms with the fact that they are going to have to sack a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Magnitogorsk was banking on the first
hints of an industrial upturn. Then came the devaluation of the
ruble in August and a simultaneous freeze on Russia's foreign and
domestic borrowing. In one day, Magnitogorsk's bank accounts were
blocked, foreign banks refused to finance steel exports and raw
materials dwindled to dangerously low levels.
</P>
<P>
   After the August crisis opened a sudden $50 million hole in the
factory's cash flow, it took the next obvious step _ one used
across Russia to forestall layoffs. It delayed paying wages to its
55,000 employees, offering them instead plastic cards to buy goods
at company-owned stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like credit cards, but without any money behind
them,'' said Mikhail Buryakov, head of the mill's finance and
economics department. He said the factory _ which depends on barter
for 40 percent of its domestic transactions _ had found ways to
quadruple its stock of goods, from food to boots, in factory-owned
stores. ``But that is the state we find ourselves in,'' he said.

BACK YARD BECOMES HOMAGE TO COWBOY CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- It's 11:45 a.m. on a weekday morning and
the phone rings at Robert Cirillo's house, right in the midde of a
``Gunsmoke'' rerun.
</P>
<P>
   He answers, though, because as much as he likes watching western
classics, he can pretty much live the experience any time he steps
out the sliding door into his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much like a museum,'' Cirillo said. ``It's like
something out of `Gunsmoke,' waiting for Matt Dillon to come around
the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Robert and Georgie Cirillo's home is like other
ranch houses on their Simi Valley street, in a modest neighborhood
where residents decorate their front yards with whirligigs and
colorful nylon banners.
</P>
<P>
   But Cirillo has transformed his back yard into a haven for
old-time cowboys and their friends -- a western town with a
blacksmith shop, a Pony Express and marshal's office, and even a
working saloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I saw every cowboy picture there was; every
cowboy was my favorite,'' Cirillo said. ``My life is in that back
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   He became fascinated with all things western while watching
cowboy flicks as a boy in Massachusetts in the 1940s and '50s. But
he kept going back long after most of his buddies had ridden off
into the sunset to new pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've belonged to western groups all my life,'' said Cirillo, a
member of the local organization trying to restore the former
Corriganville movie ranch in suburban Simi Valley, 35 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. ``I always played cowboys all of
my life. I never grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he and Georgie married eight years ago, Robert
began transforming their house into the kind of place he had always
wanted to call home. The Purgatory Saloon went up first, a
stand-alone structure that might hold lawn mowers or tools in
anyone else's back yard, but here has bar stools and antique
bottles and signs.
</P>
<P>
   A Pony Express occupies another tiny building, while the
marshal's office and a hotel are just a facade that form the back
wall of the house. The train depot may one day have a section of a
caboose placed out front to make it look even more real.
</P>
<P>
   With the precision of a fine craftsman and the flair of a man
who knows his subject, Cirillo has crafted a world that looks like
it came straight out of Dodge City. He figures he has spent about
$6,000 fixing up the place, not counting his labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to build a mine over there. Haven't gotten around
to that,'' said Cirillo, a retired landscaper who began decorating
the back yard in 1991. ``A little at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgie Cirillo is proud of her husband, whose handiwork has
transformed the place in ways she never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all his doing,'' said Georgie, who works as a medical
claims adjuster. ``I think his talent should be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she never realized how the project was growing.``At one
point I thought, `I can't keep doing this,' '' Georgie said.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Robert built, the more Georgie liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a little more time at home this way,'' she said.
``It's just so comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, ``I do like to get dressed up in my
saloon-girl outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, family and friends often get into the spirit, dressing
in period garb, stopping in for a drink at the Purgatory Saloon or
meandering along the storefronts of the western town. Occasionally,
they'll even stage a gunfight.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing rowdy, said Robert, who fended off an initial
complaint from a neighbor curious about his building spree, and now
says he has no problems with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't kids. We don't make a lot of noise. We're all in our
40s and 50s,'' said the grandfather of six.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's always work to do -- swap meets to scour for
more lanterns, lariats, spurs and saddles to decorate the place --
and plans for additions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upkeep is tremendous,'' said Robert, who compares the
place to a sports bar where men can kick back, sip a few brews and
relax -- except it's for cowboys. ``I was never into sports. I
really didn't care for it as much as twirling my guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the made-for-Hollywood look of the place and Robert's
mental encylopedia of everything western -- including trivia about
Hopalong Cassidy ad Clint Eastwood -- he has ventured little into
show business.
</P>
<P>
   He invites his friends over to enjoy the place and sometimes
gives away the decorative picture frames he crafts from castoff
wood, but otherwise he capitalizes little on his western talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of bashful,'' said Robert, who said he could maybe
imagine a brief stint working as an extra in a western film. ``I
could get lost in a crowd probably and be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, his skills and the town he built are for him and his
friends. It's hard to imagine it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just enjoy it myself,'' he said. ``Wouldn't you like to have
a yard like this?''

 MAGNITOGORSK, Russia: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That the steel mill and the city have held together is the
result of an eerie state of suspended animation, halfway between
communism and capitalism, that has been characteristic of the seven
years of Russian reform.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the privatization process began here in 1992, the
mill remains in the hands of directors born and brought up in its
shadow and educated mostly at the local mining institute. The
government holds a 23 percent stake in the factory, a testament to
Magnitogorsk's special place in Russia's industrial galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Company Town With a `Steel Heart'
</P>
<P>
   But ownership is still a novel notion, and _ as elsewhere in
Russia _ has come with a fair share of scandal. Last year 30
percent of Magnitogorsk's shares disappeared when the director of a
local holding company secretly tried to unload them through sales
that have since been declared illegal. Those shares have been
recovered and are soon to be pledged as collateral against a $95
million credit from the European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development.
</P>
<P>
   A Western steel trader tells of a visit to Magnitogorsk a few
years ago when he asked a midlevel manager who now owned the
metalworks. After a long conversation with a colleague, the manager
came back with the memorable reply: ``First, we think that is a
strange question. And to answer it, we don't know and we don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   By various accounts, not all of Magnitogorsk's profits, earned
in the export boom of the early 1990s, were plowed back into the
steel mill. An untold share was siphoned into offshore trading
companies, split between unscrupulous managers and their shady
Western trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factory was set free to export,'' said a former deputy
director who left in 1993, ``and everyone in management understood
that in their own way.'' The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But changes have taken place. During the export boom, when
Russian steel was selling at world prices and costs were
artificially low, Magnitogorsk sank almost $1 billion into new
equipment, including a new hot-rolling mill. Even now, Magnitogorsk
is seeking government-backed credits for another $1 billion
investment, this time in a cold-rolling mill for another stage in
the finishing process.
</P>
<P>
   Magnitka _ the nickname for both the town and the factory,
intertwined since their birth in 1929 _ is a company town. The
factory employs almost half of the work force and pays 40 percent
of the city's taxes _ if delivery of raw steel, in lieu of cash,
can be called revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Very little happens here that is not connected with the
``kombinat,'' as the mill is called. In addition to steel, it
produces furniture, cement, bread, meat and other unrelated
products. Its electric generators _ including one still operating
with boilers from the 1930s _ provide the city with light.
</P>
<P>
   All this has lent a certain feudal stability to life here, with
the mill's general director playing the role of local baron.
Workers, lining up outside the factory gates to pick up their
delayed July paychecks on a gray October day, were both bitter and
grateful. ``At least work here is guaranteed,'' said Tatyana
Konopolova, a clerk. ``I see no danger of losing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 the mill employed 65,000 people, which even then was
considered far too many by industry experts. Today, thanks to
retirements and other forms of attrition, the number is about
55,000 _ of whom half make steel.
</P>
<P>
   Such a work force, even sprinkled through the metalworks' array
of daughter companies, flies in the face of economic common sense.
But to the directors there is simply no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would people go?'' said Sergei Nosov, grandson of the
factory's famous World War II director, and now director of its
capital construction department. ``There would be a huge social
explosion, and that is something everyone is afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven years since the collapse of communism have not been
easy, but most people will admit that life has improved. They still
remember meat and butter rationing a decade ago, and the hours they
spent standing in line on cold winter mornings, waiting to buy
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stores are full of goods, even if the prices are high _
particularly after the ruble's collapse on Aug. 17. Private
restaurants and cafes, even a Baskin-Robbins ice-cream store, have
opened. People travel abroad, and the town is relatively well kept.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly salaries at the mill average 2,000 rubles, worth about
$300 last summer and about $120 today. By Russian standards, that
is good pay, certainly better than the 800-ruble average salary of
doctors at the city's hospitals, which are now struggling to afford
imported medicines.
</P>
<P>
   An Isolation Not So Splendid
</P>
<P>
   But Magnitogorsk _ for decades virtually closed to foreign
travelers _ is paying the price for its links to the global
economy. First Europe stemmed the flow by imposing quotas. Next
came the economic crisis in Asia, where until last year
Magnitogorsk sold 43 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russian producers turned to the United States. If it, too,
closes its doors, Magnitogorsk will have to cut production _ again.
</P>
<P>
   This cuts deep into the legend of Magnitogorsk, which has been
glorified in Soviet art as Russia's ``steel heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning there was logic to Stalin's decision to raise a
steel mill on the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains, 800 miles
from Moscow and 1,200 miles from the nearest port, but next to an
outcrop of iron ore that continued to supply the plant until the
1970s. In World War II the factory, safely situated hundreds of
miles from advancing German troops, cranked up production to
provide steel for half of the Red Army's tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But today isolation is a handicap. The mill's two main domestic
competitors are in western Russia, closer to export markets and raw
materials. In these hard times, transportation has become one of
Magnitogorsk's many nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is product quality. Throughout the communist
period, Magnitogorsk fulfilled orders from Gosplan, the state
planning agency, which emphasized quantity. Magnitogorsk's
cold-rolled steel, even now, is not good enough for the Russian
automobile industry, because its surfaces cannot hold paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet command economy also left Magnitogorsk at the mercy
of monopolist suppliers. Seventy percent of the iron-ore pellets it
uses still come from a plant 200 miles over the border, in
Kazakhstan, now an independent country _ which accepts payment in
dollars, not rubles.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the Primakov government will grant
Magnitogorsk a new flow of money, or forgive its old debts.
``Credits would be good for the factory, and the city,'' said
Georgi Tikhonov, editor of Magnitogorsk Worker. ``Whether it is
good for the national economy is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Buryakov, the financial director, is concerned, the
government owes the Magnitogorsk mill for the damage it caused on
Aug. 17. ``It is our government that created a situation in which
we have to live on credit from each other,'' he said. ``They should
be the ones giving us credits. I don't know what they will do, but
my impression is that this government will take any steps to avoid
any sudden unrest.''

DREAMWORKS FACES FIGHT OVER NAME FROM TINY PRODUCTION COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- DreamWorks: A billion-dollar studio owned by
three entertainment giants who produce Oscar-caliber films such as
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamwerks: A low-budget company run by two Florida men who
create conventions and dinner-theater productions starring obscure
``Star Trek'' actors.
</P>
<P>
   If the smaller company has its way in a coming trademark
infringement trial, Hollywood's first new studio since the 1930s
may end up with a court order forcing it to choose a new name.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamwerks, which claims its name was registered years before
DreamWorks SKG was formed, is seeking $25 million in damages and a
ruling that says the company owned by Steven Spielberg, David
Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg must hand over its stationery and
letterhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My client) has been doing this for 12 years. It's been a
passion and love of his,'' said Dreamwerks lawyer Surjit Soni.
``The fact that you don't succeed doesn't allow someone else to
come in and steal your name.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dreamwerks is no DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   While the latter is producing the world's hottest movies, TV
shows and music acts, the former is producing entertainment like
``The Boys in Autumn'' -- a play starring Walter Koenig (Chekov)
and Mark Lenard (Spock's father), which premiered at the Sheraton
Hotel near Chicago O'Hare Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamwerks case, filed in 1995, was thrown out a year later
by a Los Angeles judge, who ruled that the companies were far too
different in size and scope to be mistaken for each other.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, a panel of appeals court judges disagreed,
returning with a ruling that resurrected the case, and at times
criticizing the larger company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dispute could have been avoided had DreamWorks been more
careful, or a tad more creative, in choosing its name,'' U.S.
Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski wrote.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks lawyers were aware of Dreamwerks before the studio
settled on a name, but apparently disregarded the smaller company
as too obscure, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition taken two years ago, Katzenberg said, ``I
convinced reporters to hold their stories'' about DreamWorks
because he feared a gold-digger would find out and register the
name first, taking it hostage for a big payoff.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the producer's plan had been thwarted years earlier
-- Dreamwerks was granted the trademark in October 1992, after
being in business since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamwerks President Jonathan Harris said he found out about the
new studio's name Jan. 13, 1995 -- the day Katzenberg, Spielberg
and Geffen took out full-page ads in Daily Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter to announce the moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I was shocked and upset would be a great
understatement,'' Harris said in a court declaration.
</P>
<P>
   A DreamWorks spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In court records, DreamWorks lawyers have compared Harris'
lawsuit to ``a shot at the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their claim that there is no likelihood of confusion
between the two companies, they took a nationwide poll of ``Star
Trek'' aficionados, finding only 1 percent of the 596 surveyed had
heard of the smaller company.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks claims in court records that the smaller company is a
money-losing operation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Byrne agreed with DreamWorks when he
threw the case out. But the appeals panel had a different take,
filling its ruling with homages to the late-'60s TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreamwerks targets Trekkies; DreamWorks targets everyone. But
the relatedness of each company's prime directive isn't relevant,''
Kozinski wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the judge said, the court must decide whether the public
is likely to mistake the convention company for the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Soni answered Kozinski's question with a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said Harris and his wife have had ``more and more
trouble'' getting celebrities involved in their conventions because
of the name confusion, which now also centers on the TV shows
``Hercules'' and ``Xena, Warrior Princess.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers just assume DreamWorks got the name first,
and fear legal retribution from the larger company, Soni said.
</P>
<P>
   Trial in the matter was scheduled for January, but Soni said the
proceeding has been postponed until later in the year. Before then,
DreamWorks will take another shot at getting the lawsuit thrown out
of court.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to trial, Dreamwerks will ask for a court
ruling that literally orders DreamWorks to give up its name, along
with every scrap of paper containing the company logo.
</P>
<P>
   But if it comes to that, Soni said his clients would rather sell
their name for a fair price, not force the larger company to pick a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is for sale,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of
price.''

   BRAYE-EN-LAONNOIS, France _ Georges Lievin, 57, was not even
alive when World War I, the Great War, ended 80 years ago this
month, but he, too, became its victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991,'' he said, ``in one of the fields around here, I
found one of the artillery shells the Germans used to fire messages
between battlefields.'' He was taking a couple of visitors on a
tour of the overgrown ruins of Fort Malmaison, held by the German
invaders from September 1914 to October 1917 against countless
French attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, who spent years disabling mines in this area, had
told me that the Germans never boobytrapped message shells,'' said
Lievin, who is retired from the French army. ``This one went off
while I was cleaning it at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, three-quarters of a century after the war, cost
him an arm and most of a leg, but if anything it only heightened
his interest in the great conflict that still scars the placid
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trees on wooded hills run the outlines of
artillery-shell craters and trench lines, incisions left by the
biggest organized slaughter in human history up to that time. Even
today, not only ammunition but dog tags, bones and occasionally
more complete remains of fallen soldiers come to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer the war will remain vivid in collective
consciousness is more of a question as Nov. 11, the 80th
anniversary of the armistice, approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to come to France to commemorate it, both President
Clinton and Germany's newly elected chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
said no.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II of Britain will lay a wreath on the tomb of
the unknown French soldier who is buried at the foot of the Arc de
Triomphe in Paris, on Nov. 11 at 11 a.m., the hour the armistice
was signed, and then dedicate a statue to Winston Churchill, the
British prime minister during the Second World War, which was
spawned by the first.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, she will visit, at Ypres in Belgium, one of the
great World War I battlefields that claimed an entire British
generation of boys and men.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, unlike his two immediate predecessors,
will not lay a wreath at the grave of the greatest French hero of
the war, Marshal Philippe Petain. The marshal blackened his
reputation as head of the Vichy regime, which collaborated with
Nazi Germany after France's defeat in 1940, as Hitler took revenge
for the humiliation he felt the Allies had inflicted on the Germans
after the World War I armistice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most veterans of the first war are dead. The few still
alive are or soon will be centenarians, men like Charles Fackler,
98, of Wescoville, Pa., who survived a bullet to the stomach and an
attack of German phosgene and chlorine gas with the U.S. National
Guard 28th Division in the Argonne Forest in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been back to France since,'' Fackler said over the
telephone from the nursing home where he lives. ``I remember
getting shot, and then the gas came and I couldn't get up, but I
survived.''
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Army records, 52,947 Americans were killed.
Even more U.S. troops died of influenza and other diseases during a
war that killed at least 1.8 million German soldiers, 1.7 million
Russian, almost 1.3 million Austro-Hungarian, 1.4 million French
and nearly three-quarters of a million British troops, along with
millions of civilians and troops of other nations on the Eastern
front from the Middle East through Turkey, Crimea, the Balkans and
the Baltics.
</P>
<P>
   The war shaped the world, and the century, sweeping away the
Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires and unleashing forces
of nationalism that still grip the Balkans today.
</P>
<P>
   It was near here, on this tiny part of the Western front, that
the United States, roused out of isolationism by President Woodrow
Wilson, played the crucial role at the end. The French and, to the
north, their British and Belgian allies had fought the German
invaders to a standstill in 1914 but then bogged down in years of
trench warfare. Gen. John Pershing, the American commander, was
determined that his troops would end the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   A French attempt in 1917 to break through the German lines at
Craonne along a road called the Chemin des Dames had failed in
horrific slaughter, and thousands of French soldiers mutinied. The
following spring, the Germans swept past them in a vast advance
that seemed to threaten Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the United States had entered the war, eventually
building a force of more than a million, which tipped the balance
in favor of the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   Together they pushed the Germans back in a series of great
offensives from the Somme Valley to the Argonne Forest in the late
summer and fall of 1918, and the exhausted Germans sued for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing decades, many people in Braye-en-Laonnois _ a
town of 192 people on the edges of the Champagne countryside
northeast of Paris _ forgot that Americans had ever been here. Then
Lievin and other World War I buffs started digging near underground
limestone quarries that honeycomb the area.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was evidence left by soldiers of three nations
who had used the subterranean labyrinth and fought one another in
it for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy going down the ladder,'' warned Gilles Chauwin, one of
the members of the Association du Chemin des Dames who recently got
French authorities to declare the caves a national historical
monument. The group had been seeking to keep souvenir hunters from
making off with the evocative graffiti that the soldiers carved
into the limestone or drew on it.
</P>
<P>
   Turning a flashlight onto one cave wall, Chauwin revealed a
German inscription carved in July 1915 by W. Schmitz of the 9th
Company, 161st Infantry Regiment. Next to it, Pierre Theoleyre of
the 72nd French Infantry Regiment carved his own name two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Farther on, barbed wire marks the subterranean front line, and
the cave ceiling is pocked with shrapnel from grenades. ``God
punish the K,'' an inscription in German reads over a depiction of
the Kaiser as a pig in a spiked helmet _ whether drawn by a
desperate German soldier or one of his French enemies, it is
impossible to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1,000 graffiti in these caves, and 600 of them were
American ones,'' Lievin said, laughing. ``The Americans sure had a
lot to say.''
</P>
<P>
   American soldiers left whole galleries of the cave marked with
their names; insignia of the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Ancient
Order of Hibernians; depictions of the American flag; portraits of
American Indians in feathered headdress, and the seals of their
home states.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers here were all in the 26th National Guard, or
``Yankee'' Division, while it was training with French units in (or
under) the field in February and March 1918. M.J. Maloney of 35
Wave Ave., Wakefield, Mass., and Sgt. Flagg of 66 Edgewood St.,
Worcester, Mass., were among the many who carved their names into
the stone.
</P>
<P>
   So did Cpl. Earle W. Madeley of the 102nd U.S. Infantry
Regiment, 20 years old when he signed his name here in March 1918,
just before the German offensive that drove the Allies out that
spring.
</P>
<P>
   From July to October his division took 5,000 casualties in
fighting that won the area back, and he was one. ``Madeley never
made it home,'' Chauwin said. ``He's listed among the Yankee
Division's dead.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   American dead from both World Wars are remembered in 21
cemeteries of the American Battle Monuments Commission that are
located from England to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the American World War I cemeteries are dwindling,
said Brig. Gen. James Dickey, the retired American officer in
charge of them.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sept. 26, however, a delegation led by Secretary of the
Army Togo West Jr. did visit the cemetery at
Romagne-sous-Montfaucon, 26 miles northwest of Verdun, to pay
homage to the 15,686 soldiers buried or listed as missing there,
all people who died retaking the area in the final 47-day U.S.
offensive in the Meuse-Argonne region in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Cpl. Freddie Stowers of South Carolina, a member
of the all-black 93rd Division who was awarded the Congressional
Medal of Honor for giving his life during an attack on a German
machine-gun nest on Sept. 28, 1918. But that did not happen until
73 years later, in 1991, when the Army reviewed the service records
of black soldiers and concluded that he had been overlooked because
of his race.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing called the Meuse-Argonne offensive ``one of the
greatest achievements in the history of American arms.'' Had he had
his way, the Allies would not have stopped on Nov. 11 but would
have pursued the Germans across the border until their
unconditional surrender. Would that have merely prolonged the first
war, or avoided the second?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' said Marc Bourdin, a member of the Chemin des
Dames association. ``The important thing is to make sure younger
generations from all our countries never forget what happened here,
and make sure it never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment harks right back to those of the French mutineers
of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   (They remained dishonored until last Thursday, when Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin visited Craonne, on the Chemin des Dames,
and formally rehabilitated them. A day later President Jacques
Chirac called the action ``inopportune.'')
</P>
<P>
   A protest sung by soldiers on the Chemin des Dames so irritated
French military commanders that they offered exemption from all
military duty to anyone who would denounce its author. He was never
found, but in 1919, a communist author, Paul Vaillant-Couturier,
published the poignant text:
</P>
<P>
   It's finished, we've had enough,
</P>
<P>
   No marching anymore. ...
</P>
<P>
   Farewell life, farewell love,
</P>
<P>
   Farewell all the women,
</P>
<P>
   We're finished forever
</P>
<P>
   With this filthy war.

WITHOUT FOCUS ON GINGRICH, RIVALRIES ENGULF HOUSE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after House Speaker Newt Gingrich's abrupt
resignation, the race for House speaker was transformed into a
spirited free-for-all, with Republicans predicting Saturday that
the roiling competition would soon engulf most of the top positions
in the House Republican hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich had hoped to bring some unity to his fractious
caucus by stepping down, his departure instead opened the
floodgates for new candidates in a party still reeling from an
election that cost Republicans five House seats instead of bringing
the opposition party its traditional gains in an off-year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., the chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, loomed like the giant-killer Friday when
he announced the challenge that drove Gingrich out of the speaker's
chair. And he is still the favorite in the race, having worked for
a year to line up votes.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday the 55-year-old lawmaker, who had presented himself
as a manager who could ease the House out of paralysis, was himself
facing new challengers for the powerful speaker's post as
Republicans considered what face they wanted to put forward to the
nation in place of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than recoiling from a fight, many Republicans said they
were relishing the open competition. ``I have a smile on my face
and joy in my heart because this is a day I've been looking for,''
Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., said Friday night on CNN's ``Larry
King Live,'' as he promoted his own candidacy for House majority
leader against Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Largent said, ``What the Republican Party needs so desperately
is not retreads, not the old has-beens, but the new fresh ideas,
fresh faces, and I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership race is likely to become not just a battle of
personalities, but a struggle between different factions of the
Republican Party with conflicting ideological agendas.
</P>
<P>
   What remained unclear was whether the struggle would have any
effect on the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton. Asked
about the inquiry Friday, Livingston said simply that the matter
was being handled by the House Judiciary Committee and that ``I,
like all of the other members, await their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they were longing for a speaker who could
become a Ronald Reagan or who could replicate the successes of the
Republicans who had won gubernatorial elections in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida and Texas, by putting forward a conservatism that
seems inclusive and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan did not scare people and the guy was far more
conservative than any Republican governor,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla. He pointed to the transformation of Jeb Bush,
who lost a race for governor of Florida four years ago but won on
his second try Tuesday and captured more than half of the Hispanic
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94 Jeb sounded like us,'' he said, referring to his own
revolutionary class of Republicans who won the House in 1994 on the
``Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In '98 he sounded like very few Republicans I have ever
heard,'' Scarborough said. ``I heard him talk to Hispanics and
African-Americans, and he was on fire. He came across better with
those groups than middle-class whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 46, a telegenic soft-spoken
lawmaker, announced his candidacy for speaker in his own appearance
on the Larry King program by reminding Republicans that he had
served in the Reagan White House and by calling himself someone who
had been able to work even with liberals.
</P>
<P>
   On the air, Cox even joked that he could lobby for support from
Largent, who was also using the program as a platform.
</P>
<P>
   There was one sign of consolidation in the speaker's race.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 70, the chairman of the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee, had abruptly withdrawn support from
Gingrich on Friday saying that he was considering a run for speaker
himself. But Saturday, Archer, an apostle of tax cuts who wants to
replace the income tax code with a national sales tax, pulled out
of the contest. He had already been drawing support from fellow
Texans, who make up one of the largest Republican delegations in
the House, and from conservatives. It was not clear whether
conservatives would now scramble for another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members said the situation remained fluid. Rep. Pete
Sessions, R-Texas, said that many members who had given their
backing to Livingston had done so expecting him to challenge either
Armey or Gingrich. He said Gingrich's departure could prompt
rethinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as a Livingston versus Gingrich fight,'' Sessions
said. The Livingston forces, he said, ``will have to go back and
retest what they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Talent, R-Mo., 42, also indicated that he might seek
the post. Talent, the chairman of the House Small Business
Committee, is a conservative who has worked well with GOP
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is the most powerful figure in the House and follows
the vice president as the next in the line of succession for the
presidency. The speaker also controls committee assignments and
chairmanships, in that way exerting powerful sway over the
legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But many other positions could be up for grabs when House
Republicans convene later this month to select their leaders for
the incoming 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hell is breaking loose,'' said a senior Republican aide.
``Everybody's jumping in. I wouldn't be surprised if members start
running for multiple positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, a folksy conservative, has already been challenged by
Largent.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, the fourth-ranking leader who
serves as chairman of the House Republican Conference, faces one
rival so far, Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., another member of
the class of '94.
</P>
<P>
   So far only Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who is the majority whip in
the House, appeared to be fending off competition. DeLay, whose
role is to count votes, has the support of his extensive whip
organization, even though his relations with other House leaders
were poisoned by the abortive coup against Gingrich in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now have just under two weeks to mount their
leadership campaigns. They will select their new leaders at an
organizing meeting for the 106th Congress scheduled for Nov. 18 and
19. The session will be presided over by the chairman of the
Republican conference, Boehner, and the voting will take place by
secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The winners must be elected later on the House floor when the
new Congress convenes in January. It was the prospects of how that
second election might go that helped persuade Gingrich to step
down, some Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gingrich might have prevailed inside the Republican
caucus elections later this month, eight or more Republicans had
vowed that they would never vote for him. Their opposition meant
that, since Republicans now hold only a six-seat majority, Gingrich
might not have been able to win the second election on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his stunning departure, Gingrich won praise from
many of the Republicans he had worked with most closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few men or women have had a greater impact on the Republican
Party and the nation over the last decade than Newt Gingrich,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who had grown up with
Gingrich as a fellow member in the House minority. ``I will miss
his visionary leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate leadership elections will come in December. Thus far,
Lott appears safe, although some of his lieutenants may face
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who for four years had been Gingrich's second-in-command,
said, ``Newt Gingrich deserves a place in history right next to
Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on Saturday were already showcasing fresh faces
and a new tone. Their weekly radio address was delivered by one of
the newly elected incoming representatives, Greg Walden of Oregon,
a 41-year-old radio station owner. He said that when he campaigned
he met constituents who wanted Congress to pay down the national
debt, make health care accessible, strengthen the national defense
and protect the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   He asked President Clinton to join with Republicans in Congress
``in dedicating the next two years not to partisanship and
posturing, but to real honest to goodness problem- solving where we
debate policies, not personalities.''

MINORITY JOURNALISTS SETTLE QUIET BUT FRACTIOUS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (bl)

<P>
   A coalition of minority journalists' groups has ended one of the
most fractious, if least visible, civil rights debates of the year,
agreeing to keep its convention in Seattle despite Washington
state's vote against affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the coalition, Unity: Journalists of Color, came
after a debate that threatened to cripple the organization, which
brings black, Asian, Hispanic and American Indian journalists under
a single roof. Organized 10 years ago in the belief that nonwhite
journalists have common goals, Unity nearly split over how to
confront the rollback of affirmative action around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was a snapshot of the problems inherited by a generation of
successful minority professionals who fear that once-open doors are
closing, and an illustration of the trapdoors built into a
cross-cultural coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, leaders of the National Association of Black
Journalists said that holding the convention in Seattle would break
faith with history by having 6,000 minority professionals spend $20
million in a state rejecting government-sponsored affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the Native American Journalists Association, with
support from Hispanic colleagues, argued that a boycott would break
faith with their groups, which could be financially crippled by
hotel cancellation fees of $500,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   So painful did the six-month debate become that some
participants unsuccessfully sought a diversity training session to
clarify cultural differences among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as the next generation are trying to figure out how we
continue the civil rights struggle,'' said Vanessa Williams, the
president of the black journalists' group and a reporter who covers
city government for The Washington Post. ``The target is not so
blatant. Now there are clear differences of opinion and also some
confusion about how and when to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Unity members, including some blacks, thought that a
boycott was one of several possible responses, but that the goal of
holding Unity together was more important than any particular
tactic. ``There are hardly any other organizations in North America
that operate the way Unity does,'' said Paul DeMain, the publisher
of News From Indian Country, a national journal based in Wisconsin.
``We have to find the fortitude to put us, Unity, ahead of any
individual organization's view.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding 10 years ago, Unity has attracted the support
of publishers and broadcasters committed to finding new faces to
cover communities undergoing rapid demographic change. Aside from
anything else, there are practical concerns. Publishers hope to
reverse a decade of circulation losses. Television's audience is
dwindling, too. Minorities represent 11.5 percent of newspaper
journalists and 20 percent of those in television news.
</P>
<P>
   Unity and the four associations of minority journalists ``are
the foot soldiers of diversity,'' said Jon Funabiki, a program
officer for the Ford Foundation. ``They hold job fairs. They have
high school and college scholarship and program aids. They have
management training programs.'' At Funabiki's recommendation, the
Ford Foundation has given Unity a $500,000 grant.
</P>
<P>
   With 3,000 members, the black group dwarfs the others. Yet when
Unity was formed, every organization was given an equal voice. The
presidency rotates each year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 debate was a reprise of the struggles that dogged the
group's first convention in 1994. American Indians had concerns
about Atlanta as the site because Georgia's government helped
instigate the brutal 1838 removal of the Cherokees. Black
journalists feared that they would be stuck with hotel penalties,
though, if the convention were moved. Unity ``almost fell apart,''
Funabiki said, adding, ``The miracle is that they keep coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Native American Journalists Association joined
the 1994 convention, which was a success, in networking and
bonhomie. Leaders of the groups also reached an understanding that
if another convention was held, the smaller groups could choose a
site.
</P>
<P>
   When Unity decided to hold a convention in the summer of 1999,
the board chose Seattle, where the American Indians' presence is
strong and the Asian population is growing swiftly. Unity attracted
close to $2 million in foundation pledges and reserved hundreds of
rooms. Then petitioners in Washington state put Initiative 200 _
banning race or gender preference in state contracts, education or
employment _ on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Some black journalists started discussing a boycott, arguing
that abandoning Seattle would make the strongest possible
statement. Confrontation is important, said Robert Pierre, a
Washington Post reporter who was able to begin his career because
of a scholarship from the National Association of Black
Journalists. ``There would not be blacks, Hispanics, Native
Americans and Asian Americans in newsrooms,'' he said, ``if people
hadn't fought newspapers and broadcast organizations into making it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when Ms. Williams of the black journalists' group
proposed that Unity's board explore other sites, the other groups
swiftly rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   DeMain, a past president of the Native American group, was
concerned that boycott proponents were ignoring American Indians'
sensitivity to broken agreements. ``We've had people rip us off for
decades, signing agreements then tearing them up,'' he said.
``NABJ's saying, `You don't hear our concerns.' We're saying, `You
don't hear ours.'''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Asian American Journalists Association said
they were concerned about whether journalists should be making
political statements. ``We've been strict about not jumping into
controversial debates,'' said Benjamin Seto, the group's president
and the deputy business editor at Newsday. ``We want to be seen as
a credible group that can approach a situation the same way a
journalist approaches a story, with impartiality.''
</P>
<P>
   The black journalists were hardly unanimous. Some speakers at
the group's convention in July argued against a boycott. ``The
people in Washington need to see our faces,'' one said. ``They need
to know that we are what's right about affirmative action.'' Some
members said that a boycott would threaten Unity itself.
</P>
<P>
   When the Unity board met in September in Virginia, Ms. Williams
continued to seek new options. That discussion became heated, as
black participants like Pierre grew impatient with digressions,
like discussion of whether the physical act of pointing a finger in
a debate is an insult. Kara Briggs, a member of the Yakama tribe
and Unity's current president, felt that American Indians'
sensitivities to such gestures were slighted.
</P>
<P>
   Unity had already agreed to sponsor a meeting for the public on
the issue of affirmative action in Seattle in October. They agreed
to resume the discussion then.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, Unity's board met in Seattle with the boards of all
four groups. As the day proceeded, the discussion again
deteriorated. Hispanic and Asian representatives sought compromise,
in vain. ``We couldn't get past one group feeling that their
concerns were more important than another group's,'' said Nancy
Baca, the president of the National Association of Hispanic
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   When a vote to explore other sites was called at the meeting,
the board deadlocked. The Asians voted with the blacks, saying that
any group's request for information should be honored. The Hispanic
group voted with the Native American group. The next morning, with
feelings bruised and schedules tight, the board met again. At the
last minute, the Native American group agreed to check other sites,
but did so reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, Initiative 200 passed with 59 percent of the
vote. But King County, where Seattle is located, rejected the
measure. That offered a fig leaf: Seattle voters had not opposed
affirmative action. Last Wednesday, the board of the black
journalists' group voted 12-6 to go to Seattle, though some black
journalists quietly decided they would stay away. On Thursday, the
Unity board reaffirmed its original decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked out in a very public setting the issues that all of
us are going to have to learn to work out, in the media and in the
workplace,'' said Ms. Briggs, a reporter for The Oregonian in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Williams, the debate corrected what she called an
``unhealthy tendency to try to smooth over differences as opposed
to really confronting them so we could move on.'' She said, ``It
has been more beneficial than any orchestrated discussion of
cultural differences.''

ANTI-SEMITISM REARS ITS HEAD IN RUSSIA'S PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's Communists went looking last week for someone
to blame for the nation's economic morass, and after an
extraordinary discourse freighted with memories of the Soviet past,
they found a candidate: the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   For that they were swiftly condemned, most notably in a blunt
statement by President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin said he was
``indignant'' at what seemed a revival of Soviet anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extremism will not take the upper hand in Russia,'' he stated.
``The course of the country toward conciliation remains
unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a debate in the lower house of Parliament, Communist
legislators had pressed the argument that Jews in the government
and the media were aligned with outsiders in a campaign to
undermine Russian nationalism and sap the country's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament took two days last week to decide whether to condemn
anti-Semitic statements made last month by a Communist legislator,
Albert Makashov.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow and in the southwestern city of Samara, Makashov
proclaimed that Russia's economic woes were the fault of the
``zhidy'' _ a slur for Jews _ and that certain of them should be
found and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Makashov later expressed regret, saying he should have used the
term ``Zionists.'' But he also called for a debate, saying it would
make clear who really controls Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament wrangled over endorsing a resolution that deplored
racism and called the remarks ``sharp and bordering on crudeness,''
but it failed to pass by a vote of 107-121.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Communist voted for it; 83 opposed it and the remaining
46 either abstained or did not vote. Hard-line nationalist factions
also voted against the measure almost unanimously. Even the
moderate party Our Russian Home mustered fewer than half its
members in support of the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party chairman, Gennady Zyuganov, said that
Makashov had been censured privately and that only a task force was
needed to examine ethnic tensions, but several of his legislators
praised Makashov. One, Gennady Benov, called Zionism ``more
frightening than fascism because it operates from the flanks,
clandestinely and secretly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Communists took aim at journalists, saying they would
bring charges against prominent television reporters for ``their
active and deliberate support of the regime and its criminal
activities.'' Zyuganov called for journalists to publicly apologize
for their reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution's backers, who had cast it as a referendum on
racism, were bitter. ``It's distressing and dangerous when the
Parliament of a multiethnic country opts for state anti-Semitism,''
one legislator, Stanislav Govorukhin, said later.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism is hardly new in Russia. Jews were widely
persecuted and denied basic rights in czarist and Soviet times, and
even in independent Russia there has been an undercurrent of
resentment against Jews in powerful state and business positions.
But until now it had remained in the background of national
political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The targets were not named. But among the prominent national
figures here who are either Jewish or of Jewish extraction are
Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's former finance minister and an architect
of free-market reforms; Sergei Kiriyenko and Yevgeny Primakov, the
former and current prime ministers; Alexander Livshits, a former
economic adviser, and several so-called oligarchs who dominate
Russian industry.
</P>
<P>
   They include Boris Berezovsky, once a key Yeltsin supporter, and
Vladimir Guzinsky, a prominent Jewish activist who owns television
and newspaper empires in Israel and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was not alone in his condemnation. Russia's
highest-ranking Communist, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov,
said Friday that the Parliament's decision not to condemn Makashov
was ``a disgrace, simply a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known television journalists, Yevgeny Kiselyov,
lashed out at the Communists, saying the vote marked ``their
blackest day in history.''

CELLULAR PHONES IMPACT ON THE PEACE OF NATURE

<P>
   Madison Hut, pinned just below the raw summits of Mount Adams
and Mount Madison in the Presidential Range in New Hampshire, is a
sublime place to be on a sunny day. The views there above the tree
line, at an altitude of 4,825 feet, go around the compass and are
stirring _ while man and his handiwork remain out of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it was startling on a recent afternoon to hear a
telephone conversation amid a small gathering scattered outside the
hut. A white-haired woman was speaking into her white cellular
telephone. ``Guess where I am?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger beside me on the hut's stoop, reading a paperback,
turned. Our eyes met, our eyebrows lifted. Had we not expended
three hours climbing over rocks and roots to reach this enchanted
spot and thus to escape the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   The stranger soon became a friend. He turned out to be Norman
Sims, chairman of the journalism department at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst and a member of the board of directors of the
Appalachian Mountain Club, the latter the proprietor of Madison Hut
since 1888.
</P>
<P>
   We happened to agree on any number of subjects beginning with
the inappropriate possession and use of portable telephones, or any
such electronic gadgets, in the woods _ or whatever may constitute
wilderness in the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   We are hardly alone. But are we members of a majority soon to be
a minority?
</P>
<P>
   More cellular phones are being stuffed into backpacks than ever
before, one suspects. Outfitters like the Eastern Mountain Sports
stores report that Global Positioning Systems, the relatively new
navigational tools, are selling briskly. Beepers are becoming as
common as trail mix.
</P>
<P>
   On a hike in the Adirondacks last summer a doctor in our party
of purists had a beeper hooked to his belt. We looked at it
suspiciously. OK to take a call from a patient, we admonished, but
not from his wife asking what time he would be home for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is cloudy. Electronic communications can certainly be
termed safety devices if they help in saving lives, if they quicken
or eliminate rescue operations, and expose fewer people to dangers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way to limit, monitor or even define their use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't take a stand,'' I told Sims, ``someday too soon
there will be boom boxes up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology is not yet perfected, thank goodness. The
cellular telephones do not always work because of areas restricted
by topography, as the organizers of the 1993 world orienteering
championships found out. They had to install wire phone lines at
considerable expense to their competition finish lines in Harriman
State Park which is only 30 miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fish, the renowned Forest Ranger of the High Peaks in the
Adirondacks who has climbed Mount Marcy 499 times, says phones
cannot reach out so well from all the places so their safety use is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call out from summits,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``But problems don't happen on top. Problems happen down
in the valleys on the way to and from the top, in which case the
phone may or may not function.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only answer to that is to have your fittest member run all
the way to the top to call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish, who this year at age 62 has begun a well-earned
retirement, is ambivalent about the issue of safety or despoilment.
</P>
<P>
   But he is, he said, ``less than enthralled'' with the Global
Positioning Systems. These hand-held instruments, that cost from
$100 to $300, can position locations by reading signals from
satellites and thus affix longitude and latitude numbers within
about 300 feet. They are powered by four AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the power source fails,'' said Fish, ``and someone has put
all their trust in them, they are really up the creek because they
haven't a clue where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   These systems are remarkable in that they will track a hiker's
route from his automobile at the trail head into the woods and back
out again with a line and arrows on a small screen. But they
complement rather than replace traditional compass and map.
</P>
<P>
   A story I heard in both the Adirondacks and in the White
Mountains this past summer is about a lost hiker who called for
help on his cellular telephone. His GPS would no longer work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The replying ranger said, ``Well, let's figure out where you
are. Get out your map.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What map?'' said the hiker. ``I don't have one.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly before noon Friday, a visitor to Yankee
Stadium did a double-take. Walking through the press gate in a
Detroit Tigers' uniform, his spikes clacking on the sidewalk, was a
familiar face. Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a movie here,'' a Yankee employee explained.
``He's been here two weeks. He's got another four to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, several dozen people had gathered near cameras under an
awning in deep left field. Others were on the grass near the
pitcher's mound. Perched in some of the empty seats behind home
plate were wooden cutouts of spectators. On the scoreboard, the
Tigers were playing the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Tigers' pitcher who's got a perfect game going,'' the
Yankee employee said.
</P>
<P>
   But what, the visitor wanted to know, is the name of this movie
that is being filmed in the House of the World Series champions?
``The movie,'' the Yankee employee said, ``is `For the Love of the
Game.'''
</P>
<P>
   It must be a fictional movie, maybe a romantic comedy. With that
title, it couldn't be a true story, especially if it's being filmed
in November when baseball's free-agent auctions have begun, when
negotiations are under way for millions of dollars. Not for the
love of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the absence of the love of the game more obvious
than in the office of Brian Cashman, the Yankee general manager.
When a voice told Cashman that ``Mr. Steinbrenner is on the
phone,'' he took the call. Instantly. It is doubtful that the love
of the game was about to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Much more likely, the principal owner was talking about what to
do about Bernie Williams, David Cone and Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Yankees match what could be a seven-year, $100
million offer for their center fielder? Should they eliminate the
200-innings clause from their ace right-hander's next contract?
Should they exercise the $2.5 million option for 1999 on the
slugger recuperating from colon-cancer surgery?
</P>
<P>
   As a public service for the principal owner, the answers here
would be: yes, yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   As expensive as Williams is expected to be, if the Yankees don't
keep him, they can't replace him. He is not only their cleanup
hitter and reigning American League batting champion, he not only
has a smooth, serene personality that is comfortable in the New
York scene, he is also their center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielders who can hit, run and throw are hard to find. And
center fielders who are comfortable in a Yankee uniform might be
even harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Ken Griffey Jr., Williams is baseball's best center
fielder. If the Yankees lose him, sure, somebody else in a Yankee
uniform will be playing center field next season, but that center
fielder won't be hitting cleanup, that center fielder won't win the
AL batting title.
</P>
<P>
   As expensive as $100 million over seven years for Williams
sounds now, that price is merely the next step in the free-agent
fiscal ladder now that the Mets gave Mike Piazza $91 million for
seven years. If the Yankees were to pursue Griffey eventually, it
would cost more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, signing the 30-year-old Williams now would be a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Cone apparently isn't arguing about money. In pitching more than
200 innings, he qualified for a $5.5 million salary next season
when he will be 36 years old; the Yankees reportedly have offered
$7 million. But he doesn't want to have to pitch 200 innings to
qualify for a contract in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cone isn't demanding extravagant money. In his two previous
free-agent situations, Cone hit the lottery for $37.5 million over
six years _ $18 million with Kansas City, $19.5 million with the
Yankees. He doesn't need money; he needs a rested arm.
</P>
<P>
   As good as David Wells, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez are,
Cone remains Joe Torre's favorite choice for a big game. That type
of trustworthy pitcher is rare. Don't make Cone force himself to
pitch 200 innings. All that does is put an added burden on an arm
that should be nourished.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's future involves his health. He will not only be 37
when next season starts, he will also be coming off cancer surgery
and chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who hit 24 homers last season in earning $750,000 in
salary and $175,000 in incentives, is hoping that Steinbrenner will
pick up the option for a $2.5 million salary next year, as opposed
to a $100,000 buyout. But the principal owner is reluctant, quite
understandably.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if Strawberry will play again? Or if he does play, how
well he will play?
</P>
<P>
   Considering Strawberry's illness, that sounds harsh. But other
than Steinbrenner's promise to always ``take care'' of Strawberry,
the principal owner isn't responsible for Strawberry, especially
not for his reported $2.5 million tax debt. He can ``take care'' of
Strawberry other ways.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball now, especially in November, for the love of the
game is just a movie.

NFL LABOR PEACE THROUGH 2003 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early last week, as National Basketball Association union
members were exchanging venom with Commissioner David Stern because
of their league's 100-day-plus lockout, their National Football
League counterparts were signing off on the collective-bargaining
agreement players and owners ratified months ago. It took that long
to pore over, paragraph by paragraph, a 140-plus page document that
guaranteed labor peace in football through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   To basketball, labor peace seems as foreign a concept as the
underhanded free throw.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL can feel the NBA's pain. Over a decade ago, football
players and team owners went through a bitter labor period that
included a 1987 strike. Now, thanks mainly to a close but
professional relationship between Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and
Gene Upshaw, the players' union executive director, the ugliness of
the strike is a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   Football will be the only major professional sport of the 1990s
that will not lose games to labor problems. Both Tagliabue and
Upshaw have overseen unparalleled levels of growth for the league
and players. Since Tagliabue replaced Pete Rozelle in 1989, the
league has watched its revenue skyrocket from $970 million to $3.5
billion. Franchises are worth the price of small countries; the
Cleveland Browns recently sold for $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw, a Hall of Fame lineman for the Oakland Raiders, has
overseen player salaries reach their highest level ever. Under the
latest bargaining agreement, benefits like 401(k) plans and pension
funds will increase from $150 million to $500 million over the life
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest accomplishment for Tagliabue and Upshaw
is insuring a decade of labor peace. How did they do it? Mainly by
trying not to treat each other as enemies _ a far cry from the days
of the 1987 strike when management and the union all but despised
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I've tried to do is put a relationship in place
with Gene that would take us through the good times as well as the
bad,'' Tagliabue said. ``The first three years I had the job as
commissioner, I worked on that and so did Gene. I think it has
really paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Upshaw: ``We always talk and keep the lines of
communication open. He puts himself in my place and I put myself in
his place.''
</P>
<P>
   They speak almost twice monthly, and those conversations seem to
serve as a way to stay ahead of problems. Just last week, Tagliabue
and Upshaw met for more than two hours to discuss a number of
issues, including expansion, Hall of Fame and stadium matters,
tampering rules and the upcoming competition committee meetings in
February.
</P>
<P>
   When Tagliabue became commissioner, he worked to build alliances
with owners who felt, as he did, that labor issues were one of the
biggest threats to NFL prosperity. He got the trust of key owners
like Wellington Mara of the Giants and Dan Rooney of the Steelers.
Tagliabue hired Harold Henderson, a labor attorney, whom the owners
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tagliabue acts more like a politician than a dictator, and
because he had strong support from the owners, Tagliabue had more
clout during talks with Upshaw in the months before the NFL reached
its latest labor accord last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has a lot more power than Pete Rozelle did when the
players went on strike in 1987,'' said Upshaw. ``When Paul became
commissioner, he brought together a lot of factions. It helped make
labor talks go much smoother.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are closely watching the NBA lockout. Tagliabue said he
had not spoken to Stern in months but sympathized with him, and
Upshaw wanted the players to get the best deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting between Stern and union officials, Stern accused
prominent agents of sabotaging any chance of ending the dispute.
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said Stern was trying
to divide the union. Hunter and Stern might not be attending Knicks
games together after the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
   But their battles demonstrate the difference between
basketball's negotiations with its players and the NFL's before the
recent agreement _ Tagliabue and Upshaw never got into such public
squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mara Helping Taylor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, as he had previously, came to the aid of
Lawrence Taylor, the former Giants linebacker, by paying for
Taylor's latest stay in a drug-rehabilitation clinic, according to
several people close to Taylor. It is at least the second time Mara
has paid for Taylor's drug counseling since Taylor retired after
the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-area clinic where Taylor is staying charges $250 a
day. A 30-day stay would cost $7,500. The exact amount Mara paid is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rough month for Taylor, who was arrested in St.
Petersburg Beach, Fla., for attempting to purchase crack cocaine;
entered the clinic and then declared bankruptcy. Taylor is eligible
for the Hall of Fame in January, and most in football feel he
should get in despite his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prospects for Rhodes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While Philadelphia Eagles Coach Ray Rhodes struggles to get his
1-7 team another victory, his friends around the league continue to
come to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a good coach who is stuck in some pretty tough
circumstances,'' Tampa Bay Buccaneers Coach Tony Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   One general manager said if he were hiring a head coach next
season, Rhodes would be at the top of his list.
</P>
<P>
   If Rhodes were fired during the season or after it, one place he
could end up is 60 miles down I-95. Unless Baltimore Coach Ted
Marchibroda takes the 2-6 Ravens to the playoffs, which is
unlikely, Rhodes would be a top candidate to replace him next
season, according to several league executives.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rhodes' best friends in the league is Ozzie Newsome, the
Ravens' vice president in charge of player personnel. Rhodes, who
would be teamed with one of the top front offices in football,
making a formidable combination with Newsome, league executives
say. Rhodes could also end up as the defensive coordinator for the
Cleveland franchise since Carmen Policy, the general manager, is a
big fan of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm going to do what I have to do to turn this team
around,'' Rhodes said. ``That's all I care about. When the time is
up for me in this city, or whatever, I'm going to move on. That's
the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Support From Johnson &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, the talent agent and former Walt Disney
executive, is competing with Ed Roski Jr., the real estate tycoon,
to bring pro football and state-of-the-art stadiums to Los Angeles.
The Roski initiative has received backing from several big names
linked to that region, including Keyshawn Johnson, the Jets wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grew up in Los Angeles and played at Southern
California. While he has not been a vocal supporter, Johnson's name
alone could help the group.

U.S POLICY ON IRAQ MAY SWITCH FROM INSPECTIONS TO FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, France)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven years after the Persian Gulf war, the Clinton
administration is preparing to abandon the U.N. inspections regime
as an effective instrument for restraining President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq, senior American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration is choosing other forms of
traditional containment, including sanctions and the use of force,
which now seems more likely than at any other time since the gulf
war ended in 1991, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we use force, we move into a new phase,'' a senior American
official said. That would mean overt containment of Iraq through
continued sanctions, with clear ``red lines'' to make it obvious to
Hussein that attacking his neighbors or the Kurds in northern Iraq
will bring retaliation. ``If he tries to use weapons of mass
destruction,'' the official said, ``he should know that we will
obliterate Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   During the gulf war, the official noted, Hussein heeded such
warnings and did not use chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Washington no longer believes that Hussein will cooperate with
the U.N. weapons inspectors, who have spent seven years trying to
eliminate Iraq's nuclear, missile, biological and chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend Hussein cut off all cooperation with the
inspectors, who, senior American and European officials concede,
have been unable to do their work for eight of the last 12 months.
There is little prospect that Hussein will ever again provide the
cooperation needed for the inspectors to finish their task, the
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Western officials have concluded that Hussein cares
more about keeping his ability to produce weapons of terror than he
does about lifting the sanctions, which the Security Council has
said will end only when he complies with disarmament resolutions
and which Washington has implied will end only when Hussein falls.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials are not ruling out a diplomatic
solution to this latest crisis, and they are pressing the Security
Council to make Iraq live up to its commitments. But they also
insist that Hussein's cooperation must be full, his retreat total.
</P>
<P>
   While calculations could change, senior officials emphasize that
any use of force is likely to be a few weeks away, giving American
officials time to convince the world that Washington is not eager
for blood and that Hussein has had every opportunity to avoid a
strike. But these officials agree that the use of force is more
likely now and that one aim will be to undermine Hussein's hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   But they also agree that one likely consequence of its use is
the expulsion of the U.N. inspectors, known as UNSCOM, and the end
of an extraordinary seven-year effort to disarm Iraq by inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to maintain the unity of the Security Council and
contain Iraq, keeping the elements of containment that reduce
Saddam's ability to threaten his neighbors and the world, namely
UNSCOM and sanctions,'' an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody is seeking to preserve a useless UNSCOM, and UNSCOM
cannot work without Iraqi cooperation, which has not been
forthcoming, despite every promise,'' the official said. ``So
either there will be a meaningful UNSCOM _ able to operate freely,
without hindrance and with cooperation _ or there will be other
alternatives. And if we were to use force, we don't expect UNSCOM
to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Some regional experts urge that the inspections be maintained.
Edward Djerejian, a former ambassador to Syria and Israel, said:
``It is critical that UNSCOM keep its operations in Iraq, because
Saddam wants weapons of mass destruction. The integrity of the
inspection regime must be maintained, because it has been
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But American officials argue that inspections have not been
effective in discovering Iraq's chemical and biological secrets and
that their integrity cannot be preserved without Iraqi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   If force is used, the officials say, the stated justification
will be to support U.N. resolutions and to reduce Iraq's ability to
make or use weapons of mass destruction. The stated aim will not be
to eliminate those weapons, since they cannot be eliminated with
air power. Nor will the stated aim be to drive Hussein from power
because that, too, cannot be guaranteed from the air.
</P>
<P>
   But force will also be used ``against the sources of his
regime,'' a senior official said carefully. Translated, that means
an effort to weaken Hussein's grip on power and promote his fall.
</P>
<P>
   Possible targets would include Hussein's ethnic base in Tikrit,
his Revolutionary Guards, his interior ministry and secret police,
his sophisticated weaponry, his palaces and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials say that the Pentagon remains reluctant to use
force and that Arab allies are concerned that the real victims of
violence will be the Iraqi people, who are already suffering from
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But after the United States held off using force against Iraq
last November, and again in February and August, one official said,
``it's just that much harder to hold off again, because the
president looks weak, and American credibility is on the line, not
just the U.N.'s credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the United States threatened force, in February,
Clinton spoke apocalyptically about the dangers of Iraqi nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, and said the United States would
go to war to protect the inspectors' ``full and unfettered access''
to any sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The serious threat Hussein poses was overblown in the effort to
sell the possible attack, some senior American officials now say.
Defense Secretary William Cohen appeared on television brandishing
a bag of sugar in an effort to describe how small a dose of
biological and chemical weapons it would take to threaten
Americans, but his own chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry Shelton, expressed serious reservations about the ability of
the Pentagon to destroy such easily hidden and reconstituted
weapons from the air.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation was defused, but not ended, when
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations went to Baghdad
and used the imminent threat of force by the United States and
Britain to obtain a promise from Hussein that the arms inspectors
would have the access they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the policy confusion, American and British officials
were relieved, but hardly pleased. Annan, an official said,
expected to win the Nobel Peace Prize; American and British
officials expected another round of Iraqi defiance, and held a
thorough policy review, with its conclusions being put into
practice now.
</P>
<P>
   The first conclusion was to try to prevent Hussein from
dictating the game and manipulating Washington through UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's happened over and over again,'' a senior official
said. ``Saddam creates a crisis over UNSCOM, divides the U.N., we
ramp up militarily at a cost of $1.5 billion a time, the French,
Russians and the U.N. use our leverage to do a deal, and Saddam
gains a little more, until the next time. That's just stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   By trying to avoid confrontation on Hussein's terms and to keep
the Security Council unified, the United States urged UNSCOM and
its chairman, Richard Butler, to avoid unnecessary confrontations
with Iraq that would allow Hussein to put the blame on UNSCOM,
rather than allowing the United States and Britain to put the blame
on Hussein, where it presumably belongs.
</P>
<P>
   That policy proved embarrassing to Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright when one inspector, Scott Ritter, quit and
charged that Washington was undermining the group's ability to work
by discouraging the surprise inspections that he felt were the key
to success.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and senior American and British officials have rejected
those charges, saying that they discouraged Butler from engaging in
useless confrontation with Iraq only when it was became clear in
August that Baghdad would not allow the very inspections Ritter
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that their new policy is paying dividends now, with
the Security Council _ including the Russians and the French _
firmly opposed to Hussein's latest demands. Rather than sending a
high-level negotiator to Baghdad, as they did last winter, the
French have withdrawn their charge d'affaires from Baghdad,
American officials point out. Nor is Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov of Russia, who defused an earlier crisis in November 1997,
rushing to Iraq's aid or defense.
</P>
<P>
   The second conclusion was to limit military goals to ``deterring
and diminishing'' Iraq's capacity to make and use terror weapons.
That means the Pentagon is happier and there is less need to build
up in the gulf or to ask much from vulnerable Arab allies like
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far from a perfect policy,'' a senior official said.
``Given the Security Council and the state of the Arab world, this
is a least worst policy. And it's less worse than it was in
February.''

   As voters reaffirmed democracy last week, a report was released
that seemed like lab results on a 200-year-old paternity suit
against one of the Founding Fathers. DNA tests matched descendants
of Thomas Jefferson with those of his beautiful slave Sally
Hemings. This turned Jefferson scholarship on its ear; from the
19th century on, most historians insisted that a man of Jefferson's
character could not have had a sexual relationship with Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   The study in the scientific journal Nature by Eugene Foster, a
retired Tufts University pathologist, showed Jefferson fathered
Eston Hemings at 65, an age associated more with retirement from
life than with the creation of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings' descendants had long claimed Jefferson as an
ancestor, and a few books have tried to document the liaison. But
Jeffersonian scholars preferred to discount the claim, specifically
that contained in a memoir by Eston Hemings' brother, Madison. The
scholars relied less on facts than on their understanding of
Jefferson's character. Assessments of his character _ written
before the DNA test _ follow.

   ``According to the admitted standards of greatness, Jefferson
was a great man. After all deductions on which his enemies might
choose to insist, his character could not be denied elevation,
versatility, breadth, insight and delicacy . . . he fairly reveled
in what he believed to be beautiful, and his writings often
betrayed subtile feeling for artistic form, _ a sure mark of
intellectual sensuousness. He shrank from whatever was rough or
coarse, and his yearning for sympathy was almost feminine.''

   (The charges of a sexual relationship with Sally Hemings) ``are
distinctly out of character, being virtually unthinkable in a man
of Jefferson's moral standards and habitual conduct. . . . It is
virtually inconceivable that this fastidious gentleman whose
devotion to his dead wife's memory and to the happiness of his
daughters and grandchildren bordered on the excessive could have
carried on through a period of years a vulgar liaison which his own
family could not have failed to detect.''

Press, 1970).
</P>
<P>
   `` Unless Jefferson was capable of slipping badly out of
character in hidden moments at Monticello, it is difficult to
imagine him caught up in a miscegenous relationship. Such a mixture
of the races, such a ruthless exploitation of the master-slave
relationship, revolted his whole being. It is of no historical
importance, but the best guess is that Sally's children were
fathered by Peter Carr. '' (Jefferson's nephew)
</P>
<P>
   FAWN M. BRODIE wrote ``Thomas Jefferson, an Intimate History''
(W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.) and famously re-ignited the Jefferson-Hemings
question in 1974, using a Freudian approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the important reasons that Jefferson's true nature has
remained elusive is the insistence of all his previous biographers
that after the death of his wife he never felt any lasting
affection again for any woman. Gilbert Chinard stated the theme in
1928 when he wrote bluntly that though Jefferson corresponded with
many women ``there is no indication that he ever fell in love
again.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   But does a man's sexuality atrophy at 39, especially if he has
already demonstrated that he was capable of very great passion? . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Freud warned long ago (in ``Leonardo da Vinci: A Study in
Psychosexuality''): ``Biographers frequently select the hero as the
object of study because for personal reasons of their own emotional
life, they have a special affection for him from the very outset.
They then devote themselves to a work of idealization.'' . . . This
kind of canonization dominated 19th-century biography, and even
today the Jefferson scholars wary of the impulse to sanctify are
nevertheless often its victim; they glorify and protect by nuance,
by omission, by subtle repudiation, without being in the least
aware of the strength of their internal commitment to canonization.
This we see particularly in their treatment of the story of Sally
Hemings. This liaison, above all others in Jefferson's life, is
unutterably taboo. . . . Black historians, however, have long
accepted the story as accurate, and it is one of the most ironic
aspects of the Jefferson image today that the blacks who repudiate
him as a hero, because of his ambivalence over slavery,
nevertheless believe the historical Jefferson to have been a man of
great sexual vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   GARRY WILLS, in ``Uncle Thomas' Cabin'' (New York Review of
Books, April 18, 1974), attacked Professor Brodie's book. But some
of his statements about Hemings commented indirectly on Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet there is no scrap of evidence for this passion, except
perhaps the fact that he retained Sally at Monticello after stories
about her had been widely circulated. Still, what was he supposed
to do? Kill her? Freeing or selling her would make her more likely
to talk, or to be tricked into talking. It was safer to keep her
nearby. She was apparently pleasing, and obviously discreet. There
was less risk in continuing to enjoy her services than in
experimenting around with others. She was like a healthy and
obliging prostitute.''
</P>
<P>
   JOEL WILLIAMSON, in ``New People: Miscegenation and Mulattoes in
the United States'' (The Free Press, 1980), argued against lumping
Jefferson with other slave owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to a point Jefferson fits neatly the pattern of the widower
as miscegenator exemplified by his father-in-law. One ought not to
be greatly surprised to find that he had a mulatto lover among his
slaves, but if he did, it probably was not Sally. If it was, he
departed the role in two important respects: he did not avow
paternity . . . and he did not seem to maintain the relationship
with the mistress until death did them part.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH J. ELLIS, whose 1997 book, ``American Sphinx: The
Character of Thomas Jefferson'' (Alfred A. Knopf) won the National
Book Award, included the appendix, ``A Note on the Sally Hemings
Scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Hamilton and both Adamses understood about Jefferson, and
what my own immersion in the historical evidence has caused me to
conclude as well, is that for most of his adult life he lacked the
capacity for the direct and physical expression of his sexual
energies. Henry Adams put it most explicitly when he said that
Jefferson's temperament was ``almost feminine.'' When scholarly
defenders like Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson claimed that
Jefferson was ``not the kind of man'' to engage in illicit sex with
an attractive mulatto slave, they were right for reasons that went
deeper than matters of male gallantry and aristocratic honor.
Jefferson consummated his relations with women at a more rarefied
level. . . .
</P>
<P>
   He was, to be sure, capable of living with massive
contradictions, but his psychological dexterity depended upon the
manipulation of interior images and personae; he was not that
adroit at the kind of overt deviousness required to sustain an
allegedly 38-year affair in the very center of his domestic
haven.''
</P>
<P>
   ANNETTE GORDON-REED, a professor at New York Law School, sifted
through the existing evidence and put her findings in ``Thomas
Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy'' (University
Press of Virginia, 1997). She concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to look more closely into the identities of the
parties involved, the too ready acceptance and active promotion of
the Carr brothers story, the reliance upon stereotypes in the place
of investigation and analysis, all indicate that most Jefferson
scholars decided from the outset that this story was not true. . .
. In the most fundamental sense, the enterprise of defense has had
little to do with expanding people's knowledge of Thomas Jefferson
or the other participants in the story. The goal has been quite the
opposite: to restrict knowledge as a way of controlling the
allowable discourse on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Professors Ellis and Gordon-Reed appeared on PBS'
``Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' to discuss the DNA research linking
Hemings' last born to Jefferson. Accompanying the report in Nature
was an article by Ellis and Eric Lander, a geneticist. Asked on the
program if he had a change of heart, Ellis said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a change of heart, but this is really new
evidence. And it _ prior to this evidence, I think it was a very
difficult case to know and circumstantial on both sides, and, in
part, because I got it wrong, I think I want to step forward and
say this new evidence constitutes, well, evidence beyond any
reasonable doubt that Jefferson had a longstanding sexual
relationship with Sally Hemings. Even though the match is only with
one of the Hemings' descendants, Eston Hemings, it's inconceivable
that Jefferson, who was 65 when Eston was born, would have made a
one-night stand here.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Professor Gordon-Reed said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the moral of this story is the thing this shows very
clearly is that we're not two separate people, black and white; we
are a people who share a common culture, a common land, and it
turns out a common blood line, and this is something that we
haven't wanted to deal with openly. And talking about Jefferson,
which people like to do, I think is a good vehicle for exploring
that question.''

   MOSCOW _ In the sea of red banners and angry faces that flowed
through an overcast Moscow on Saturday to mark what used to be the
premier feast of Soviet communism, Revolution Day, one of the few
slogans with a constructive bent was the old chestnut from 1917:
``All Power to the Soviets.''
</P>
<P>
   But after chanting the line a few times with her fist held high,
an elderly woman wearing a frayed cloth coat with a red ribbon in
the lapel was hard pressed to explain exactly what this meant in
the current circumstances. President Boris Yeltsin had to go, she
declared, along with the gang of thieves who had stolen her
pension, and the West had to stop meddling, and it was time for
people to get down to real work.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was among some 10,000 marchers who turned out for the
main event of the Nov. 7 commemoration, a march organized by the
Russian Communist Party from the statue of Lenin on October Square
through the center of Moscow to the old KGB headquarters. By most
accounts, the turnout was better than in recent years, evidently
reflecting the impact of the latest economic crisis, which hit in
August.
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet days, Nov. 7 was marked with a military parade
past Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square with huge banners proclaiming
Soviet achievement and might.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a special edition of Pravda _ or at least one of two
competing papers using the name of the official organ of the
Communist party _ did issue a list of ``basic slogans,'' but
instead of the long lists of the past there were only seven,
including one that read, ``Rid the mass media of the henchmen of
the West.''
</P>
<P>
   But several years ago, Yeltsin issued a decree renaming the
holiday the ``Day of National Reconciliation and Agreement.'' And
to keep the Communists from rallying at Lenin's tomb, Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov sealed off Red Square with thousands of police, backed by
thousands more in riot gear. Even the backup meeting place of the
past, the Manezh Square, was now a glittering park and underground
mall, so the marchers were relegated to the square facing the KGB
building _ now used by its successor, the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a theme to the day, it was anger, dismay and
confusion. Slogans, chants and placards were a melange of nostalgia
and grievance, in which ``Power to the Soviets'' was just another
cry of rage, along with the banners demanding the ouster of
Yeltsin, the imprisonment of his ``team,'' the return of power to
the ``working man.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the more mundane protesters were groups carrying
ultranationalist or anti-Semitic banners, which have become more
pronounced as the economy has worsened. ``Yeltsin surrendered
Russia to be robbed by Zion,'' read one placard, while youths
dressed all in black proclaimed themselves the ``Black Hundreds,''
a name for ultranationists in czarist times.
</P>
<P>
   By agreement with the main Communist party, most of the more
rabid Communist groups were shunted off to Vasilievsky Hill, where
several hundred followers of radical organizations with names like
the National Bolshevik Party or Working Russia vented their fury.
One speaker roused approving guffaws when he declared that even if
Yeltsin died and were buried in Russia, he would dig up the body
and throw to the West, ``where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's most curious event was outside the Russian government
building, where several dozen monarchists gathered to pray for
those killed by the Bolsheviks in 1917 and to demand freedom for
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, who was
arrested in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``He freed the Chilean people of that international garbage, the
Communists,'' explained a speaker, who then expressed sympathy for
the people marching under Communist banners elsewhere in Moscow,
who were ``led on the same road to the abyss, first by Communism
and then by the liberalism of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the seemingly contradictory mix of Communism,
internationalism, Russian nationalism and religion at the various
points, the unifying strand was the shared invocation of an idyllic
past that never was, whether czarist Russia or Lenin's Soviet
Union, and a frustration with a present from which these protesters
had been excluded.
</P>
<P>
   According to a public opinion poll by the Russian Independent
Institute for Social and National Issues, only 13 percent of
Russians still hold to Communist ideology, and 77 percent of these
are poor. But the poll also found that 40 percent of those
questioned still believe that the Communists can return to power.
</P>
<P>
   In a message issued from his rest home in southern Russia,
however, Yeltsin suggested that even if they do return, they would
hardly be the same Communists. In their official platforms, he
noted, ``They are not only promising a `bright future' and social
equality, but also democracy, and private property, and free
enterprise, and a financial market. And not a wordk about the old
values _ the war on religion, the hegemony of the proletariat,
world revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the thousands of irate old Communists marching
through Moscow's center, many more millions were out in playgrounds
and streets enjoying a day off, including several hundred
Muscovites who queued up for an hour or more to view a new exhibit,
``Cezanne and the Russian Avant-Garde,'' at the Pushkin Museum of
Fine Arts.

`NEXT STOP, WATERLOO' PUTS FRENCH IN A SWOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Napoleon met his Waterloo only once. But French rail
travelers to London meet it every time they take the Eurostar train
to Waterloo Station, the British terminus of the high-speed line
under the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Florent Longuepee, a conservative French politician, said he had
actually never made the journey himself. But he wrote to British
Prime Minister Tony Blair last week asking him to call the station
after anything but the Belgian village where the duke of Wellington
defeated the French emperor in 1815.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of erasing this feat of arms, realized
with the Prussians at the expense of the French, from the history
of your country,'' wrote Longuepee, with just a twist of the knife
(his name means ``long sword'' in French).
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when we are building Europe,'' he wrote, ``it seems
appropriate that the British nation should agree to give this
station a new name.''
</P>
<P>
   If they didn't, he suggested, he would propose renaming the
French terminus of the line, the Gare du Nord, and calling it the
``Gare de Fontenoy,'' after another Belgian village, where Louis
XV's army beat the British in 1745 after chivalrously allowing them
to fire the first shots.
</P>
<P>
   His threat was weakened, Ben Macintyre noted Friday on the front
page of The Times of London, by the fact that few people in Britain
have ever heard of Fontenoy, whereas every French schoolchild knows
what Waterloo signified.
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the point of Longuepee's letter, Macintyre
said. ``The Channel Tunnel is a strong symbol, too, and I think
that a big effort should be made to make it a positive contribution
to the construction of Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waterloo Station predated the Channel Tunnel by more than a
century, taking its name from Waterloo Bridge over the Thames when
the South Western Railway extended the tracks to that point on the
river in 1848. A new terminal on its north side, widely acclaimed
on both sides of the Channel for its stunning steel-and-glass
design, opened when the Channel Tunnel did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been to London in years, and the last time I went
was before the tunnel was finished,'' said Longuepee, a member of
the Ile-de-France Regional Council for greater Paris. ``It's the
principle of the thing that I'm concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   The French could have renamed the Gare de l'Est, where trains
from Germany terminate in Paris, the Gare de Verdun, after the
French World War I victory, he observed, but they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London, in an editorial on the subject, said, ``If
the French really want to rename the Gare du Nord, they should
choose a more celebrated Norman victory, say, Hastings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The French Metro stations,'' the editorial also pointed out,
``are a roll of battle honor for the French and disgrace for the
losers: Sebastopol, Solferino, Stalingrad, Austerlitz. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Blair has not responded to Longuepee's letter. But, as the prime
minister chose the Waterloo terminal to announce his plans for
Britain's six-month presidency of the European Union in the spring
of 1997, it seemed unlikely that he would agree to a new name for
the station.

FRANCE HONORS VETERANS OF BRITAIN AS ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WWI-FRANCE-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Some live in nursing homes, as you might expect of men
who are pushing 100 years old, and few can walk without help. But
Saturday, on the 80th anniversary of the end of World War I, a
dozen or so surviving British veterans gathered here at a museum
devoted to the memory of war to receive one of France's highest
distinctions and to hear, in the most ringing tones, that they have
not been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 11th of November, 1918, at 11 a.m., the sound of bugles
echoed from trench to trench, ending a war that had scarred that
generation forever,'' said Daniel Bernard, France's ambassador to
Britain, as he affixed the Chevalier Cross of the Legion of Honor
onto the chest of each veteran in turn. ``British veterans of the
Great War, France wants you to know that she remembers, and from
the bottom of her heart says, `Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, France presented the medal to all French veterans
of the First World War. But Saturday, well aware that this is the
last time any significant number of World War I veterans is likely
to be alive on such a significant anniversary, the country searched
out veterans from around the world. It found about 200 in Britain.
Many were too infirm to come to the ceremony. Those who did attend
had clearly made the greatest of efforts to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, of course, a world war, and hundreds of thousands of
Allied soldiers made the supreme sacrifice on French soil,''
Bernard said. ``It is absolutely right to honor Allied veterans in
the same way as their French comrades.''
</P>
<P>
   As they sat stiffly in the grand atrium of the British War
Museum, with airplanes from past wars suspended over their heads
and dozens of proud relatives surrounding them, the men found their
minds going back to that terrible time many years ago, when they
were young and in the process of being irrevocably changed.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Marshall, 101 years old, remembered how he was shot in
his right hand and, after returning to Britain for treatment,
re-enlisted and went back to France to fight again.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Lorriman, a week shy of his 100th birthday, said that as
much as he tried to forget the horrors of war, the memory of his
lost friends and relatives kept flooding back.
</P>
<P>
   And Ernest Argall, 99, who worked as one of the world's first
wartime wireless operators, thrilled as he recalled the best
message that ever came across his radio: the message that the
armistice ending the war had been signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky in that I didn't have to fight in the trenches,''
Argall said. ``But you can't forget it. I lost dozens of school
friends, no end of friends. Their lives were chucked away, and I
came away with the overall impression that lives didn't matter. I
was really sickened by it, disgusted with the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorriman said he was delighted to accept the award, presented
with a Gallic double-kiss on the cheeks by the ambassador, on
behalf of all his fellow soldiers. ``I appreciate that the French
have decided to honor all the lads _ not just me,'' he said. ``What
would have happened to them without us, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the veterans said they had always been reluctant to talk
about their experiences, which took place at a time when men were
not supposed to complain, discuss their problems or weep for the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lost someone nearly every day, but you just met trouble as
it came,'' said Marshall, who served in the cavalry and machine gun
divisions and today sat proudly in his wheelchair in a tweed suit,
his chest heavy with medals. ``The shells and the bombs and the
machine guns and what you will. It was difficult to come back and
start a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's 67-year-old son, John, said his father had a
first-rate memory but had always been reticent about the war.
``He's seen such horrible things, that's the problem,'' said John
Marshall. ``We've learned more about his experiences in the last
few weeks, as today approached, then we'd ever learned before.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came during a weekend of remembrance, in which
Britain commemorates those who survived its wars, and those who did
not. In a nation that has seen two generations effectively wiped
out by this century's two great conflicts, war has always been a
part of life. But after 50 years of peace, the memories are fading
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unimaginable for our generation,'' said Caroline Kenyon,
sitting in the audience during the ceremony. ``This is particularly
relevant for me, because my grandfather was in the trenches for
four years during the war, and he never recovered. He had the most
terrible shell-shock, the most terrible nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Barratt, whose uncle, Clarence Luscombe, 99, fought in
the war by lying about his age when he volunteered, looked on with
affection as Luscombe stood tall and said ``Merci'' when he
received his medal. Next to her was her mother, Lily Ochiltree,
Luscombe's sister-in-law, for whom the ceremony brought on a double
set of emotions: Mrs. Ochiltree was 17 when a bomb fell on her
house in London during World War II, killing her parents and
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need remembering,'' Mrs. Barratt said of the
veterans. ``In France, as the ambassador said, it's a duty to
remember. I think that's true of all of us.''

   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ Soon after dawn each day, the promenade that
runs along the shore of the Caspian Sea fills with Americans and
other expatriates out for a morning run.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are Texas oilmen, and after dark they congregate at
Margaritaville, a Tex-Mex restaurant that features tacos,
enchiladas and refried beans. Gas executives from Louisiana prefer
the jambalaya and gumbo at another favorite haunt, the Ragin'
Cajun. Later, some join the newly rich Azerbaijanis who pack
glittery local discos.
</P>
<P>
   Once a distant and sleepy outpost of the Soviet Union, Baku is a
boom town where the scent of big money hangs in the air. Huge
amounts of oil and gas are believed to lie beneath the Caspian, and
three new nations that share its shoreline _ Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan
and Turkmenistan _ stand to reap billions of dollars from what
looks like the century's last big bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Caspian region is landlocked, however, pipelines
must be built to carry its oil to world markets. Oil companies are
soon to announce which route they prefer for their main export
pipeline from Baku.
</P>
<P>
   Many nations, including the United States, believe the decision
will have profound economic and geopolitical consequences, and are
lobbying intensely for their favored routes.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is far more than the fate of the complex Caspian region
itself. Rivalries being played out here will have a decisive impact
in shaping the post-communist world, and in determining how much
influence the United States will have over its development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about America's energy security, which depends on
diversifying our sources of oil and gas worldwide,'' said Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, who has put Caspian issues among his key
priorities. ``It's also about preventing strategic inroads by those
who don't share our values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to move these newly independent countries toward
the West,'' Richardson added. ``We would like to see them reliant
on Western commercial and political interests rather than going
another way. We've made a substantial political investment in the
Caspian, and it's very important to us that both the pipeline map
and the politics come out right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is making a final effort to persuade
oil companies that they should build their pipeline across Georgia
and Turkey, a route that would promote U.S. interests in the
region. Russia and Iran are pushing routes of their own, and urging
the companies not to commit themselves to the U.S.-backed one.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives must weigh pressure from Washington against a
backdrop of low oil prices and the worldwide economic downturn. In
this climate they are reluctant to commit themselves to
multibillion-dollar investments _ especially, perhaps, the
U.S.-backed proposal, which oil companies estimate will cost $4
billion. This is roughly double the estimate for the other plans,
which involve shorter distances.
</P>
<P>
   Lands around the Caspian have been political and military
battlegrounds almost since the dawn of history. The Persian,
Russian, Ottoman and British empires sacrificed countless lives and
enormous amounts of treasure to secure them. History's most
ambitious conquerors, from Genghis Khan and Tamerlane to Peter the
Great and Hitler, waged campaigns here.
</P>
<P>
   Early visitors to this region recorded their amazement at the
gaseous ``pillars of fire'' that rose from many meadows, and at the
black goo that spilled from the ground. The 13th-century adventurer
Marco Polo wrote that the goo, which we now call crude oil, was
inedible but ``good for burning.'' The very name Azerbaijan comes
from an ancient Persian word meaning ``garden of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan has already lived through one oil boom. It reached
its peak a century ago, led by pioneers with names like Nobel,
Rothschild and Rockefeller. Many of the Azerbaijanis who made
fortunes in that boom built elegant baroque and neoclassical
mansions in downtown Baku, and they stand today as links to a
fabled past.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, only two states bordered on the
Caspian Sea: the Soviet Union and Iran. Both had vast energy
reserves in other places, and neither paid much attention to those
under and around the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, however, the political geography of the
region changed radically. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan
emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union. All three have come to
realize that they control enough oil and gas to make them
fabulously rich.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to share in that wealth, energy companies from nearly 40
nations have descended on the Caspian. William Courtney, a senior
State Department official and former ambassador to Kazakhstan and
Georgia, has estimated that by 2010, foreign companies will invest
as much as $50 billion in Caspian oil fields alone, not counting
the billions they will spend to develop gas fields and build
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of well-dressed young Azerbaijanis stepping from shiny
Mercedes sedans and nodding at their bodyguards as they whisper
into cell phones no longer attracts attention here. Nor do reports
that one or another local ``oil shark'' has bought or ordered a
lavish estate and paid for it with suitcases full of hundred-dollar
bills. Clever entrepreneurs have already made millions of dollars
from the oil boom, and that is nothing compared to what may lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   From their offices here, oil executives can gaze out at a sea
dotted by oil platforms. But it is on the streets of Baku that the
effect of the boom is most palpable. New restaurants and bars seem
to open every week, some bearing names like Manhattan and
Shangri-La. Bewildered pensioners, survivors from another age,
wander past them begging for coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often that a whole region like this becomes
available,'' said Igor Effimov, who directs Pennzoil's operation
here from an office near the ancient city wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's guess that the market price for oil stays where it is
now, about $15 a barrel,'' Effimov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subtract about $5 a barrel for operating costs, transportation
and taxes,'' he added. ``What you're left with, the amount of money
that is going to hit this country could easily be $50 billion to
$100 billion or more. You and I will both be dead by the time all
that money finishes flowing in, but it is just a mind-boggling
number.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone can begin making these fortunes from Caspian oil,
however, a decision must be made about where to lay the main export
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1994 contract between Azerbaijan and 11 foreign oil
companies _ among them Pennzoil, Exxon and Amoco _ the companies
will recommend rather than dictate a pipeline location to the
Azerbaijani government. But since they will pay for whatever
pipeline is built, their recommendation carries great weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is fervently promoting a route that
runs from Baku through Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean. At
a port near the Turkish town of Ceyhan (pronounced JAY-han), the
oil would be loaded onto tankers for shipment to European markets.
</P>
<P>
   This Baku-Ceyhan route fulfills every U.S. condition. It passes
through only countries friendly to the United States _ Azerbaijan,
Georgia and Turkey _ and avoids both Russia and Iran. It would also
pull the Caspian region away from Russia's shadow and toward the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Caspian nations met in Turkey on Oct. 29 and signed a
declaration favoring the U.S.-backed route. But they did not offer
any financial support to reduce its $4 billion estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has told oil companies that for
political reasons it cannot give them large subsidies to build the
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. Instead it is pressing Turkey to do so.
Turkish leaders are reportedly open to the idea because they badly
want the pipeline, but have not yet produced a package of
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's special envoy to the Caspian countries, Richard
Morningstar, is working to persuade Turkey to improve its offer,
and says he believes Turkish officials are responding.
</P>
<P>
   For half the estimated cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline,
however, oil companies might build a line either southward through
Iran to the Persian Gulf or northward to the Russian port of
Novorossisk on the Black Sea. A route to Georgia's Black Sea port
of Supsa is shorter and would be even cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipelines are supposed to be built for commercial reasons, not
political reasons,'' said Robert Ebel, an energy specialist at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``The
plan to build through Turkey emerged as a way to help Turkey, and
because our government doesn't want a pipeline through Iran. But
that doesn't put the project on a paying basis.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude, which is widespread in the oil business, drives
some U.S. officials to distraction. They are deeply convinced that
building a pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan is vital to the United
States' long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives, however, stubbornly insist on their right to
choose the cheapest alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Overseas Petroleum president Richard Matzke said the
Baku-Ceyhan option favored by the United States ``probably isn't
the most rational solution at the moment,'' and other oil
executives agree. As a result, some administration officials have
privately concluded that the Baku-Ceyhan line is not going to be
built in the next few years. They believe the oil companies are
preparing to announce that they will build a line only as far as
Georgia, leaving open the possibility of a future extension to
Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is preparing to portray the decision
for Georgia as a victory, on the grounds that the pipeline will be
built along an ``east-west axis'' rather than north through Russia
or south through Iran. And Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
asserted recently that ``an obituary for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline
is at least premature and, we believe, wrong and inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   If oil companies announce that they will only build a pipeline
as far as Georgia's Black Sea coast, they must decide what to do
with the oil once it reaches there. The only maritime route out of
the Black Sea is through the Bosporus, which runs through the
center of Istanbul and is already so crowded that the Turkish
government has announced plans to limit its ship traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine say they have the
ideal alternative. They want to receive Caspian oil at ports on the
western shore of the Black Sea, and then send it to European
markets on barges or through existing pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials scoff at these proposals. ``We don't see them
as practical and we don't see who would finance them,'' said a
White House aide. ``Baku-Ceyhan is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much oil and gas lie in the Caspian region vary
widely, often according to results of the most recent test
drillings. A few dry holes were hit last summer, and several tracts
in the Azerbaijani sector turned out to contain gas instead of oil.
That news, together with low oil prices and the Asian financial
crisis, has calmed the frenzy in Baku a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very interesting split of oil people on one hand and
geopoliticians on the other,'' said Thane Gustafson, a
Washington-based energy consultant. ``The geopoliticians are still
breathing heavily, but for the oil people it's more like a sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new Caspian nations, the prospect of riches remains very
real. Their energy reserves are valued in the hundreds of billions
or even trillions of dollars. Without doubt they have more oil than
Alaska, probably at least as much as the North Sea and possibly
half as much as Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estimates range from 20 to 200 billion barrels,'' said Paul
Millar, a British government official who monitors developments in
the Caspian. ``The true figure is more likely somewhere in between,
but it is a brave person that approaches their bank or shareholders
for funding on a market estimate that could vary by plus or minus
90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   This uncertainty has made oil companies reluctant to support
multibillion-dollar pipeline projects like the one Washington is
backing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Caspian region turns out only to have as much
oil as pessimists believe, its strategic importance is all but
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not really about oil,'' said Julia Nanay, a
Washington-based consultant who works with oil companies active in
the Caspian. ``It's about defense politics and world strategy.
Whether you're talking about containing Russian influence or
helping Turkey or containing Iran or building up new states in the
region, oil is just a political cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New oil is being found in Mexico, Venezuela, West Africa and
other places,'' she added, ``but it isn't getting the same
attention, because you don't have these huge strategic rivalries.
There is no other place in the world where so many people and
countries and companies are competing.''  &QL;

DOWN THE STRETCH COMES A FEUD FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ This is Churchill Downs, but somehow the place
has a different feel and texture during Breeders' Cup week. Not so
light and effervescent, as when it is host to the event for which
it is so widely known _ the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   This is a different atmosphere. There is the familiar early
morning buzz of activity as grooms, trainers and practice riders
move through the bone-chilling dawn air in brisk, syncopated
rhythms, getting the horses ready, moving them out, bringing them
back in. What you feel is not excitement but tightly wound tension,
the tension of a truly great competition. Instead of the Derby, it
is the 15th Breeders' Cup _ in particular, the mile-and-a-quarter
Classic, which is being portrayed as one of the great horse races
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby attracts a crowd of about 140,000 on the first
Saturday in May; the seven races in Saturday's Breeders' Cup will
draw half that many. A large number of those who attend the Derby
are not horse racing fans but tourists, or students who crowd the
infield, or novices drawn by the lure of an event that has run
nonstop for 123 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby is a party. The Breeders' Cup, especially this one, is
not. It's a celebration of racing at its finest, but no party. The
mood, like the weather, is crisp, clear and highly focused. ``This
is like the races of races,'' said the trainer Patrick Byrne, who
will have a significant role in Saturday's drama. ``This is more
about the industry, the breeders, the core racing fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The featured event Saturday afternoon is a long-awaited meeting
between Skip Away, the 1997 Classic winner and the loser of only
one race this year, and Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner and the 1998 winner of the Dubai Cup. They're
competing in a field of 10 horses that is being called one of the
strongest ever assembled. The Breeders' Cup Classic hasn't seen a
drumroll like this since Sunday Silence edged Easy Goer in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic had one other highly anticipated duel, and it also
lived up to expectations. In 1987, Ferdinand and Alysheba staged
the first race between two Kentucky Derby winners. Ferdinand, a
year older than Alysheba, beat him by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made over the financial implications of the race:
if Skip Away finishes third or better, he overtakes Cigar and
becomes the first race horse to earn $10 million. Earlier in the
week, R.D. Hubbard became the first owner to pay an $800,000 fee
for the right to run a horse in a race when he supplemented
Gentlemen into the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm not intrigued by the financial implications of this
great race. In fact, I'm tired of financial implications as a
marker of an athlete's value _ be they human or be they horse. The
most compelling dimension of this Breeders' Cup is that, in the
Classic, it is providing one of the great showdowns in racing
history: Skip Away; Silver Charm; Gentlemen, with his 13 victories
in 23 career starts; Awesome Again, a Byrne horse who is undefeated
in five starts this year; Touch Gold, Byrne's other horse in the
race and the winner of the Belmont Stakes a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   We're looking at the equivalent of undefeated teams meeting in
the Super Bowl, or the perfect-game pitcher facing the champion
home run hitter. This is one of those days _ too rare in horse
racing, boxing and track and field _ when the best meets the best.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Byrne is right in the middle of it. Last year at
this time he was reveling in the glow of seeing his 2-year-old
horse, Favorite Trick, win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, a victory
that clinched Horse of the Year honors for the horse and Trainer of
the Year honors for Byrne. But Byrne had to abandon Favorite Trick
when he signed a five-year contract to become the trainer for Frank
Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Byrne admitted that he was feeling the
pressure, not simply of having two horses in the Classic, but of
the weight of having been a king and trying to do it again. ``Once
you've hit the big times and you start to produce these major
stakes winners, you're expected to turn out stakes winners,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four running tomorrow and expect to have a good shot
in the Classic and the Sprint,'' he added. But, good chance or not,
that tension was there, and Byrne acknowledged it, attributing it
to the uncertainty of the seven races and the knowledge that in a
race of the Classic's magnitude, with an unprecedented field, even
the very best effort might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about horse racing,'' he said, walking back
to his stable. ``Anything can happen. You just never know.''

   After months of hedging, Russia acknowledged that it will

loans. Its coalition government put the blame on a collapsing
currency. But the looming default also reflects Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's failure to put together an economic plan that
would advance market reforms _ and win funds from the International
Monetary Fund. Russia will also get 1.5 million tons of wheat and
$600 million from the United States to buy more American-grown food
next month, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. Russia's food
stocks, its government says, have fallen sixfold, to two or three

   Parenting Help Is Just a Click Away &QL;

<P>
   The moment comes to every parent. The baby won't sleep. The
toddler won't toddle. The middle-schooler can't get herself out the
door to school on time. The high-schooler demands to be taken to
the mall _  &UR; again. &LR;  And the parent, heaving a sigh and searching
the ceiling for answers, wails, ``What do I do now?''
</P>
<P>
   Time was, those beaten-down parents would seek out some
homegrown wisdom, either by calling Mom or leaning over the
neighbor's fence. But Mom might well be busy at the office, and the
neighbor's fence _ oh, need it even be said? _ has been replaced by
a glowing screen with a keyboard in front of it. Now it's the
Internet that offers to be the ultimate dispenser of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The National Parent Information Network is just a click away,
its site (www.npin.org) financed by the Education Department. It
gives advice on everything from the impact of television violence
to helping children make friends at school, has links to other
useful sites and even allows you to send e-mail questions detailing
your parental woes.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a second. What if the woe in question is that you can't
get your children off the computer? If so, you'll never even get to
the computer, much less be able to emit your electronic wail.

   A New Pill for Staying Awake
</P>
<P>
   Sleep may be, as Samuel Coleridge once observed, ``a gentle
thing,'' but Americans don't get nearly enough of it. And in a
perpetually sleep-deprived country, staying awake is big business,
lining drugstore shelves with wake-up pills and sleeping potions,
and filling the cash registers at Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to boost alertness through chemical means have proved
frustrating: Caffeine isn't very strong. More powerful stimulants,
like amphetamines and ritalin, are riddled with side effects and
prone to abuse. But a novel compound awaiting approval by the Food
and Drug Administration may usher in a new generation of
wakefulness drugs that tap into the human body's own mechanisms for
staying awake.
</P>
<P>
   Modafinil, called Provigil by Cephalon Inc., the
Pennsylvania-based company that wants to market it, is already
available in Europe and has been shown in American clinical trials
to increase daytime alertness in people with narcolepsy, a severe
sleep disorder. The drug may also prove helpful for other sleep
disorders, says Dr. Dale Edgar, a Stanford University School of
Medicine researcher who has done animal studies of modafinil
financed by Cephalon and the Air Force Office of Research.
</P>
<P>
   The drug does not seem to be addictive, appears to have few side
effects and in studies did not trigger the ``rebound'' sleepiness
typical of amphetamines. Scientists don't know how the compound
works, but they suspect it acts on the brain's biological clock,
causing it to fight back built-up sleep pressure beyond the point
when it would normally shut off, allowing sleep to descend.
</P>
<P>
   No wakefulness drug is a substitute for getting sleep, Edgar
cautions. And serious side effects can emerge once a new drug
enters the market and is widely prescribed; the same could happen
with modafinil, which so far has only been taken by a limited
number of patients. But eventually, says Dr. David Dinges, a
University of Pennsylvania scientist, a drug will emerge that will
allow people to forego sleep. When it does, it will raise thorny
ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we know what sleep is for,'' Dinges says, ``we're not
going to be able to say it's OK to find a substitute for it.''

   LUXURY TAX
</P>
<P>
   When the collective bargaining agreement was negotiated two
years ago, the owners and players agreed to a luxury tax that the
owners hoped would serve as a deterrent to spending. The teams with
the five highest payrolls would pay a 35 percent tax on the portion
of their payrolls that was above a certain threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement stipulated thresholds for each season unless
payrolls dictated an adjustment, which would be determined by
averaging the fifth and sixth highest payrolls. How fast have
payrolls escalated? The agreement provided for a threshold of $55
million this year; the average of the fifth and sixth highest
payrolls will be about $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Aug. 31 payrolls, which did not include earned
performance and award bonuses, the Baltimore Orioles owed the
biggest tax payment, $2,463,418. They were followed by Boston
$1,801,362; Atlanta $993,940; the Yankees $714,270, and Cleveland
$483,751.

   BATTING 9TH, BROSIUS SURPASSED 7 TEAMS' TOP RBI MAN
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, who last week re-enlisted for three years of
Yankees service, drove in more runs _ 98 _ batting at or near the
bottom of the lineup than the RBI leader of seven teams _ the
Angels, the Twins, the Devil Rays, the Diamondbacks, the Reds, the
Marlins and the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   WRONG NUMBER
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mackay, not Jim Leyland, answered the telephone. Mackay is
not the new manager of the Colorado Rockies; Leyland is. Mackay
wasn't answering the telephone at Leyland's home in Pittsburgh; he
was answering it in the office of Computer Technology and
Australian Products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We write Internet software,'' Mackay said, ``basically auction
software so companies can host live auctions and have customers bid
on products.''
</P>
<P>
   But why was Leyland's telephone number ringing at an auction
software office?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very old number,'' Mackay said. ``We've gotten
thousands of calls. The worst thing is I've asked people who have
the other number to call me back so that I can forward the number.
But no one will give it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay is an Australian, but two years in Pittsburgh have made
him familiar with the former manager of the Pirates and the World
Series champion Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly who Jimmy Leyland is,'' Mackay said. ``The
press gives him pretty good coverage in this town. When the Marlins
won, who do you think got all the calls until 3 in the morning
congratulating him? I said boy, who is this Jimmy Leyland who has
friends calling him at 3 in morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay said the company has had Leyland's old number for two
years, since he left the Pirates for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   REGGIE AND GEORGE
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Reggie Jackson was spared the humiliation Darryl
Strawberry suffered last week when a public relations man working
for George Steinbrenner disclosed to reporters what he said were
Strawberry's debts to the Internal Revenue Service and a former
wife.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Steinbrenner was doing everything he could to disparage
Jackson, who was in the last year of his five-year contract with
the Yankees. At one point the owner called reporters and told them,
not for attribution to him, that Jackson owed money all over town.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare instance of self-control where a Steinbrenner leak was
concerned, the reporters did not write the story, and the tale of
Jackson's debts, fact or fiction, never surfaced.

THE JOB OF TURNING DODGER BLUE TO TICKLED PINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the statistical rankings that determine the level of
draft-choice compensation for free agents, three teams each had 15
players emerge as Type A players. One, the New York Yankees, won
the World Series. Another, the Cleveland Indians, lost to the
Yankees in the American League Championship Series. The third was
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can call it underachieving,'' Kevin Malone,
the Dodgers' new general manager, said of the third-place team.
``There were some guys who didn't live up to the expectations of
others. But that's all past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' present began Friday. Deciding they couldn't sign
both Randy Johnson and Bernie Williams, the Dodgers recruited Devon
White to play center field for them. Six years older and less
productive offensively than Williams, White cost about one-eighth
as much as Williams might have.
</P>
<P>
   Now Malone can turn his attention to Johnson, whose lanky
6-foot-10-inch body could be a prized ornament on anyone's pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have the financial support in Los Angeles, but we also
have to be fiscally responsible,'' Malone said. ``I'm going to go
after the best players and do the best we can. But I will be well
aware of what the price will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fox Group bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley
family before last season, next year's team will be the first
bearing the indelible Fox imprint. The purge of O'Malley era
employees is complete. The people in charge of the product on the
field are not Dodgers' lifers. If the newcomers are to bleed Dodger
blue, they will have to get a transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, from Baltimore out of Montreal, hired a manager who had
been hired and basically fired in New York, Cincinnati and
Baltimore. Davey Johnson, whose 10 full seasons of managing in the
major leagues have ended in first or second place, is the best
manager who has the toughest time securing and holding a job.
</P>
<P>
   He often is portrayed as being difficult for the front office to
handle. ``I don't know how I got that reputation,'' he said. ``But
I'm going to work on it.'' While he works on adding to his
first-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson could be expected to anticipate with delight the
addition of a front-line pitcher or position player. But his
thoughts as winter approaches are on different areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can write down eight names and stick them in the
lineup,'' Johnson said. ``It's kind of clearcut who the regulars
are going to be. But it's the use of the bullpen and the bench that
makes the difference. If the bullpen and the bench aren't flexible,
you have troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the areas that count late in the game with matchups
and versatility. That can be the difference between winning and
losing. A lot of times clubs just fill those roles with a rookie
here, a rookie there. But I think it's the most important part of
your club.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cited the Yankees of the last three years as a team that
has benefited from a strong bullpen and a good bench. ``I've tried
to create that versatility on any team that I've managed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who was the Orioles' assistant general manager during
Johnson's two years as their manager, readily agreed with Johnson's
view of those often overlooked elements of a team. He plans to
upgrade those areas at the same time he seeks to fortify the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Malone wanted to improve the defense in center field, and he did
with the signing of White. He wants to balance the lineup by adding
left-hand hitting, presumably more than White, who is a
switch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't say so, Malone ideally would like to sign the
left-handed slugger Mo Vaughn to play first base and trade the
right-hand hitting Karros. He also wants to trade Bobby Bonilla as
part of his salary-saving strategy because the salary-spending
strategy centers on signing Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have quality starters,'' Malone said, referring to Chan Ho
Park, Carlos Perez, Ismael Valdes and Darren Dreifort. ``If you
could add a front-line starter, it would make us even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Malone said, is putting together the best group
of people. ``We've seen that having the best players on a team
doesn't guarantee a championship,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
factors besides pure statistical information. There are some
intangibles involved. When you add players in this day and age, you
have to consider their makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone knows whereof he speaks. He saw baseball's highest
payroll self-destruct last season in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had too many selfish, egotistical players,'' he said. ``We
didn't have one common goal to win. Everybody was more concerned
about their individual stats. Not everybody, but we had too many
individual players and not enough team players.''

   DOBRE VODE, Yugoslavia _ Sanije Millaku, the mother of six
children and a proud homeowner, fondly remembers the new bedroom
set and the pots of yellow roses arranged on the window sill before
the start of the terrible summer.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, she came down from her makeshift camp in the
hills to find her house burned, the fancy furniture a heap of fine
white ashes and her clay pots baked with melted glass that was once
her bedroom windows.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ethnic Albanian refugees of Kosovo, pushed out of
their villages by the tanks and artillery of Serbian forces, have
returned to their houses. But what they find is hardly home.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Drenica Valley, the heart of operations of the
separatist ethnic Albanian fighters, there is plenty of evidence of
destruction for destruction's sake as the Serbs moved in to punish
the civilian population that supported the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Backyard wells have been filled with the carcasses of animals
slaughtered by Serbian soldiers for food; the blackboards and desks
in the schoolhouse in Dobre Vode have been burned and the windows
smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Simple things, like the theft of a sewing machine motor and
dainty coffee cups flung from a window, seem especially intended to
inflict pain.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, bowed to NATO and
withdrew about 4,500 Serbian special police officers from Kosovo
nearly two weeks ago, almost all the ethnic Albanian refugees who
had been camping in the hills have moved indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the well-armed Serbian policemen camped in their
villages, even in their homes, had been the ultimate deterrent to
returning home. Now that the refugees are out of the hills, many
are doubling up with friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Some are sleeping in their cars. Others have found a room or two
still intact at home and a few lucky ones have found relatively
little damage.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophe depicted by U.S. officials of refugees dying
from the cold in the snow above the tree line appears to have been
averted. But many of the 250,000 refugees that the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees estimates were swirling around Kosovo
during the height of the fighting still lack proper shelter.
</P>
<P>
   And many say they still feel skittish about their security.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 Serbian special policemen remain in this southern
province, the number that NATO officials said they and Milosevic
had agreed was the level of the force before the fighting began
last March.
</P>
<P>
   These policemen, according to an agreement signed by Milosevic
and the NATO supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, on Oct. 25, are allowed to man 27 ``observation posts'' in
designated areas. Under the agreement, only nine of these posts are
to be manned ``initially.''
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be enough maneuvering around the edges of the
agreement to crimp the confidence of the refugees that they will be
safe at home.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees reported on Thursday,
for example, that the Serbian police were using an earthmover to
dig what appeared to be a new post at Orlate, near Malisevo. The
agency said the arrival of truckloads of policemen at Cermyljan,
near Djakovica, had caused newly returned refugees to flee again.
</P>
<P>
   Reports filed by the Kosovo Diplomatic Observers Mission, which
consists of observers from the United States, Western Europe and
Russia, say the Serbian police are continuing patrols intended to
harass returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, on the border with Montenegro, Serbia's sole
partner in the Yugoslav Federation, 11 ethnic Albanians returning
to their homes in Kosovo were taken off a bus and are still being
held by the Serbian police in Pec, the refugee agency said. Agency
officials said the incident was not an isolated one.
</P>
<P>
   What should be the more solvable problem of making damaged homes
livable for winter is also difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about 20,000 houses that need to be rebuilt,''
said Margaret O'Keefe, the refugee agency's director in Serbia.
``Even if houses look OK from the outside, you go inside and you
find the walls are crumbling.'' It is a race against the snow to
get the homes patched together, she said.

</P>
<P>
   The southern flanks of Kosovo, along the Cursed Mountains
bordering Albania, are already curtained with snow. Further inland,
temperatures fall below freezing at night.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, rain and mud made for miserable conditions as
returning refugees tried to clean up gutted houses and drain
damaged water wells.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Millaku, 40, and her husband, Ibrahim, 45, seemed at a loss
where to start. Not a room in their home of 16 years was habitable.
Rain poured through windows where the glass had melted from the
fire that burned in rooms filled with furniture and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've collected some cooking pots, some wire and a few
things,'' Millaku said as he pointed to a pile of belongings.
``There isn't much that is useful that they didn't ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity throughout the Drenica region has been cut, the main
switchboards gutted, said Millaku, who works for the electric
utility.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from the hills five nights ago, the eight
members of the family have taken turns sleeping in their
four-seater car and on the floor of a neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees and other
agencies have started to distribute plastic sheeting, like that
which became almost a landmark in besieged Sarajevo, taking the
place of windows blown out by artillery fire. But in a string of
villages in western Drenica, no sheeting was evident Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother Teresa agency, the local ethnic Albanian group that
distributes much of the U.N. supplies, turned up in Dobre Vode for
the first time Saturday, Millaku said, dropping off flour, cooking
oil and pasta, ``but nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In Trdevac, just east of Dobre Vode, the Ramaj family appeared
more upbeat. They were out in their field Saturday, plowing with
the tractor on which they had fled to the hills during the Serbian
offensive. Nexhme Din Ramaj, 15, was planting two sacks of wheat
seed, which if all goes well, he said, will be harvested next July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs burned the house, but left us one room,'' he said.
``And they didn't touch the seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the agencies said, refugees appear to be
returning to regions where the Kosovo Liberation Army had been the
strongest. In these areas, like Drenica, the guerrillas appear to
have bounced back, appearing in uniforms and with rifles at
checkpoints and driving around in cars.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, they have taken over positions on roads or in
houses vacated by the Serbian police, helping to give the returning
refugees a sense of security. The refugees said they still
supported the fighters even though the Serbian forces had destroyed
much of their property because they suspected them of harboring
guerrillas,
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safer if our fighters are around the village,'' said
Sinan Gashi, 35, as he showed visitors around his compound of three
homes in the village of Cabic. Two of the houses are unlivable; the
third is overflowing with his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest house, an unfinished structure high on a hill,
the Serbian police had gouged sniper holes in the walls. Spent
bullets littered the floor.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Gashi said, he doubted that the presence of the
fighters made the village a target. But spring, he said, when many
fear the fighting between Serbian forces and the guerrillas will
erupt again, was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the political and military situation if we
rebuild,'' he said. ``If we rebuild they could come and burn us
down again.''

<P>
   TRINIDAD, Colo. _ Perched for the last century on the sandstone
facade of the First National Bank building here, three impish
gargoyles have watched the changing foot traffic on Main Street, as
this small Plains city reinvented itself again and again.
</P>
<P>
   When cattle was king, this proud building of Romanesque arches
was the headquarters of a vast cattle and land empire. When coal
was king, the back offices became a health clinic for the United
Mine Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   With tourism now the king in Colorado, the former union clinic
receives medical travelers from around the world who have come to
consult a surgeon who has made this town known as ``the sex-change
capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boon to business here,'' the surgeon, Stanley Biber,
said of his specialty in this town 200 miles south of Denver.
``They come with families, they stay in the hotels, they eat in the
restaurants, they buy at the florists.''
</P>
<P>
   Biber, a vigorous 75-year-old, has performed 3,800 sex-change
operations at the 70-bed Mount San Rafael Hospital over almost 30
years. ``The transsexual work means the difference between the
hospital being in the red or being in the black,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad boosters wince at the sex-change label, preferring, in
one brochure, to promote their town of 10,000 people as ``a pocket
of peace, plentiful clean air and pure Western Americana.'' They
talk of the year (1882) that Bat Masterson served as town marshal,
of modern Trinidad's four museums and of its red-brick Victorian
buildings downtown. Indeed, if ski mountains were near, this town
could be another Aspen or Telluride.
</P>
<P>
   But with the nearby Comanche National Grasslands a tepid tourist
attraction, some residents are toying with taking the sex-change
industry out of Trinidad's closet.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit on Biber ``would be really interesting,'' said Paula
Manini, director of the Trinidad History Museum, adding, ``Of
course, I am sure other people in the community would think it
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Biber's story began here in 1954, when he came to Trinidad fresh
from service in Korea in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or MASH,
unit. He grew up in Iowa and wanted to be a surgeon and a cowboy.
So after Army service, he chose Trinidad, on the Purgatoire River,
which meanders through 2.5 million acres of range land in
Colorado's largest county, Las Animas.
</P>
<P>
   As the coal mines played out, Biber's medical practice with
mining families shrank. In 1969, he stumbled on a new line of work.
A social worker, whom Biber knew as a woman, but in fact was a man,
asked the surgeon if he could perform a sex-change operation. With
the confidence of a war surgeon, and with drawings obtained from a
Baltimore sex-change surgeon, Biber removed the man's penis in an
operation known as penectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Biber's new practice was booming from word-of-mouth
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did the first sex changes, we kept the patient charts
in the administrator's safe,'' Biber recalled. ``Then we realized
we had to bring the local people into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting local religious leaders, Biber lectured about what
doctors now call ``gender dysphoria'' _ the condition of a person
who feels trapped in the body of the wrong sex.
</P>
<P>
   From 50,000 to 75,000 people live as transsexuals, or opposite
from the sex they were at birth, said Nancy Nangeroni, executive
director of the International Foundation for Gender Education, a
nonprofit group in Waltham, Mass. Since George Jorgensen became
Christine in a 1952 operation in Denmark, an estimated 25,000
Americans have had sex-changing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Botzer, a Seattle counselor of transsexuals, who came
here for sex-change surgery in 1981, recalled one friend who
arrived clutching Biber's fee in small bills in a paper bag. Biber
now charges about $11,000 for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan Biber certainly was a pioneer,'' Dr. Eugene Schrang, one
of a handful of American surgeons specializing in sex-change
operations, said from his clinic in Wisconsin. ``He probably has
done more operations than anyone else in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the early 1980s, when few surgeons would perform the
operations, about two-thirds of the nation's sex-change surgeries
were done at Mount San Rafael Hospital, which became a private
nonprofit hospital in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, unfavorable publicity about Biber and the
procedure led him and other surgeons to draw up guidelines to
eliminate sex-change surgery on demand. Most candidates now must go
through two psychiatric evaluations, live and dress in their new
role for at least a year, and undergo nine months of hormone
treatments _ testosterone for women and estrogen for men.
</P>
<P>
   Biber said that he regularly turned away patients who were not
psychologically ready for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon said that only three of his 3,800 patients, all men,
had been so unhappy in their new sex that they had insisted on
switching back. In recent years, he said, there has been a major
shift in the sex of his patients, from overwhelmingly male to 50-50
today.
</P>
<P>
   A pillar of the community, Dr. Biber has served as county
commissioner. He lives on a ranch east of town where he and his
wife reared nine children, and he keeps the hospital open despite a
50 percent population drop since the 1950s. As Trinidad's general
surgeon for almost half a century, Biber has performed conventional
surgeries on many of the town's residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Biber's everybody's friend. Everybody knows him,'' said
Janet Scott, a volunteer at the A.R. Museum of Western Art, on East
Main Street near the bank building. ``A lot of people begrudge him
for making Trinidad, you know, the sex-change capital of the world.
But I think he does a lot of good. Those people are very
troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as sex-change surgery becomes more mainstream, the road to
Trinidad is less traveled. Biber is cutting back to one surgery a
week from three, and younger surgeons are building up specialized
practices in more accessible cities, like Detroit, Montreal and
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   As American transsexuals become more public and politically
active, community leaders are looking back in appreciation at the
pioneering role played by Biber in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one out there doing it, when no one else was,'' Ms.
Nangeroni said from Massachusetts. ``Back then, the road to
Trinidad represented the only path available for sex
reassignment.''

AID DRIBBLES TO HONDURANS FROM SKIES THAT BROUGHT DISASTER  
(JT)

   OROCUINA, Honduras _ The helicopter descended on this village in
southern Honduras like some giant insect of the Apocalypse,
ratcheting the air and sending a whirlwind across the muddy soccer
field where it alighted.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers swarmed from the trees ringing the field and ran
toward the Mexican Air Force helicopter. Many looked exhausted,
ragged, hollow eyed, muddy. Several children had red eyes, a sign
of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the crowd had unloaded a small shipment of food
and medicine donated by charities in the capital, Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creek flooded and carried away 15 houses,'' said Jesus
Montoya, a teacher. ``We are completely isolated because we don't
have any way to get to the regional capital. For eight days we've
been isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   This village of 4,500 people, with tiled roofs and an immaculate
white church, lies along what used to be a sparkling stream in the
hills of Choluteca Province. Like thousands of other hamlets in
Honduras, it was cut off from the rest of the world by one of the
freakiest hurricanes in history, the storm called Mitch. The storm
crawled slowly over Central America for a week, dumping two feet of
rain and killing more than 10,000 people in landslides and floods.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days, the residents of Orocuina have lived without
electricity or clean water. Their food has dwindled and the Mayor
has started rationing. There is an epidemic of conjunctivitis, and
the local doctor has diagnosed three cases of cholera. People are
beginning to feel desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Although far from the Atlantic waters that spawned Mitch,
Choluteca Province was particularly hard hit by the storm. The
Choluteca River and all its tributaries flooded, knocking out
dozens of bridges, including two major ones on the highway to the
Pacific port of San Lorenzo.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Choluteca, block after block of houses have been
completely buried in mud. The huge plantations of melons and sugar
cane along the river that provided most of the jobs have been wiped
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected this to happen,'' said Dario Rivera, a local
businessman who was helping organize aid deliveries. ``Everyone
thought it was going to be a small storm. The problem we have in
Choluteca is transportation. The bridges are down and the roads are
broken and there is no way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mexican Air Force personnel arrived in Honduras
with 16 helicopters and began distributing a small amount of food
and medicine to people in the south. The quantity distributed
Friday afternoon to four municipalities by one of the helicopters
was small compared with the number of people who asked for food.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Liure, Mayor Virgilio Gomez said the storm had
destroyed 60 houses. The 270 people left homeless are living in the
church and other shelters. Two local bridges were knocked out,
making it impossible to get to Choluteca. Telephone and electricity
lines are down.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Liure and Orocuina is repeated to various
degrees in thousands of villages throughout Honduras. With roads
and other installations shredded by the floods, the only hope for
most people is some kind of airlift. In the last week, the United
States Air Force has distributed 345,000 pounds of food and other
supplies with 17 helicopters flying from its base in Palmerola, 30
miles west of the capital. Mexico shipped about 700 tons of food to
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   But the scale of the problem appears to dwarf the relief
efforts. Leaders in all four villages visited by the Mexican
helicopter Friday said they had received no aid since the storm
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off from the outside world, a group of men from Liure tried
to walk the 20 or so miles to Choluceta last week, fording streams
and wading through polluted flood plains for a day, only to find
they could not get back to the village with supplies for three more
days.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one was killed in Liure, townspeople say they feel as
if their livelihoods have been savaged.
</P>
<P>
   The rains have destroyed at least half of the bean and corn
crops in the municipality, Gomez said. Worse still, the floods
carried away the nearest melon plantation, where at least 700 of
the town's 1,270 inhabitants worked. The shelves at the local
stores are empty, cleaned out by people hoarding food. There is no
electricity. The drinking water is contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   In their isolation and desperation, town leaders ordered
villagers to build a path of rocks across the stream bisecting
their town, but despite three days of work they still cannot move a
bus or car across the rapidly flowing waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't count on anything,'' Gomez said.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Helen Cluett remembers the indignities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, when she tried to register as a Republican after moving
to Florida from New York, a courthouse clerk told her flat out,
``There's no such thing as a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so Southern she didn't know,'' said Ms. Cluett, an
auction house representative in Palm Beach. ``The state was less
than 10 percent Republican when I registered. For years I couldn't
vote for governor because no Republican ran. We've come a long,
long way, and I can't believe it's in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   If longtime Florida Republicans walk around giddy these days, it
can be traced to a few words uttered by former President George
Bush in a Miami hotel ballroom Tuesday night: ``May I introduce to
you the next governor of Florida, Jeb Bush!''
</P>
<P>
   To the former president, Jeb Bush's victory meant having two
sons in charge of two of the nation's most populous states, Texas
and Florida. And to Florida Republicans, it meant that their state
became the first in the South since Reconstruction to have both a
Republican governor and a Republican majority in the Legislature, a
dominance that gives the party a formidable power base for the next
presidential election and the redrawing of legislative district
lines after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The victory comes when Republicans like Jeb Bush and his
brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, are redefining what voters can
expect of a Republican administration. Jeb Bush epitomized an
ideological flux, toning down the hard-edge conservatism that
characterized his unsuccessful run for the governorship in 1994 to
become an advocate of compassion and inclusion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he raised the hopes not only of Republican
constituencies that expect him to be friendly to business and
hostile to taxes, but also of liberal Democrats and minority groups
who expect him to improve public schools, open up economic
opportunity and listen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect Jeb Bush not to be a politician, but I'm
convinced that Jeb Bush will not sacrifice service to be
politically expedient,'' said T. Willard Fair, president of the
Urban League of Greater Miami and a partner with Bush in the
founding in 1996 of a charter school in Miami's inner city that has
raised student test scores. ``I don't think he'll make decisions
that would impact adversely on a group of people.''
</P>
<P>
   At his first news conference as governor-elect last week, Bush,
a 45-year-old real estate businessman, was specific on what
Floridians could expect from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think crime will drop,'' he said. ``I believe that they'll
have an assurance that their taxes won't go up. They will see a new
system of educating our kids, where they're going to see better
results, where more children aren't going to be left behind, where
reading scores will go up, particularly in the primary grade
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush also set a tone of diversity. He announced that the top
members of his transition team would be a black man, a Hispanic man
and a white woman, and said Republican rule ``does not mean that we
don't need to create consensus and build some common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle-of-the road approach echoes that of other successful
candidates for governor and underscores that voters reward those
catching on to the country's centrist leanings. In Florida,
Democrats say they do not expect a dramatic tilt to the right,
mostly because the conservative Democrats who dominated Florida
politics in the past often voted with moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the changing of the guard in Tallahassee
will not be noticed. Bills passed by the Republican-led Legislature
that were vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat who is retiring,
but that Bush would be expected to sign include one that would
require parental notification of a minor's plans for abortion, tort
reform that would make it tougher for consumers to sue businesses
and a tax rebate for property owners.
</P>
<P>
   John Thrasher, a Republican who will be speaker in the Florida
House of Representatives, said Republican legislators were looking
forward to ``a governor we can work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But many others expect a friend in the governor's mansion as
well. By broadening his base, Bush will likely face intense
cross-pressures, especially from Republican fiscal and social
conservatives who do not always agree.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters leaving polling places Tuesday showed that
Bush won by getting slightly more support from a cross-section of
voters than he did when he lost to Chiles, with not one demographic
group handing him the election. A poll by The Associated Press and
a consortium of news media organizations found that Bush, who won
by 55 percent to 45 percent over his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov.
Kenneth MacKay, gained votes this time from women, older Floridians
and blacks. Bush also remained strong with Hispanic voters _ about
60 percent voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not transform himself enough to trouble earlier
supporters. Bush, for example, has continued to hold conservative
views on abortion and school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any significant changes,'' said John Dowless,
executive director of the Christian Coalition of Florida. ``There's
more moderation but there's no abandonment of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like state Rep. Addie Greene of West Palm Beach, who
campaigned for Bush's opponent, said she expected Bush to work hard
to fulfill election promises so that he could win a second term.
But she remained skeptical of his sincerity, noting that among
competing constituencies he must also pay back the special
interests that helped finance his campaign. ``This is going to be
very good to watch,'' Ms. Greene said. ``We're going to sit back
and see how many lies he told.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also need to regroup, some political analysts say, and
build strength to keep Florida a competitive two-party state. All
is not lost, they say, because of the tendency of Florida voters to
cross party lines. In typical fashion, on Tuesday they also
re-elected Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and kept the state cabinet
split with three Democrats _ the state attorney general and the
commissioners of insurance and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Amadeo Trinchitella, 80, the president of the Democratic Club at
the Century Village retirement community in Deerfield Beach whose
15,000 residents voted overwhelmingly Democrat, was philosophical
about the Republican takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid, I'm not concerned,'' he said. ``The pendulum
swings and things change. If they don't do the right thing there'll
be a changeover. The Democratic Party will grow again. We're not
going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Republicans, who achieved their majority in the
state Legislature in 1996 and have steadily gained on Democrats in
registered voters over the last two decades but still lag in total
registration, 40 percent to 45 percent, say nothing will stop them
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that with the leadership of Jeb Bush, his fiscal
conservative views with a compassionate touch, you're going to see
a continued move to more equality between the two parties,'' said
Ed Pozzuoli, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who heads the Republican
Party in Broward County, a Democratic stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, Ms. Cluett, a relentless worker for Republican
candidates, also harbors big hopes. ``I hope and pray that's the
best thing that ever happens in Florida,'' she said of the
Republican rule that will start on Jan. 5. ``This is special. This
is my swan song. I'm going to relax after this.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE POLITICS OF GETTING OUT WHILE THE GETTING
IS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was one of the standing jokes of New York politics
that Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan had written more books than Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato had read. But all the royalties from all those
books would not equal the amount of money D'Amato could raise in
one phone call. You have talents, and then you have talents.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are both on the way out, the pair who have been the
state's senatorial team for nearly two decades. D'Amato was the
career pol who brought home bacon. Moynihan was the
scholar-statesman, although a scholar-statesman who was quite into
bacon himself. The Moynihan pork had to come in huge slabs, like
the multibillion-dollar transportation act or the Manhattan
post-office-turned-railroad station that, if it ever gets finished,
will probably and justly be named the Moynihan Edifice.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after D'Amato lost his re-election race to Rep.
Charles Schumer, Moynihan let it be known that he was quitting when
his term ends in two years. Friends of the senator say he has been
planning his retirement since 1994. If he had not, the sight of New
York's junior senator going down in flames would certainly have
sent him packing. Before D'Amato's political career expired, both
he and Schumer got to see advertisements a dozen times a night
featuring their pictures in tones of gray and white that suggested
they were either half-dead or recently released from a year in
solitary confinement. And how many people get to spend sums in the
eight figures for the pleasure of being publicly branded a liar or
a ``putzhead''?
</P>
<P>
   New York politicians are actually very averse to genuinely
competitive contests. For most of them, a good election year is one
in which everybody gets cross-endorsed by both parties and the day
after the voting finds every single public official standing
exactly where he or she was the day before. (It is no accident that
the state Legislature scored a 100 percent rate of return for
incumbents last week.)
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan never had a serious primary after 1976, when he won the
Senate nomination as the lone centrist in a field of left-wing
Democrats. His Republican opponents have included a state
assemblywoman who campaigned by taking buses around the state in
the company of her 22-year-old daughter, and a Long Island lawyer
who got to drive his own car. In 1994, the Republicans put up the
heiress to a convertible-sofa empire, whose greatest claim to fame
was the fact that, as a tot, she had opened and closed a couch-bed
on the company's television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side to politics in New York is that if you climb
high enough and hang on long enough, sooner or later somebody will
smell blood and do you in. Gov. Mario Cuomo coasted along through
two re-elections and then was tossed out on his ear by George
Pataki, a pleasant Republican whose name people seemed to have
trouble placing even after he had been in office several years.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato created Pataki, plucking him out of nowhere and making
him the party nominee. (In New York, nowhere would be the state
Senate.) But four years later, Pataki was enjoying one of those
virtual political cease-fires and D'Amato was the one voters had
gotten sick of after 18 years on the job. The governor was
practically carrying D'Amato around the state _ a particularly bad
idea since Pataki is so tall he made the senator look as though he
had shrunk to the size of a raisin.
</P>
<P>
   When your time is up in New York, it is really, really up.
Schumer, who was considered to be doing quite well by running neck
and neck with the legendary campaigner Al D'Amato, wound up
absolutely obliterating the senator on Election Day. Schumer, a man
who respects the manic activity his profession requires at the
highest levels, was last seen running around upstate New York,
thanking all the people who had actually not voted for him. D'Amato
had portrayed him as the enemy of all things agricultural, and
Schumer _ who is indeed one of your more urban politicians _ is
determined to win over the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that once he's elected they'll never see him
again,'' laughed one of Schumer's aides. ``Little do they know
they'll never see the end of him. God help us if there's an ice
storm.'' ( Schumer was violently attacked for voting against relief
for upstate farmers after an ice storm. If bad weather strikes this
winter, look for him on snow shoes, somewhere near the Canadian
border, delivering coffee door to door.)
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan did something similar when he was first elected, if on
a more leisurely schedule. He became the first senator in New York
history to visit all 62 counties, some of them extremely remote and
containing only about a half-dozen people. But he has been around
too long to feel that hungry again, and his decision to retire
suggests that he has not lost his best political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had barely given his concession speech when the
political chattering classes began theorizing that he would run
against Moynihan in two years. Moynihan would be 73 then. D'Amato
first won his Senate seat by claiming that 76-year-old Jacob Javits
was too old to stay in office. But then, in two years, D'Amato will
be 63 himself. Better to leave it to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Already we are hearing suggestions that the son of Mario Cuomo
or the son of Robert F. Kennedy might run for the seat. Sons did
not do too well in this last election, unless their name was Bush.
Three heirs to great political family traditions were knocked off
in Minnesota alone by Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   New York has never had a professional wrestler running for
public office, although we did have a gubernatorial candidate whose
claim to fame was a couple of years as TV's Grandpa Munster.
</P>
<P>
   The time may be right. Perhaps Hulk Hogan would have the energy.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A potent winter storm that brought heavy mountain snow and
valley rain to northern California and parts of Oregon on Saturday
will move across the interior West on Sunday. Snow accumulations of
more than 1 foot will be common along west facing slopes from the
southern Bitterroots to the mountains of central and northern Utah.
Gusty winds will lead to poor visibility in blowing and drifting
snow. Periods of rain will be common in many valleys of the
interior West. Showers will linger early Sunday morning in the
onshore flow near the Oregon and northern California coasts. Drier
air will arrive by Sunday afternoon. The deserts of the Southwest
will be mainly dry.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds, spotty very light snow and a few areas of freezing
drizzle will linger across the northern Plains and western Great
Lakes. Temperatures will remain several degrees below the seasonal
average.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy light snow and rain will accompany a weakening area of
low pressure as it moves east from the central Ohio Valley. Wet
snow may leave a small accumulation north of the track of the low
pressure center over parts of southern Michigan, northern Ohio and
northwestern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a band of clouds and scattered sprinkles will
cross the interior Southeast as a jet stream disturbance streaks
east.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Atlantic Seaboard will be dry with some sunshine and
cool breezes from the north. Low clouds will linger over much of
the interior Northeast. A few flurries will occur near the northern
Appalachians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RARE CLOUDS
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, residents near Yakutat, Alaska, were treated to
the rare sight of the highest clouds visible from earth.
Noctilucent clouds are wavy, bluish-white clouds that form at
rarefied altitudes near 50 miles. Comprised of tiny ice particles,
the clouds are so thin that stars shine brightly through them. They
are best observed at high latitudes around twilight when they are
illuminated against a dark sky. One theory holds that the clouds
form when water from disintegrated meteorites freezes onto meteoric
dust. In this case, a rocket sent vapor high into the atmosphere
that caused the luminous clouds.

AT THE WHITE HOUSE, A SUDDEN SENSE OF RELIEF AND ELATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Republicans in fratricidal disarray, the White
House is preparing a new winter policy offensive and approaching
the impeachment inquiry with new confidence that President Clinton
can emerge with little or no further damage.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials insisted that last week's election results
and the departure of the president's chief Republican foil, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, will have no bearing on the president's
handling of the impeachment threat in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   These officials denied widespread speculation that Clinton would
now feel emboldened to aggressively contest the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment inquiry or the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct suit. There is no chest-thumping or drum-beating going
on in the White House, these aides said, even behind the
bulletproof glass of the residential quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mistaking the sense of relief and elation at
the White House and among congressional Democrats. One aide
repeated the joke making the rounds of senior White House staff:
``The Monica strategy worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But others warned that instability in the Republican leadership
could pose new dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their disarray makes that more difficult,'' said the White
House official involved in handling impeachment matters.
``Dangerous things happen in a disorderly situation. We're trying
to get a little sense of how things are playing out on the other
side, and we're not sure who's calling the shots now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the danger of impeachment receded, the president began
planning a series of policy initiatives for the coming months to
respond to the public will expressed in Tuesday's voting. Clinton
said last week that the midterm election results were an
``ear-splitting'' public endorsement of his policies on education,
health care and Social Security, and vowed to pursue them with new
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   One thing at least has changed since Tuesday's balloting.
Presidential advisers and Capitol Hill Democrats now speak openly
of the possibility the Judiciary Committee will find no grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And while aides quietly let it be known as recently as a month
ago that the president might be willing to accept congressional
censure or some other form of lesser punishment as an alternative
to impeachment, there is now growing confidence at the White House
that Congress may take no action at all.
</P>
<P>
   However, a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, who would not
allow his name to be used, said Clinton probably cannot escape the
Lewinsky matter untouched. ``The sense up here is still that the
exit will require some form of punishment, whether it's censure or
whatever,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides involved in handling impeachment matters said
they were particularly heartened by the decision by Rep. Henry
Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to call Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr as the panel's only witness. Instead of
hearing weeks of repetitive testimony, the committee appears to be
limiting its inquiry to areas Starr has investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr's not going to tell them anything we don't already
know,'' said one senior White House official. ``It's going to be
tough for them to vote articles of impeachment based only on Ken
Starr as a witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reassessing their scandal strategy, Democrats are
gleefully watching the Republicans as they shoot their wounded and
quarrel over the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares about impeachment?'' one happy congressional
Democratic aide said at the end of the week. ``We've got a war
going on in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   One presidential adviser said the White House impeachment
strategy cannot be done in a vacuum, but only in response to
actions from Capitol Hill. The Judiciary Committee on Thursday sent
the White House a list of 81 questions arising from Starr's
investigation of the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers said they planned to respond to the
committee in a ``timely'' manner and would not try to drag out the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But a broader reaction to the inquiry will await the
Republicans' next move, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican drama plays out on Capitol Hill, the president
intends to hew to the agenda he outlined last January in his State
of the Union address and which Democrats used to their advantage in
the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In two post-election public appearances, Clinton stressed
revisions to the Social Security system and support for a health
care bill of rights as the top priorities of the new year. Aides
are now putting flesh on this skeletal agenda for presentation in
the budget submission to Congress early next year and in the State
of the Union speech in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyers will continue to handle impeachment stuff and the
president will continue to be president,'' said Douglas Sosnik, a
senior presidential adviser. ``Despite the fact that no one inside
the Beltway was paying attention all year, we have been working on
his agenda to improve education, preserve Social Security, pass a
health care bill and maintain the strength of the economy.
Tuesday's balloting reaffirmed that the people were listening, and
that is certainly satisfying for the people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been blessed, once again, by divided and inept
opponents and by a tolerant, even indulgent, electorate. He has an
opportunity now to seize the high ground of policy and dictate the
terms of debate in Washington for the next several months. The
president has a chance to command center stage against a Republican
party with no clear voice or coherent policy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House enters the last two years of Clinton's term with
a new group of senior officials in place, under the leadership of
John D. Podesta, the new chief of staff. Many of the team members,
including Sosnik; Paul Begala, a former campaign consultant; Craig
Smith, the political director, and Steve Ricchetti, the deputy
chief of staff, have years of experience dealing with Clinton's
propensity for self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heady optimism brought by the Republican chaos and
the dimming danger of impeachment, White House officials are chary
of proclaiming another Clinton comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still time to mess up,'' one senior Clinton adviser
said of the president's remaining time in office. ``No lead is safe
with us.''

EXPERTS WILL TRY TO DEFINE `IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)  (Eds: See also CLINTON-AGENDA) 
(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question has unleashed a stream of
constitutional experts, acid-tongued opinion makers and endless
chatter from television pundits.
</P>
<P>
   What constitutes an ``impeachable offense?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of Democratic demands for a workable
definition and calls to hold an in-depth debate, 19 historians,
professors of constitutional law and former Justice Department
officials, including an attorney general, are expected to gather on
Monday on Capitol Hill to offer their own interpretations and help
Congress formulate an answer to the elusive question.
</P>
<P>
   They will testify before the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee
on the constitution, chaired by Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. Ten of
them will be Republican witnesses; eight Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a rare gesture of comity, one professor, Michael
Gerhardt, who teaches law at the College of William and Mary in
Virginia and who wrote a recent book on federal impeachment, will
speak as a joint witness.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats on the committee are skeptical about Monday's
hearing, saying that what is truly needed is a debate between
members and some sort of threshold agreement on whether the
evidence sent by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, rises to
the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are omitting the essential task before us, which
is to compare the allegations to the historical standards of other
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.,
who served on the Democratic staff of the Judiciary Committee
during Watergate. ``If we were to do that, there is a substantial
possibility we may not need further proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now going to have 19 witnesses on one day, on a
subcommittee. It's really a shoddy approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of witnesses includes constitutional law experts, like
William Van Alstyne, a professor at Duke University, and Laurence
Tribe, a Harvard law professor; historians like Arthur Schlesinger
and Jack Rakove, who won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for his book on
the constitution; Griffin Bell, an attorney general under President
Carter; and Gary McDowell, now the director of the Institute for
U.S. Studies at the University of London and a well-known Reagan
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Each witness will make a 10-minute presentation and then answer
questions from members.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was put together with political considerations in
mind. The Republican witnesses will argue, for the most part, that
the framers of the Constitution would have considered perjury a
``high crime and misdemeanor,'' a position held by many Republican
committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the framers were the ones examining this, they would have
impeached and removed the president,'' said Stephen Presser, a
professor at Northwestern University's law school. ``If what Starr
says is true, and that's a big if, the president has turned the
engines and law-enforcement mechanisms of government to his own
advantage. If he has tried to frustrate the working of law, he has
done everything the framers feared an unscrupulous official would
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts summoned by Democrats will argue that impeachment is an
act of last resort, reserved only for flagrant acts that imperil
the nation's public interest.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, five of the eight Democratic panelists signed a
letter, along with 395 other legal scholars, to Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who later that day announced he was stepping down as
speaker, and to the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, stating
that Starr's accusations do not warrant impeachment under the
Constitution. Two historians signed a similar letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If certain crimes such as murder warrant removal of a
president from office because of their unspeakable heinousness, the
offenses alleged in the independent counsel's report or the
investigative counsel's statement are not among them,'' the letter
stated. ``Short of heinous criminality, impeachment demands
convincing evidence of grossly derelict exercise of official
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakove, who will testify Monday, said: ``There is a good reason
for us to think or ask why we have only had two previous
impeachment proceedings, all of them very different in their
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Several panelists wondered whether their testimony would even be
relevant in the coming weeks, believing as some of them do that the
Democratic victory in last week's elections made impeachment
increasingly unlikely. ``They are looking for an exit strategy,''
said the Rev. Robert Drinan, a Georgetown University law professor
and former member of Congress who sat on the Judiciary Committee
during the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But Presser said he disagreed with that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I read the Constitution, Congress has no choice in this
matter,'' he said. ``If the president has committed an impeachable
offense, Congress has the duty to remove him. It's not Congress
may. It's Congress shall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are either impeachable or you are not. It doesn't shift
with the duty of public opinion.''

RISING RUSSIAN IMPORTS FUEL DISPUTE WITH U.S. STEELMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with RUSSIA-RUSTBELT) 
(bl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A new Cold War has broken out between Russia and the
United States, this time over hot-rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
   More than just steel is at stake in the trade dispute, which is
sure to drag in both governments before it is over. The case turns
on jobs and profits, but also on politics as it tests the U.S.
government's support for Russia's painful economic transition.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, U.S. steel producers became alarmed about a
surge in inexpensive steel imports. As imports rose to record
levels, prices fell _ from $300 a ton, to $220 for the hot-rolled
coils that make up 55 percent of the American steel market.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, U.S. steelmakers brought an anti-dumping case in
Washington against Russia, Japan and Brazil, contending that their
foreign competitors are selling steel below cost in the United
States, at grave damage to the domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not the biggest exporter of hot-rolled steel to the
United States. Japan is. But squeezed by a drop in domestic demand
and a collapse of their markets in Southeast Asia, Russian
producers have significantly stepped up their shipments to the
United States. Imports of Russian steel rose to 2.2 million tons in
the first seven months of 1998 from 1.8 million tons in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from Magnitogorsk _ often dubbed the Pittsburgh of Russia _
exports to the United States are a matter of survival, as hopes for
reviving the domestic market have been dashed by the economy.
Magnitogorsk now sells 60 percent of the steel it produces abroad,
of which 49 percent goes to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Russian steelworkers have warned that losing the
American market could cost them 100,000 jobs, and $1 billion a year
in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from Pittsburgh, headquarters of USX-U.S. Steel Group,
which in the last decade has gone through a painful transition of
its own, the Russians' aggressive sales techniques amount to
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some horribly low prices that to our knowledge,
are below the cost of producing a ton of steel,'' said Paul J.
Wilhelm, president of USX-U.S. Steel. ``There is a tremendous surge
in imports that is coming out of the hides of U.S. steelmakers, and
U.S. steel workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian steel producers insist they are not producing below
cost, especially with the ruble devalued by 60 percent. ``To say
there is no free market in Russia is absurd,'' said Mikhail
Buryakov, director of Magnitogorsk Metal Works' finance and
economics department.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's economy is weighted down by barter transactions _
at this point, 40 percent of Magnitogorsk's domestic transactions
are conducted in kind, not cash. So calculating production costs is
no easy task. ``We cannot afford to sell for less than it costs to
produce,'' said Serafim Afonin, president of the Russian Union of
Metal Exporters. ``Exports are our only way of getting real
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to forestall heavy anti-dumping penalties, the
Russian producers have offered to cut their exports to 1997 levels,
which by their estimates would amount to a 30 percent cut from
monthly volumes in the first half of this year. But U.S.
steelmakers say they will oppose any quotas or any
government-brokered deals.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly the Russians want their case to be set aside, and
considered in light of their peculiar economic difficulties, which
in their view resulted from reforms urged on them by the Americans.
The case is now under review by the Commerce Department and a
preliminary find is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us take a look at the transformations that have taken
place, in the name of free, open market reforms,'' said Afonin.
``They said, open your markets, and we did. Now they want to hit us
over the head. If the Americans want Russia's reforms to continue,
they should understand.''

TALKING HEADS' POST-MORTEM: `ALL WRONG, ALL THE TIME' 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JANNY SCOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich may have emerged the biggest loser in Tuesday's
election, but Washington's political pundits are running a close
second, many of them having predicted since late January that the
American public would sooner or later turn on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts, commentators and reporter-prognosticators, who
have become a ubiquitous feature of the news media landscape,
almost without exception predicted wrongly that the Republicans
would come through the election with a tighter grip on Congress
(and, by implication, on Clinton's fate).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all wrong, all the time,'' said George Stephanopoulos,
the ABC commentator and former aide to Clinton. ``It's true and we
probably ought to admit it.'' He said the commentators consistently
misread ``the public feeling on the entire issue of Monica and
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blankley, a former press secretary to Gingrich, said, ``The
first thing that has to be understood is that pundits are
remarkably better at autopsy than they are at prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better at explaining Washington to the country than the
country to Washington,'' said Blankley, who is now editor at large
of George magazine and a broadcast pundit on shows including ``The
McLaughlin Group.'' ``We don't have any greater standing than any
other reasonably sentient human being on what 270 million people
are going to do about something.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday and Thursday, before Gingrich announced
that he would resign both the speaker's job and his seat in
Congress, pundits and former pundits attributed the often startling
degree of the miscalculations to a half-dozen factors including the
genuinely surprising outcome of the election, the myopia of
Washington insiders, and the vested interest of journalists in the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hunt, executive Washington editor of The Wall Street Journal
and a regular on the CNN talk show ``Capital Gang,'' said many in
the media failed to grasp the public's acceptance of Clinton in
part because ``if that was going to be a permanent condition,''
then there might be no story to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report and
a political analyst for CNN, said journalists also ignored polls
showing no clear evidence that the public was turning on Clinton.
They did so in part, he said, because some themselves felt betrayed
and offended by the president's lying.
</P>
<P>
   And William Kristol, the editor and publisher of The Weekly
Standard, who had predicted in recent months that both Clinton and
the Democrats were ``doomed,'' said ruefully, ``I think I'm not as
smart as I thought I was, or at least as I pretended to think I
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything these days is so over-interpreted and
over-explained, it's useful to be reminded that these things are
hard to predict,'' Kristol said. ``The key thing now to remember is
that just as one's facile predictions were wrong, one's facile
explanations after the fact are as likely to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the damage done to the pundit class,
Stephanopoulos was asked. ``Hardy breed,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the pundits' opinions have not been uniform and have
shifted over time, from the moment in January when Sam Donaldson of
ABC News said he thought that if Clinton was not telling the truth
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, his presidency would
be ``numbered in days.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, pundits could be heard predicting a prolonged
impeachment. Some said it was not a matter of whether but of when
he would be driven out. Some forecast imminent resignation. Some
said the Democrats wanted him out so they could regroup for the
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's approval ratings then rose, the pundits regrouped
but did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from now, Clinton will be gone,'' Kristol wrote in May.
When the public understands what Clinton has done, he wrote, ``then
the American people will desert Clinton. Indeed, they will turn on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   By late August, pundits were predicting disastrous results for
the Democrats in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Kristol wrote, ``After the voting this Nov. 3, the
Democrats are likely to be down to about 40 senators and fewer than
200 House members, their lowest total in 70 years. And the
devastation will continue at the state and local levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the pundits modified their forecasts late last
month, there was nevertheless widespread agreement that the
Republicans would end up winning seats in both the Senate and the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shields, who appears on ``Capital Gang,'' was one of the
relatively few commentators who came close to the truth. ``There
are going to be five or fewer,'' he said on Saturday night. ``It
may even be a wash. You heard it right here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky,'' Shields said, sounding like a man who
narrowly escaped a freak accident that had just swallowed up his
friends. ``But I've been wrong enough times that I'm not sitting
here as any sort of Delphic oracle.''
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, pundits pointed out that they were in good
company. Other people seemed not to have foreseen the outcome of
the election either. The pundits said they had gotten many things
right _ for example, the fact that the original charges against
Clinton were serious and would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   They said pundits tended to use history as a guide in making
predictions; historically, the party in the White House has lost an
average of 27 seats in midterm elections. In addition, some said,
they took into account the fact that the Republicans had raised far
more money.
</P>
<P>
   There was, moreover, ``an overwhelming consensus amongst party
professionals in both parties,'' Blankley said. When everyone is
relying on data that the parties collect, pundits can either rely
on that data, too, or go on their own hunches, if they have any,
which most did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair to my miserable fellow pundits, whenever someone
would say the Republicans were expecting to gain 40 seats in the
House, there was usually a pundit to say, `Wait a minute,'''
Blankley said. ``So there were some minor corrections to the more
egregious misrepresentations made by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pundits pointed to other reasons for the miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said the public long ago ``knew exactly what Clinton was
and what he had done'' and made judgments that many journalists
``didn't get.'' The public concluded that while they might not like
or trust Clinton, he was a pretty good president and they did not
want to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the media did not accept those conclusions.
``Because in a way it ended the story,'' Hunt said. ``And a whole
lot of people who didn't have the advantage of covering Watergate
thought this is going to be my one and I don't want it to end
prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said, ``I've thought for a while that the public's
focus is much more exclusively on the state of the economy'' while
``among all members of the media there has been greater criticism
of the president and a stronger sense that, `Gosh, sooner or later
the public has got to turn on this guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   The polls never clearly showed that, Rothenberg said. And many
in the media have now come to doubt that the public would turn.
``But, yeah, there was a sense that this guy had broken a cardinal
rule of politics, lying to the American public with such intensity
and false sincerity that sooner or later people were going to judge
him on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people interviewed seemed to think the business of punditry
would be changed by the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose pundits fight the last war,'' said Michael Kinsley,
a former Washington pundit who is now the editor of the online
magazine Slate. ``So the next time one of these things comes along,
they'll all predict that people will shrug it off. And that will be
one that people take seriously.''

 MOVE OF BRITISH AUTO SUPPLIER TO U.S. IS REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After a trans-Atlantic tug-of-war over whether
LucasVarity PLC, the British-based auto components and aerospace
company, should move its headquarters to Buffalo, N.Y., small
shareholders delivered a remarkable rebuff to both management and
big U.S. investors, voting by a hair's breadth for the company to
remain in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Britain's automotive industry _ from stately Rolls
Royce to minuscule Minis _ owned by American, Japanese or German
concerns, the battle had assumed jingoistic overtones, particularly
among those who fear that Britain has forfeited its manufacturing
base to become a nation of service-providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucas paid good money for Varity and we would have expected it
to remain a British company,'' Gordon Hoar, a former Lucas
Aerospace employee and a British shareholder, said before the
ballot. Indeed, with a pedigree dating to its founding in 1897,
Lucas' tussle with relocation had been viewed as one of the great
milestones in its 101-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Friday night was so close that the announcement of
the results was postponed until noon Saturday. In a statement,
LucasVarity said the proposals of its British-born but U.S.-based
chief executive, Victor Rice, for the move to Buffalo had been
rejected in some cases by fractions of a percentage point. There
was no immediate comment from the company on Rice's position after
the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   LucasVarity employs 56,000 people and recorded sales of $7.8
billion last year. It is one of the world's biggest producers of
automotive brakes and counts General Motors and Ford among its main
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot marked a major turning point in a corporate drama
that began in 1996 when Lucas Industries PLC of Britain paid $2
billion to take over Varity Corp., based in Buffalo. Last
September, Rice stunned British shareholders by proposing that the
corporation move its headquarters to Buffalo and abandon its
listing on the Financial Times blue-chip index for a listing in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The idea inspired much British indignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told it would continue as a British company which
would remain in Britain,'' declared Sir Anthony Gill, a former
Lucas chief executive, when he arrived for Friday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And Schroders, a British investment house that controls 11
percent of LucasVarity stock, counseled against the move to
Buffalo, saying a switch to a New York listing would not be ``in
the best interests'' of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that: British shareholders suspected that one motive
behind the planned move is that senior executives would find it
easier to live in the United States. ``Absolute rubbish,'' said
Nicholas Jones, a company spokesman. Instead, the company's
management argued, a move to the United States would anchor it
``among its automotive peer group'' and lower the cost of borrowing
by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Right until the vote, the management remained quietly confident
that it would carry the day. Despite the company's British base,
British institutional and other investors control only 40 percent
of the stock. U.S. investment is said to be between 54 percent and
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual dual voting system pitted big U.S. investors against
small shareholders controlling only 5 percent of the 1.4 billion
shares issued, but numbering an estimated 18,000. In effect, the
voting procedures gave an institutional investor with 10 million
shares the same clout as someone with 500.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement on Saturday, LucasVarity said it fell short of
the required 75 percent of value by a mere 0.58 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The vote took place after London markets had closed for the
weekend, so there was no way of knowing how traders would judge the
outcome. In advance of the vote on Friday, shares slipped back by
as much as 6 percent in a day of fitful trading, but recovered to
208 pence.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had argued that a move to Buffalo would facilitate
borrowing plans to finance acquisitions and a buyback of 20 percent
of the stock. But critics remained suspicious, partly because of an
earlier maneuver by Rice, who acquired the Canadian tractor firm
Massey-Ferguson _ only to move it from Toronto to Buffalo and
rename it.

POLITICAL MEMO: DEMOCRATS MOURN LOSS OF IDEAL FOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their wish finally came true: Democrats helped
topple House Speaker Newt Gingrich. But rather than celebrate, many
of Gingrich's toughest foes are now lamenting the loss of the
politician they most liked to demonize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have Newt to kick around any more _ and we'll miss
him,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic media consultant. ``In the
way the Republican Party spent years using Ted Kennedy as their
punching bag _ and made millions in direct mail off him _ I don't
think we've ever had a better villain than Newt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Gingrich's decision to step aside was announced
Friday, Saul Shorr, a Democratic commercial creator who featured
the speaker in a recent advertisement in a House race in Seattle,
said he told a colleague that he hoped Gingrich would survive.
``You only get to make a first impression once,'' Shorr said, ``and
the first impression he made on the American public was entirely
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as many Republicans did not want President Clinton to
resign _ they preferred a wounded president over Vice President Al
Gore in the top spot in the run-up to the 2000 campaign _ Democrats
are ambivalent about Gingrich walking off the political stage. Not
even Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the arch-enemy of liberals for
decades, could generate as much vitriol _ or fund-raising dollars
on either side _ as Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Told on Friday night of Gingrich's decision, Michigan Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, described him as a leader who was ``either
loved or hated.'' To many, it was more the latter. A New York
Times/CBS News Poll taken several days before Tuesday's election
found that the speaker's popularity was continuing to erode: His
positive rating stood at 18 percent; his negative rating was 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was so popular among Democrats because all they had to
do was flash his picture (usually in blurry black and white) in a
television commercial or inject his name in a partisan speech or a
fund-raising appeal, and it was instant shorthand for depicting
Republicans as dangerous extremists.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential campaign, the Democratic Party pumped
millions of dollars into commercials tying Republican nominee Bob
Dole to Gingrich. ``They really weren't even that creative,'' Ms.
Grunwald said of the spots.
</P>
<P>
   They did not have to be. All the commercial creators needed was
an image that people could grasp in a split second.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to drive Dole campaign officials to complain
publicly, as Scott Reed, his campaign manager, did two weeks before
the 1996 election, saying, ``Bill Clinton has spent $45 million on
misleading and false advertising linking Dole to Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Carroll, who in the 1992 campaign was in charge of
opposition research for the Democratic Party, said that until
Gingrich led Republicans to retake Congress in 1994, Democrats
never could find just the right villain. In fact, polls show that
most other Republican leaders are virtual strangers to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for him to pretend to be a happy-faced
conservative,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's swift emergence as an irresistible foe occurred
because of a confluence of events: He became a household name
because of his triumph leading the Republicans to seize the House
in 1994, for the first time in 40 years. But a year or two later,
when Americans began souring on the new Congress, Gingrich was seen
as the embodiment of the party. In interviews around the country,
particularly in the 1996 campaign, ordinary voters would literally
recoil at the mere mention of the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was easy to caricature,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican
strategist in San Francisco. ``The same things that made him an
effective leader made him an easy target: He was loud. He was
outrageous. And he always pushed the envelope further than anyone
thought he could _ or should _ push it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Cherny, a former senior speech writer for Gore, said the
loss of Gingrich as a pinata was ``a sad day for Democrats.'' It
was with relish, he said, that he would lace Gore's speeches with
references to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich was a two-word explanation for Republican
intransigency and extremism and I took advantage of it,'' said
Cherny, the editor of Blueprint, a new magazine about centrist
Democrats. ``Every time he was the voice of the Republican agenda
it made the Democratic arguments that much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, when many campaigns turned on local matters,
Democrats were less enchanted with featuring the speaker. But in
the closing weeks some Democrats again pulled out their
not-so-secret weapon. In his last speech of the campaign, in
Baltimore, Clinton urged Democrats to vote, declaring, ``Your vote
counts just as much as mine, just as much as Speaker Gingrich's.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorr produced a commercial for Jay Inslee, a Democrat who ran
for the House in California (and unseated Rep. Rick White) that
criticized Republicans for prolonging the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick White and Newt Gingrich shouldn't be dragging us through
this,'' Inslee said in the 30-second commercial.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., broadcast a commercial in the
closing days that linked her Republican rival, Matt Fong, to
Gingrich, portraying both men as extreme opponents of abortion. She
was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, however, who were daunted by Gingrich's
political skills, said they were thrilled that he is quitting. With
Gingrich no threat, many of these Democrats were more praiseworthy
of the speaker's talents than some in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's gone _ he was such a formidable adversary,''
said William Carrick, a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles.
``He's probably one of the best fund-raisers that's ever been
involved in American electoral politics. He's the only one of them
who had real strategic vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a senior White House official, said Gingrich had
``a rare intellectual gift for articulating his views.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Gingrich's successor, whomever that might be, could
well end up just as disliked. He argued that the speaker's
unpopularity was not personal but based on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that American politics is not a cult of
personality,'' Begala said. ``People like us or dislike us based on
our ideas or issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff to House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt said he was not mourning the loss of a political foil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turmoil is helpful to us,'' he said of the Republican's
intramural fight. ``We have an agenda and we're ready to go. And
unless they change their agenda direction, they'll have another
Speaker who will become equally unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   But politicians who are as unpopular as Gingrich do not come
around that often. ``They spent tens of millions of dollars
demonizing Gingrich,'' Schnur said. ``That's all money down the
drain. Now they have to start over with the next guy.''

   Reaction to busing proposal is divided
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Parents and minority group leaders gave mixed
reviews to news that the Austin school board is considering ending
more than a quarter-century of busing.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Baez has a son who is bused from her neighborhood in
Southeast Austin to O. Henry Middle School, 2610 W. 10th St., in
West Austin. Baez said she is torn over whether busing has more
benefits than disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been struggling with that question for weeks. I love my
son being able to talk to and be friends with kids of different
races,'' Baez said. But she said busing hasn't improved academic
opportunities for students.
</P>
<P>
   But like other minority leaders, Olga Cuellar, deputy director
of education for an Austin League of United Latin American Citizens
chapter, is more sure about where she stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want busing to continue unless they have good
experienced teachers in these inner-city schools,'' said Cuellar.
``If we are getting the same curriculum and the same tools at every
school, then there's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin school children in grades seven to 12 were first bused to
integrate schools in the 1971-72 school year after a federal court
ruled the district didn't give black and Mexican Americanchildren
the same education as white students, said Dan Robertson, the
district's director of planning services. Students in grades one to
six were bused in the 1980-81 school year. The court order was
lifted in 1983, and trustees stopped busing most elementary school
pupils in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they would welcome an end to all cross-town bus trips,
which require about 4,000 middle and high school students to make
long trips to school. Some parents of those students say they feel
isolated from the schools and communities to which their children
are bused.
</P>
<P>
   Becker Elementary Principal Lauralee Pankonien said residents in
her community are divided over the issue. Students who attend
Becker, 906 W. Milton St., are bused past Fulmore and Porter middle
schools to Covington, 3700 Convict Hill Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responses from parents were almost split,'' said
Pankonien, referring to questionnaires distributed by the district.
``Some parents would prefer to continue feeding to Covington and
Bowie (High School), and some preferred neighborhood schools. There
are just different concerns within different families.''
</P>
<P>
   She said middle-class parents with older children who have
attended Covington and Bowie seemed less opposed to busing. The
long treks south seemed to concern working-class parents with
transportation and schedule constraints most.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees will receive a report on public response at a Dec. 1
meeting and make a decision on busing before they redraw boundary
maps. Trustees plan to vote on new boundaries at a meeting Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations who sued the district over desegregation since the
1950s say they will watch carefully how the district handles
integration while redrawing boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP is opposed to resegregation,'' said Gary Bledsoe,
state president of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. ``Segregated schools breed racism. The NAACP would
want to ensure that any (school) assignment program for students
would be in compliance with Brown vs. Board of Education.'' The
case is a 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which
justices reversed the ``separate but equal'' standard used in
public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having children go to school together is the best way to
overcome the racial and ethnic misunderstandings of the past,''
said Al Kauffman, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Education Fund. Austin school trustees ``might want to
meet with the people who have sued them in the past,'' he said.
``We would look at the plans,''he said, ``and if people in the
community thought the district was resegregating the community,
then we might consider a suit.''

 &HT;    New leaders tepid on constitutional change
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three Texans elected this week to posts that
would become appointed under a proposed new state constitution are
not rushing to sign on to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Prefacing their remarks with kind and complimentary words about
the powerful state lawmakers proposing the change, Railroad
Commissioner-elect Tony Garza and Agriculture Commissioner-elect
Susan Combs stuck to low-key reaction Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two jobs are among many that would be appointed by the
governor, if Senate Finance Chairman Bill Ratliff and House
Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell pull off their long-shot effort
to win approval for a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Junell, D-San Angelo, and Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, want to
make Texas governors more powerful by allowing them to appoint the
land commissioner, agriculture commissioner, railroad
commissioners, judges and State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Senator Ratliff and Representative Junell are very
smart people, and whatever ideas they have will be given thorough
consideration,'' said Republican Susan Combs, who was elected
Tuesday and will take office in January as the state's agriculture
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Combs came down firmly uncommitted on the proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the people decide, I will be happy with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the constitution would require legislative and voter
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Garza, a Republican elected Tuesday to the three-member
Railroad Commission, said it's up to the Legislature and the
people, but he thinks Texans like voting on lots of state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Representative Junell and Senator Ratliff are very thoughtful
people, and any time they speak, they should be taken seriously,''
Garza said, making it clear that the two lawmakers with their hands
on his budget know that he thinks the world of them. ``But I think
there is a strong bent in this state to keep as much in the hands
of the people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the current system, which allows governors to appoint
the state's insurance and education commissioners and lets
gubernatorial appointees pick other agency heads, offers a ``fair
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican David Dewhurst, elected Tuesday as state land
commissioner, took no position on the proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the measure,'' he said. ``But I'm always in
favor of streamlining and modernizing government.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Christie of Houston, chairman of the State Board of
Education, said Texas voters decided 10 years ago that they want
the panel to be elected, not appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the voters,'' Christie said. ``The governor has
good, strong influence with the ability to appoint the (education)
commissioner and appoint the chairman. I think that's a good
balance.''

 &HT;    GOP hold on Ohio may not signal ideology changes
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ohio is now the most Republican state east of the
Mississippi _ on paper, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the statewide GOP sweep on Tuesday, Ohio is one
of only six states in the nation to have Republicans controlling
all of the statewide offices, both chambers of the Legislature and
both U.S. Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the all-Republican half-dozen _ which includes Idaho,
Wyoming, Utah and Kansas _ only Ohio and Pennsylvania are eastern
industrialized states. Ohio, however, has a more Republican state
legislature and congressional delegation than Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But political observers caution that the apparent Republican
stranglehold on the state is relatively new, is due more to
individual candidates and good luck than ideology, and may be
nothing more than Ohio politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not this great Republican fog over the state of
Ohio,'' says Republican strategist Jim Tilling. ``We have had good
candidates, we've run good races, all that is true. But we've also
had some good breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nelson, a University of Dayton political science
professor, calls the current political situation ``just a minor
swing of the pendulum'' in Ohio politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio is one of the strongest two-party states in the
country,'' Nelson says. ``You don't have to go that far back to
find it the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only 10 years ago, the Democrats enjoyed the reigns of
power, controlling all the state offices under Gov. Richard Celeste
and the state House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties have very strong histories,'' Nelson says. ``This
is exactly what you'd expect to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers, such as Karl Kurtz , of the National Conference
of State Legislatures, caution against leaning too heavily on party
labels when making nationwide comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio is a big, high-population, industrial state,'' Kurtz
says. ``A Republican there is like a Democrat in Idaho and
Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sprague, director of the Council of State Governments,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem to me that people Ohio elects are very far
right,'' Sprague says. ``They strike me as moderate pragmatists who
are interested in solving problems _ not ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sprague says he's ``amazed that a state that size would
be as completely Republican as they now are.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the GOP's success, Republican leaders
say, is the quality of the people they have running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget how important individuals and good fortune are
in a political party's success, . '' Tillings says.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio's case, the two individuals who made the most difference
are Governor _ and Senator-elect _ George Voinovich and Secretary
of State _ and Governor-elect _ Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, including state chairman Robert Bennett,
emphasize what a good job their leading candidates have done in
office, and how they've won the trust and respect of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich and Taft probably did the most work for their
party when they were first elected to statewide offices in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Taft had wanted to run for governor, but by stepping aside and
winning the secretary of state race, he assured Republicans control
of the all-important apportionment board, which redraws state
legislative districts every decade.
</P>
<P>
   That was the turning point for Ohio Republicans. Just as
Democratic control of the Apportionment Board led to statehouse
control during most of the 1970s and 1980s, Tilling says, the
Republican redistricting in 1991 led to the party's dominance this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   And once candidates gains statewide office in Ohio, observers
agree, they are difficult to unseat.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the state's eight major media markets make it
hard _ and expensive _ for anyone to gain name recognition across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   A congressman, such as Democrat Tony Hall of Dayton, Tilling
says, can be ``just tremendously popular in their own district but
virtually unknown elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only place where you really have a chance to get a
foothold is state office is when you get an open seat.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Democrats definitely missed a major opportunity
Tuesday. The poor showing has some observers wondering if the Ohio
Democratic Party isn't due for a major readjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery County Democratic
Party, says it's ``absolutely'' time for a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   The party, he says, is suffering from an ``aging
infrastructure'' of ideas and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about trying the same old things,'' says
Lieberman, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for
state Democratic Chairman David Leland. ``We need some imagination,
some innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy, he says, must be to develop a good ``farm
system'' that brings up good candidates and gets them publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go into the races four years from now with candidates
who have no name recognition, and we have to spend a million
dollars to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland sees that mountain of work, perhaps, more clearly than
anyone. The party, he says, has to raise a lot of money, keep the
grassroots organization healthy and recruit candidates who can win.
</P>
<P>
   The name recognition battle is going to be tough in the wake of
Tuesday's election, he admits. But Ohio political history shows
that statewide candidates often have to run and lose before they
have the name recognition to win.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates now considered political juggernauts, such as
Voinovich, Celeste, Sen. John Glenn and former Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, all lost on their first run for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, the party is better off now than it was 3 1/2
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As for his plans: ``My term runs until May 2000, and I plan to
spend all my time building and rebuilding the Democratic Party in
Ohio. That's what I'll be focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Bennett says he heard the same questions when he
took leadership of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, when I came in,'' Bennett says, ``people were saying
I had no candidates, no money, no organization, and we were out of
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett says the Republicans were able to turn their
fortunes around with hard work and good people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a misnomer to say Ohio is a Republican
state,'' he says. ``I don't think that tells the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era where unaffiliated voters make up two-thirds of the
electorate, Bennett says, good candidates are critical.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans can't afford to coast, he says. In 2000, term
limits will kick 59 state legislators out of office, and the party
will have to find more good people to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ohio Republicans are feeling good, Bennett says voters
sent the Republican leadership in Congress a strong message by
sending more Democrats to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to listen to that message,'' Bennett says. ``If we do,
we have the chance to make significant gains in 2000. And, of
course, that's for all the marbles and the presidency.''

   HAITI-GOATS _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ Ileus Viltine, a poor

only shelter was a rickety lean-to made from coconut leaves. But
now he has a new house with a tin roof. And, even better, he can
afford to send three of his five children to school. The source of
his new-found wealth? An unassuming goat. Viltine is just one of
1,200 farmers who have received a pregnant Nubian-bred goat as part
of the Haitian Goat Project sponsored by the Atlanta-based
non-profit group, Global Health Action. The group has operated the
project since 1985 to give impoverished Haitian families a means of
support and better nourishment for children. On the surface, a goat
may not seem like much. But it has a lot to offer: milk, meat,
hides. And the goats can be sold so that children can go to school,
many of them for the first time. We visited the tiny village of
Oranger, high in the mountains of rural Haiti, where a team from
Atlanta spent hours checking the goats for parasites and other
diseases, while teaching the farmers, many of them women, how to
care for their goats. The farmers say the goats are the only things
that have kept them alive. (Emling, Cox News Service).

communications, owner Jonas Guillaume recently opened Computer
World. He sells memberships for $35 a month, or about one-sixth of
the annual per-capita income, to any one who wants their own email
address and access to the Internet. He also offers six-week
training courses for doctors, lawyers, and other Haitian
professionals, many of whom know nothing about computers. Computer
World has become a gathering place for students and others who
``had heard something about the Internet,'' but didn't know exactly
what it was. Computer World even sells cappuccino, espresso and
light snacks in this land of rice and beans. (Emling, Cox News

Breaux is emerging as the Democrats' best model for success in a
region of the country where Democrats have fared poorly. Breaux's
success is a mixture of conservative votes, soft-spoken bi-partisan
rhetoric and old-fashioned retail politics. (Foskett, Atlanta

A TALE OF DARING U.S. SUBMARINE ESPIONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of America's most daring acts of piracy took shape late one
night in 1970 as Capt. James F. Bradley Jr. of the Navy sat in his
Pentagon office, meditating on how to achieve a nearly impossible
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, according to a new book, was wondering whether U.S. spy
submarines could somehow learn to tap the welter of undersea cables
that encircled the Soviet Union like necklaces, heavy with
communication jewels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here could be an open ear to the plans and frustrations of
Soviet leaders, intelligence unmatched by any human spy or even the
newest surveillance satellites,'' says the book, ``Blind Man's
Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was finding the cables, which were bundles of wires
a few inches wide. In the wilderness of the seabed, their locations
were deemed to be as safe as buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before dawn, Bradley's thoughts drifted back to his
childhood in St. Louis, when his mother took him on Mississippi
riverboat rides to escape the summer heat. He remembered the fun of
riding high up in pilothouses with steamer captains. From that
perch, he now recalled, he would occasionally see signs placed
discreetly along the shoreline warning boaters not to anchor
because of cable crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The same precautions, he realized, might hold for the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   In great secrecy, scanning a distant shoreline in the Sea of
Okhotsk with a periscope, a U.S. submarine discovered that such
warning signs did exist, written in Russian. And that discovery led
to one of the Cold War's most secretive and successful spy
operations, which the book recounts in rich detail, going far
beyond earlier sketchy accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Man's Bluff'' was written by Sherry Sontag, a freelance
journalist, and Christopher Drew, a reporter at The New York Times,
with research by Annette Lawrence Drew, Drew's wife. It has just
been published in New York by Public Affairs, a new publishing
house. Drew, while working on a series of stories with a team of
reporters at The Chicago Tribune, broke some of the details of the
story in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Ingenious cable taps in such places as the Sea of Okhotsk (near
the submarine base at Petropavlovsk and Pacific fleet headquarters
near Vladivostok) and in the icy Barents Sea (near Soviet missile
submarine bases and Northern fleet headquarters at Murmansk)
produced a torrent of intelligence data that shed light on Soviet
plans and intentions during some of the Cold War's darkest days,
the book reports.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a Barents tap in 1984 allowed Washington to
monitor a high-level Soviet alert in 1983, revealing details of
nuclear planning for missile submarines. Intelligence analysts, the
book reports, called the intelligence haul ``the crown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   The book says the tapping was done by a small fleet of U.S.
submarines, including the Halibut, the Seawolf, the Parche and the
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, these submarines, upon finding a target, would send
out divers who would help attach listening pods that recorded
magnetic emanations from the Soviet cables without having to make a
physical connection to any of the wires inside.
</P>
<P>
   The spy pods could be huge, the book reports. One was a metal
cylinder 20 feet long that was filled with electronics and
emblazoned inside with the words: ``Property of the United States
government.'' The book says some early pods were designed by Bell
Laboratories, an arm of AT&AMP;T that had long experience working with
undersea phone cables.
</P>
<P>
   A large pod, the book says, was discovered by the Soviets in the
Sea of Okhotsk after its existence was revealed by Ronald Pelton, a
former U.S. cipher expert who sold the secret to the Soviets for
$35,000. The book contains a Russian photograph of the captured
pod, taken at the Ministry of Security's museum in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Okhotsk setback, however, did little to slow the clandestine
work, the book reports. Tapping still pushed ahead in the Barents
Sea, and spread to the Mediterranean as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, even as the government was preparing to argue in a
secretive court case that Pelton was a traitor, the Seawolf was
trying to tap a cable that ran from West Africa to Europe. The
goal, the book says, was to aid a showdown with the Libyan leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   The book chronicles not only many spying missions but also the
feats and fears of the spy-submarine crews, which worried that
their lives were at risk in hostile waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has refused to make any substantive comments on the
book, saying that to confirm or deny any of its details could be
deemed detrimental to the nation's security interests.

 &HT;    Grand theft charged in case of costly tax preparation
 &HT;    By Monika Gonzalez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. _ An 85-year-old woman walked into an H&AMP;R
Block to have her taxes prepared and ended up befriending an
employee who later took her for more than $44,600, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton Beach police have arrested 45-year-old Nancy Mercer of
Delray Beach on charges of exploitation of an elderly person and
grand theft after being tipped off by the victim's relatives.
Mercer is being held at the Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of
$3,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue that Boynton Beach resident Irene Topp was in
trouble came when her cousin, Diane Dee of Daytona Beach, found
three canceled checks totaling $5,500 made out to Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Topp told Dee she didn't know anything about the checks and that
Mercer had been ``helping'' her by writing out checks for her to
sign, Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   Dee and her husband, Walter, 70, discovered a November 1997
promissory note indicating that Topp had loaned Mercer $25,000
under a payback plan that included no interest, repayment terms
that went past Topp's 100th birthday and a clause that the loan
would be forgiven if unpaid before Topp dies, according to arrest
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Topp's bank provided the Dees with a statement of checks for the
last two years and found more checks made out to Mercer, Mercer's
boyfriend Michael Viele and her niece, Pamela Heeren in Tennessee,
the arrest report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives found $44,600 had been misappropriated from July 1997
and May 1998, an arrest report said. Dee told police Topp wanted to
give Mercer money to help her buy a house, Mercer's boyfriend money
to start a locksmith business, and Mercer's niece money because she
was having financial problems.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent Tuesday night, a dozen HIV-infected men
headed to the back of a cluttered office suite on West 26th Street.
They made their way past a table blanketed with fact sheets on the
latest anti-AIDS drugs, past an extensive library that included all
the established scientific journals and a computer that was
available for Internet surfing on treatment and services. A list of
AIDS-related symptoms was visible on an office desk.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any place that is fully up-to-date on AIDS
treatment, it is the headquarters of the People With AIDS Health
Group, a nonprofit organization that is financed by the state and
federal governments to educate community agencies and to counsel
clients on the use of the new drugs that suppress HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But the men who gather every other Tuesday are not there for
advice on the new drugs. These men, in fact, do not use the
medications that have revolutionized AIDS treatment. In a decision
that even some advocates for AIDS patients consider extreme, they
have refused to use the anti-viral drugs, even though most have
such high levels of the virus in their blood that doctors would
urge treatment. These men, however, are forsaking the treatment for
as long as they FEEL healthy. They say their bodies will be better
off in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Niedzolkowski, 50, a tall, gregarious man, organized this
support group a year ago. It is a way for him and the others to
cope with the enormous pressure from doctors, friends and loved
ones who have urged them, sometimes hysterically, to begin the
triple-drug regimen that has allowed some people to leave their
deathbeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to maintain your resolve when you're all by
yourself and everyone is saying you're crazy,'' Niedzolkowski said.
``There's nobody to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   The support group may be on the extreme end of how patients try
to beat the odds, but as problems with AIDS drug cocktails have
cropped up, there has been a growing willingness by some to rethink
the prevailing approach to ``hit early, hit hard'' with the drug
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The men in the support group call themselves the drug-naive
group. The regulars range in age from their early 30s to early 60s.
Some have lived for years without symptoms. All have watched
friends die of AIDS. A couple of them marched in Washington with
the militant AIDS organization Act Up in the late 1980s, to draw
attention to the epidemic and to push for quicker federal approval
of anti-AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, the group was forced to improvise, without
Niedzolkowski there to moderate the discussion. He was at home,
sick. For a man whose disease-fighting T-cells have fallen to 168,
it is worrisome. The average uninfected person has about 1,000 of
these immune system cells. Even more important as an indicator of
disease progression, his virus level has climbed to 177,000 copies
of HIV per milliliter of blood. The federal government recommends
starting treatment when the virus level is above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Niedzolkowski insists that his body is not in a state of
emergency. He says his illness is an allergic reaction to Bactrim,
an antibiotic that he recently started taking to prevent
AIDS-related pneumonia. He still has no intention of using
anti-viral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My resolve has been the same as it always was, to hold off as
long as possible,'' said Niedzolkowski, who is also the operations
director for People With AIDS. ``My life doesn't need to be saved
yet. I feel there's an awful lot of hype out there about saving
people's lives with these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are dealing with really severe side effects with
these drugs,'' he added. ``We're trying to push it to the limit in
terms of saving these drugs for later.''
</P>
<P>
   The support group in New York appears to be the only one in the
country that is exclusively organized around not using the
anti-viral drugs. But its concerns about treatment are increasingly
being voiced by others. Many advocates for AIDS patients say there
is confusion surrounding the decision of when to begin treatment,
despite new federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the era of uncertainty with the
therapies,'' said Derek Link, the top federal policy analyst for
the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's largest AIDS service
agency.
</P>
<P>
   While there is generally little disagreement that people who
show advanced AIDS-related symptoms _ like thrush, a fungus
infection in the mouth, or unexplained fever _ should be treated, a
debate is growing over the best time to start treatment for others
in earlier stages of infection. An article this month in the
British medical journal The Lancet, for example, suggested that
women infected with HIV might need to start the drugs earlier than
men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said the federal guidelines were intended
to provide flexibility _ unless patients were at an advanced stage
_ so that patients would sit down with their doctors and make the
decision about treatment together. Fauci said the complexities of
patients' lives made it unrealistic to offer a standard code.
</P>
<P>
   And in a September issue of the same journal, a prominent AIDS
researcher contends that some asymptomatic people should delay
treatment of a lifelong regimen of drugs until their use is clearly
required.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. Jay Levy, a professor of medicine at the
University of California at San Francisco, suggests in the article
that the immune system is more resilient than is widely believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to say, `Wait a second _ it looks good for one or
two years, but in the long run, is it going to be the answer?'''
Levy said in an interview. ``The balance should be that when you
need them, they're wonderful, but save them for the time when you
need them. I have seen physicians jumping in to give the drugs even
in some cases where there is very little virus in the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for delaying treatment has gained strength as optimism
has faded that the new therapies are a cure, and as people have
become more concerned about dangerous side effects and the
appearance of drug-resistant HIV strains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole `hit early, hit hard' approach made a lot of sense
if we thought we could cure the infection, but with a growing
amount of evidence that we can't do that, it changes the balance a
bit,'' said Dr. Roy Gulick, an assistant professor of medicine at
Cornell University Medical College and the co-director of the
Cornell Clinical Trials Unit. ``You find an enormous amount of
variability right now in terms of aggressiveness'' of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gulick and other AIDS specialists say the advantages of
the new drugs greatly outweigh their disadvantages. ``These
therapies are life-saving,'' Gulick said, ``and anyone with
advanced disease or even middle disease is going to benefit from
the therapies in terms of not developing AIDS as fast and actually
living longer.''
</P>
<P>
   By most people's reckoning, the drug-naive group in New York is
daring. Most of the members have dwindling counts of
disease-fighting cells and high levels of virus that go far beyond
what doctors would consider acceptable without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, the men in the support group sat around a
conference table in an office that seemed to pay homage to a
different era. Neon-orange chairs and donated furniture were
scattered about. Posters vied for space on crowded olive-green
walls. Besides providing treatment education, the People With AIDS
Health Group is one of the nation's oldest ``buyers' clubs,'' as
they are known. The organization sells pharmaceutical drugs that
are approved in other countries, but not in the United States, to
fight opportunistic infections.
</P>
<P>
   John Condelario, a 44-year-old vegetarian with a shaved head,
earrings and a tattoo on a muscled arm, took Niedzolkowski's place
as moderator. There was also a newcomer, a prosperous-looking young
man in a navy blazer and khaki pants who announced that he needed
guidance on whether to start treatment with anti-viral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the support group did not quite know what to make of
the stranger. They frown on curiosity seekers, preferring to spend
their time seriously hashing out technical advice, reviewing their
lab sheets and discussing natural treatments like elderberries,
milk thistle and vitamin B-12 shots. But the men listened politely
to the newcomer, answered questions and shared stories of how they
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Jordan Smith, a reed-thin man who at 62 looks a decade
younger but is the oldest member of the group, told of how doctors
had badgered him and accused him of being in denial about the
disease. He resisted their pleas to use anti-viral drugs. Instead,
he sees an acupuncturist, uses holistic therapies and meticulously
charts his lab results. He also leads an active life, dancing at
discos into the early morning, waving a glow stick to house music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good 13 or 14 years for me, and I'm still here,
miraculously,'' said Smith, an administrative assistant. ``My
feeling is, I'm going to hold out for as long as I can with the
hope that if and when it becomes necessary, the drugs maybe will
get better, that they'll be less toxic. Maybe they will know about
long-term side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Condelario said he tested positive two years ago. He said he
panicked when he first learned of his test results and even wrote a
suicide note, before he set out to do his own research. That work
led him to the support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the group's been the stuff that has kept my mind
straight in terms of, `Am I doing the right thing?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Condelario was barely able to contain his excitement about
something else that was on his mind. He had just received his
latest laboratory test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some good news to share,'' he said, lifting his fists
triumphantly. He said that his T-cell count had risen to 679 from
408, and that the level of virus in his blood had fallen
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The group congratulated him. ``How did you do it?'' asked the
newcomer, who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Condelario was not sure. But he said he reduced his stress by
switching jobs at the human resources company where he works.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really haven't altered the antioxidants or the herbs?''
Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
   Condelario replied: ``I went a week without my supplements, and
I sort of panicked. But the week before my blood test, I started
taking them again. That could have been it. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomer, who tested positive seven years ago, told the
support group that he was weighing the pros and cons of using the
drugs. He said he felt more fatigued lately; he also has a
persistent dry cough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to a lot of people,'' he said. ``Everybody I
know is positive and on drugs. They all said I'm crazy, nuts, to
stay off of them. They are all so thrilled about having their viral
loads down to nondetectable. I don't think it's so important to be
nondetectable, but I do want to keep it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The man wondered aloud whether he should make a move from his
high-stress real-estate job. He also worried that ``all hell would
break loose'' if he took the new drugs and did not adhere to the
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   He got no clear-cut answer. ``We can't convince you to do one
thing or the other; that's up to you,'' said Smith, the senior
member of the support group. ``Everybody has a different way of
approaching this. We all sit here with reasons of our own for not
wanting to do the drugs. None of us are adamantly against the
drugs. If we need them to keep living, we will do it. But many of
us want to hold off as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedzolkowski, who was at home with fever and aches that night,
barely got a mention in the meeting. Others in the group did not
seem bothered: some have also experienced allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Niedzolkowski's psychotherapist, Michael Shernoff, whose own HIV
viral level is now undetectable because of the new drugs, said his
client was neither a fanatic nor self-destructive. ``Mark pushes
the envelope, but it's his right,'' Shernoff said. ``He's doing it
as an extremely well-educated consumer. Those of us who have
elected to take the meds are probably in what is the largest
uncontrolled study in the world. We are all guinea pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Niedzolkowski's doctor, William Shay of Manhattan, is
clearly worried. At every opportunity, he tries to nudge his
patient toward starting the anti-viral drugs. Shay said that the
average person with a high level of virus in the blood was better
off taking the drugs than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is delaying the inevitable,'' Shay said. ``His T-cells
are falling, and his viral load is high. I just hope he doesn't
wait too long. He is in a spot. He is putting himself at risk of
infection and the loss of more T-cells that may not be replaceable.
I don't know what the magic moment is.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a wild week at the office for House
Republicans, who, being Republicans, talked a lot after a bruising
midterm election about re-evaluating their company's sudden loss of
market share, ``looking at everyone from the CEO to the janitor,''
as Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., put it.
</P>
<P>
   But upon abruptly losing their boss, Speaker Newt Gingrich, on
Friday, the same Republicans who had spent much of the year
fighting _ scheduling votes and then postponing them, failing even
to pass a budget _ seemed united, if for only a moment, in their
relief. The worst seemed behind them now.
</P>
<P>
   And in a moment, said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., a moderate,
the focus shifted to the immediate future and the enormous
challenge of governing with a six-vote majority: ``Now,'' Mrs.
Roukema said, ``we've got to roll up our sleeves and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already seemed to have a few ideas about how to do
that, saying they should focus on tax cuts and work through
disagreements rather than run from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any family therapist will tell you the worst thing you can do
is sweep your problems under the rug,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon,
R-Ariz., one of the conservatives in the Class of '94 who have
grown increasingly unhappy with Gingrich and who had been first to
say that he planned to block Gingrich's re-election as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The fight averted _ the battle Gingrich had been expected to
wage to hold on to power _ may yet give way to the fight to succeed
him. But for now, some of the candidates for leadership roles were
trying to out-nice one another on CNN's Larry King Live, offering
lavish tributes to Gingrich and to each another.
</P>
<P>
   There was still no agreement on where Republicans had gone
wrong: Had their error been in betraying their core conservative
beliefs or in being held hostage by them? But in the days since the
election, there has been a surprising consensus among both
conservative and more moderate House Republicans on both what
agenda they should pursue and how they might push it more
effectively in the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   All manner of Republicans said that one of their most serious
problems had been their leadership's apparent fear of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason we put off looking at appropriations for
seven or eight months, with one excuse after another, and then came
up at the end of the session with this omnibus bill that had
everything but the kitchen sink in it and busted the budget,'' Mrs.
Roukema said. ``It was all because they didn't want to look as
though they were giving in to the president, or forcing a shutdown,
or showing divisions in the party. They didn't want to face any of
it, but we should bring these things to the floor and that's it. We
win or we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Souder, R-Ind., who is more conservative, used almost
identical language to describe his frustrations. ``Sometimes you
have to be willing to try something and lose,'' Souder said. ``But
we're afraid the news media and the public will decide we're not
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of working through hard questions, he said, ``We
hold, we hold, we hold.'' And at the end of the session, he said,
with another potentially disastrous government shutdown looming,
nothing is accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Souder and others said that applying a few management principles
from the business world would not hurt the party. Neither would a
little discipline and organizational skill. ``Last year we came in
and diddled around for two months,'' Souder said. ``Why can't the
budget committee be meeting in December? Ninety percent of this
stuff can be done ahead of time, but we don't even get rolling
until March.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a basic agreement, even among social
conservatives, that economic issues have often been shortchanged,
to the party's detriment. The next Congress, many said, should be
tightly focused on tax cuts, education, health care and protecting
Social Security. Those who oppose abortion rights said they should
fight hard, vote to ban certain late-term abortions _ and when they
are vetoed, put the onus on the president.
</P>
<P>
   And, they hope to learn to sell that agenda with better
marketing and public relations, a softer approach and a nicer
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get serious about outreach'' to minorities and
others who have not traditionally been part of the Republican base,
said Watts, who is black, adding: ``I've been beating my head
against the wall on that for four years. We've got to get more
market share. You can't just throw mud on the wall 60 days before
an election and pray some of it sticks. You have to have a plan
that says, `Here's my view of the future, and it includes you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Northup, R-Ky., said that without such a clear message,
cleanly articulated, ``certain members that don't enjoy the popular
support of the conference just take it upon themselves to
articulate something'' that damages the image of the whole group.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, ``There are certain members that have
homosexual issues very high on their agenda.'' Ms. Northup said
that Republicans might agree that homosexuals should not be able to
marry or adopt children, adding: ``But it's not at the top of our
agenda. If that's what wakes you up in the morning, then people
will think, well, maybe you are mean-spirited. And if you are
mean-spirited about that, then maybe you're mean-spirited about our
elderly or our handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Northup advocates a brand of ``compassionate conservatism.''
But some of those who have been the public face of the party in the
House, she said, ``don't understand this in their core.''

   ``People who represent districts where there is disregard for
people who've struggled or who come at life from a different angle,
leadership has had no concept,'' Ms. Northup said. ``They want
somebody in some focus group to tell them better words to use, but
they don't feel it in their hearts.''

<P>
   She is also among those who find fault with both conservative
purists and an older generation of Republican legislators she
described as altogether too cozy with Democrats, with ``a
holier-than-thou attitude towards the conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   And while a whole raft of issues, notably social issues, still
divides the House Republicans, many feel the more serious problem
is one of attitude. ``We've got a real comity crisis, and the
public wants a more thoughtful process for resolving the issues
with greater respect for various sides,'' said Rep. Jim Leach,
R-Iowa, a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   There is the sense that as a group, House Republicans may never
know what hit them on Nov. 3. Speaking of the Republicans'
apparently misguided decision to sponsor campaign commercials
reminding voters of the presidential sex scandal, Rep. John Linder,
R-Ga., who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee,
said: ``It was Newt's consultant who said, `We've got to deal with
this,' and I agreed with him. It brought together all we had argued
against. Then we were accused of doing unfair things by bringing up
Monica Lewinsky. I don't know. I do not know how Americans respond
to this.''
</P>
<P>
   With a deep sigh, Linder added, ``But then, we must just go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the sense that there is no more time to spend
meditating on these mysteries a mere two years before the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot to do in two years,'' said Rep. Michael
Forbes, R-N.Y., who has become increasingly moderate since his
election in 1994 and was the first to announce he would not support
Gingrich for speaker two years ago. ``I think the fight's over, so
it clears the path,'' Forbes said. ``Now we can do some of the
things we've talked about.''

TOMMY FLOWERS, 92; BROKE NAZI CODES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tommy Flowers, a British civil servant with a genius for
electronics whose pioneering Colossus computers enabled the Allies
to decode top-level German military communications in World War II,
died Oct. 28 at his home in London. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   The Colossus machines were once described by Flowers as a
``string-and-sealing-wax affair.'' But they became the capstone of
the intelligence operation known as Ultra, which outwitted the
Germans and, in the words of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, ``saved
thousands of British and American lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Britain went to war with Germany in the summer of
1939, many of its leading mathematicians, cryptographers and
technicians were assembled at Bletchley Park, a Victorian-era
estate 55 miles north of London. It was there that the German
military codes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers was named a Member of the British Empire, receiving a
1,000-pound award for the decoding of military messages from the
German Enigma machines in the war's early years.
</P>
<P>
   But his major contribution came in 1944 and 1945, when the
computers he designed tackled the codes produced by the more
sophisticated German Lorenz machines. The deciphering of those
messages, between Hitler's headquarters and his generals, gave the
British and Americans insight into German defenses for the D-Day
invasion and subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Harold Flowers was born on Dec. 22, 1905, in London,
where his father installed bakery machines. Early on, he showed a
penchant for engineering. As his son Kenneth related, ``When he was
age 5 he was told he'd just gotten a baby sister. He said, `I'd
rather have a No. 5 Meccano,''' a construction kit.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers obtained a degree in engineering from the University of
London and in the late 1930s experimented with electronic telephone
transmissions for the research arm of the British Post Office,
which oversaw the nation's communications.
</P>
<P>
   He was enlisted in the Bletchley Park effort in 1942, although
he later developed his computer at the Post Office's Dollis Hill
research station in London.
</P>
<P>
   The British deduced the principals behind the Lorenz codes, but
had been frustrated in developing technology for quick decoding.
The machine the British were using in 1943 was slow and unreliable,
and sometimes caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of nine months, working with several senior
engineering aides and a few dozen technicians, Flowers developed
the first large electronic-valve computer, overcoming the
skepticism of Bletchley Park officials.
</P>
<P>
   Colossus measured 16 feet by 7 feet, weighed one ton and was put
together partly with standard telephone-exchange parts, the
``string and sealing wax.'' Although primitive by today's
standards, it quickly pinpointed the wheel settings used by the
Germans' Lorenz machine operators for coded messages, an essential
first step in deciphering. Another device then completed the
decoding.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they delivered the machine to Bletchley Park in
December 1943, it was a sensation,'' said Professor Brian Randell
of the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, an authority on the
program. ``It was an incredibly revolutionary idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Flowers wrote how ``at the time I had no thought
or knowledge of computers in the modern sense and had never heard
the term used except to describe somebody who did calculations on a
desk machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's government wanted 10 Colossus devices delivered by
early June 1944, for the D-Day invasion. At least 10 machines were
in operation by the war's end, but only one more Colossus could be
produced in time for the Allied invasion of Normandy, on June 6.
That machine was, however, five times as fast as the first
Colossus, which started work the previous December.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, British authorities dismantled most of the
Colossus machines. The very existence of Bletchley Park and the
Colossus computers remained secret until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers returned to his electronics research for the Post Office
and remained there until 1964. He then worked for a division of
International Telephone and Telegraph, before retiring in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Kenneth, of Beverley, England, he is
survived by his wife, Eileen; another son, John, of London, and
three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Randell remembered how Flowers was ``very quiet and modest''
when finally allowed by British authorities to reveal his
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to come to terms with the fact that he was now being
encouraged to talk about something that he'd been very actively
discouraged from almost thinking about for 30 years,'' Randell
observed.
</P>
<P>
   Although recognized by the scientific community, Flowers
remained largely unknown to the British public. Yet his work lives
on at Bletchley Park, which is now a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Run by a historic trust, it displays the Germans' Enigma and
Lorenz machines. But the centerpiece is a replica of the Colossus
computer, which was switched on by the Duke of Kent _ in the
presence of Flowers _ on June 6, 1996, the 52nd anniversary of the
D-Day invasion, which marked the beginning of the end for Nazi
Germany.

PEACEMAKERS CONVERGE ON CAMPUS TO REVERSE APATHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (mk) 
 By IAN ZACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ That wispy but stubborn ideal ``world
peace'' attempted a comeback here on the cold asphalt outside a
college football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 University of Virginia students camped out all night
Sunday in the frigid fall air for a chance to snag the hottest
ticket in town _ not for a rock concert or championship bowl game
but for an academic conference featuring some of the world's most
famous peacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I just shook the Dalai Lama's hand!'' Jocelyn
Diaz, a 21-year-old senior, shouted at the close of the two-day
conference on Friday. ``I feel changed by this. You get so caught
up with your life and then you see these people who are making so
much of a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare joint appearance, seven winners of the Nobel Peace
Prize descended on the campus here and preached forgiveness and a
shared responsibility for ending suffering around the world.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing together the Nobel laureates, the university hoped
to inspire its politically apathetic student body and others into
turning their attention away from material concerns for more than a
moment to the world's victims of war, genocide, ethnic conflict and
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, who received the 1984
Nobel Prize for his work against apartheid, delivered a rousing
speech to a standing-room only crowd in a university auditorium,
pleading for help ``in realizing my dream, my dream of a world that
is more caring, a world that is more compassionate, a world where
people matter more than profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Jody Williams, the American who shared the 1997 prize for her
efforts to rid the world of its millions of land mines, urged
students to get involved in causes and help change the things they
abhor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sit back and worry and don't sit back and cry and don't
sit back and wait for the other guy to do it,'' Ms. Williams said.
``Join in and make it better yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama of Tibet, the 1989 laureate, wearing a maroon
monk's robe, exhorted students to look within and find their
generous spirit. ``Caring about others,'' he said softly, ``is a
great benefit for the self.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were joined by former President Oscar Arias Sanchez of
Costa Rica (1987), Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor (1996), Rigoberta
Menchu Tum of Guatemala (1992), Betty Williams of Northern Ireland
(1976) and Bobby Muller, an American who represented the
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which shared the 1997
prize. Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (1991) sent a surrogate because
she is prevented by her government from traveling freely.
</P>
<P>
   Professors said they thought the presence of the laureates at
the university would inspire students and others to think about the
world beyond the country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much less time is spent on international issues than 10 or 15
years ago,'' said Melvyn Leffler, a professor of history. ``With
the end of the Cold War, our focus has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia, as at many of the nation's college campuses,
activism peaked in the late 1960s and early '70s with protests
against the war in Vietnam. The last major protests here were in
the late 1980s, when students erected shanties on campus to
denounce the university's investments in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the atmosphere is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are so apathetic here,'' said Rebecca Daugherty, a
junior. ``They just go to class and drink and never stop to think
about what's happening in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students clearly were moved by the Nobel laureates, though.
``Attending a single event can have a consciousness-raising
effect,'' said Cristina Bull, a 19-year-old junior, who pledged to
help Betty Williams campaign to get computers to poor schools in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just reminds you that there are people who care so much
about causes,'' she added. ``It makes you want to get involved.''

A TRANSIT TEMPLE'S BURIED STONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under a light drizzle on the morning of Oct. 28,
1963, demolition crews began dismantling the mighty pink Milford
granite walls of Pennsylvania Station.
</P>
<P>
   They are still doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was largely demolished in the early 1960s, old
Pennsylvania Station was too big to be erased entirely. Distinctive
remnants of the original McKim, Mead &AMP; White masterpiece can be
found exactly where they have been since 1910: brass balustrades,
glass-block and Belgian-block paving, marble floors and a delicate
cast-iron track indicator.
</P>
<P>
   But no vestige has been as substantial and surprising as an
8-foot-high section of granite wall that emerged last month from
behind the cinder block partition of an abandoned underground
office suite. The partition was being torn down to prepare for New
Jersey Transit's new $105 million waiting room and passenger
concourse in the southeast corner of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about the size of blocks they used to build the
Pyramids,'' said Saundra Lautenberg, the program manager for
engineering and construction at N.J. Transit.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the stones are not quite that big, the wall constitutes
an extraordinary urban archaeological find under West 31st Street
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 20 feet long, the granite wall is composed of a massive
curb and two courses of finely finished stone on which the message
``Drive Slow'' can still be read. It once enclosed a covered taxi
ramp that brought passengers _ including Farley Granger, at the
climax of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a Train'' _ directly to
the waiting room from Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope that, rather than jackhammering this wall into
rubble, some blocks can be salvaged and incorporated as a
commemorative element in the Amtrak concourse that is being planned
within the General Post Office, or James A. Farley Building, across
Eighth Avenue from the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very beautiful pieces of stone,'' said Alexandros E.
Washburn, president of the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment
Corp., the state agency overseeing the Farley building plan.
``You're always surprised by the scale of the old station. It's as
if it had been built by giants.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how the blocks would be removed. But because
they are only about 4 inches thick, Ms. Lautenberg said it appeared
that they could be taken out whole. On a visit to the wall last
week with Washburn, she pledged cooperation in any salvage effort,
short of helping to finance it.
</P>
<P>
   The construction project that uncovered the wall is one of
several being undertaken to adapt the cramped station to its
growing role as a commuter hub and its future role serving
high-speed trains on the Northeast Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Ernst, the general manager of the New York metropolitan
division of Amtrak, is a veteran of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who
wastes little sentiment on the architecture of the old station.
``It was kind of a cold, vast place,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But from an operational standpoint, he regrets the demolition.
``At that time,'' Ernst said, ``they could get away with a loss of
passenger movement capacity. We can't get away with that any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   N.J. Transit will add stairs, escalators and elevators to the
east end of Platforms 1 through 6, connecting them to a new
51,000-square-foot, split-level passenger concourse, waiting room
and ticket counter. The space, formerly used for stores and
offices, is being leased from Amtrak for 99 years.
</P>
<P>
   The East End Concourse is to open in mid-2001. It is being
financed by the federal government, New Jersey Transportation Trust
Fund and Metro-North Railroad, some of whose passengers are carried
by N.J. Transit. Sverdrup &AMP; Parcel are the architects. O'Brien
Kreitzberg is the construction manager.
</P>
<P>
   N.J. Transit executive director Shirley DeLibero said the East
End Concourse would ``reduce the bottleneck between Platforms 1
through 6 and the street, improving the quality of life for our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of life for travelers will get worse before it gets
better, however, since Amtrak has just begun a $37.5 million
remodeling of its concourse, to prepare for the inauguration next
year of 150-mile-per-hour train service between Washington and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Four escalators will connect the concourse and platforms, and
two waiting rooms will be built, one solely for high-speed trains.
The architects are Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum. The construction
manager is Tishman Construction Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In December 2002, if all goes according to plan, Amtrak would
move to a new concourse and ticketing hall in the Farley building,
probably leaving the existing concourse to N.J. Transit and the
Long Island Rail Road.
</P>
<P>
   The Farley design will incorporate architectural details from
the original station like the granite wall and the balustrades with
X-shaped ironwork that are now being removed from the central
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   At the back of Amtrak's baggage storage area, above Platform 1,
is the last of the 12-feet-tall track indicators that once stood at
the head of each stairway.
</P>
<P>
   A minor work of art in its own right, the indicator looks
something like a grandfather clock, its face supported on scrolled
brackets and topped by an arched pediment. The departure time of
``1 - - 7'' is displayed, the two middle numerals missing. (Did it
last herald a 10:27 train? A 12:07? An 11:17?)
</P>
<P>
   ``It should go to a more prominent place,'' said Fred Bartoli,
Amtrak's manager of high-speed rail and facility programs. ``There
is so much around you that is hidden from view.''
</P>
<P>
   One remnant is in plain sight: the basic layout of a shop-lined
arcade from Seventh Avenue that ushers passengers through a
midblock gallery (originally the general waiting room, now a
rotunda with an illuminated billboard) to a concourse paralleling
Eighth Avenue that leads to the 11 platforms below.
</P>
<P>
   The public can glimpse the shadows of Pennsylvania Station on
the fourth Monday of every month, at 12:30 p.m., on free tours
given by Lorraine Diehl, the author of ``The Late, Great
Pennsylvania Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she is a longtime chronicler of the lost landmark, Ms.
Diehl regarded the newly excavated wall rather coolly. ``It was so
abstract,'' she said. ``It was like discovering a dinosaur claw
long after the dinosaur is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old carriageways were one of the most romantic parts of
the station, with the play of light and shadow,'' she said. ``The
station is really gone. When you're looking for it in these tiny
pieces, it's too heartbreaking.''

   In defeating Sen. Alfonse D'Amato by nine percentage points on
Tuesday, Charles Schumer gathered the support of many traditional
Democratic demographic groups, some of whom had deserted Democratic
candidates in the previous two contests for this seat.
</P>
<P>
   Women, blacks, Jews, Democrats, moderates and affluent voters
all gave Schumer a large share of their votes. D'Amato did best
among whites, conservatives, men and less-educated voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who defeated his Democratic challenger,
Peter Vallone, by more than 20 points, was supported by voters from
all age groups, former supporters of President Bush and Ross Perot,
and both men and women. Liberals, voters with postgraduate
education and Hispanic voters all gave Vallone a large portion of
their support.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying table is based on surveys of voters leaving
polling stations throughout New York state, and shows how about 60
demographic groups voted for U.S. senator in 1992 and 1998, and how
they voted for governor in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Race and Religion
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato received the support of most white voters, Schumer
increased the Democratic share of white voters. Compared with four
years ago, Pataki did better this year among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates were favored by a majority of black
and Hispanic voters. Hispanic voters were more supportive of
Schumer and Vallone than they were of Democrats in 1994 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In his re-election bids in 1986 and 1992, D'Amato was supported
by about 40 percent of Jewish voters, traditionally strong
supporters of Democratic candidates. Schumer was able to get the
support of three-quarters of Jewish voters. Jewish voters gave
Vallone much less support than they gave Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Gender Gap
</P>
<P>
   There is a 10-point gender gap among Schumer's voters. The
gender gap _ the difference between the percentage of men and the
percentage of women supporting a candidate _ is seen in all age
groups, from 13 points between men and women under 30 to six points
for men and women ages 30 to 45.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a seven-point gender gap among Pataki's
supporters in 1994, the difference between his support from men and
his support from women dropped to two points this year.
</P>
<P>
   Party Loyalty
</P>
<P>
   Schumer did a better job of holding the votes of self-identified
Democrats than Vallone did against Pataki this year, or Robert
Abrams, then the state attorney general, did against D'Amato in
1992. In 1992, more than a quarter of Democrats voted for D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pataki and D'Amato received more than three-quarters of the
votes from Republicans. Independents divided almost equally between
the candidates in the Senate race, but Vallone received only a
third of the independent vote.
</P>
<P>
   Data for 1998 were collected by Voter News Service based on
questionnaires completed by 2,191 voters leaving 45 polling places
throughout New York state on Election Day. Data for 1994 were
collected by Voter News Service based on questionnaires completed
by 1,775 voters. Data for 1992 were collected by Voter Research and
Surveys based on questionnaires completed by 1,997 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Those who gave no answer or voted for other candidates are not
shown. Dashes indicate that a question was not asked or a category
was not provided in a particular year. Asterisks indicate that
there was an insufficient number of respondents in that subgroup.
Family financial situation is compared with four years earlier for
1992 and with two years earlier for 1994 and 1998.

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle Discovery returned
safely to the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday after a nine-day
mission, with its oldest crew member, Sen. John Glenn, reassuring
mission control that he felt as good on Earth as he had in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to reprise a statement that I made a long, long time
ago,'' Glenn said on landing, ``except this time it is, `One-G and
I feel fine.' Discovery and this crew took us around and around,
and that view is still tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, when Glenn became the first American to circle the
planet, his first words from orbit were, ``Zero G and I feel fine.
... Oh, that view is tremendous.'' Saturday, at 77, he returned to
earth as the world's oldest astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded by two sonic booms, the shuttle appeared in sunny skies
over Florida's east coast and touched down at 12:04 p.m. in what a
mission control commentator in Houston called ``a beautiful
landing.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing cover of a parachute compartment that fell off
during the launching on Oct. 29 did not pose a hazard in the
shuttle's descent and landing, NASA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the insulation-covered aluminum panel forced the
shuttle to do without the stowed parachute to help brake the
shuttle's speed on the runway. Other shuttles have landed safely
without such drag chutes, and NASA officials had not expected
Discovery to experience any problems Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA administrator, Dan Goldin, said he planned to tell
Glenn, ``You're a true American hero. You got back in that shuttle
because you believed you'd improve life here on Earth. You did
everything you promised me you'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, Glenn emerged from the crew transport
vehicle with Discovery's other crew members, smiling as he came
down the stairs. The crew, with Glenn walking somewhat haltingly,
then walked around the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife, Annie, his son, David, daughter, Lyn, two
grandchildren and the Waterford High School band from Ohio, Glenn's
home state and the one he has represented as a U.S. senator for
almost 25 years, were there to witness his return.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether too much attention had been showered on Glenn,
Goldin said, ``Yes and no.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Glenn's return to space had created new interest in
science, but he said that his agency had no interest ``in getting
attention just to get more money.'' He added, ``It's our hope and
dream that the same excitement prevails'' for future projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't wait for Senator Glenn's third launch before you come
back,'' he told reporters gathered at the landing site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldin said that any decision on whether future shuttle missions
would include other elderly crew members would come in a year or
two and depended in part on the results of studies from Glenn's
flight. He said scientists agreed that ``this ought to be an
exploratory flight, not a pilot flight.''
</P>
<P>
   William Readdy, NASA's shuttle program director, told reporters
Saturday, ``The mission vastly exceeded everybody's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Readdy, a veteran of three shuttle missions, said that after
nine days of weightlessness, Discovery's crew members would hit the
ground feeling heavy, clumsy and thirsty from dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like stepping on a pier after being at sea for a while,''
Readdy said. ``You're not quite as coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With younger people it's all reversible,'' he said. ``The
interesting thing would be how John Glenn recovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery on Tuesday of an $11 million satellite carrying
images of the sun, two days after it was released by the shuttle
astronauts, was a vindication of sorts for NASA, which botched an
effort to use the satellite, Spartan, in a flight last year. It
tumbled out of control then because of crew errors, and two
space-walking astronauts had to go out and haul it in.
</P>
<P>
   This time the shuttle's commander, Lt. Col. Curtis Brown Jr.,
pulled up alongside the satellite, and another crew member, Stephen
Robinson, slowly caught the Spartan with a robot arm. NASA expects
some 1,200 images of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, and the
charged particles streaming off the sun's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, back in orbit after 36 years, said during the mission
that he enjoyed floating in the shuttle, which is far more spacious
than the tiny cockpit he occupied on his first flight. He said he
had suffered no motion sickness and was eating heartily. Glenn, who
is retiring from the Senate in January, became the first American
to orbit Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962. He is now also the oldest person
to travel in space.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the aging-related research involving Glenn, the
seven-member crew conducted scores of experiments ranging from
solar physics and astronomy to the design of new drug delivery
systems, studies of artificial bone, and testing of insulation
material for the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 80 experiments aboard the Discovery are
housed in a pressurized laboratory in the cargo bay that is
connected to the shuttle's crew quarters by a tunnel. This
laboratory, privately owned and operated by Spacehab Inc. of
Vienna, Va., contains research like an experiment with aerogel, the
lightest solid known.
</P>
<P>
   Spacehab also houses a bioreactor, a device that allows cell
cultures to be grown in space in rotating cylinders. Astronauts are
tending several experiments for growing human cells, including
research into making artificial and synthetic material more
acceptable for human implantation by seeding it first with bone
cells. This work, researchers said, could lead to synthetic bone to
repair limbs damaged by accidents or for dental reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments, like the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital
Systems Test, or HOST, developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md., are in the shuttle's open cargo bay. A
platform in the bay contains several instruments and devices
tentatively scheduled to be installed on Hubble during its next
servicing mission in the year 2000, said Rud V. Moe, payload
coordinator at Goddard.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was poked and prodded during the mission because of
similarities between what happens to astronauts in space and bodily
changes due to age, like loss of bone and muscle mass, greater
susceptibility to infection and sleeping difficulties. The
experiments required him to provide 10 blood samples and 16 urine
samples while in space.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodletting was part of a ``protein turnover'' experiment
to study muscle wasting by tracking protein building and breakdown.
Data are being collected in six three-day sessions before, during
and after the flight. Each session, including the two in space,
requires five blood samples each taken from the senator and a
fellow crew member, 35-year-old Pedro Duque.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glenn and another crewmate, Dr. Chiaki Mukai, 46,
are doing sleep studies by wearing specially instrumented suits and
caps to measure breathing, chest expansion, eye movement and brain
waves when they go to bed.

THE BREEDERS' CUP: RICH AND GETTING RICHER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ This year marks the fourth time that Churchill
Downs has played host to the Breeders' Cup. It's not yet racing's
most prestigious event and may never be because of the aura that
surrounds the Kentucky Derby, but from its inception in 1984, the
Breeders' Cup has staged racing's richest day, and it is getting
richer. The seven cup races of 1998 featured a record purse
distribution of $13,220,000.
</P>
<P>
   For racing fans, the Breeders' Cup represents a year-end
championship, where Cigar and Favorite Trick closed out undefeated
seasons, where Personal Ensign completed an undefeated career, and
where the longest shot on the board, Arcangues, returned $269.20
when he won the 1993 Classic. Such deeds thrill industry insiders,
too, but there are other facets of the competition to be
considered, involving where future Breeders' Cups will be run.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill has a lock on the Derby. The Louisville track created
the race, has run it for 123 years, and guards the property rights
with an in-house team of corporate lawyers. But the Breeders' Cup
is owned and run by Breeders' Cup Ltd., headquartered in Lexington,
Ky., 75 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Churchill and Breeders' Cup officials
discussed the possibility of the track's permanently playing host
to the event. ``The talks don't amount to much,'' said Karl Schmitt
Jr., Churchill's vice president of corporate communications. ``The
Breeders' Cup has an informal location system where it moves around
the country. Churchill supports this, because it best serves the
promotion of our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the rotation has taken the event to Hollywood Park
three times and to Santa Anita twice. Both tracks are in Southern
California. Gulfstream Park near Miami has run the Breeders' Cup
twice, and will again on Nov. 6, 1999. Woodbine, in Toronto, has
held it once, and the Breeders' Cup has made three trips to New
York, to Aqueduct in 1985 and to Belmont Park in 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill has produced the largest crowds. The track drew 71,237
when it first played host in 1988. It drew 66,204 in 1991 and
71,671 in 1994. The following year, the event lured barely half
that many people to Belmont. The average Breeders' Cup attendance
at sites other than Churchill has been 51,602.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville borders thoroughbred country. The industry's
pre-eminent farms, Claiborne, Lane's End, Three Chimneys and the
historic Calumet, are all in or near Lexington. They are heavily
represented on the Breeders' Cup's 44-member board of directors.
Three of the directors also served on Churchill's board, including
William Farish, who is a master of Lane's End and the track's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our World Series, and with its Derby heritage,
Louisville knows how to handle it,'' Farish said. ``The hotels,
restaurants, transportation systems, they're all experienced in
dealing with a crush. And the population here consists of horse
racing fans. We don't have to explain to them that a Breeders' Cup
horse was a Derby, Preakness or Belmont Stakes winner. They already
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Farish supports the rotation concept. The bulk of the money
that Breeders' Cup puts toward purses comes from nomination fees,
which are paid annually for stallions and once, at a cost of $500
each, for foals. In North America, Kentucky ranks third in
thoroughbred stallions and first in foal production. Florida is
fourth in stallions, and second in foal production. California
ranks second in stallions, third in the production of foals. Tracks
in these states will almost certainly be included in a permanent
rotation system, if one is established.
</P>
<P>
   A Breeders' Cup site is usually chosen two years in advance.
Several major tracks have never expressed interest. Pimlico in
Baltimore, home of the Preakness, has yet to submit a bid. Neither
has Arlington International Racecourse near Chicago. Both have the
necessary facilities: A main track at least one mile in
circumference; a turf course; large dining areas, and the ability
to handle crowds of 50,000-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Park, which opened last year near Dallas, wants to be
in the mix. Texas legalized parimutuel wagering in 1989, and now
ranks first in thoroughbred stallions and fourth in foal
production. ``Having a Breeders' Cup here is our No. 1 goal,''
Corey Johnsen, the Lone Star general manager, said.

JUNIOR RIDER FINDS THE VIRTUE IN STUBBORNNESS

 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She cuts such an elegant figure in her second-skin
jodphurs and knee-high riding boots, a bejeweled dragonfly clip
adding a whimsical teen-age touch to her blond hair, that it's hard
to imagine she suffers, along with 1.4 million other Americans,
from an incurable disease that kills many thousands of them every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, especially when she has jumped a clean round of the
sort that helped her fulfill a dream and qualify for the
prestigious Maclay Championships Sunday at the National Horse Show,
even Kathie Ruffatto forgets she's sick. But when it comes time to
plunge a syringe filled with Methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent
used by oncologists for cancer treatment, into her thigh each week,
Ruffatto gets a jolt of reality.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many mornings when the 100-pound Ruffatto,
bedeviled at 17 by a case of systemic lupus so severe that it used
to make her faint dead away in midleap during horse show
competitions, is simply too exhausted to drag herself out of bed.
Her joints get sore and swollen; her fatigue rules out attending
high school (she has been home-schooled since her sophomore year
and hopes to start college in January), much less any possibility
of piloting a spirited, half-ton show horse.
</P>
<P>
   Lupus causes the body's immune system to attack its own cells
and tissues. Despite a daunting drug regimen that includes a hefty
dosage of Prednisone, which mitigates the inflammation in her
joints but builds perilously brittle bones, and Fluorinef, which
regulates her electrolytes and appears to have halted her fainting
spells, there are times when Ruffatto feels ``like a robot'' _ the
way she felt before her illness was finally diagnosed three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see videos of myself falling off my horse during
competition, it just looked like a dead body falling to the
ground,'' said Ruffatto, whose symptoms flared when she was 10.
Miraculously, she never hurt herself in any of her tumbles.
Stubbornly, whenever her baffled parents begged her to stay off her
horse _ they were advised by pediatricians that parental pressure
and stage fright were causing her spills _ she denied she felt
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she knows for sure she is sick, and may have to cope
with the disease forever, Ruffatto's stubbornness has become a
virtue. It's her refusal to give up her horses and bow to her
disease that enabled her to ride in Madison Square Garden in the
same ring as the world and Olympic champions of a sport that is,
she said, ``who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Michael and Joan, and her physician, Dr. Terri
Finkel of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in
Denver, and her riding coach, Wilson Dennehy, whose daughter, Liza,
also has lupus but continues to show horses, have all agreed that
it's the riding that inspires Ruffatto to get out of bed each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the fact she gets up on these horses and
competes is more dangerous than if she didn't, but I wouldn't let
her ride if I thought it was life-threatening,'' said Finkel, who
specializes in pediatric rheumatology and, during Ruffatto's
complicated diagnosis, at one point feared her patient was
suffering from lymphomic cancer at 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that she might be on a slightly lower dosage of
medication if she wasn't competing, but I think it's riding that
keeps her going,'' Finkel said. ``Kathie is very unusual in that
she has this intense drive to live a normal life. Unfortunately,
that's not true of most kids who are dealing with a disease like
this. Many of them end up with chronic illness syndrome, just kind
of withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maclay is the ultimate test for the 72 junior riders judged
the best in North America after strenuous regional preliminaries.
After flying from Denver to New York on Tuesday to rest up and
practice, all Ruffatto could do was hope that Sunday morning, the
most important of her life, would be one of her good mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was excited about seeing ``The Lion King'' on
Wednesday night, her parents went off to the theater by themselves;
she was too tired to leave the hotel. And because her own horse,
given the Lion King-inspired name Haukana Matata (No Worries), was
deemed too green to handle the claustrophobia of the Garden, she
left him at home in Denver and leased a junior circuit veteran,
Picasso, for this competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad because my horse is the one I qualified on,'' said
Ruffatto, ``but I also wanted to be safe and not have to worry
about either of us getting hurt. Ever since I started showing, I
dreamed of riding in the Maclay, but in truth I never thought I'd
be able to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an escape route for me when I'm riding, because
when I'm on a horse, I feel like I'm the same as everyone else,
sort of, even though I can't do all the things everyone else
does,'' said Ruffatto, whose short supply of stamina prohibits her
from doing the grooming and warm-up schooling that is second nature
to most juniors at her level. ``At first it was hard for me to tell
people I had lupus; it was hard for me to accept it, too. But now I
just want to show other kids that even if they're sick, they can
still follow their dreams. That's why I'm here.''

ANSWER LIVELY TAKES JUVENILE BY A HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be updated after the Classic) 
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The 15th Breeders' Cup got off to a rousing
start Saturday when Answer Lively won the $1 million Juvenile by a
head over the 76-1 long shot Aly's Alley, and cast a lengthening
shadow toward next year's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively became the first winner on a day loaded with seven
Breeders' Cup races with purses of $13.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   He won it under a skillful ride by Jerry Bailey, who was riding
the colt for the first time but was riding a Breeders' Cup winner
for the seventh time. And he did it before a throng of 70,000
spectators at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The Juvenile served as the opening act to racing's richest and
grandest day of the year with its show-stopper finale, the $5.2
million Classic with 11 of the world's finest horses led by Skip
Away and Silver Charm, meeting for the first time but contending
with an all-star field of nine rivals in the richest race in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Silverbulletday won the Juvenile Fillies with
Excellent Meeting finishing second and Three Ring finishing third;
Reraise won the Sprint, with Grand Slam finishing second and Kona
Gold taking third, and Da Hoss won the Mile, with Hawksley Hill
second and Labeeb third.
</P>
<P>
   The program may not have included a race with the traditions and
history of the 124-year-old Kentucky Derby, and the crowd was only
half the size of the multitudes that flock to Churchill Downs in
May for the Derby. But the Breeders' Cup featured 85 of the finest
horses from three continents, and the Juvenile kicked off a day of
unquestioned riches but unknown fates.
</P>
<P>
   The unknown fate involved the winning colt and his chances of
going on to stardom next year at 3. Since the Breeders' Cup was
established 15 years ago, no colt who won the Juvenile returned the
next year to win the Kentucky Derby. In fact, no colt has won the
2-year-old championship and come back to win the Derby since
Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively, a son of Lively One, is owned by John Franks, an
oil man from Louisiana, and he was not exactly a secret with the
bettors. He had won three of his six starts before he went to the
post as the favorite, and he responded with a well-rated effort
under Bailey's guidance that not only won but also outran the small
herd of five colts entered by D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, he had a head on the long shot Aly's Alley, who
was closing fast on the inside, and Aly's Alley had three-quarters
of a length on Cat Thief, the only one of the Lukas army to run in
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Franks was asked if he was happy that he hadn't changed his mind
about selling Answer Lively to any of the many people offering
substantial money for the horse, and he replied dryly: ``I didn't
change my mind, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was asked how he felt being shut out, and he replied: ``I
was hoping to get a better finish. But the race set up for a closer
to win. The horses there at the end were the ones that figured to
be there, including Aly's Alley. He's run well all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively won two races in Louisiana this fall before
running second to Cat Thief in the Breeder's Futurity at nearby
Keeneland just three weeks ago. And he ran a strategic race
Saturday, stalking the lead before making his move in the
homestretch. And he had enough gas left to hold off the late rush
by Aly's Alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trick was to see how he would rate behind horses,
and he did that real nice'' Bailey said. ``Near the finish, I knew
somebody was coming up on the inside, but I also felt the inside
wasn't the best place to run. That's why I chose an outside lane
for the finish, and my colt responded beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Prado, the jockey on Aly's Alley, held up his fingers
about three inches apart and said: ``I got beat this far. I tell
you, we were in front two jumps after the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Answer Lively outran and even buried some highly
regarded 2-year-old colts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes It's True, the leader of the Lukas band, held the lead for
three-quarters of a mile but gave way and finished 11th in a field
of 13. Scotty Schulhofer's Lemon Drop Kid, second in the Champagne
Stakes at Belmont Park last month, moved up gradually from eighth
place but could not pass the four top finishers.
</P>
<P>
   The Groom Is Red, owned by Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino and
trained by Nick Zito, got pinched coming out of the gate and ran
last almost to the homestretch, rallied but finished sixth. The
other Lukas horses finished eighth, ninth and 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Two colts acted up and one was even scratched at the gate as the
suspense built. Prime Directive balked and flailed when entering
the gate, prompting Jorge Chavez to dismount and leading the
trackside veterinarian to scratch the horse. Then Red Sea, a star
in Britain, broke through the gate, prompting Kent Desormeaux to
jump off. They got back in the gate and ran the race, but finished
12th.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively ran the mile and one-sixteenth on a fast track in
1:44, paid $7.40 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $520,000
and hopes of beating the curse of the Juvenile winners.

 &HT;    Renewed interest in space travel credited to Glenn flight
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ Has John Glenn's headline-grabbing
return to space fired up public enthusiasm over the space program?
</P>
<P>
   NASA sure hopes so. Its biggest project since the moon landing,
the International Space Station, is finally about to get off the
ground. A Russian rocket is scheduled to launch the first element
of the station on Nov. 20. Space shuttle Endeavor is already on the
launch pad with the second element, scheduled for launch on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, it will be an orbiting behemoth the size of a
football field with living space for seven astronauts. NASA hopes
to finish it in the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I think STS-95 (Glenn's flight) has regenerated
interest in space flight and space exploration,'' Endeavor
commander Bob Cabana said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn made history in 1962 when he became the first American to
orbit the earth. His second flight after 36 years caused one of the
biggest news media turnouts in the history of space flight, in
sharp contrast to the lack of media interest in most shuttle
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the space race, which created one daring adventure after
another until men landed on the moon, the 67 successful space
shuttle missions since the Challenger accident in 1986 have had a
monotonous sameness that dulled public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the space station has generated interest mainly by
its cost and its countless delays. The original plan announced by
President Reagan in 1984 was to cost $8 billion and be finished by
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, the first pieces are just now on the
launch pads and the pricetag is estimated at anywhere from $21
billion to $96 billion based on costs over the station's lifetime,
according to a congressional estimate. And NASA's schedule is still
in doubt because a key piece, a Russia-supplied service module
needed to keep the station in orbit, has been delayed for lack of
funding because of Russia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even Glenn expressed disappointment in the station's progress
during a news conference from space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped the space station would come along a little bit
faster than it has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has touted the space station as the most complex
construction program in history and the biggest international space
project ever, with 443 tons of hardware being built by 16 nations.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't the first space station ever. Russia has had a
series of space stations over the years, culminating in the
still-occupied Mir. America cobbled Skylab together in 1973 from
Apollo hardware left over after President Nixon canceled the last
scheduled moon flights. It fell out of orbit in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Science journalist Andrew Chaikin, author of A Man on the Moon ,
worries that Americans' attention spans are too short to stay
interested in a long-term project like the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have an enormous problem in this country with the
fact that it's harder to get people's attention for more than 10
minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the orbital construction work will provide plenty of
high-wire drama, predicts John Pike, a space analyst with the
Washington, D.C.-based Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly going to be a lot more interesting than the
shuttle program, where they went up, tormented insects and came
back down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Endeavor's mission next month will require three
spacewalks to get the first two elements hooked up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Like the moon program, space station construction will keep the
public interested because it has a storyline, Pike predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) is going to take you back to the '60s where there is a
beginning, a middle and an end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the space program really has been to extend our
reach to new worlds,'' said rocket scientist Robert Zubrin, founder
and president of the Colorado-based Mars Society. ``The challenge
that's been staring NASA in the face since 1973 (the year following
the last moon flight) has been Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin is the chief advocate for a grassroots movement to get
the U.S. to commit to a manned Mars program. He organized the Mars
Society at an August founding conference that drew 700 people. He
said the organization now has 50 chapters across the U.S. and 20 in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin believes the technology exists to put humans on Mars in
10 years. What's lacking, he said, is the political will to do it.
President Bush set a 30-year goal of sending an expedition to Mars
but never pushed the idea. President Clinton has set no such goal.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin thinks Glenn's flight might help focus public attention
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had massive value as a stimulus for reflection'' on
America's space accomplishments in the 1960s, he said. ``We had a
space program to storm heaven. We developed hydrogen-fueled engines
and nuclear space power, interplanetary navigation and data relays
. . . the entire bag of tricks NASA uses today.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's flight, he said, ``is putting to us the question of
whether we should continue.

COMMENTARY: PLEASURES OF A REAL-LIFE PLEASANTVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. _ Ever since they flocked to a preview of
the movie that has the same name as their hometown, Pleasantville's
citizens have been self-consciously comparing notes on what about
their village is the same as the movie's darkly comic locale and
what is different.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, life in the cinematic Pleasantville is as pretty and
trouble-free as it was in ``Father Knows Best.'' Dad returns from
work shouting, ``Honey, I'm home!'' and inevitably sniffs a
meatloaf baked by his prim, stay-at-home wife. The high school
basketball players never miss a shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is an urban cynic's vision and clearly means to
expose the sinister underside of idyllic places like the real
Pleasantville. The two modern-day teen-agers thrust into the
movie's black-and-white 1950s sitcom soon uncover the sexual and
artistic longings that have been dampened to keep life tidy.
</P>
<P>
   When they challenge the prevailing order, they unleash the
fascism lurking in the village's soul, setting off book burnings
reminiscent of the Nazis'.
</P>
<P>
   The real Pleasantville's residents are tickled by the attention
the movie is bringing them, but they say life here is not all black
and white and bland, nor is it festering with unspoken tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the soccer game the other day, a lot of women said they
couldn't remember the last time they made a stack of pancakes for
their kids like the mom does in the movie,'' said Carol Greenman,
owner of the village's bookshop, which features a window display
about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantville women these days make the 50-minute commute to New
York, where their jobs give them a regular dose of big-city rough
and tumble. Rather than burning books, Pleasantville High School
requires students to read ``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   This village of 6,500 prides itself on its Quaker-nourished
tolerance. It has two group homes for troubled children. The Jewish
population here has grown large enough to open a synagogue. Only
126 blacks were counted in the 1990 census, but people blame the
homogeneity on the high cost of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Nonna said that if Pleasantville ever had a
Panglossian mind-set, it was eroded by Vietnam, Watergate and the
Internet. ``It's nice to have a perfect village, but as the movie
points out, you can't be too perfect,'' he said. ``You've got to
change and be open to new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   What may make Pleasantvillians uncomfortable is that the
wholesomeness satirized in the movie is quite true of this
close-knit village. Most children walk to school, allowing families
to cross paths and get to know one another. When high school
students mount their annual musical, 100 parents pitch in to hammer
sets and sew costumes. When students graduate, the whole town shows
up, dogs included.
</P>
<P>
   That neighborliness has a price, said Iliana Korin, a
Brazil-bred psychologist, who cherishes her 18 years here. ``You
can't be so open and allow much of the outside influences in,'' she
said. ``You lose some diversity and intellectual stimulation.'' And
Donald Antonecchia, the schools superintendent, said that such
close ties mean that ``if a student is suspended, there's a good
chance everyone knows about it at every dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   He was thankful for the town's geniality when his nephew,
Richard Modica, a Princeton sophomore who had starred in high
school musicals, was killed by a drunken driver in Florida, and
residents gathered round to console his family.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, someone destroyed the downtown Hanukkah menorah
and deposited it on the lawn of a Jewish village trustee. So as a
point of civic principle, villagers arranged to get another
menorah, and 200 people, Christians and Jews, turned out to see the
eighth night's lighting.
</P>
<P>
   It's supposed to be sophisticated to see all this as saccharine
_ as ``Leave it to Beaver.'' But many Pleasantville youngsters who
thirst to escape find that when they grow up, they want to return
to places like Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small, tight-knit community really grounds you,'' said
Meaghan Harrigan, a 17-year-old senior. ``It's nice to know when
I'll be coming back from college I'll see everybody and they'll
know it's me.''

 &HT;    The real issues in the Microsoft case
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imagine if you owned a telephone that you could use
only to make and receive calls to and from your boss, your doctor
and the members of your immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Such a phone might be of some value to you. But the real value
of telephones is that they can reach billions of people throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the realm of personal computers, an operating
system gains immeasurable value to users if it's able to handle all
manner of useful applications _ ones that help us write letters,
balance our checkbooks or surf the Internet _ and have them all
work in harmony with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the core realities behind the landmark antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp., due to enter its fourth week on Monday in
Courtroom Two of the federal courthouse here before U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that courtroom, most economists who have studied the case
concur that Microsoft is a monopolist. In fact, recent industry
studies show that of every 100 personal computers being shipped
today, 97 will contain one flavor or another of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson must wrestle with the issue of whether Microsoft has
illegally leveraged that monopoly to fence off for itself still
other software markets, such as access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the small courtroom, Microsoft's lawyers dispute the monopoly
tag, citing fringe operating systems such as Linux or Apple
Computer Inc.'s Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting a second line of defense, they argue that in the
rough-and-tumble high-tech world, even today's monopoly power may
wind up as tomorrow's has-been firm.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of this, they cite IBM Corp., which fought the
Justice Department to a draw more than a decade after being accused
of monopolizing mainframe computers. By the time the government
finally dropped the case, the mainframe business had become static
as sales of personal computers took off.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also raised an ``everybody-does-it'' line of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, from Microsoft's perspective, Netscape
Communications Corp. basked in a monopoly on Internet browsers
until Microsoft began giving its Internet Explorer away.
</P>
<P>
   In a like vein, the software giant from Redmond, Wash., argues
that Apple would control the software market for video and sound
content through its QuickTime technology had it not been challenged
by Microsoft's media player and by RealNetworks(cq) Inc., in which
Microsoft has purchased a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft contends it has fused Internet Explorer
directly into Windows 98 because that's what its customers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends in court that it should be free to blend
any and all applications directly into Windows. That position
appears to trouble the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But, in practice, there is little that Jackson _ or, for that
matter, even the U.S. Supreme Court _ can do about it, since the
code has been so tightly woven into the latest versions of Windows
that the product would stop working properly if it were to be
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not at all clear what remedies the government would
seek, and the courts would agree to impose, if Microsoft is found
guilty as charged of having broken the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Department of Justice nor the 20 states that have
joined in bringing the case have sought financial reparations from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint does seek to recover ``costs'' from Microsoft _
such as the sums spent to prepare dozens of videotaped depositions.
Likewise, the state attorneys general, according to their
complaint, have asked Jackson to award them ``their costs of suit,
including reasonable attorneys' fees.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to Microsoft, such costs and fees are pocket change
compared to what is at stake should it lose the case. Presumably,
Microsoft would be vulnerable to civil suits filed by injured
rivals who could use a guilty verdict to pursue damage awards
potentially worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Monday's witness in the slow-moving trial _ original estimates
of a six- to eight-week trial now range up to Valentine's Day _
will again be Apple Senior Vice President Avadis Tevanian Jr. After
that, prosecutors may show more videotaped testimony from Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategists believe their fortunes in Courtroom Two
will improve when its expert witnesses take the witness stand and,
in a reversal of roles, face a grilling from the federal and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these witnesses is Richard Schmalensee, acting dean
of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law, who
has sat at the head of the defense table for the entire course of
the trial, says Schmalensee ``will refute the government's case and
prove that our inclusion of Internet technologies in Windows was
designed to provide new tools and innovations for consumers and
software developers.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the trustbusters intend to double-dip into
expert pool before resting their case by calling economists
Franklin Fisher and Frederick Warren-Boulton.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who is also now at MIT, played a key role in the
drawn-out IBM litigation. Warren-Boulton, a former chief economist
for the Justice Department, now heads a Washington consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-page court filing submitted to Jackson in May, Fisher
held that Windows produces ``network effects,'' just like the phone
system or the public airwaves. Under this theory, the more people
decide to use a system, the more imperative it for other people to
use it too.
</P>
<P>
   If such ``network effects'' are found to really work, the courts
might decide that Windows is a public utility and that Microsoft
should be guaranteed a regulated fair rate of return to maintain
and improve the system. Conversely, the courts could decide that
Microsoft is an aggressive competitor who should be left free to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   All that is sure at this early point in the historic trial is
that the issue remains in doubt.

 &HT;    School bullies: Risky as weapons?
 &HT;    WITH BULLYSIDE, HITBACK
 &HT;    By Diane Loupe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There have been bullies at least as long as there have
been schools. But as the problem turns increasingly violent, as it
did last week in Cherokee County many educators are beginning to
treat bullies as hazards that are just as dangerous as drugs and
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Posters on the walls of some Georgia schools ask students, ``How
do you handle conflict?'' and urges them to ``See the problem
through the other child's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Students watch a video called ``Broken Toy'' describing a
fictional boy's suicide after being bullied. Counselors, students
and parents take classes on coping with bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally and in metro Atlanta, schools are doing more than
ever to fight bullying and are launching formal prevention programs
after a string of shootings and deaths. Last week's beating death
of a 13-year-old Cherokee County student by a 15-year-old who was
described by some students and parents as a bully will only
increase the attention, educators say.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha School is testing a program called Power Steering that
trains young people to put themselves in an opponent's shoes before
getting into a confrontation. It is based on strategies taught to
corporate managers to handle employee conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Other suburban Georgia educators have a prevention program in
elementary schools to help students manage anger, solve problems
and communicate better with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take those things seriously and protect
children,'' said Karen Weaver, chairwoman of the Fulton County
school board and sponsor of a 1997 policy that prohibits verbal or
physical harassment of any kind. She called bullying ``the most
underreported student infraction.''
</P>
<P>
   It also can be one of the most devastating. Mass murderer
Jeffrey Dahmer was bullied. So was Luke Woodham, who killed two
students and wounded seven others last fall in Pearl, Miss.
Mitchell Johnson, who killed four girls in Jonesboro, Ark., in
March, was angry after being teased about his weight.
</P>
<P>
   A DeKalb County English teacher was shot to death in 1996 by a
student who parents say was a bully.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Cherokee case, which left 13-year-old Josh Belluardo
dead in Cherokee County and 15-year-old Jonathan Miller charged
with murder as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Brian Head, an overweight student in Cherokee
County's Etowah High School, pulled a semiautomatic pistol from his
book bag just before economics class, waved the gun around the
room, then put it to his temple and pulled the trigger. Just before
Brian killed himself, another student had been pulling his hair and
slapping him in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   After Head's death, Cherokee adopted a school policy that
prohibits taunting, bullying and harassment in all forms. Bill
Head, Brian's father, who is suing the Cherokee County school
system, says the public has focused on bullying as a conflict, when
it's really abuse of a helpless child.''
</P>
<P>
   Head plans to lobby for a law that would require teachers to
report the crimes of simple assault, assault and battery,
aggravated battery, terroristic threats and
</P>
<P>
   stalking just as they are now required to report their
suspicions of child abuse by parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's abuse, defined in Georgia state law as assault and
battery,'' Head said. ``And even when they have it in their policy,
when schools and teachers fail to show students that they will
follow through, students have learned by the school's reaction that
they are not protected, and they never tell. That's why Josh died.
That's why Brian died.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullied children typically are different in some way, such as
their weight, ethnicity or clothing, said Diane Jackson-Chapman, a
longtime DeKalb school counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The victims are so convinced they're somehow to blame for their
plight that they don't tell an adult about their problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis, principal of DeKalb's Shamrock Middle School, called
in Jackson-Chapman last school year after parents demanded action
to stop bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson-Chapman put together workshops for both teachers and
parents.
</P>
<P>
   At the first workshop, she defined bullying and asked teachers
to track for a week the times they noticed behaviors on a checklist
that included such things as taunting, teasing, intimidating and
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was eye-opening, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The list got longer and longer, and by the third day, (it) was
out of the room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock teachers were trained in low-key intervention
strategies, from talking to students in the hall to referring
potential bullies to the principal. Students also took conflict
resolution classes and learned about listening to one another,
reading body language and having empathy for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been dramatic, Davis said. Discipline has
improved, and students are being sent to the office far less often.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Brown, an Ohioan who was tormented by bullies as a child
and later founded an anti-bullying program, says schools aren't
doing enough to stop the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear older students literally brag about giving a 'swirly'
to a middle school kid,'' said Brown, describing the violent taunt
in which a child's head is plunged into a toilet, which is then
flushed. ''They don't care. There's no risk to admit they are a
bully. It's much more of a stigma to admit they have been
bullied.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown added: ''I remember one father telling me he'd 'rather my
kid be a bully than be a damn bully victim.' It was a very
far-reaching statement, coming from a love for a son.''
</P>
<P>
   John Monferdini, a counselor at DeKalb Alternative School for
students with disciplinary problems, where teacher Horace Morgan
was shot to death by a student two years ago, says student disputes
are not like they were 30 years ago, when he was in school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our fights and the next day it was OK,'' Monferdini
said. ''Today, it's not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative school student Kris Brim, 15, recalls being harassed
by students in an Atlanta public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to do stupid stuff _ treat me like a girl,
make me do stupid stuff, saying, 'Go get me this,' like I was your
slave,'' he said. ``I wasn't doing what they said. I didn't run. I
got in a fight. He swung at me and kicked me. I ducked, and so I
picked him up and stomped him. I ain't fixing to let him stomp
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing efforts by educators to combat bullying, few
think their policies and programs can halt a problem that has its
roots in an increasingly violent society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as parents are not holding our children as accountable as
we were held accountable,'' said Cherokee County school board
member Carol Benton, whose daughter was the target of bullies at
high school. ``If I got in a conflict with another student, what
the school did to me was nothing compared to the trouble I was
going to be in at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock Principal Davis also looks beyond the schoolhouse, and
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the easy access of guns, look on the highways, the
road rage there,'' Davis said. ``There's a general disrespect for
mankind. Where's the humanity out there?''

 &HT;    Parenting factors part of aggression, experts say
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Schoolyard bullies are just mean kids _ troubled,
misguided, too tough for their own good, right?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's more to their teasing, taunting and violent
behavior, say child psychologists who've spent years analyzing
aggression in young students.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, for example, are part of the picture in many ways, both
at school and at home, said Arthur Horne of the University of
Georgia's education department, where he heads ACT EARLY, a program
that teaches teachers how to deal with aggressive kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question is always, `Why do the bullies get away
with it? Who's not minding the store?''' Horne said. ``Often the
adults think these bullying kids are not as bad as the other kids
complaining about them. So the kids take it into their own hands,
things escalate and get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, bantering or bullying seldom goes from throwing paper
wads on the back of the bus to fatal beatings, Horne said. ``My
staff was talking about the (Cherokee County) situation this
morning, and just how very rare it is to see it escalate to that
point. It looks like it just exceeded everyone's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jonathan Miller, the 15-year-old charged with murder in
the death of E.T. Booth Middle School eighth-grader Josh Belluardo,
has been characterized as a bully by some students and parents, his
attorney, Michael B. Syrop, has said the description is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the bully and the target of his taunts are loners, said
Jan Hughes, an educational psychologist at Texas A&AMP;M University who
has treated aggressive kids for 20 years. ``They do tend to select
vulnerable kids who aren't part of any peer network. Bullies also
have a poor ability to empathize with anyone, and they tend to be
callous.''
</P>
<P>
   Other traits of bullies: viewing the world as unfriendly, an
inflated sense of self, a sense they are owed special entitlements,
and believing they can get away with hurtful behavior because they
always do.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is usually the case with kids, the influence of parents
and home environment also must be considered for bullies, said
Hughes, who's researching how to prevent serious aggression in
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenting factors are a primary cause of adolescent
aggression,'' Hughes said. ``Bullies are more likely to experience
parenting that is harsh or inconsistent. Or maybe the parents do
not see their child's actions as bullying. Maybe the parents see it
as their child being assertive and standing up for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Horne and Hughes suggested better adult monitoring, especially
on school buses where many fights and feuds occur, or
aggression-prevention training for bus drivers. They also warned
that any schoolkids exhibiting bullying behavior aren't ``just
going through a phase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you scratch the surface a little, any child who is a bully
is unhappy and they are headed toward an unhappy adulthood,''
Hughes said. ``Any persistent use of aggression before the age of
12 is not going to just go away on its own.''

 &HT;    Kids trying to fight back may make matters worse
 &HT;    By Diane Loupe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The only way to stop a bully is to fight back, many
parents used to tell their children.
</P>
<P>
   Some still feel that way, choosing to arm their children with
karate or boxing lessons to prevent them from schoolyard predators.
</P>
<P>
   But many bullying experts say that advice is dangerous in a time
when the tormentors may have guns or knives, or be strong enough to
deliver a lethal blow, as happened in Cherokee County last week
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Mullin-Rindler, associate director of the Project on
Teasing and Bullying in Elementary Schools at the Wellesley College
Center for Research on Women, says telling children to defend
themselves against bullies will only make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who are bullied are not kids who are likely to fight
back,'' she said. ``Fighting back tends to escalate the treatment.
The bully retaliates and becomes more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brandis, an Atlanta psychologist who works with schools on
anti-bullying programs, also thinks it unwise to place the burden
on the victim of bullying.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they strike the first blow, would I say turn the other
cheek like Jesus, no,'' said Brandis. ``It has to be a last resort.
You can't just let people beat you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullied children tend to have low self esteem, feel powerless
and ashamed of being bullied, Brandis said.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, is programs that teach children empathy
and problem solving -skills and schools that won't tolerate any
form of bullying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get it. This is not about the bully,'' he said.
``It's about the environment in which bullying is tolerated and it
is not part of the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brian Head, a student at Etowah High School in Cherokee
County, told his dad, Bill Head, he was being bullied, Head said he
gave his son the traditional advice: inform a teacher or
administrator about who was abusing you. But teachers started
throwing it back at Brian, urging him to solve his own problems,
the father said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Head shot himself to death at the school in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped telling anyone,'' said Head. ``And see what
happened? It sent a message to all the other students.''

 &HT;    The real issues in the Microsoft case
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imagine if you owned a telephone that you could use
only to make and receive calls to and from your boss, your doctor
and the members of your immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Such a phone might be of some value to you. But the real value
of telephones is that they can reach billions of people throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the realm of personal computers, an operating
system gains immeasurable value to users if it's able to handle all
manner of useful applications _ ones that help us write letters,
balance our checkbooks or surf the Internet _ and have them all
work in harmony with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the core realities behind the landmark antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp., due to enter its fourth week on Monday in
Courtroom Two of the federal courthouse here before U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that courtroom, most economists who have studied the case
concur that Microsoft is a monopolist. In fact, recent industry
studies show that of every 100 personal computers being shipped
today, 97 will contain one flavor or another of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson must wrestle with the issue of whether Microsoft has
illegally leveraged that monopoly to fence off for itself still
other software markets, such as access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the small courtroom, Microsoft's lawyers dispute the monopoly
tag, citing fringe operating systems such as Linux or Apple
Computer Inc.'s Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting a second line of defense, they argue that in the
rough-and-tumble high-tech world, even today's monopoly power may
wind up as tomorrow's has-been firm.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of this, they cite IBM Corp., which fought the
Justice Department to a draw more than a decade after being accused
of monopolizing mainframe computers. By the time the government
finally dropped the case, the mainframe business had become static
as sales of personal computers took off.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also raised an ``everybody-does-it'' line of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, from Microsoft's perspective, Netscape
Communications Corp. basked in a monopoly on Internet browsers
until Microsoft began giving its Internet Explorer away.
</P>
<P>
   In a like vein, the software giant from Redmond, Wash., argues
that Apple would control the software market for video and sound
content through its QuickTime technology had it not been challenged
by Microsoft's media player and by RealNetworks(cq) Inc., in which
Microsoft has purchased a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft contends it has fused Internet Explorer
directly into Windows 98 because that's what its customers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends in court that it should be free to blend
any and all applications directly into Windows. That position
appears to trouble the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But, in practice, there is little that Jackson _ or, for that
matter, even the U.S. Supreme Court _ can do about it, since the
code has been so tightly woven into the latest versions of Windows
that the product would stop working properly if it were to be
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not at all clear what remedies the government would
seek, and the courts would agree to impose, if Microsoft is found
guilty as charged of having broken the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Department of Justice nor the 20 states that have
joined in bringing the case have sought financial reparations from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint does seek to recover ``costs'' from Microsoft _
such as the sums spent to prepare dozens of videotaped depositions.
Likewise, the state attorneys general, according to their
complaint, have asked Jackson to award them ``their costs of suit,
including reasonable attorneys' fees.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to Microsoft, such costs and fees are pocket change
compared to what is at stake should it lose the case. Presumably,
Microsoft would be vulnerable to civil suits filed by injured
rivals who could use a guilty verdict to pursue damage awards
potentially worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Monday's witness in the slow-moving trial _ original estimates
of a six- to eight-week trial now range up to Valentine's Day _
will again be Apple Senior Vice President Avadis Tevanian Jr. After
that, prosecutors may show more videotaped testimony from Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategists believe their fortunes in Courtroom Two
will improve when its expert witnesses take the witness stand and,
in a reversal of roles, face a grilling from the federal and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these witnesses is Richard Schmalensee, acting dean
of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law, who
has sat at the head of the defense table for the entire course of
the trial, says Schmalensee ``will refute the government's case and
prove that our inclusion of Internet technologies in Windows was
designed to provide new tools and innovations for consumers and
software developers.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the trustbusters intend to double-dip into
expert pool before resting their case by calling economists
Franklin Fisher and Frederick Warren-Boulton.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who is also now at MIT, played a key role in the
drawn-out IBM litigation. Warren-Boulton, a former chief economist
for the Justice Department, now heads a Washington consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-page court filing submitted to Jackson in May, Fisher
held that Windows produces ``network effects,'' just like the phone
system or the public airwaves. Under this theory, the more people
decide to use a system, the more imperative it for other people to
use it too.
</P>
<P>
   If such ``network effects'' are found to really work, the courts
might decide that Windows is a public utility and that Microsoft
should be guaranteed a regulated fair rate of return to maintain
and improve the system. Conversely, the courts could decide that
Microsoft is an aggressive competitor who should be left free to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   All that is sure at this early point in the historic trial is
that the issue remains in doubt.

MARINERS LOOK FEEBLE BEHIND SHOPPING CART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Trying to picture the Mariner baseball executives at
the general managers meetings in Florida, I can't get this singular
image out of my head.
</P>
<P>
   I see an eccentric bag lady, wearing two scarves and three
coats, shuffling through used-clothing bins at a thrift shop. Time
passes, and I see a story in the paper that Thusnelda Frapperty,
age 86, died and left a $50 million estate to her cats.
</P>
<P>
   The image is a little exaggerated. Bag ladies don't need coats
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, at least 20 major league clubs would enjoy operating
with the Mariners' alleged 1999 player payroll of about $53
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners don't act the part of landed gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new stadium, a large, proven fan base, perhaps the
game's two best players, and an ownership group whose collective
worth outstrips nearly all of their contemporaries, the baseball
brass enters the commencement of free agency and the trading period
with a can't-do list.
</P>
<P>
   Can't do Kevin Brown. Can't do Bernie Williams. Can't do Mo
Vaughn. Could have done Randy Johnson, but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Probably can't do Todd Stottlemyre. Probably can't even do Tim
Belcher, even though they did him once, back when he was a
34-year-old kid, and made the American League Championship Series
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, on what purports to be a can-do list, is something
that rightfully should be on the can't-do list: either trading
David Segui or moving the first baseman to left field.
</P>
<P>
   I could be wrong, but my recollection was that Segui joined Ken
Griffey Jr. and Dan Wilson last year as Mariners who regarded a
ball batted or thrown toward them as less than a life-threatening
event.
</P>
<P>
   But one plan under consideration this offseason is to move Segui
from first, where he saved the Mariner infield from being the most
error-prone aggregation since the bridge crew of the Titanic, to
the outfield, where he has rarely played.
</P>
<P>
   The move is to allow first to be played by Jay Buhner, whose
offseason arm surgery permits him to hit but not resume his normal
right-field spot until deep into the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   While Buhner is a good glove man, his adjustment to the infield
as a 34-year-old with creaky knees will be just slightly faster
than global warming. Meantime, Segui will be added to the Griffey
collection of clueless left field partners, whose number NASA
scientists expect to agree upon when research concludes early next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than improving the team, this Mariner plan sets out to
weaken 25 percent of the regular field positions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the diaphragm of the Mariner fan spasms completely from
the brilliance of this move, there is an alternative _ trading
Segui for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they might get one or more prospects for Segui is beside
the point. In the last few seasons, most of these types of trades
by Woody Woodward, M's vice president of baseball operations, have
worked into liabilities, if not disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are that Segui set career highs in numerous offensive
categories and was an exceptional fielder (one error in 1,162
chances) until his August knee injury. Presuming a return to good
health, he is one of the best free-agent signings in club history
and only slightly less a contributor than Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   A trade makes him the Seattle professional heir to Omar Vizquel
and Tino Martinez _ somebody else's All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rumors suggest the Mariners are thinking about trading him
for multiple lesser players from Pittsburgh. The Mariners can't get
his equivalent from the Pirates because they don't have it, so
again Seattle is contemplating giving up great for maybe good.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the reasons this time aren't primarily money or age,
because Segui, 32, makes a relatively reasonable $2.5 million. His
departure would be mostly to resolve a situation with an older,
injured favorite, Buhner, whose deal is up after '99 (the club
holds an option for 2000). Even for a club with a grand tradition
of shortsightedness, trading Segui for multiple ordinary players
would require an electron microscope to detect virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The more the Mariners trade for younger players, the more they
squander the present (see 1998) and the less the atmosphere appeals
to Griffey and Rodriguez, both of whom have declared plainly their
desire to play for a winning team before re-upping.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners head down to Florida having nearly talked
themselves out of the market for significant free agents, the only
alternative for improvement is trades. But unlike the Yankees,
Dodgers, Braves and a few others, the Mariners simply don't have
the veteran quality depth that allows for successful swaps of prime
major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fat, just meat, such as Segui.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining alternative is another trip to the discard table
of Tony Fossas, Pat Listach and Rick Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Items to fill the bag lady's cart. And secure the cats' futures.

DREAMWORKS FACES FIGHT OVER NAME FROM TINY PRODUCTION COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
NEW VERSION WITH FIXES THROUGHOUT  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- DreamWorks: A billion-dollar studio owned by
three entertainment giants who produce Oscar-caliber films such as
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamwerks: A low-budget company run by a Florida couple who
create conventions and dinner-theater productions starring obscure
``Star Trek'' actors.
</P>
<P>
   If the smaller company has its way in a coming trademark
infringement trial, Hollywood's first new studio since the 1930s
may end up with a court order forcing it to choose a new name.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamwerks, which claims its name was registered years before
DreamWorks SKG was formed, is seeking $25 million in damages and a
ruling that says the company owned by Steven Spielberg, David
Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg must hand over its stationery and
letterhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My client) has been doing this for 12 years. It's been a
passion and love of his,'' said Dreamwerks lawyer Surjit Soni.
``The fact that you don't succeed doesn't allow someone else to
come in and steal your name.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dreamwerks is no DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   While the latter produces the world's hottest movies, TV shows
and music acts, the former produces entertainment like ``The Boys
in Autumn'' -- a play starring Walter Koenig (Chekov from ``Star
Trek'') and Mark Lenard (Spock's father), which premiered at the
Sheraton Hotel near Chicago O'Hare Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamwerks case, filed in 1995, was thrown out a year later
by a Los Angeles judge, who ruled that the companies were far too
different in size and scope to be mistaken for each other.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, a panel of appeals court judges disagreed,
returning with a ruling that resurrected the case, and at times
criticizing the larger company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dispute could have been avoided had DreamWorks been more
careful, or a tad more creative, in choosing its name,'' U.S.
Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski wrote.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks lawyers were aware of Dreamwerks before the studio
settled on a name, but apparently disregarded the smaller company
as too obscure, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition taken two years ago, Katzenberg said, ``I
convinced reporters to hold their stories'' about DreamWorks
because he feared a gold-digger would find out and register the
name first, taking it hostage for a big payoff.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the producer's plan had been thwarted years earlier
-- Dreamwerks was granted the trademark in October 1992, after
being in business since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamwerks President Jonathan Harris said he found out about the
new studio's name Jan. 13, 1995 -- the day Katzenberg, Spielberg
and Geffen took out full-page ads in Daily Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter to announce the moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I was shocked and upset would be a great
understatement,'' Harris said in a court declaration.
</P>
<P>
   A DreamWorks spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In court records, DreamWorks lawyers have compared Harris'
lawsuit to ``a shot at the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their claim that there is no likelihood of confusion
between the two companies, they took a nationwide poll of ``Star
Trek'' aficionados, finding only 1 percent of the 596 surveyed had
heard of the smaller company.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks claims in court records that the smaller company is a
money-losing operation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Byrne agreed with DreamWorks when he
threw the case out. But the appeals panel had a different take,
filling its ruling with homages to the late-'60s TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreamwerks targets Trekkies; DreamWorks targets everyone. But
the relatedness of each company's prime directive isn't relevant,''
Kozinski wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the judge said, the court must decide whether the public
is likely to mistake the convention company for the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Soni answered Kozinski's question with a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said Harris and his wife have had ``more and more
trouble'' getting celebrities involved in their conventions because
of the name confusion, which now also centers on the TV shows
``Hercules'' and ``Xena, Warrior Princess.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers just assume DreamWorks got the name first,
and fear legal retribution from the larger company, Soni said.
</P>
<P>
   Trial in the matter was scheduled for January, but Soni said the
proceeding has been postponed until later in the year. Before then,
DreamWorks will take another shot at getting the lawsuit thrown out
of court.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to trial, Dreamwerks will ask for a court
ruling that literally orders DreamWorks to give up its name, along
with every scrap of paper containing the company logo.
</P>
<P>
   But if it comes to that, Soni said his clients would rather sell
their name for a fair price, not force the larger company to pick a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is for sale,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of
price.''

 WALL STREET PLAYS RELOCATION CARD, AND CITY PAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even as city and state officials were clinching a
deal last week to keep one financial market in Manhattan, the New
York Stock Exchange increased the pressure for its own generous
deal by talking to developers about building a new trading floor in
Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The routine threat to cross the Hudson River drew the routine
reaction: Officials in New York put a $600 million incentive
package on the bargaining table, a sum that would cover more than
half the cost of building and outfitting a new headquarters for the
New York Stock Exchange directly across from its historic home on
Wall Street, according to negotiators on both sides of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidies would also be triple those granted to the Nasdaq
and American Stock Exchanges in a tentative deal struck last week
for a new joint headquarters, possibly near Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting with New Jersey has become an enduring ritual for many
of the city's largest and most profitable corporations, from Avon
Products and Conde Nast Publications to General Motors Corp. and
NBC. No industry has used the tactic more than the commercial
banks, investment banks and insurance companies that make up New
York's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   And whether the companies truly intend to leave, it has worked.
City and state officials over the last 15 years have granted more
than $2 billion in tax breaks, cash and low-cost electricity to
companies that threatened to move to New Jersey, Connecticut and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of New York has become the softest mark in the
country for companies looking to extract corporate welfare from
government,'' said state Sen. Franz Leichter, a frequent critic of
the deals. ``We're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the
financial industry, which is _ while important to New York _
downsizing. Couldn't this money be better spent on transportation,
schools and other economic development initiatives?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, Leichter's view is shared by developers
like Leonard Stern, chief executive of Hartz Group, which owns the
Colgate Center office complex in Jersey City. Some companies will
move to less expensive space outside New York, he said, but most
have no intention of doing so, even though they ``routinely inquire
about how to shake down the city.'' Despite the millions of dollars
in subsidies provided by New Jersey or New York, he said, there is
no net gain for the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is paying an unnecessary price in allowing itself to
be shaken down by one tenant or another,'' Stern said. ``Too many
politicians know the price of everything, but not the value of New
York City. I don't know how Giuliani allows this rape of taxpayer
dollars to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern acknowledged that his company was still talking to the New
York Stock Exchange about a move to his Colgate complex. He said
the exchange has ``assured us'' that New Jersey was not being used
merely to extract larger concessions from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey secretary of commerce, Gualberto Medina, said on
Friday that his state was still in the running, but two other
developers in New Jersey who are negotiating with the exchange said
they did not believe there would ever be a New Jersey Stock
Exchange. ``They're going to stay in Manhattan,'' said one

   City and state officials in New York contend that they have to
take the relocation threats seriously, especially since New Jersey
is luring companies with hefty tax subsidies of its own. Although
the exodus of companies from New York has slowed to a trickle since
the mid-'80s, both Cigna Insurance and U.S. Trust are now
considering moving a total of 900 workers to Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public investments in the exchanges are not simply
corporate retention deals,'' said Carl Weisbrod, former president
of New York City's Economic Development Corp. ``They're
infrastructure deals, no different than the Erie Canal. Financial
services are the key to our economic health and future. Ensuring
that this industry remains concentrated in New York and competitive
is a major public policy objective.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly has been for both Democratic and Republican mayors
over the last 15 years. During the real-estate boom in the 1980s,
Mayor Edward Koch gave a $235 million incentive package to Chase
Manhattan and $90 million to Citicorp after those companies
threatened to relocate some of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   During the recession in the early 1990s when the city's
financial center appeared to be on the verge of disintegrating,
Mayor David Dinkins continued the tradition, granting a total of
$255 million in tax breaks to Morgan Stanley, Prudential
Securities, Bear Stearns and Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who as a mayoral candidate in 1993
criticized the use of corporate retention deals, has accelerated
the process. His administration has granted $445.4 million in tax
subsidies to 20 Wall Street companies since January 1994, including
$75 million for Bear Stearns and $50.5 million for Credit Suisse
First Boston. Eight insurance companies got a total of $122.34
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example, city officials granted a $5.8 million
incentive package to Zurich Centre Group, even after it had
abandoned its previously announced plans to move to Stamford,
Conn., where it had obtained a $190 million tax credit for a new
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Those so-called retention deals mostly involved cuts in sales
taxes and property taxes. The city's financial markets, however,
have bargained for far more by playing the relocation card for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Afte talking with New Jersey, the Mercantile Exchange got a
$183.9 million incentive package from the Giuliani administration
in 1994, which included $129 million in cash, the equivalent of 59
percent of the cost of its new headquarters and trading floor at
Battery Park City. The Merc currently pays $1 million a year in
rent on the state-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which owns the Nasdaq and American Stock Exchanges, also
wanted a big subsidy package to build a joint home for both markets
in New York or New Jersey. Zarb offered to move the NASD
headquarters from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many real-estate executives and officials in New York doubted
that Zarb, who has made no secret of his plans to create a
financial market that could rival the New York Stock Exchange,
would move to New Jersey, which offered $140 million in tax and
cash incentives.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials said they struck a deal last week to
provide the exchanges with $20 million in cash and $180 million in
tax credits and low-cost electricity. The subsidy package, however,
is portable and can be used at a site near Times Square or in
Battery Park City. Michael Jones, a senior vice president at NASD,
said on Friday that the company was ``still in the process'' of
making a decision and obtaining board approval.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials are frantically trying to conclude a
deal with the New York Stock Exchange, which says it is continuing
to negotiate with both New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   According to negotiators for both sides, the city and the state
have offered to provide nearly $500 million in cash and $100
million in tax breaks toward the construction of a $1.1 billion
trading complex on a block bound by Wall Street and Exchange Place,
between Broad and William streets. The $600 million package would
be more than twice as large as any subsidy ever offered to a single
company.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether those incentives include the $300 million
it will cost to acquire the construction site. City and state
officials are hoping to sell the right to build an office tower
above the exchange's new trading floors, which will rise about 15
stories.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has maintained that it will not pay for the
land, while state officials have refused to grant any subsidies for
new computers and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The bargaining is further complicated by the fact that the stock
market favors moving to a vacant parcel at Battery Park City, while
city and state officials want the exchange to remain in the city'
traditional financial district. They fear that property values and
the economic health of the district would be undermined by the
stock market's departure.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, New Jersey, which has long sought the prestige
a financial market could offer, beckons with its own set of
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that both of these exchanges gave very serious
consideration to New Jersey,'' said Medina. ``If they don't come,
this stalking-horse was involved in a photo finish.''

WALL STREET SEEMS UNAWARE OF WARNING SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Why is Wall Street such a happy place? Trouble signs
abound at home and abroad, but the U.S. stock market seems blithely
unaware of any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest reason for concern emerged this week when the yield
on Japan's six-month Treasury bill turned negative. Think about it.
Investors in Japan are willing to buy short-term government
securities at above par and redeem them for par at maturity, which
produces a loss.
</P>
<P>
   This came about because Japanese banks are sinking further into
a credibility crisis despite government's recently announced
bailout plans.
</P>
<P>
   One expert told The Wall Street Journal that this turn of events
means people prefer a small loss from entrusting their money to the
government to the perceived risk of putting it in banks and losing
the entire amount. A similar negative spread occurred on U.S.
government securities, the story said, during the Depression amid
rising fear of a banking system collapse.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening in Japan isn't entirely irrational for some
investors, however. The recent strength of the yen raises hopes for
its value to continue rising in foreign exchange markets. If the
trend remains in place, the yen's appreciation will more than
offset the loss incurred when the Treasury security is redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   While this rare phenomenon is driven somewhat by arcane foreign
exchange bets, the underlying reasons should be cause for serious
concern among investors and policy-makers alike. If the banking
system of the world's second-largest economy is held in such low
repute, getting Japan back to health is obviously a greater
challenge than even the most pessimistic envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Japan situation, though, is only one of many global trouble
spots, which raises the question of why Wall Street remains so
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil shows signs of progress with its problems, but it's a
day-to-day thing. If its latest stabilization plan doesn't pan out,
an emergency in Brazil is likely to be very bad for global markets
in general and U.S. financial markets in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there's been an easing of the credit crunch that seemed
to developing a few weeks ago after the hedge fund debacle and some
other unsettling events. But while the flight from risk may have
eased, it's still a problem, and further woe in Brazil would be a
substantial depressant on marketplace confidence worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the horizon is Europe's coming conversion to its euro
common currency when the New Year arrives. This development has a
lot to recommend it, but the required adjustment may slow economic
activity, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Here at home, the economy expanded a good deal more than most
expected in the third quarter, but there was less to the Gross
Domestic Product Report than met the eye. The economy grew at a 3.3
percent annual rate, but about one-third was due to inventory
accumulation. Consumer spending, which is two-thirds of the
economy, was almost 4 percent, which looks good until compared with
the first half's 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Aggregate profit growth has been shrinking for about a year and
probably will continue to do so if the economy slows, as most
observers expect it to do. Declining profits mean an already pricey
stock market will become more pricey even if stocks stay at current
levels.
</P>
<P>
   But is Wall Street worried? Not as far as anybody can tell.

HALLMARK CARDS INC. WON'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE NET WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc. will not have to reveal
one of its biggest secrets after all.
</P>
<P>
   A judge decided Friday that the company's net worth won't be
needed in an ongoing trial against the Kansas City greeting card
maker. That's because the judge killed half of the lawsuit, the
half that required Hallmark's net worth statement.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Russell of Clay County Circuit Court, saying he had
``taken this matter rather seriously,'' fetched the secret
net-worth statement from a safe. It was still sealed inside a
manila envelope. From his bench, the judge handed the envelope to
Hallmark's attorney, John Aisenbrey, who turned on his heels,
walked past his desk and into the courtroom audience. He handed it
to Carol Fowler, a Hallmark staff lawyer, who returned it to
Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly pleased,'' Hallmark spokeswoman Julie O'Dell
said later. She said Hallmark liked to keep its financial matters
private.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Ed Maupin, said he would appeal the judge's
decision, ``which we believe is not consistent with the clear
weight of the testimony given in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Maupin's case wasn't wiped out. The judge ruled that the other
half of the trial should go forward. The jury is to start
deliberations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Net worth is the value of a company. Hallmark's net worth is not
publicly known because Hallmark is privately owned and not required
to disclose financial matters.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, there was a threat that the net worth could be
revealed in the trial. That would have been of interest to
competitors, who might have been able to use it as a weapon against
Hallmark. It also could have been of interest to Hallmark
employees, who get a claim on company stock as an employee benefit
but who don't get a great deal of outside validation of what that
stock is worth.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit concerns Maupin's allegation that Hallmark reneged
on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Maupin was a longtime employee whose job was to find buyers for
Hallmark's obsolete machinery, old office equipment, scrap paper
and such. In 1988, at age 52 and after having been demoted, he
agreed to quit his job with the idea that he'd sell Hallmark's
salvage as a contract salvage dealer for Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Maupin got a farewell letter from the personnel director wishing
Maupin well and saying he was ``certainly welcome to approach
Hallmark'' to seek business.
</P>
<P>
   But Maupin alleged that Hallmark did not welcome him. His calls
went unreturned, business from Hallmark came only grudgingly and in
token amounts, and some managers reported that the word at the
company was that Hallmark did not want to do business with Maupin,
according to testimony brought out this week by Maupin's attorneys,
Kelly McClelland and Marty Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark's attorneys presented evidence and testimony saying
that Maupin did get meetings with Hallmark executives and did get
some business, therefore he was welcome to approach _ which was all
the contract called for. Moreover, Hallmark found better ways to
dispose of its salvage than having Maupin handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Maupin's lawsuit basically made two allegations: that Hallmark
broke its contract to welcome him, and that Hallmark committed
fraud by inducing him to leave the company with the ``welcome to
approach'' letter.
</P>
<P>
   Russell on Friday tossed out the fraud claim. He said there was
``no credible evidence that there was fraud'' because there was no
substantial evidence that at the time the ``welcome to approach''
letter was crafted, Hallmark intended to give Maupin the cold
shoulder later.
</P>
<P>
   With that decision, there was no need for the net-worth
statement. That would have been used by the jury in assessing
punitive damages if Maupin had won.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dell said: ``We felt all along that's the way it would turn
out, that there was no fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Maupin said: ``We are disappointed the judge felt so much
pressure over the issue of releasing the net-worth statement of
Hallmark to the world that he could not conclude that there was
clearly sufficient evidence to show Hallmark's representations to
Mr. Maupin...was fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the judge said, ``There may well have been a breach of
contract.'' The trial proceeded on that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are set for Monday morning. If Maupin
prevails, he could be awarded more than $120,000.

 &HT;    `X-Files' season opener reveals show at its best
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Something is definitely ``out there'' on
``The X-Files'' ... but it's not the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say it's a hideous-looking creature with long claws
and a really nasty disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files' '' season opener picks up nicely where the movie
left off. Once again Mulder (David Duchovny) finds himself before
an FBI review board, trying to explain a ``global domination'' plan
by vicious spacelings. And, once again, the Feds don't buy his
shadow conspiracy stories.
</P>
<P>
   Even Scully (Gillian Anderson), who we all know was infected by
the deadly alien virus in the movie, has her doubts. After what
she's seen, though, it's a bit hard to believe she remains a
stubborn skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mulder and Scully are hot on the creature's trail.
But so is Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who continues
to puff away while uttering cold lines like, ``The response must be
equal to the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   All the elements that make ``The X-Files'' work are on display.
Scully and Mulder chasing killer beings in dimly lit corridors; The
Syndicate meeting in smoke-filled rooms while angrily barking,
``How can this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The tension should be raised a few notches as Scully and Mulder
continue to butt heads with agents Spender (Chris Owen) and Fowley
(Mimi Rogers). You can almost feel the tension between Mulder and
the slimy Spender. But most interesting will be finding out if boy
wonder Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) holds the key to everything in
``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the episodes can equal this top-notch and often
creepy opener, ``The X-Files'' is in for a great season.

Esperanza _ or New Hope _ neighborhood of Tegucigalpa clung
precariously to a hillside, a physical manifestation of the
precariousness of life in the second-poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere. Last weekend, some residents heeded warnings and
evacuated while others stayed behind and prayed. Around 2 a.m.
Saturday, as the rains from Hurricane Mitch softened the ground, a
section of hill split away and fell straight down into the river,
taking more than 70 houses with it. A few people survived the
plunge. Others died; their bodies still lie buried in the rubble. A
look at the devastation the Hurricane wrought on Honduras, along
with brief update on Nicaraguan situation, and on the future of
people who have lost jobs, houses _ and even the land on which
their houses were built. Residents say Nueva Esperanza will never
be rebuilt. New Hope, they say, is gone for good. (Melvin, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 40.

   HAITI-GOATS _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ Ileus Viltine, a poor
Haitian farmer, lived most of his 67 years in grinding poverty. His
only shelter was a rickety lean-to made from coconut leaves. But
now he has a new house with a tin roof. And, even better, he can
afford to send three of his five children to school. The source of
his new-found wealth? An unassuming goat. Viltine is just one of
1,200 farmers who have received a pregnant Nubian-bred goat as part
of the Haitian Goat Project sponsored by the Atlanta-based
non-profit group, Global Health Action. The group has operated the
project since 1985 to give impoverished Haitian families a means of
support and better nourishment for children. On the surface, a goat
may not seem like much. But it has a lot to offer: milk, meat,
hides. And the goats can be sold so that children can go to school,
many of them for the first time. We visited the tiny village of
Oranger, high in the mountains of rural Haiti, where a team from
Atlanta spent hours checking the goats for parasites and other
diseases, while teaching the farmers, many of them women, how to
care for their goats. The farmers say the goats are the only things
that have kept them alive. (Emling, Cox News Service). (EDs: This
package will be CoxNet's Focus page for Sunday.)

   HAITI-INTERNET _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ In Haiti, a country

Internet. Relying on imported equipment and wireless
communications, owner Jonas Guillaume recently opened Computer
World. He sells memberships for $35 a month, or about one-sixth of
the annual per-capita income, to any one who wants their own email
address and access to the Internet. He also offers six-week
training courses for doctors, lawyers, and other Haitian
professionals, many of whom know nothing about computers. Computer
World has become a gathering place for students and others who
``had heard something about the Internet,'' but didn't know exactly
what it was. Computer World even sells cappuccino, espresso and
light snacks in this land of rice and beans. (Emling, Cox News

 &HT;    The Wright stuff, here on Earth and beyond
 &HT;    By Jeff Bruce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ninety-five years ago, two Dayton bicycle makers
gave the world wings. On Saturday, a piece of those wings returned
to Earth from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a wind-swept stretch of sand at Kitty Hawk, N.C., on
Dec. 17, 1903, that Orville and Wilbur Wright made history. They
became the first men to defy the grip of gravity and soar above the
earth in a winged contraption powered by a man-made machine.
</P>
<P>
   They were, as John Glenn has so graciously acknowledged, the
first astronauts. After the Wright brothers' achievement, the
question was not whether mankind would fly, but how high and how
fast and how far we would go.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of mere decades we've gone from that humble
beginning to the moon and back. We've shattered the sound barrier
many times over. Someday, perhaps, we will visit other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Orville Wright, who started it all with his first wobbly flight
of 120 feet, never lived to see his creation take mankind beyond
the sheltering blanket of our atmosphere. Surely, though, he and
his brother knew the day would come.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Glenn completed his homage to the Wright brothers
when he returned from his nine-day expedition aboard the space
shuttle Discovery, appropriately (if coincidentally) mission No. 95
in the shuttle program.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Discovery were two swatches of fabric from the original
1903 Wright Flyer, the first airplane. Glenn had been given one of
the squares of fabric by a group of Dayton civic leaders earlier in
the year with the request that he carry into orbit a piece of the
plane that gave aviation its birth. Another swatch of fabric was
contributed by the National Air and Space Museum along with a small
wood chip from the Wrights' Kitty Hawk hanger where the plane was
stored.
</P>
<P>
   While many people have seen the world's first airplane on
display at the Smithsonian, most may not realize that the cloth
covering the display is not the original. The cotton fabric
covering the Flyer was damaged during the disastrous Dayton flood
of 1913. Wright family members saved the original covering, cutting
it into small squares to be used for special occasions. Rocketing
into outer space surely qualifies as one of those.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Glenn and the crew of Discovery have returned the
fabric to Earth, it may soon find its way back to Dayton. Massive
festivities are planned here for the year 2003, marking the 100th
anniversary of first flight. A special display for the swatch is
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn's historic return to orbit has been a nostalgic
opportunity to recall the early days of our space program, the
heroism of the original Mercury astronauts, and the amazing
scientific and technological advancements we've witnessed over the
past few years. It's given NASA a much-needed and overdue spot in
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   And by carrying into space a piece of the Wright stuff, Glenn
has also helped underscore where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it. John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth,
might have grown up just another Ohio farm boy had it not been for
the pioneering work of two irrepressible inventors right here in
Dayton.

operations in this former coal mining town. ``It's a boon to
business,'' says Biber. Trinidad, Colo., is known as ``the
sex-change capital of the world.'' ``The patients come with their
families and help the regional economy.'' Trinidad boosters wince

 &HT;    Glenn feeling fine after flawless landing
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery and Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A flawless landing capped the space
shuttle Discovery's nine-day mission Saturday, bringing to a close
Sen. John Glenn's historic space adventure and the nostalgic trip
America took with him.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect weather allowed Commander Curt Brown to bring the
shuttle down at the Kennedy Space Center on the first of four
possible landing opportunities, after 135 loops around the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Houston this is PS2, I'm better known to a lot of you
as John,'' Glenn said, referring to his crew rank of payload
specialist number two. His voice was strong and exuberant just
minutes after the noon touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to repeat a statement I made a long, long time ago,''
he added, ``except this time it is 1 g and I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``zero g and I feel fine'' made history in 1962 when
Glenn flew America's first orbital mission, and he reprised that
line nine days ago after achieving orbit aboard Discovery as the
oldest man ever in space at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
   Looking a bit unsteady as he adjusted again to having gravity
pull at his balance, Glenn stepped gingerly from the crew carrier
when he and the rest of the crew put their feet back on Earth
nearly two hours after the shuttle stopped rolling. The crew
carrier is a bus-like vehicle on giant hydraulic legs that raise it
to the height of the space shuttle hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovery has landed!'' bellowed NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin, as the crew stood on the runway behind him, ``and our
spirits in America and Europe and Japan soar.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's seven member crew included Brown, Glenn, Pilot
Steve Lindsey, Mission Specialists Dr. Scott Parazynski, Stephen
Robinson and Pedro Duque, and Payload Specialist Dr. Chiaki Mukai.
Duque is the first Spaniard in space, and Mukai is the first
Japanese astronaut to go twice.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred photographers and reporters joined a like number
of friends and family at a special section of bleachers about 1,200
feet from the shuttle's lengthy runway. But this gathering paled in
comparison to the celebrity-infested spectacle of the launch.
</P>
<P>
   A marching band from Waterford, Ohio near Marietta showed up at
the last moment, having driven all night after learning that their
trip to Disney World came within a day of coinciding with the
shuttle landing.
</P>
<P>
   As minutes closed in on the touch-down time, the crowd squinted
into the sun looking for the enormous shuttle and the small plane
that guides it down. Three minutes before landing, two rapid-fire
sonic booms announced Discovery's speedy return to Earth, flying in
at an angle six times steeper than of an airliner.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped down heavily on the runway, sending spraying smoke
from the tires as they touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful landing, Curt,'' the voice of NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   Mission control went down to the wire Saturday morning before
finally clearing Discovery to land on the first pass at Kennedy
Space Center. Crosswinds gusting slightly above the
17-mile-per-hour limit prompted Launch Entry Flight Director Linda
Ham to poll her mission control team before giving commander Brown
a ``go'' to leave orbit just nine minutes before he had to fire his
engines to slow down or continue on another orbit around the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as late as we like to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery could have made another landing attempt on the next
orbit, but after that it would have had two chances to land at
Edwards Air Force Base in California or spend another day in space.
</P>
<P>
   The big question for the day was whether the shuttle's drag
parachute, which slows the shuttle on the runway, would
accidentally deploy in the air. When Discovery launched October 29,
the small door that covers the chute fell off as the main engines
ignited. NASA engineers spent much of the first days of the flight
evaluating the dangers of having the chute exposed in its
compartment, and concluded that it posed no threat to the mission
and little to the return to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis proved correct, but they chose not to use the
parachute since they couldn't verify that it wasn't damaged during
the fiery phases of liftoff and reentry. Also, after the shuttle
landed, ground crews kept a 600-foot clearance zone around the tail
because the chute's small explosive charge, which opens the chute
under normal conditions, hadn't been detonated.
</P>
<P>
   The first 47 shuttles landed without such a chute, which is
attached at the base of the tail. Initial inspection showed the
chute, still packed in its compartment, was not damaged after nine
days in the harsh environment of space.
</P>
<P>
   The day began at 4 a.m. for Discovery when the crew had
breakfast -- Glenn ate Mexican-style eggs and sausage patties --
before reinstalling the metal seats that had been removed and
stowed to make room for scientific equipment. By about 10 a.m. they
were suiting up in the orange `pumpkin suits' worn for launch and
reentry.
</P>
<P>
   Packed under Glenn's suit was a heart and blood pressure monitor
that recorded cardiovascular data throughout the 70-minute descent
to Earth. Although Glenn was the only member of Discovery to be
outfitted with the monitors, NASA has recorded identical data on 66
other astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after landing, the crew was taken to crew quarters
for an extensive physical evaluation. Glenn's lasted about four
hours, and included taking more cardiovascular measurements while
he was strapped to a table that was tilted vertically. Glenn also
spent time standing on a small platform while wearing monitors that
measured the activity in his inner ear, where the human balancing
mechanism is, while the platform moved beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   David Liskowsky, who headed the life science studies that
involved Glenn, said the on-board experiments went very well, but
he added that there's ``still a lot of science to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   And while scientific study clearly undergirded the mission, it
was Glenn's enthusiasm at having finally made the second space
mission he was denied nearly 40 years ago that provided the
mission's excitement. Often borrowing from his comments the first
time he flew, Glenn spent his nine days in orbit acting like a man
living out a life-long dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovery and this crew took us around and around,'' Glenn
said while still seated on the runway, ``and that view is still
tremendous.

EDITORIAL: A WAR FOR THE REPUBLICAN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 8:
</P>
<P>
   The modern Republican Party seems to define itself through
revolution. In 1980, Ronald Reagan overthrew the bland,
accommodating style of the party's old guard, and then Newt
Gingrich stormed the Capitol in 1994. Now that Gingrich has been
booted, the House Republicans have to decide whether the 1998
election dictated that yet another fundamental shift is in order.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right says Gingrich erred by going soft. Yet the
voters picked moderate Republican governors as the party's stars of
the future. It promises to be a gory sorting out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent, one of the first to challenge the Gingrich
leadership team, wants a return to the ``Reagan agenda'' that he
says the public never abandoned. But Rep. Robert Livingston, whose
public opposition to the speaker signaled an anti-Gingrich
stampede, proclaimed the newly revolutionary idea of conciliation
toward the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his challenge, Livingston spoke of replacing the
``revolutionizing'' talents of the speaker with his own supposed
talents at day-to-day governing. He seemed to be echoing the record
of those Republican governors who have embraced pragmatism,
ideological flexibility and impatience with litmus-test social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   From Gov. George Bush in Texas to Gov. George Pataki in New
York, these Republicans rejected the ``government is the problem''
mantra of old. They embraced the use of public resources for
children's health, schools, the environment and job placement for
the poor. They carefully avoided Gingrich's divisive, wedge-driving
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston's words cannot necessarily be taken at face
value. He can be viewed as a moderate only in the context of the
rigid conviction politics perfected by Gingrich and mimicked on the
Senate side by the majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a civil war in the House Republican conference.
Northeastern moderates may play a key balancing role, as they did
in preserving Gingrich against his own disaffected rebels in the
1998 budget fight. But most House Republicans are hard-liners who
still want to slash government and taxes, stop abortions and lift
environmental laws _ but do it with a friendlier face.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says a handful of ``cannibals'' blackmailed him into
resigning. He can take comfort knowing that they did not think him
wrong, just loud, clumsy and irresolute.
</P>
<P>
   This militant faction is in denial about the successes forged by
Republican gubernatorial candidates like Bush of Texas, who clearly
intends to test his brand of Republicanism in the next presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, the Republicans returned to the statehouses last week
cut taxes when they could. But they also did things like balancing
economic growth and environmental protection. Some Republican-led
states enacted laws protecting patients against arbitrary moves by
health-maintenance organizations, at a time when the Gingrich team
walked away from the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Govs. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan
prevailed as welfare reformers while actually spending more on day
care and training to ensure that welfare recipients do not just get
dropped from the rolls but find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Pataki and their colleagues in other statehouses have
brought back into the Republican mainstream the idea that while
government may not be the whole solution, it is not the enemy
either. As they choose their next speaker, the Republicans in
Washington ought to listen. But the ghosts of the Gingrich
revolution will be strong in the House, and it will probably take
another election to show the hard-liners that being mean does not
sell so well anymore.

MOYNIHAN AND D'AMATO PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One is a towering Democrat with a mane of white hair, the other
a medium-built Republican with a bald pate. One speaks in the
pinched cadences and flowery language of the university, the other
in the earthy phrases and nasal tones of Long Island subdivisions.
One spends his spare moments writing books and giving lectures, the
other raising campaign cash and playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find an odder couple in the Senate than
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York's four-term Democrat, and Alfonse
D'Amato, the three-term Republican. And so it seems only fitting
that events last week should herald the end of their congressional
careers in distinctively different ways.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, D'Amato was soundly defeated by Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., after one of the loudest, most passionate and
expensive campaigns in state history. Just three days later,
Moynihan announced that he would avoid the threat of a primary
challenge and retire when his term ends on Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato went down fighting until the end; Moynihan offered
little emotion or fanfare, just a straightforward, ``It's time to
go,'' spoken softly to a handful of reporters in separate
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their obvious contrasts, Moynihan and D'Amato had a
strikingly cooperative working relationship for most of their 18
years together in the Senate. They frequently shared credit for
legislation and budget items, helped win approval for each other's
judicial nominations, defended each other against criticism, went
out of their way to attend joint news conferences and did almost
nothing to help their parties oust the other from office. Their
alliance was stronger than that of many same-state senators from
the same party.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong if history remembered the Moynihan-D'Amato
era simply as a time of remarkable cooperation between a seemingly
ill-matched couple. In truth, they worked well together largely
because of their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that clearer than in the realm of politics. D'Amato
was the master builder and paramount leader of New York's
Republican Party, which, at least until Tuesday, was considered
among the most efficient and powerful political organizations in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato influenced local and state politics to a degree
unmatched by perhaps any other senator in modern American history,
helping elect a governor, several congressmen and dozens of local
officials. Most of those people remained loyal to D'Amato, doling
out jobs and contracts to his friends, allies and contributors, and
fighting for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, on the other hand, is almost a party unto himself.
Though he is fond of recalling how he cut his teeth on the brawling
clubhouse politics of Hell's Kitchen five decades ago, Moynihan has
had little to do with the state Democratic Party since.
</P>
<P>
   He despises fund raising, and so never raised much money for
anyone, including himself. He has focused almost entirely on global
affairs and domestic policy, caring little for the hand-dirtying
work of selecting candidates, punishing enemies and resolving
intraparty feuds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike D'Amato, who fought ferociously to insure that an obscure
state senator named George Pataki would receive the Republican
nomination for governor in 1994, Moynihan rarely took sides in a
Democratic primary fight until this year, when he supported his old
friend Peter Vallone in his doomed candidacy for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his lack of party involvement _ or, perhaps, because
of it _ Moynihan was a vote-getting machine, having set the record
for margin of victory in a New York Senate race in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the pragmatist, D'Amato understood that toppling Moynihan
would have been difficult at best, foolhardy at worst. Ever the
diplomat, Moynihan did little to make his colleague ever consider
it.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it might sound for a man who wore his partisan loyalties
on his sleeve, D'Amato clearly recognized the value of having
strong ties to prominent Democrats in a state where Democrats
outnumbered Republicans by a ratio of 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that D'Amato frequently invoked Moynihan's name on the
campaign trail this year, whether in Rochester or Nassau County,
recalling their joint efforts to get acid rain legislation, protect
state transportation funds and oppose the Clinton administration's
attempts to rescind federal Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   And Moynihan, to the dismay of many Democrats, obligingly went
along. When D'Amato held news conferences in Washington to promote
legislation that was important to his campaign this year, Moynihan
often attended. And when environmental groups accused D'Amato of
masquerading as a defender of the environment, Moynihan's chief of
staff, Tony Bullock, came to the junior senator's defense.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that Moynihan was not a loyal
Democrat. He was concerned about the Republicans winning a
filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate this year. And he
seemed genuinely pleased about Schumer's victory, saying he would
feel more secure about retiring knowing that the state's next
senior senator would be a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan also believed deeply in bipartisanship, even when
the concept seemed so out of vogue in recent years. In a
Republican-controlled Congress, D'Amato simply could get things he
could not, like additional money for mass transit this year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Moynihan has commented on the importance of
close cooperation between senators from the same state,
particularly given New York's declining power in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who in his autobiography warmly described Moynihan as a
friend, statesman and scholar, tends to be less theoretical than
the senior senator. In an interview five years ago, for example, he
offered this bare-bones assessment of their relationship: ``We
don't get in the way of each other.''

ELECTION RITUAL TURNS INTO A SPORTING RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Every two years for the last 24, voters here
went to the polls and gave the job of tax collector to James
Branca. A gentle man, Branca did little to keep pace with
technological advances, but treated residents with the warmth and
deference to which they are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, he died of pneumonia with 18 months left in his
latest term, leaving town officials with the sticky question of
whom to appoint to dog their 58,000 constituents for money.
</P>
<P>
   After one member's late-night brainstorm, the Board of Selectmen
decided to pass the job to another local institution: Louis
Caravella, 72, who for years has carried the affectionate but
unofficial title of mayor of Cos Cob, a section of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 until he sold it in 1988, he owned a store that was
officially called Post Stationery but was known universally as
Lou's. Besides selling stationery, Caravella made house calls to
install hearing-aid batteries, fixed radios and flashlights, and
tried to teach responsibility to children at the nearby school by
automatically offering one day's credit on candy.
</P>
<P>
   Caravella's wife, Judy, had retired in May from teaching nursery
school, and they had planned to travel. But Caravella dutifully
answered his town's call. In July he was sworn in for the
$60,000-a-year job of managing six employees and collecting $169
million a year in town taxes and sewer fees. He expected to serve
out Branca's term, which will end in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But as beloved as he is, Caravella has one serious flaw in the
eyes of a powerful group of residents. He is a Democrat. Branca was
a Republican, and Caravella had just become, as his supporters
proudly put it, the town's first Democratic tax collector in 334
years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican leaders in town say they like Caravella just
fine, they gathered enough signatures to force a special election,
and put up a candidate of their own. ``Inroads,'' explained
Christopher von Keyserling, a Republican who nevertheless
campaigned for Caravella. ``The Grand Old Party doesn't like
inroads.''
</P>
<P>
   And so what had been a town ritual suddenly became a race.
</P>
<P>
   Caravella said he instantly felt like the underdog, since 46
percent of the town's voters are registered Republicans while just
19 percent are Democrats and the rest are unaffiliated.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate was Samuel Telerico, 62, who owns a
packaging-technology consulting company called Teleden Enterprises,
because it was started in his den. Both men are Greenwich natives.
Caravella was senior class president of Greenwich High School in
1944, and Telerico held the same honor 10 years later. Asked to
describe their opponents, Caravella said, ``Sam's a great guy.''
Telerico said: ``Lou's a fine person. He's done a lot for our
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they campaigned ferociously. Caravella raised
$25,000, and Telerico collected $11,000 for a campaign that
included 5 a.m. trips to the railroad stations to give commuters
free copies of The Wall Street Journal, with campaign brochures
tucked inside. Both men bought radio and newspaper ads featuring
testimonials from various local and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Telerico, who made modernization of the office his main campaign
issue, donned Bermuda shorts and a golf shirt to troll the town
beach and organized a ``supermarket brigade'' to spread the word to
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Caravella hired a telemarketing firm to call 16,000 Greenwich
households with a 30-second recording of him asking for support. He
said he mailed 33,000 postcards and handed out 7,000 fliers at flea
markets, pumpkin patches and fire stations.
</P>
<P>
   On election night, both parties set out spreads of beer, wine
and finger sandwiches as they waited for the result. At the
Democratic gathering at Redmen's Hall, owned by a fraternal
organization, Selectwoman Stephanie H. Sanchez, cell phone to her
ear, shouted, ``I think _ I think we've got it!''
</P>
<P>
   In the first count, Caravella was ahead by 62 votes. Since the
difference was less than 0.5 percent, state law required a recount,
which was set for 10 a.m. Thursday at Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate stuck around: Caravella headed to Hilton Head,
S.C., for an annual golf outing, and Telerico took off for San
Francisco to visit his new granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the 1,000 absentee ballots, stuffed in cardboard
boxes, were hauled out of the town clerk's vault and recounted one
by one. Discrepancies were discovered. Party officials used tally
sheets with columns labeled ``Sam'' and ``Lou'' to keep track as
their candidates gained and lost a vote here or five votes there.
Eight hours later, Telerico had gained four votes and Caravella had
lost three, reducing his margin to 55 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Then the election officials headed downstairs to ``the
dungeon,'' the unheated, concrete-floored storage room where the 49
voting machines had been impounded. Mechanics used power drills to
jack up each one so its counters could be read.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Vecchiolla, one of the town's two voting registrars,
barked out the totals from Rows 13A (Telerico) and 13B (Caravella).
A crowd gathered as people got home from work and heard the recount
was still under way.
</P>
<P>
   Snickers bars, left over from Halloween, were handed out by
Edward Dadakis, a former town Republican chairman. On the last
machine, the drill jammed. One of the mechanics, Ed Handel, used a
hand crank to open the machine as the crowd shouted, ``Go, Eddie!
Go, Eddie!'' No number had changed. ``Right on the money,'' said
Carmella Budkins, the town clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Caravella would remain the tax collector, by 55 votes out of
more than 17,000 cast. Ms. Sanchez, the selectwoman, led a round of
applause. On the way out, Dadakis said to Carol Ducret, the
election's chief moderator, ``Carol, you're going to recheck those
totals upstairs?''

NBA TALKS: PLENTY OF GAMES, NO HOOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Stern authorized team officials to explain the owners'
proposal to players last week, lifting a moratorium that began July
1. Depending on whose side you are on in the National Basketball
Association's labor dispute, it was either a gesture on the league
commissioner's part to educate the masses or a scheme to divide the
players union.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, retaliated by
saying he would mail out the union's proposals to the league's
general managers. ``We'll have them attach to it the NBA's
proposal, and they can judge for themselves which one is better,''
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Election day has come and gone, but in the NBA the campaigning
goes on and on. They are playing games in November, all right. With
the regular season wiped out until at least until Dec. 8, the
boardroom has become the focal point in a battle to sway the
league's middle class.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of no progress on economic issues and with no clear
date when talks will resume, Stern has become fond of calling
recent negotiations ``Groundhog Day,'' referring to the Bill Murray
movie in which the main character wakes up to Feb. 2 day after day.
It is one point he and Hunter agree on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're going backward, we're just running in
place,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has left both sides time to expound on their idea
of what a good deal represents.
</P>
<P>
   For the league, which is proposing to limit the salaries of
upper-echelon players, it means grabbing a bigger portion of
revenues while claiming to raise the income of the league's
journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the vast majority of players, and I mean like 80 or 90
percent, there is absolutely nothing in that deal that is not
really good for that group of players,'' Russ Granik, the deputy
commissioner, said last week. ``Whether they would vote for it or
not out of concern for the high-end salary players, I don't know.
But for the vast majority of players, it would be hard for me to
conceive of any reason why they would not endorse the deal at least
as it would affect them over the next six years.''
</P>
<P>
   For the union, which does not want to drastically alter a system
that resulted in the players taking in more than 57 percent of
basketball-related income last season, it means finding a way to
appease the owners while not sacrificing too much.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the NBA is indeed a league of haves and have-nots,
Michael Jordan made $33 million last season, while the median
salary hovered around $1.3 million. Nearly 30 percent of the
players last season were paid the league minimum salary of
$272,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal they are currently proposing barely helps the middle
class,'' Hunter said. ``Plain and simple, the concessions they want
us to make would hurt everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the agent David Falk _ whose clients include Jordan and
Patrick Ewing, the union president _ has begun campaigning. Singled
out by Stern for sabotaging a potential deal last week, Falk has
been characterized as having only his supernova clients' interests
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem the agents have with the escrow arrangement is,
they are concerned about a real limit on salaries,'' a participant
in the negotiations said. ``So if $15 million is the most, say, Tim
Duncan can make, then why would a player pay an agent 4 percent of
his salary? Why wouldn't he just get a lawyer to look the contract
over? The superstar agents are afraid this deal would make them
less valuable in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk responded: ``Honestly, I'm not worried about fees. We're
going to make tons of money off our players on the marketing side.
We're worried about a fair deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Stern and Hunter, Falk is trying to make his case before
the people, too. He said he is planning to stage his own all-star
exhibition game in two to three weeks, a game that may include
several members of the original Olympic Dream Team, including
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   A site has not yet been determined, but a charity has: NBA
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the league has gotten a great cushion from television,
we have to create cushions for the players in case this goes
longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without any budging at the bargaining table and the season held
hostage at least until mid-December, it appears no tactic or
convention is off limits anymore.

EDITORIAL: PERILOUS DAYS IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 8:
</P>
<P>
   With food stocks dangerously diminished by a disastrous harvest
and the economy still reeling, Russia is headed into a winter of
deprivation and discontent. The critical question is whether
Russians will stoically endure another season of hardship, as they
have so many times before, or strike out in anger against the
political order.
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in part on decisions taken in Moscow and
Washington in the days ahead. With President Boris Yeltsin
sidelined by illness and in political eclipse, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov must develop a program that pulls Russia back from
the abyss without abandoning democracy and economic reform. The
United States must do whatever it can within reason to help Russia
get through the winter and start down the long road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is off to a shaky start. Though he shows little
inclination to reverse course entirely and return Russia to a
Communist-style command economy, he is embracing anachronistic
advisers and policies that threaten to put Russia in a state of
perpetual decline.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov inherited a desperate situation. The government cannot
pay its bills, food imports have declined precipitously, foreign
investors have fled and prices are skyrocketing while wages and
pensions are stagnant, if they are paid at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic plan Primakov recently outlined is misguided.
It does little to deal with the oligarchs who control enterprises
that have refused to pay taxes, and thus helped bring on the
government's fiscal crisis. Instead, it seeks to prop up favored
enterprises and print rubles to pay back wages and other government
obligations. The government says it wants to avoid the
hyperinflation that will surely come if it prints too many rubles,
but its only strategy to avoid this is to ask for Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to reform Russia's economy collapsed for a
variety of reasons, including corruption and effects of the Asian
economic implosion that scared investors and depressed the prices
of commodities Russia exports, most notably oil. But that failure
does not justify a return to the failed strategy of Soviet-era
economic planning.
</P>
<P>
   Russia badly needs foreign investment. To get it, the country
will have to do more to establish rules of law so that investors
know what they are getting and to assure that the capital is put to
productive use, not siphoned into foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will also need to negotiate acceptable terms for
restructuring the billions it already owes. If foreign companies
can be persuaded to help develop Russian natural resources, and to
make use of the highly educated work force, a prosperous Russia
could eventually evolve.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the outlook is grim. The International Monetary Fund
has rightly refused to support Primakov's plan, but aid for Russia
may still be necessary. After the poor harvest, the country needs
food aid this winter, and the United States has promised $625
million worth of grain, meat, milk and other goods. More should be
provided if donors can assure themselves that the food will feed
the needy, and not benefit the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   These are perilous days in Russia's passage from tyranny to
democracy. To navigate them safely, Primakov and Russia's friends
in the West should not assume that the patience of the Russian
people is infinite.

NASCAR RIVALS SEEK TO BRAKE GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ In a NASCAR Winston Cup season that has seen Jeff
Gordon lead the pack in poles won, miles led, miles completed,
money won and boos generated, how can the rest of the field catch
up?
</P>
<P>
   That is among the questions that will haunt Gordon's peers
throughout NASCAR's truncated off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has won 39 of the past 126 Cup races, can tie
Richard Petty's modern era (since 1972) record of 13 victories, set
in 1975, today by winning the NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Is the dominance of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports, winners of
four consecutive driver's championships, bad for the Cup series?
</P>
<P>
   Is NASCAR tough enough on Maximum Jeff and the No. 24 DuPont
Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo?
</P>
<P>
   What can they do to stop him?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Jeff is that he's just so good, he makes it
look too easy,'' said Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and
general manager of Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. ``That said,
anybody winning 12 races _ that's a tough thing to promote. I'd
like to see it get more competitive, but I don't think that's Jeff
Gordon's fault. It's everybody else's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain teams get on a roll and can do no wrong. Was it bad
for the NFL that the 49ers had their dynasty? That the Cowboys had
their dynasty? Or that the Bulls have had their run in the NBA? To
me, if it's not wrong for the Cowboys or 49ers or Bulls, why is
this wrong? The answer is no, it's not bad. You've got to tip your
hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, the sport's first seven-time champion and its all-time
leader in victories with 200, remains perplexed by all the fuss
surrounding Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been phenomenal,'' said Petty, a car owner since
retiring as driver of the No. 43 STP Pontiac Grand Prix in 1992.
``But then I turn around and go back three or four years and say,
`What was Dale Earnhardt doing? What did Bill Elliott do? What did
Rusty Wallace do?' Go back to those two or three years when Darrell
Waltrip won so many races. Cale Yarborough in 1976, '77 and '78 won
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarborough, the only driver to win three consecutive Cup
championships, won 10 races in 1974 and 1978. Wallace won 10 races
in 1993. Elliott won 11 races in 1985 as ``Million Dollar Bill.''
Earnhardt, the sport's second seven-time champion, won 11 races in
1987. Waltrip racked up back-to-back 12-victory seasons in 1981-82.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Gordon's not the first one to go through a dominant
spell,'' Petty said. ``He won't be the last. That's the system. The
big phenomena is that NASCAR is so much bigger now, and he's
getting the publicity that those boys never got. There's just more
people watching the sport now.''
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus is that Gordon's polished presence _ on-
and off-track _ has helped propel stock-car racing into the
fastest-growing spectator sport in America. Gordon's ongoing
success also has forced rival series teams to re-evaluate their
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has raised the level for everybody to aim at,''
said Michael Kranefuss, a co-owner of Jeremy Mayfield's No. 12
Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. ``As much as you dread the fact that you're
getting your butt kicked every weekend, that's what you thrive on _
we've got to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranefuss and rival Ford team owner Robert Yates also suggested
that Gordon-watching has become a preoccupation throughout the
side-by-side Cup garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they put us in these garages and the way they lay
stuff up on the table, man, if we can't figure it out, we're
stupid,'' said Yates, who owns the No. 28 Texaco Havoline Ford
driven by pole-sitter Kenny Irwin Jr. and the No. 88 Quality
Care/Ford Credit Taurus driven by Dale Jarrett. ``We feel a little
bit stupid right now, but we're going to get smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's gone off and is lapping the field every
week. It's been a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran crew chief Larry McReynolds said it would be silly for
himself or driver Mike Skinner to concentrate solely on trying to
outrun Gordon _ or complain to NASCAR that the 24-car is operating
outside the rulebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have looked pretty dumb this year if we had whined very
much, considering that a car that has the same sheet metal as us
won 12 races,'' said McReynolds, who tunes the No. 31 Lowe's Chevy
at Richard Childress Racing. ``You still question it in your mind,
why and how. You feel like there's a definite disadvantage there,
but the elements are laying right there in front of you. Gordon _
almost single-handedly _ has won the Manufacturers' Championship
\Rfor Chevrolet\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said any ``whining'' at RCR is directed in-house, to
improve the 31 car and Earnhardt's No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus
Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking for Richard Childress Racing, we don't go to NASCAR
whining about the 24 car,'' said Skinner, the 1997 Cup rookie of
the year. ``You don't make Michael Jordan play with one shoe. If
Jeff Gordon is good enough to win 15 races a year, you're just
going to have to let him win 'em. We hope we can win two or three.
And move the marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working harder and harder and harder. Our engine
department works seven days a week. Larry McReynolds works seven
days a week. Half the guys in that shop work 70-, 80-hour weeks.
We're not going to be satisfied until we beat not only him, but we
want to beat all those Tauruses as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice president for competition, said that
when a driver and team like Gordon/Hendrick gets on a roll, all the
sanctioning body can do is make sure they are playing by the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't police the chemistry of a team or the fact that they
may have gotten a couple of extra lucky breaks,'' Helton said.
``And I don't think there's an unfair advantage. That's not the
right terminology. Jeff and (crew chief) Ray (Evernham) and the
whole 24 organization have just done everything very right.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, when we go to New York and celebrate
the championship (next month), no one will question the fact that
Jeff Gordon earned it. And that he's truly championship material.''
The checkered facts
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with his first championship season of 1995, Jeff
Gordon has won 39 of the last 126 Cup races _ a run that produced
titles in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Gordon is the youngest driver in NASCAR history to win
three Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who clinched his third title with a victory in the
ACDelco 400 at Rockingham, N.C., last Sunday, is the first driver
to win 12 races since three-time champion Darrell Waltrip in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon _ who won 10 races in 1996 and 1997 _ can tie Richard
Petty's modern era (since 1972) record of 13 victories, set in
1975, today.

A POWER RACER IS ROLLING INTO KEY WEST TITLE EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)  (js) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was two years between barrel rolls for Matt Alcone, the
champion offshore powerboat racer. But a repeat of the
100-mile-per-hour boating accident that broke his resolve in 1996
did little more than make him mad nine days ago. Now it's on to the
world championship this week in Key West, Fla., and with not much
of a backward glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been another boat sitting at the dock after my
accident on Halloween, I would have gotten right into it,'' Alcone,
a 45-year-old marketing executive from Laguna Beach, Calif., said
during a telephone interview. ``But I decided I would do whatever
it takes to get ready for Key West. I had no jitters, just
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   A $100,000 repair job is putting Alcone's 45-foot Skater
catamaran back into shape. His crew is replacing the Superboat's
twin 950-horsepower Sterling engines. And the electrical wire that
was sure to corrode after being submerged in salt water near
Biloxi, Miss., has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   As for Alcone and his throttleman, Jerry Gilbreath, the Key West
race has a double agenda: to win the world championship among the
75 powerboats competing, and to break the 118.1 m.p.h. average
speed record set last year by Bob Morgan, the throttleman for Big
Thunder Marine. That 46-foot catamaran, named after Morgan's
powerboat company in Lake Ozark, Mo., is equipped with four
1,000-horsepower engines. Morgan has enlisted the driving expertise
and financial backing of Guido Verme, a Brazilian lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Thunder team watched Alcone skid out of control in the
recent accident at Biloxi. ``They were just driving over their
heads,'' Morgan said. ``It looked like they went into the turn too
fast. But you have to be driving like that to win, or else you
might just as well go out and run slow around the course hoping
everybody else breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Alcone nor Gilbreath was injured in that accident. But
their boat skidded sideways after hooking a wave, and rolled over
twice before stopping upside down in the shallow water of the Gulf
of Mexico. Unlike the accident in 1996 that forced Alcone into a
three-month sabbatical, the roll this time felt like a
well-practiced stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was strapped in my seat and hanging upside down,'' Alcone
said. ``It was our Halloween trick or treat. But because of
training, we were able to stay calm. The cockpit was filled with
water, regulators made it possible for us to breathe. The boat's
F-14 fighter canopy kept us from getting hurt even though we
skidded sideways at 150 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Offshore powerboaters are required to train for such mishaps,
Alcone said. He had been suspended at least six times in an
upside-down chair immersed in a training swimming pool. With six
fatalities having occurred at the world championship in the last
decade, offshore racers are serious about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is a calculated challenge. Alcone has taken
the low road with a boat that is only one foot shorter than
Morgan's, but weighs about 8,000 pounds less. And with two engines
instead of four, Alcone is banking on his boat's nimble footing in
flat calm and rough seas to outdistance Big Thunder's heavy tread.
</P>
<P>
   If seas are moderate, at two to four feet, Morgan's boat is
expected to have the edge with its superior ability to accelerate.
Big Thunder Marine is racing against seven other Superboats, while
Alcone Motorsports competes against five boats in the Superboat
Limited Class.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, top speeds of 160 mph can be expected on the
12.5-lap, 130-mile course. The overall world champion is determined
by the best average speed. Actual race days are Wednesday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years since its introduction, the Farr 40 has
received enough attention internationally that the one-design
sailboat class has organized its first world championship. The
six-day regatta is scheduled to begin Sunday at South Miami Beach,
Fla. Nineteen boats representing amateur-driven teams from
Australia, England, Greece and the United States are expected to
race. Among the favorites to win are Solution, a Farr 40 owned by
JOHN THOMSON of Port Washington, N.Y., and Wired, owned by STEVE
and HELGA GARLAND of South Weymouth, Mass. Thomson won four out of
six class events this year to place first nationally. &QL;

VASSAR MILLER, 74, TWICE NAMED TEXAS POET LAUREATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vassar Miller, whose lifelong struggle with cerebral palsy made
the simplest tasks arduous yet who wrote 10 volumes of searing and
highly regarded poetry, died on Oct. 31 at Houston Methodist
Hospital. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller's work often explored religious themes, although she
also wrote about her own pain and sense of isolation, and there
were occasional flashes of acid humor. Poems collected in ``Wage
War on Silence'' made her a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in
1961. She also was twice named the poet laureate of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texas writers and critics, most notably Larry McMurtry,
lamented the lack of attention paid to her work, which had never
been considered particularly fashionable until late in her career.
``That she is to this day little known, read or praised in Texas is
the most damning comment possible on our literary culture,'' he
wrote in a 1981 essay in The Texas Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the Texas Legislature named Ms. Miller the
state's poet laureate in 1982, and again in 1988. Last year she was
named to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame by the Governor's
Commission for Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I Had Wheels or Love: Collected Poems of Vassar Miller,''
was published in 1990, drawing on her previous 10 volumes,
including her first book of poems, ``Adam's Footprint,'' published
in 1956; ``Onions and Roses'' (1968); ``If I Could Sleep Deeply
Enough'' (1974); and ``Struggling to Swim on Concrete'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   The poem ``Change'' from the ``Onions and Roses'' collection is
a favorite of her admirers:
</P>
<P>
   I can remember the sun as a great golden eagle spreading its
wings to my will.
</P>
<P>
   Now it moves slowly, a buzzard drifting across the sky, over the
carrion earth,
</P>
<P>
   or swoops, a hawk, to seize the heart of a newborn puppy dropped
from his pain-crazy mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now I give thanks if its claws, absent-minded, release me into
some weed patch of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vassar Miller's poetry is direct, clear and tautly composed,
with depths that are immediately accessible,'' a Houston Chronicle
reviewer wrote in 1991. ``Her subjects are the same ones that keep
most people searching beyond and beneath the surfaces of their
daily lives; love, life, emotions and the unfilled longings of the
disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller was born in Houston's museum district. She lived in
the same house for most of her life, until increasing infirmity and
poverty caused guardians to move her into a nearby nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   She was born with cerebral palsy and always had great difficulty
walking and talking. (Late in life she also lost the use of her
hands, and she told an interviewer that her dream was to obtain a
voice-activated computer so she could continue writing.)
</P>
<P>
   Her stepmother encouraged her to learn to read and write, and
urged her to attend public school, and her father led her to
creative writing by teaching her to type. Ms. Miller eventually
received degrees from the University of Houston and taught creative
writing at the University of St. Thomas, near her home.
</P>
<P>
   She was a familiar figure on the streets of the museum district,
going from home to church to classes in her motorized cart.
``Sometimes it would tip over and she would laugh,'' Helen Havens,
a rector at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, which Ms. Miller
attended for many years, told The Houston Chronicle in 1995. ``She
had this raucous laughter. When she'd fall down walking, she'd say,
`Don't help me. I can do it myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller is survived by two sisters, Joy Morton and Margaret
Schomer, both of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when her trust fund had been depleted, friends in
Houston held three fund-raisers for her. But guardians said that
she required full-time care and there was insufficient money to
care for her at home, so she stayed at a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   She told an interviewer around that time that she felt her
poetry would be best remembered for its metaphors, and she listed
Bach oratorios and chocolate ice cream among her joys in life.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe the meaning of her life, Ms. Miller said: ``To
write. And to serve God.''

MADISON SQUARE PARK TO REGAIN ITS 19TH-CENTURY LUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drug dealers used to ply their trade openly there.
And homeless people took up residence. But thanks to a police
crackdown, those problems have abated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Madison Square Park, a 6.2-acre swath of land between
23rd and 26th Streets, stretching from Madison Avenue to Broadway
in Manhattan, is a far cry from the verdant gem it was in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Its asphalt is cracked. Its irrigation is poor. There are
missing benches, broken fences and poor landscaping. There's more
dirt than green even in warmer seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But all that may soon change. The City Parks Foundation, a
nonprofit organization that raises private funds to restore parks
and to run park programs, collected $2.5 million to restore the
park. That amount was matched by the city, with $1 million coming
from the mayor's budget, $1 million from the City Council and
$500,000 from the Manhattan borough president's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to restore the park to its former majesty,'' said
Timothy Marshall, the project manager for the renovation and the
former deputy administrator of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   As he and Debbie Landau, executive director of the City Parks
Foundation, strolled through the park on Friday, they rattled off
facts about it and the surrounding neighborhood: The park is 150
years old. It was built by Frederick Law Olmsted's assistant,
Ignatz Pilat. Before it was a park, it was home to an arsenal,
barracks and potter's field.
</P>
<P>
   Named for President James Madison, it has one of the largest
collections of public art _ eight monuments and statues _ of any
park its size. The hand and torch of the Statue of Liberty were on
display there in an effort to raise money for the base of the
Statue. There are over 200 trees.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood was once one of the city's most vibrant areas,
a home to major hotels. Lady's Mile was visible from the park.
Madison Square Garden was located there until 1925. Today,
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York Life (both corporate
sponsors of the restoration) and major toy companies line the edges
of the park. New York Life donated $420,000, and Met Life,
$1,415,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer of Met
Life, said contributing to the park was not a difficult decision
since the company's buildings are on the perimeter of the park.
``The key was getting our neighbors to do the same,'' he said.
``The park was gorgeous when Madison Square Garden was here. We
want to make sure it looks beautiful because we have a large number
of associates, customers and tenants coming into our buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In warm temperatures, employees from the toy and insurance
companies use the park, as do neighborhood residents, particularly
dog owners. ``It's one of the most used dog runs in the city,''
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Meyer, who co-owns the Union Square Cafe and Gramercy
Tavern, donated $60,000 to the park's renovation. He recently
opened a restaurant which overlooks Madison Square Park, and is
about to open another. The restaurant, Eleven Madison Park,
features photographs depicting the history of the park and the
surrounding neighborhood. In two to three weeks, Meyer plans to
open another restaurant, called Tabla. It, too, will have a park
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason for Eleven Madison Park is to rekindle the
celebratory spirit and hospitality that the area had 100 years
ago,'' he said. ``The park is part of our decor, part of our
ambience. I can't understand why any commercial or residential
building would not want to invest in the park, since it's our front
yard. We want to take a page out of the Bryant Park playbook.''
After that park in midtown was cleaned up and landscaped, he said,
``it became the heart of the community's revival.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and Ms. Landau envision a European-style park, with
ornate lampposts, decorative plantings, old-fashioned benches, new
signs on the perimeter, a renovated fountain on the south end and
perhaps a new fountain on the the north end. (``Water helps drown
out urban noise,'' Marshall said.)
</P>
<P>
   The statues, including Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Admiral Farragut,
will be cleaned and waxed. The maintenance station, currently an
eyesore on the south end, will be moved underground. The corner of
23rd Street and Madison Avenue is expected to be transformed from a
motorcycle parking lot into a formal entrance to the park, adding
about a third of an acre of parkland, and squaring the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park will be superior to nearby Gramercy Park,'' said
Henry Stern, the city parks commissioner, referring to a private
park open to residents of certain buildings. ``And it will be open
to the public. There are bright days ahead for Madison Square
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Parks Foundation will embark on a campaign to raise $1
million dollars for maintenance of the park, as well as a
$5-million endowment. ``We don't want to be in a position of build
and decline, build and decline,'' Ms. Landau said.

D'AMATO'S MISSTEPS PAVED WAY FOR SCHUMER BULLDOZER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO and ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen days before Election Day, Charles Schumer's
campaign manager learned of a story that would appear in the next
day's issue of The Jewish Week: Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, in a private
meeting with supporters, had described Schumer with a Yiddish
vulgarism and mocked another lawmaker from New York City for being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a Republican, was holding a news conference later that
afternoon, so the Schumer campaign had to act fast. Working out of
Schumer's messy suite of offices on West 52nd Street, aides to
Schumer, the Democratic challenger, paged reporters who were on
their way to D'Amato's news conference, informed them of the story
and pressed them to ask the senator about the reported slur.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato never knew what hit him. As his aides watched in
helpless disbelief, the question suggested by Schumer's aides
instantly eclipsed an appearance intended to highlight D'Amato's
efforts to win federal funds for breast cancer research and to
attack Schumer for missing votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When Schumer's campaign manager, Josh Isay, and his media
consultant, Hank Morris, met for dinner that night, they saw the
second product of their work on the television news: D'Amato,
halting and defensive, denying a remark he would later admit having
made. Morris and Isay, who had run a campaign based largely on
portraying D'Amato as a liar, decided over grilled fish and white
wine to turn the New York 1 News clip into an advertisement by the
next night.
</P>
<P>
   A number of forces accounted for Schumer's upset of D'Amato last
week. Democrats mounted their best get-out-the-vote operation in 10
years. Nationally, Republicans framed this year's elections as a
referendum on President Clinton's behavior, the last thing D'Amato
wanted in a state where Clinton is popular.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and abortion rights advocates invested heavily
in an attempt to unseat a senator they had long seen as hostile to
their causes. Schumer had proven himself to be a dogged
fund-raiser, while D'Amato entered the race with the burden of
having served 18 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, an equally important explanation for Schumer's
success in unseating a Republican fixture can be found in the
contrasting bearings of the campaigns that day.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this was a contest between a sharp and aggressive
Democratic candidate backed by a crisp and sometimes ruthless
campaign team challenging a three-term senator who often seemed a
step off his game, and who was backed by an apparently distracted
campaign organization that often seemed to be relying on an old
political script.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer adopted a campaign theme _ ``Too many lies for too
long'' _ the day after he won the primary, and stuck to it until he
declared victory. While there were days when his campaign seemed
beleaguered, particularly during the long stretch when D'Amato
attacked him for missing votes, he never made a serious misstep.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, D'Amato moved unsurely from attack to attack to
attack until the final hours, when he was saying that voters should
re-elect him so he could run for a fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign was run by a tight and intense group _
primarily Morris, Isay and Schumer _ who were almost obsessively
preoccupied with anticipating and addressing every development. (A
perpetually nervous Isay raced over to Elaine's restaurant late one
night so he could win personal assurances that former Police
Commissioner William Bratton, who is known to spend many evenings
there, would go to an endorsement news conference the next
morning.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the people who had made up D'Amato's political
brain trust for the last 20 years were scattered for most of this
campaign season. Zenia Mucha was running the campaign of Gov.
George Pataki, while Arthur Finkelstein was shuttling between New
York and North Carolina, where he was advising Sen. Lauch Faircloth
in his own unsuccessful re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of October, when D'Amato's future in the Senate
appeared to be in serious doubt, D'Amato's associates were joking
darkly about the phone calls that were coming in from other
Finkelstein clients.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, D'Amato never seemed to be quite the
indefatigable political puncher that New Yorkers have long known.
His campaign aides made a tactical decision, over the objection of
many of D'Amato's friends, to keep him off the public stump and out
of his commercials. And when he appeared in public, he was usually
escorted by some more popular politician _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
one day, Pataki the next _ which often seemed to diminish the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was a terrible campaign,'' said Edward Koch, the
former mayor and perhaps D'Amato's most prominent and loyal
supporter. ``There is nothing wrong with negative campaigns, but
they must (a) be true and (b) be a minor part of a campaign that is
overwhelmingly positive about the candidate himself. Here it was
all negative. I thought that was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, D'Amato had assured worried friends in the
Senate that Schumer would be an easy opponent. In the days after
the Democratic primary, his aides said privately that they had
considered Schumer _ a liberal Jewish Democrat from Brooklyn with a
20-year voting record to examine _ a far easier mark than his main
rival for the Democratic nomination, Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of business on the Monday before Election Day,
after a campaign in which D'Amato had outspent Schumer by almost 2
to 1, it was the Democratic challenger who was flush with
excitement, dancing at a rally with Hillary Rodham Clinton in
Manhattan. At 5 p.m. that day, Schumer impulsively ordered his
campaign plane into the air for one more rally in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time on Long Island, D'Amato had just given up
speaking at a rally after a discouraging 15 minutes in which two
sound systems set up by the political machine that produced him had
given out. As Schumer headed for Buffalo, D'Amato called it a day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Challenger Adopts an Effective Strategy
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks before Election Day, Morris was in a television
production studio on West 43rd Street. That day, Democrats across
New York were choosing D'Amato's challenger. But Morris, who at 45
is the most active political consultant in the state _ and is known
for appearing at even black-tie events wearing a rumpled sweater _
was producing advertisements for the general campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements that went on the air two days later offered
the first clue that D'Amato was in for a different kind of
challenge. Brash and counterintuitive, they portrayed D'Amato as
soft on crime and as an advocate of higher taxes, turning a
traditional D'Amato attack against him. They ended with the line,
``Too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme had been settled on two weeks earlier, by which time
Schumer and his advisers had concluded that his victory in the
Democratic primary was assured. But in tone and sweep, the
advertisements were the product of the two years Schumer had spent
studying D'Amato's previous campaigns and the attitudes of voters
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flicker of apprehension among some of Schumer's
aides when Morris suggested building a campaign around a slogan
describing New York's leading Republican as a liar. Morris
halfheartedly suggested a softer alternative _ ``too wrong for too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ``too many lies'' theme played directly to what the
Schumer campaign had concluded were two of D'Amato's biggest
liabilities: Voters didn't trust him and thought he had been in
office too long.
</P>
<P>
   It was also designed as a broad pre-emptive defense against any
attack D'Amato might make. And it telegraphed to audiences who were
skeptical that Schumer could beat D'Amato _ financial contributors,
Democratic workers, the media and, of course, D'Amato _ the tenor
of the campaign Schumer intended to run.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's research had found that many voters admired D'Amato's
bracing political style, and he set out to co-opt it. ``If you ask
people what kind of vehicle he reminded them of, the people who
don't like him say `a Cadillac' or `a Lincoln,''' said Morris,
referring to D'Amato. ``People who do like him _ and the swing
voters _ said `a bulldozer.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Schumer set out to be a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude permeated the Schumer campaign. At his Manhattan
headquarters, Schumer's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, would
repeatedly cite a line from the movie ``The Untouchables'' in
rallying the troops. ``If he uses a fist, you use a bat,'' Wolfson
said each day. ``If he uses a knife, you use a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the second of the two senatorial debates, Isay asked Mark
Green, the city's public advocate and D'Amato's most persistent
foe, to come to the WNBC studios and stand in D'Amato's line of
vision, hoping to rattle him.
</P>
<P>
   There were bad moments. Schumer's campaign was flummoxed when
D'Amato began assailing him for missing votes in Congress to run
for the Senate. It affected the mood in both camps. D'Amato and his
advisers went from listless to ebullient as Schumer's aides were
forced daily to respond to the missed votes cited by D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer's aides asserted that they were not worried about
the attacks, other Democrats observed that the campaign was no
longer about D'Amato's record and credibility; it was now about
Schumer's behavior in Congress. Some of Schumer's friends began to
worry that D'Amato had again found the hook with which to drag down
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That concern faded on the morning when Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the
Manhattan Democrat whom D'Amato had mocked as overweight, called
Isay and informed him of the story that was about to appear in The
Jewish Week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An Incumbent's Gaffe Leads to Self-Doubt
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato and his campaign first tried to shrug off the report of
the Yiddish slur and his subsequent denial of it, responding to
every question with another attack on Schumer's attendance record.
But inside the campaign's offices on Lexington Avenue, D'Amato's
aides were shaken by what almost everyone believed was a massive
misstep.
</P>
<P>
   And no one knew it better than the candidate himself. D'Amato,
an instinctive and self-assured campaigner, began chiding himself.
``Alfonse was stunned, and there are very few times I've seen
that,'' said one associate, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's wave of self-doubt, and the growing concern among some
of his advisers that he might lose this race, led him to push
himself even harder. His efforts put a strain on his 61-year-old
body, and fatigue began to set in. Several of D'Amato's advisers
said they thought it showed in his first debate with Schumer, on
Oct. 24, when he looked coiled, defensive and programmed, answering
almost every question with a scripted attack on Schumer's
attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   As the atmosphere darkened, some of D'Amato's advisers began to
complain that Finkelstein was spending too much time on other
campaigns. A bald, incessantly rumpled man whose knife-edged
commercials belie a genial personality, Finkelstein had always been
the calming force within D'Amato's campaigns. D'Amato missed his
presence and began leaning more heavily on longtime friends and
advisers like Ms. Mucha.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha quietly shifted her attention from Pataki's
re-election campaign to D'Amato's. But it was too late. As he
struggled to find his balance in the last weeks of the race, his
campaign was wrought by bickering between Republican Party leaders
and his senior staff members: Finkelstein, Kieran Mahoney and Jon
Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party officials complained that Finkelstein and
Mahoney, who have historically relied almost entirely on television
advertising to win races, had, out of a budget of $20 million, set
aside only $200,000 for getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The effect became clear in the final week of the campaign: The
campaign buttons, lawn signs and mailings that normally remind
voters that an election is at hand were largely absent. Even
Schumer, campaigning on Long Island, pointed out to reporters how
few D'Amato signs he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer had expected that D'Amato's endgame would focus on his
stature as a member of the Senate majority and on his ability to
deliver for the state. But D'Amato remained in attack mode.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, even a fatigued D'Amato seemed concerned about the
tenor of his campaign. During a tour of upstate New York, he began
picking out people in the crowd whom his office had helped, among
them a woman whose ex-husband had taken her children away.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, as D'Amato settled into the seat of his
chartered jet, he turned to Pataki and spoke proudly of that
moment. ``We should have made a commercial out of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But they never did.
</P>
<P>
   A basic political error pulled the last string out of D'Amato's
campaign. Eight days before Election Day, Schumer's advisers
learned that The Village Voice was about to publish an article
showing that as a Nassau County official running for the Senate in
1980, D'Amato had done exactly what he was accusing Schumer of
doing: ignored his legislative duties to run for office. Schumer's
advisers instantly alerted other reporters.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's senior aides were caught completely off guard by the
disclosure, and other Republicans expressed astonishment that
D'Amato could have made such a fundamental mistake. ``The winds
have been let out of the sails,'' a senior elected Republican
official said sadly at one of D'Amato's campaign events the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   On the last Sunday of his fourth campaign for the Senate,
D'Amato, looking spent and worried, spent barely 20 minutes
speaking in public. One of those appearances was at a rally among
Orthodox Jews in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   A year before, at the same site but on a colder, rainy
afternoon, thousands of people had filled the street, screaming in
excitement as Giuliani appeared for his own post-election rally.
They cheered the Republican mayor's every word and mobbed him as he
walked down the street.
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday, the Republican senator spoke for four minutes
and headed for his car. The crowd _ D'Amato's crowd _ applauded
politely, if briefly, and scattered into the dusk.

REAL ESTATE: BRIDGEPORT TURNS TO WATERFRONT TO SPUR ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ After more than 30 years of grinding
depression, failed attempts at urban renewal and dashed hopes for a
casino, Bridgeport is now reclaiming its decaying waterfront in an
effort to stimulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is replacing deteriorated industrial buildings and
substandard housing with Harbour Place, a $1-billion,
3-million-square-foot commercial and retail project designed to
attract tourists and generate economic activity in the surrounding
area.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the public's affinity for the sea and maritime
environments, as demonstrated in the success of waterfront
developments in Portland, Maine, Portsmouth, N.H., Boston and
Baltimore _ as well as Norwalk _ the city began acquiring 38
properties for the first 30-acre phase of the project last June.
Demolition of existing buildings and relocation of residential and
commercial owners and tenants is expected to be completed in
December. Completion of the entire project could take 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a 52-acre peninsula bounded by Interstate 95, the
Pequonnock River, Yellow Mill Pond and Bridgeport Harbor. It is
just across the Stratford Avenue bridge from downtown. ``This will
be a huge boon for the city,'' said Joseph P. Ganim, Bridgeport's
mayor since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of Harbour Place will be a 1.3 million square
foot retail mall with restaurants, a 20-screen movie theater and a
large-screen IMAX theater. Construction is expected to begin in
about 18 months and an opening is planned for the fall of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the site would include an Early American ``village''
with restaurants, shops, a fishing pier, a waterside esplanade, a
400-room hotel and conference center next to a 250-hotel, a
maritime museum and amphitheater, a fitness and wellness center and
a 6,500-space parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities envisioned at the shoreline or in the water include a
marina, a ocean liner converted to a hotel, restaurant and
nightclub, cruise ships, water taxis, a high-speed passenger ferry
service to Manhattan and La Guardia airport and, possibly, two
office buildings with parking for an additional 3,000 cars and a
helicopter pad.
</P>
<P>
   The plans, submitted by the Conroy Development Co. of Greenwich,
won the city's approval over two other short-list competitors
``because of its scope and magnitude,'' said Ganim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought together a variety of destination uses that would
make Bridgeport a point of first interest along the coast from
Boston to Washington,'' said Alexius C. Conroy, founder and
president of the 13-year-old company. The rival companies on the
short list were Hines Interests Limited Partnership of Stamford and
Bridgeport Maritime Partners, a joint venture of Collins
Enterprises of Greenwich and Dames, Moore &AMP; Brookhill, a Manhattan
developer.
</P>
<P>
   Partial financing for Harbour Place will come from a $448
million package approved this year by the state legislature for
projects in Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport. Bridgeport will get
$130 million of that package, plus a state grant of $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to start some entrepreneurship which would uplift
depressed areas in cities that are trying to turn themselves
around,'' said state Sen. Alvin Penn, a Bridgeport Democrat who is
chairman of the bonding committee.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Freimuth, director of Bridgeport's Planning and Economic
Development office, said the city would also issue $50 million in
general obligation bonds. As the project moves forward property
taxes of an estimated $10 million to $15 million a year will be
committed to paying off the bonds. Marginal properties on the site
now ``bring in less than $1 million a year,'' said Freimuth.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $700 million is to be raised privately by the
Conroy organization and its partner, Lend Lease of Atlanta, an
international real estate and money-managing firm with a regional
office in Manhattan. At present, said Gamin, ``the work is moving
along at an appropriate pace.'' And indeed, the few remaining
stumbling blocks seem surmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Eight appeals from landowners dissatisfied with the city's terms
of property acquisition by eminent domain cannot by law halt the
taking of property. One lawsuit, filed last July by the century-old
Pequonnock Yacht Club to gain a stay on a city order to move, is
``in negotiation on a number of alternate sites,'' said Russell
Liskov, assistant city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Securing an ocean liner will depend in part on the viability of
dredging the harbor to accommodate such a vessel. Still open is the
question of how many ferry services the state can support. A new
task force on high-speed ferries is studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Three ferry services are currently operating, one from
Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, on Long Island, another from New
London to Orient Point, N.Y., and a summer service from Haddam to
Greenport and Sag Harbor, N.Y. But interest is high in Stamford,
Norwalk and New London in running passenger ferries to Manhattan
and the New York airports and to Glen Cove, N.Y., and possibly
other points on Long Island. And Captain's Cove, a 19-year-old
marina, entertainment and shopping complex west of Harbour Place,
has been developing plans for a service with Seaconn, a ferry
company in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Captain's Cove could lose business to Harbour Place, but Kaye
Williams, founder and owner of the popular 15-acre maritime
complex, doesn't think so. ``We're more of a no-nonsense,
boat-building, free-and-easy people place,'' he said. Two of its
main attractions are a reproduction of the 18th century British
frigate H.M.S. Rose and the Lightship Nantucket, both open for
tours.
</P>
<P>
   On an infinitely grander scale, Harbour Place is also ``heavily
involved in nautical and historical theming,'' said J. Thomas
Porter, senior principal at the architectural firm of Thompson,
Ventulett, Stainback &AMP; Associates of Atlanta, designers of the
project. ``We are planning a large signature lighthouse on the
point _ possibly as a restaurant and observation tower.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the water, he added, the village of individual shops,
restaurants and the fishing pier would be built of wood, recalling
the city's early history. The mall will be contemporary but with
nautical references in lighting fixtures, decorative accents,
directories resembling treasure maps and identification plaques
resembling those on ships.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, like most people in Bridgeport, feels Harbour
Place ``will open up the city _ bring more people in,'' he said.
Just as he benefited from the new baseball park at Harbor Yard, he
hopes to profit from the Harbour Place overflow. Still, haunted by
the city's decades-old identity crisis, he added: ``Thank God
Bridgeport's smokestacks are gone, but there's still a smokestack
mentality out there.''

</P>
<P>
   Outsiders driving in on I-95 may admire the People's Bank
building, but once past that all they see is power plants, rundown
factories, dilapidated housing and mean streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnpike goes through the worst part of the city, giving
people the wrong impression,'' said Charles Brilvitch, the city
historian. ``It's a common misconception that Bridgeport is not on
its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's decline from industrial powerhouse to rudderless city
brought it close to bankruptcy in 1991. By 1995 it had a $4 million
surplus but was still searching for an identity. Its development as
a tourist attraction would be a third incarnation since the late
18th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harbour Place is to be built where a steel mill once stood,
giving the peninsula the name of Steel Point,'' said Brilvitch.
``Before the big industries came this was a major seaport. When the
Hudson River froze the goods that came east on the Erie Canal came
down through Bridgeport. Farmers brought their cornmeal and cider
brandy here, traded it for factory goods and shipped it to New York
and the West Indies. There was even a whaling fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Rock Harbor on the west side was a shipbuilding port, and
Bridgeport Harbor was a prime location for clamming, duck hunting,
and oystering. Talmadge Brothers, one of Connecticut's largest
oyster companies, is now one of the properties to be moved off the
Harbour Place site.
</P>
<P>
   Jose E. Rivera, Jr., his wife, Grace, and young sons, Jose III
and Hector Luis, must also move. Their house at 23-29 Pierpont
Street was condemned by the city. ``The closing is on Nov. 22,''
said Rivera, ``and we have no place to go yet.'' Surrounding him
are other condemned houses and a scrap yard.
</P>
<P>
   People like the Riveras, who are facing displacement, and
Brilvitch who lives elsewhere in Bridgeport, are among the few city
residents who are not pleased with what is happening at Steel
Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have restored the old oyster sheds, wharves, and
houses,'' said Brilvitch, ``but this city has a monumental aversion
to historic preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year's agenda for Harbour Place lists more land assembly
and clearance, relocations, environmental remediation, design and
engineering work, dredging, bulkhead construction and street
alignment.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after a few years, Conroy believes Bridgeport will
become a viable new venue for office construction because of
``Stamford's constricted labor and real estate market.''

 &HT;    History's hard knocks
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Newt Gingrich's recent drive for re-election,
one of his campaign buttons proclaimed membership in ``Newt's Army
to Save America.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular handout was a postcard of Gingrich and his wife,
Marianne _ he in a dark suit, she in a bright red dress.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was running to retain his seat in Georgia's 6th
Congressional District, Gingrich gave the impression that he had
something larger in mind.
</P>
<P>
   His staff, in fact, was studying the logistics of getting him on
presidential primary ballots even in the face of polls that
consistently showed Gingrich to be unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   At one point this year, Gingrich boosters floated a fantastic
scenario: Gingrich, the third-ranking constitutional officer, would
ascend to the presidency after scandal forced both President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore from office.
</P>
<P>
   It is by now well understood that Gingrich dreams big dreams and
sees himself, as he put it in 1994, as a ``transformational
figure.'' His critics say the dreams are frequently the product of
his hubris, which too often gets the better of his keen intellect.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics must also acknowledge that Gingrich has
prevailed against the odds more often than most politicians.
Polarizing and partisan, he also won.
</P>
<P>
   He has been knocked down and written off almost as often as
Clinton, the Democrat who is similar to Gingrich in so many ways
and whose fortunes seem to rise as Gingrich's fall, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has confounded his political enemies with his ability
to rise from the ashes of his setbacks. It is tempting to proclaim
the end of Gingrich's political life after Friday's shocking news
that he will step down as speaker and resign his seat, maybe as
early as January.
</P>
<P>
   Less confrontation
</P>
<P>
   But a safer course may be simply to declare an end to a
tumultuous political era in Washington that Gingrich has helped
define more than any one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go down as one of the most important speakers in
history,'' said Randall Strahan, an Emory University professor who
is at work on a book about Gingrich and other influential speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich elevated the office to ``at one point being the equal
of the president's,'' Strahan said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he continued, ``The part of the office that he never really
mastered is governing.''
</P>
<P>
   The denouement came more quickly than anyone expected, and it
was rich with irony. The conservative firebrands Gingrich helped
sweep into office in the Republican Revolution of 1994 were the
leaders of the move to dump him as speaker. These impatient novices
often seemed to Gingrich to be remarkably similar to himself when
he entered the House in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana used his prominence as House
Appropriations Committee chairman to launch a challenge to Gingrich
on Friday, hours before the speaker made his stunning announcement.
Livingston rose to chairman only because Gingrich picked him over
more senior Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president offered his congratulations to a ``worthy
adversary,'' just days after an election in which a Republican
victory would have been taken as a signal to ratchet up impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was factually correct to insist that he had led the
only Republican team since before the Great Depression to win three
successive majorities in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, however, was hollow to many Republicans who saw
their hopes of big gains slip away amid a poorly defined campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich found no grateful throng of Republicans hailing him and
little willingness to give him another chance to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Career of close calls
</P>
<P>
   There have been many narrow escapes and second chances in
Gingrich's political lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The shaggy-haired history professor at West Georgia College lost
his first two races for Congress, running first in the wake of
Watergate and then with Jimmy Carter at the top of the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But when he won on the third try in 1978, he immediately set
about making himself known, even at the cost of annoying his
party's elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of more senior Republicans who had grown
very, very comfortable with the way things were,'' said Rich Galen,
a longtime Gingrich aide.
</P>
<P>
   The cable television broadcast of the House of Representatives
on C-Span gave Gingrich his first national exposure. He and other
junior Republicans railed against the Democratic majority in
lengthy speeches to an empty House chamber, delighting the small
audience of Republican activists watching at home.
</P>
<P>
   Tip O'Neill, a Democrat who was then speaker, ordered the camera
operators to pan the deserted House floor in an effort to ridicule
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neill gave way to Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, Gingrich
launched an ethics crusade, which won him the undying enmity of
Democrats. Gingrich almost single-handedly forced Wright from the
House in 1989 over questions about a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled his career on the Wright case and it propelled him
into the Republican leadership, using the support of other young
Republicans to beat out a more senior colleague for the job of
Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was as comfortable taking on President Bush over the
1990 budget agreement to raise taxes as he was attacking Democrats,
glibly bashing whoever happened to be in his way.
</P>
<P>
   He left no doubt that his goal was to become speaker of the
House, a laughable notion perhaps in an era of comfortable
Democratic majorities and Republican leaders who did not see the
urgency as Gingrich did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to change Washington, to change the federal
government _ not to be a participant in sharing the spoils of the
current system,'' he said in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, however, Gingrich eked out a 984-vote win over
Democrat David Worley in the old 6th Congressional District, south
and west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Worley attacked Gingrich for supporting a pay hike for House
members, a vote incidentally that also riled his conservative
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But national Democratic leaders did not aggressively support
Worley because they had previously agreed not to make the salary
increase, which they also backed, a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mellowing of Newt'' was a headline in this newspaper a few
months after his close call in the 1990 election.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on that theme would pop up with some regularity in
the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich dutifully campaigned for Bush in 1992, but he was far
less distressed than many Republicans, who feared Clinton's
election would relegate them to obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   A telegenic, moderate southern Democrat was the GOP's worst
nightmare, in appearance and outlook the antithesis of someone like
O'Neill, the cigar-smoking, beefy Massachusetts pol.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's election liberated House Republicans from the
constraints of having to pledge fealty to a Republican White House,
even when it compromised with the Democratic Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton's missteps on health care and other issues
played a large role in the Republican takeover of Congress in the
1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich was free to campaign in a way he and other
Republicans were not in 1992. They set the agenda and it reflected
their priorities, not those of some other Republican who needed to
reach out.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's ups and downs had been well-chronicled locally. But
in the weeks before the election, he and his Contract with America
were unknown to the majority of the country. Election night changed
that forever.
</P>
<P>
   He was up, Clinton was down. Gingrich became the first
Republican speaker in 40 years and led a 100-day charge to pass
most provisions of the Contract in the House, including a balanced
budget bill and welfare reform. Clinton, stung by the election
results, meanwhile wondered about his own relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Problems crept up. He encountered resistance to a $4.5 million,
two-book deal with Rupert Murdoch-owned HarperCollins. He quickly
renounced the money, but the House ethics committee set strict
guidelines for how he could promote the books and pay his expenses.
</P>
<P>
   An ethics complaint filed by Ben Jones, a former congressman
from Georgia who ran against Gingrich in 1994, alleged that the
speaker improperly financed the college course he taught on
Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Gingrich basked in the national spotlight. When he
went to New Hampshire in 1995 to look at moose, the national press
corps followed. Gingrich was everywhere -- on the cover of Time, in
daily televised press briefings -- and his staff did little to
discourage talk of a presidential run in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics Problems
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of Gingrich's downfall as speaker can perhaps be found
in his presidential ambitions. As long as Gingrich's single-minded
goal was a Republican majority in the House, he was willing to be
as caustic and uncompromising as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich the bomb-thrower was the darling of conservatives who
banished their doubts about their leader's commitment to their
principles.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich as the leader of the House, and with an eye on a
broader public following, learned the hard way that governing was a
lot harder, and it required compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's minions stood with him in 1995 when a budget standoff
with Clinton resulted in the partial shutdown of the federal
government. Gingrich eventually relented in the face of
overwhelming public criticism of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives in Congress were angry that Gingrich had given
in.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker compounded the problem by complaining about having
to exit the back of Air Force One when the U.S. delegation returned
from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. The New York
Daily News ran its memorable ``Crybaby'' headline with a cartoon of
Gingrich in diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were emboldened by Gingrich's missteps and
</P>
<P>
   made the speaker the focus of the 1996 campaign. He was still
everywhere, but now Gingrich's face was appearing in Democratic
television ads warning of Republican extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was up, easily winning re-election. Gingrich was down
after the Republicans lost seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Things soon got worse.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics investigation produced a bi-partisan consensus on the
ethics committee that Gingrich had indeed violated House rules.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers worked out a deal that would give him another chance
and another term as speaker. He would admit to providing inaccurate
information to the committee and agree to a $300,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Second Term
</P>
<P>
   Nine Republicans chose not to support Gingrich for speaker in
January 1997, but he retained enough support to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened, he accepted the speaker's gavel followed later that
month by his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of 1997 was a mess for House Republicans.
Gingrich licked his wounds, while his narrow majority wandered from
issue to issue with no real plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich team's worst mistake was its opposition to a
disaster relief bill for Midwestern flood victims. Members of the
freshman class of 1994 plotted to depose Gingrich and enlisted the
support of some of the speaker's most trusted allies.
</P>
<P>
   The coup ultimately failed amid recriminations by House Majority
Leader Richard Armey of Texas and Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
Gingrich survived, mainly because moderates in the House could not
abide replacing Gingrich with a more conservative speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Six solid months of depressing news gave way to the signal
accomplishment of the 105th Congress, a balanced budget deal and
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement had overwhelming bi-partisan support, though
conservatives grumbled again about spending provisions.
</P>
<P>
   A slimmed-down Gingrich had re-emerged as a less partisan
figure, triumphant over the enactment of a major provision of the
Contract with America. Another item, welfare reform, had become law
in the midst of the presidential campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Gingrich returned to the lecture circuit, preaching
cooperation with the White House and relying more and more on
Republican moderates in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with Clinton, against most congressional Democrats, in
a failed effort to get the president broad authority to negotiate
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how 1998 would have gone had the nation not been
rocked by news of an alleged affair between the president and a
White House intern?
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich urged caution and patience. He promoted his new book,
Lessons Learned the Hard Way, which offered a more human side of
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Stops in key presidential primary states became commonplace.
Gingrich set a Labor Day 1999 deadline to make up his mind about a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton early this year appeared to have been through
the worst of the allegations -- months before his grand jury
testimony and admission of ``inappropriate behavior -- Gingrich
broke from his judicious appraisal of the situation and began
lambasting the administration for a pattern of corrupt behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers in New Hampshire walked out of Gingrich's
talk to that state's legislature in protest of the speaker's
references to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives applauded but some Republicans feared a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the Clinton-bashing from his speeches just as
abruptly. At the time, his advisors said he had accomplished his
goal of refocusing attention on the White House's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich struggled the rest of the year to strike the right
balance. When independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent his report to
Congress, Gingrich pressed for its release with all its tawdry
details.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself at one point told a closed-door meeting of
Republicans to stop talking about sex and start talking about
``crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee began an impeachment inquiry with
Gingrich leading Republicans in a pledge to do their constitutional
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the final days of the campaign, Republicans ran
television ads invoking the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a clear message, the GOP lost another five seats in the
House last week. Gingrich admitted he had misjudged public reaction
to Clinton's problems and took responsibility for the poor showing
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich has never tiptoed away from anything in his life.
It would be surprising to see that change now.
</P>
<P>
   How dramatic would his final days as presiding officer of the
House be, then, if his last official act was to gavel down a vote
on articles of impeachment against the president.

 &HT;    Livingston letter spelled the end of speakership
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For days House Speaker Newt Gingrich endured a rash
of criticism for the Republican losses on Election Day, but perhaps
nothing hit him harder than a letter that came from his trusted
protege Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.).
</P>
<P>
   In a four-page letter, Livingston, known for his fiery temper,
demanded that Gingrich relinquish complete control of the
money-doling Appropriations Committee to him. The tersely written
letter suggests that Gingrich had lost control of the Republican
Conference and a structure was needed to regain confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the majority to complete its work and demonstrate
that we can properly govern, I believe it imperative that you
acknowledge and agree to these suggested changes in house
procedure,'' Livingston wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Such demands on the speaker of the House are highly unusual and
widely considered an affront, akin to a middle manager telling the
CEO of a company how to run it. More importantly, the letter
reveals how icy the relationship between the two friends had become
and it offers a glimpse at the disciplined fashion in which
Livingston operates.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gingrich who plucked Livingston out of the pack to be the
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, leap-frogging him over
several more senior members of the blue chip committee.
</P>
<P>
   And in January 1997, when Gingrich became the first speaker to
be punished for violating House rules, Livingston was one of the
trusted inner circle that he reached out to for advice. It was
through the support of lawmakers like Livingston that Gingrich was
able to overcome the group of nine who opposed him as speaker and
who openly called him ``road kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship was not just political, as so many are out of
necessity in Washington, but personal. It goes back to Gingrich's
plans to lead the GOP out of the so-called ``wilderness,'' to take
over Congress. Last year, when Livingston contemplated leaving
Congress, it was Gingrich who persuaded him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   When the letter arrived, it was a surprise to Gingrich. The two
conferred, and Livingston retracted the letter by noon on Friday. A
few hours later, he announced that he would run against Gingrich
for speaker of the house. A few hours after that, Gingrich stunned
Washington when he announced he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolutionizing takes some talents _ many talents,'' said
Livingston, making his bid for the speakership. ``My friend Newt
Gingrich brought those talents to bear and put the Republicans in
the majority. Day-to-day governing takes others. I believe I have
those talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been silent on the letter and oblique about what he
thinks about Livingston's bid. It was no secret on Capitol Hill
that Livingston hoped to replace Gingrich, but he had hoped to do
it with his blessing. Whether such a blessing would be offered
after Gingrich received such a letter is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Livingston asserts that as the chairman of the
appropriations committee he would be given the full responsibility
to ``run the committee as I see fit and in the best interest of the
Republican majority, but without being subject to the dictates of
any other Member of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that would appear to directly address the problem
of Gingrich interfering with the will of his committee chairman, a
complaint that has been often heard on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The letter indirectly refers to the narrowly averted budget
fiasco where the House stayed in session several weeks past its
departure date because of feuding over routine spending bills.
Livingston asks that Gingrich agree that ``all future budget
resolutions be completed for House approval between April 15 and
April 30 and that thereafter all Appropriations bills are free to
proceed with or without a Budget Resolutions, for completion in the
House of Representatives by the end of June of every calendar
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston continues to say that as the chairman of the
committee, he ``shall be present in all leadership discussions of
the budget affecting appropriations matters.'' And no decision on
appropriations issues would be made without consulting with him
first.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Livingston complains that the legislative
schedule is too short. ``We should have longer work weeks and fewer
holidays,'' he wrote. And he said that the GOP should meet with the
Democrats for an hour each week, a direct reference to the partisan
rancor that has developed between the two parties and the open
hostility that the leadership of each party has for the other.

 &HT;    Gingrich decides to `let a new team take over'
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich confirmed Saturday that he
will not return to Congress next term despite being overwhelmingly
re-elected by his district's voters just a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said it would weaken House Republicans if he remained
in office and it was more important to have a unified party than
for Georgia to keep its senior congressman _ and the clout that
brought federal funds and kept military bases open in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a practical matter for me to stay in the House
would make it impossible for a new leader,'' Gingrich said Saturday
afternoon in front of his east Cobb home. ``I think there comes a
time when you've got to step out and let a new team take over, let
a new team try to do the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich holed up in his house for most of the day. Television
news crews arrived early in the morning and gathered outside,
apparently annoying neighbors, until the speaker appeared to give a
brief statement in midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, said he was looking into the legalities of
vacating his seat after being re-elected Tuesday to the
conservative Sixth Congressional District for his 11th term. He
promised to work hard to elect a Republican in a special election
next year.
</P>
<P>
   He was noncommittal about his plans or presidential aspirations.
He took credit for helping bring about two of the pivotal political
events in the last 20 years _ the election of Ronald Reagan as
president and the collapse of the Soviet Union. After his brief
statement at the end of his driveway, he pivoted and walked briskly
back to the house as two Cobb County sheriff's deputies waited to
make sure no one followed.
</P>
<P>
   Just before his statement, the speaker hugged neighbor Lucia Roy
and thanked her for her kind telephone call and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick and tired of the whole thing,'' Roy said. Her
husband, Terrence, doubted Gingrich had much of a national
electoral future left. ``I don't think he'll ever get elected
because he talks too honest.

 &HT;    Ga. school chairman emerges as contender to replace Gingrich
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When news of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's abdication
hit the airwaves Friday evening, Georgia school board Chairman
Johnny Isakson was boarding an airplane for a convention in
California.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Isakson arrived, he was probably one of the few
people from the 6th Congressional District who hadn't heard the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to my hotel they said, `You must have a family
emergency, because you have a stack of phone messages,''' Isakson
said during a telephone interview Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was no illness in Isakson's family, only an outbreak of
political fever among Republicans wondering who might run for
Gingrich's seat. Much of the speculation centered on Isakson, one
of the most respected and best-known Republicans in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson said he is considering running for the seat, but won't
make up his mind until he returns to Atlanta early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a statement at the appropriate time,'' Isakson said.
``I would be in consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson wasn't the only Republican weighing a bid to replace
Gingrich over the weekend, but if he does decide to run, many
others might defer to him, predicted Matt Towery, a Gingrich
confidant and a former member of the state House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if Isakson gets in, no other credible Republican
candidate would consider it,'' said Towery, who squashed rumors
that he might seek the seat himself. ``I have no desire to ever be
in politics again.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Randy Sauder (R-Cobb) said he is considering a run
for the 6th District seat, but would probably stay out if Isakson
gets in. Sauder and Isakson talked by telephone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds more and more like'' Isakson will run, Sauder said.
``He's a Republican icon in Cobb County, and I have a great deal of
respsect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans being mentioned as possible candidates include
former state Sen. Charles Clay (R-Marietta), former Christian
Coalition head Jerry Keen of Roswell, and state Rep. Mitch Kaye
(R-East Cobb).
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expressed hope that former U.S. Rep. Buddy
Darden, who lives in Marietta, might run for the seat, but Darden
did little to stoke that rumor. ``I'm not going to think about it
right now,'' Darden said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich completes his current term and steps down before the
start of the 107th Congress, his resignation could take effect a
few days before Gov.-elect Roy Barnes takes over from Gov. Zell
Miller. Either Miller or Barnes would have to call a special
election to fill the two-year term that begins next year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor could decide the election will be partisan, which
would involve primaries for both parties, or nonpartisan, in which
all candidates would run in a primary together, and the top two
would meet in a runoff if nobody got a majority. Special elections
are usually nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Miller could not be reached for comment Saturday, and Barnes
noted that the decision about a special election might not be his
to make. If it is, Barnes said, ''I would talk to the secretary of
state and get cost estimates before I would make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a nonpartisan election is ordered, Democrats conceded
that Isakson would have the advantage because of his popularity in
the 6th District.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson has already represented parts of the district at the
state Capitol. He was the Republican leader in the state House
before making a run for governor in 1990, when he captured the GOP
nominatino but lost to Miller in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson then served two terms in the state Senate before running
for U.S. Senate in 1996, when he lost to businessman Guy Millner in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Miller tapped Isakson to head the state school
board illustrates that Isakson is well respected by Democrats as
well as Republicans.

REAL ESTATE: A CITY KNOWN FOR GAMBLING REINVENTS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (js) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ There was not a slot machine to be seen inside the
National Bowling Stadium, a cathedral of 78 lanes built three years
ago in the midst of this gambling town's aging avenues of neon. Nor
are any planned for the swath of construction that is expected
nearby in a depressed neighborhood of empty buildings straddling
the Truckee River.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with increasing competition from gambling on riverboats
and Indian reservations, Reno is trying to diversify the economic
engine that made the city's name recognized across the world. By
giving visitors and local residents more reasons to go downtown
than just to win a jackpot, officials here hope that the city's
center, now a bit tarnished, will regain its luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is all over the place now,'' said Jeff Griffin, mayor
of Reno, an otherwise prosperous city of 170,000 at the toe of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains. Until the '50s, it was the nation's
pre-eminent gambling destination, but it now ranks fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to just pull slot-machine handles,'' the mayor
observed, ``they don't need to come all the way to Reno. We had to
reinvent ourselves to broaden our appeal. We had to make
attractions that even our harshest critics _ our own citizens _
would like. We saw that downtown was deteriorating, so we had to
move aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few projects so far to come to fruition _ and
certainly the most ambitious _ is the National Bowling Stadium.
With 78 lanes in a vast hall that stretches longer than a football
field, merely calling the $55- million facility a bowling alley
would be misleading. It features a four-story atrium entrance, a
pro shop with its own alley, giant scoreboards and permanent
stadium seating for 750 spectators overlooking the lanes. It also
has a large-screen theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been called the Taj Mahal of bowling,'' said Jack Cook,
vice president of stadium operations. ``Bowling needed something
that was spectacular. What we have here is unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Though impressive, the stadium is not the world's largest
bowling facility. That distinction belongs to the one in the
Showboat casino in Las Vegas, which has 106 lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Reno-Sparks Convention &AMP; Visitors Authority, a local
government agency, built the stadium primarily to play host to the
world's two largest bowling tournaments. It was more of an economic
decision, financed by a 1 percent hotel room tax, than one inspired
by the love of sport.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bowling Congress and the Women's International
Bowling Congress _ both amateur events _ last five months each and
bring at least 90,000 competitors a year to Reno for two out of
every three years. Participants fill up hotel rooms, see shows _
and gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowlers are moderately good spenders,'' said Bill Eadington,
director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial
Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno. ``They're not high
rollers, but they are in town with all of the right motivations.
They often bring family and friends here for five or six days and
they come during a relatively slack period of the year from
February to June.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the tournaments had occasionally been held in Reno.
But by building the stadium, city officials made sure that the
events would continue to come to Reno on a rotating basis.
Contracts with the two tournament associations prohibit use of the
alleys by local leagues and visitors off the street. But management
is permitted to book corporate parties, professional tournaments
and smaller amateur events.
</P>
<P>
   During certain periods the stadium is virtually empty. At other
times there can be hundreds of competitors from across the nation
throwing strikes and picking up spares, as was the case recently
during a money tournament organized by the Amateur Bowlers Tour.
Among the bowlers was Marc Stern, a computer consultant from
Langhorne, Pa., who was visiting Reno for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting to take to the lanes, he said that the stadium
seemed so impressive during his first trip to the city two years
before that the prospect of playing there again made him want to
return. ``You can't even compare this place to where I bowl at
home,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   But the stadium's presence does not completely overshadow the
obvious blight elsewhere in downtown. To get a sense of it,
visitors need look no further than the famous arch across Virginia
Street that declares that Reno is the ``Biggest Little City in the
World.'' On one side of the sign's arc is the vacant Harold's Club
casino.
</P>
<P>
   The stagnation is at its worst along the banks of the Truckee
River, a five-minute walk south of the city's tourist strip of
newer hotels and souvenir shops. Pedestrians who pass this way get
an eyeful of empty office buildings and casinos.
</P>
<P>
   It is here where the city has pinned its downtown recovery. The
Reno Redevelopment Agency bought several deteriorating blocks along
the Truckee River for $11 million and is trying to market the
neighborhood as a future riverfront promenade of shops and
restaurants. People who want to gamble will have to go elsewhere in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in gaming generally is the emphasis on
visitors who gamble, not gamblers who visit,'' said Eadington, of
the University of Nevada. ``So there is a turn to creating other
entertainment possibilities.''

 RENO, Nev.: entertainment possibilities.''

<P>
   This month, after more than a decade of fits and starts, the
first riverwalk project got under way. Construction crews are
building a 12-screen cinema and shopping complex that officials
hope will be a catalyst for more construction nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery along the Truckee River has been slow going, in part
because most of the buildings date to before the 1950s. Efforts to
restore the empty casinos into modern gaming halls has been
particularly problematic since they are typically too cramped and
require too much work to bring them up to today's gaming standard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most likely rehabilitation projects is the Riverside
Hotel, a classical red brick building built in 1927 where,
according to historical lore, visitors such as Claire Booth Luce,
the diplomat and playwright whose husband was then George T.
Brokaw, and Gloria Vanderbilt, the fashion designer whose husband
was then Pat De Cicco, once rented rooms to establish residency for
one of Reno's famous quick divorces. The city has approved the
plans of the Oliver McMillan Co. of San Diego, in conjunction with
Artspace Projects of Minneapolis, to transform the building into
artists' lofts and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is the Mapes Hotel and Casino, an 11-story
Art Deco tower that was built in 1947 and has been empty for nearly
17 years. With the support of local preservationists, Oliver
McMillan, in a joint venture with QM Resorts of Sparks, Nev., has
submitted a plan to renovate the hotel into time-share units and
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rogers, senior vice president and general manager for
Harrah's Reno, one of the major downtown casinos, said that the
bowling stadium and the planned riverwalk are important in the
effort to get visitors to come more frequently and stay in town
longer.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno does not match Las Vegas in glitter, he said that the
downtown redevelopment would attract visitors also interested in
the area's recreational and scenic attributes, such as the nearby
mountains, ski resorts and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowling gives people a trial period to try Reno out for a few
days and say, `Hey, it's a nice place, let's go back for vacation,'
'' said Rogers. ``The downtown redevelopment is an opportunity to
enhance the overall experience. No where else in the country have
Mother Nature and Lady Luck created such a combination.''

STAN WRIGHT, 78, A U.S. OLYMPIC TRACK COACH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stan Wright, the track coach who took the blame for the
disqualification of two American sprinters who showed up late for
their races in the 1972 Munich Olympics, died on Friday night at
St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``His kidneys just shut down,'' said his daughter Toni
Hartfield. ``He had had dialysis treatments four times since he was
in the hospital.'' He had been hospitalized since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had been ill for many years. About 12 years ago, he had a
heart-bypass operation, Hartfield said.
</P>
<P>
   His death came only two days after the death of his cousin,
Larry Ellis, coach of the 1984 U.S. Olympic men's track and field
team and a former president of USA Track &AMP; Field.
</P>
<P>
   For a third of a century, starting at a time when black coaches
were excluded from high positions in the American track hierarchy,
Wright was a highly respected coach and administrator. In 1966, he
became the first black head coach of a U.S. national track team
when he was named to handle the U.S. team for dual meets against
Poland and the Soviet Union a week apart in Los Angeles. His
athletes on those teams included Jim Ryun, Al Oerter and Ralph
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he was the assistant coach in charge of sprinters for
the U.S. Olympic team. His three men in the 100-meter dash were
Eddie Hart, Rey Robinson and Robert Taylor, all potential
medalists. In the first morning of the Olympics, they easily won
their first-round heats and qualified for the quarterfinals later
in the day. Wright's time schedule indicated they would not run
again before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:17 p.m., relaxing in the Olympic Village, they saw on
television what appeared to be a replay of their morning races.
When they realized it was really the quarterfinals, they rushed to
the track, but Hart and Robinson arrived after their races had been
run. Taylor got there less than a minute before his race, stretched
twice and finished second, advancing to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Valery Borzov of the Soviet Union won the gold
medal and Taylor the silver. On the last day of track, Hart
anchored the United States to the gold medal in the 4x100-meter
relay, but the onus of the disqualification would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Wright, Howard Cosell of ABC television
assailed the coach. Months later, Wright accused Cosell of ``an
unfair and inaccurate portrayal of my part in the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interview,'' Wright said, ``I took the responsibility,
but not as an admission of incompetence or negligence on my part. I
took the responsibility to get the athletes off the hook because it
wasn't their responsibility and they didn't act irresponsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he learned after the fact that the schedules team
officials had given to him and the other American coaches a month
before the Olympics were outdated. After the morning races, he said
he had shown the schedule to German officials in the check-in area
and asked if it was still correct. He said they told him it was.
</P>
<P>
   Although little was said about it publicly, athletes from other
nations missed races in three other events because of time changes
they were not told about. Hart, the Olympic favorite, felt Wright
was a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an athlete,'' Hart said, ``you don't even want to think
about such things as schedules. It is perfect for someone else to
handle this part of the situation. I don't think there was anything
wrong or bad about the way Stan Wright handled us.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Hartfield, Wright is survived by two
children, Sandra Robinson and Tyran Wright; two sisters, Charlotte
Eddings and Mary Whitehead; five grandchildren, and one great
grandson. Wright's wife, Hazel, died in October 1997.

<P>
   Stanley Van Dorne Wright was a round-faced, soft-spoken man who
seldom hid his feelings. He was born Aug. 1, 1921, in Englewood,
N.J., and starred there in high school baseball and basketball. He
received a bachelor's degree from Springfield College and a
master's from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He was the head track coach at Texas Southern University
(1950-67), Western Illinois (1967-69) and Sacramento State
(1969-79). He was also the athletic director at Fairleigh Dickinson
(1979-85). He was chairman of the men's track and field committee
of the Amateur Athletic Union and its successor as the sport's
national governing body, The Athletics Congress. In 1993, he was
elected to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the State Department, he coached the Singapore
track team in the 1962 Asian Games and Malaysia in the 1964 Tokyo
Olympics. In 1968, he was assistant coach in charge of sprinters
for the U.S. Olympic team, and there was controversy there, too,
when Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two of his sprinters, gave a
Black Power salute during a medals ceremony and bowed their heads
during the playing of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and upset,'' Wright said then. But he also
understood their protest of racial inequities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never tell anyone to do this or that,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are men, not babies, admittedly young men, and if they
want to raise a clenched fist or raise hell or whatever and they
are willing to take the consequences, that is their business.''

WAKE-UP CALL GIVEN TO STARS FROM SAN JOSE
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days, after that half-effort debacle in San Jose the
other night, the coach would have gathered the bloated Presidents'
Trophy winners and outlined the day's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   A ``bag skate.'' Namely, the coach keeps the pucks in the bag,
and for the next two or three hours, the players skate. And skate.
And skate.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Hitchcock didn't have to. The veteran-laden Stars
already understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players that spoke up after the San Jose game, that spoke
out in the room and talked to the media, those are players who
recognize what was here and are not prepared to let that slip,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that shows you how far this team has come,
individually and collectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, in other words, knows it's a long way from here to
the NHL playoffs and, in particular, from here to Detroit. And the
Stars, he contends, are not going to win the Stanley Cup simply
because it's their turn.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're not that good, Hitchcock contends. The
listless 4-0 defeat to the Sharks proved that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference in that game was that they had more
energy than we did that night,'' Hitch said from Los Angeles, where
the Stars played the Kings last night. ``And the energy you put on
the ice is a reflection of your work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the E-word. Hitchcock has dropped the words ``energy'' and
``work ethic'' so many times that Mike Modano doesn't know whether
he's an Olympian or a longshoreman, a golden boy or a grinder.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, whose slap shot used to solve most problems, has
been wearing a Stars jersey for exactly 10 games, and he's already
telling the media that the team needs a good rump-kicking and has
to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   I almost think Hitchcock half-enjoyed what happened in San Jose
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long season. Six months. And the Stars danced every dance
last regular season.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, they were still grinding away, knocking off Chicago
for their 49th victory and clinching that Presidents' Trophy thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the taut Stanley Cup playoffs that count. The Stars
know that. So why would a veteran team not look at the breadth of
the regular season, remember the sweat and tears, and wonder, why
bother?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's it at all,'' Hitchcock countered. ``I
think it's the `identity' of your team that comes into play. It
doesn't matter if it's Game 50 or the first game of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that to be competitive and have a good base for
your team, you have to have a very, very strong work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach goes through it at this time of year,'' Hitch
continued. ``Sometimes you fight it for months. But you develop a
strong work ethic in your own way, and that's the base that you
draw on for the balance of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to preach the E-word, the ethic word, last season.
After winning 48 games in the 1996-97 regular season, the Stars had
been humbled and snuffed in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to prove to people last year, to make amends, right
from Day One,'' Hitchcock said. ``We almost played out of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hitchcock has to find a new button to push. The game in San
Jose might have been the first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' he said, ``it isn't our skill that made us a
good team. I don't think that skill alone makes championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made us a great team was the level of commitment we made.
The relentless level that we played at overwhelmed some teams. And
for us to win again, we have to get that level back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a hitch in his voice, the coach will tell you that his
Stars are not the most skilled of NHL teams. The Red Wings, they
dazzle you with their skills. Young Edmonton is loaded with skilled
people. And look out for Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us might differ. After all, owner Tom Hicks is paying a
lot of money, if all he has are bricklayers.
</P>
<P>
   But to admit otherwise would not be the standard Hitchcock
script. There are no stars in the Stars' system. When even Modano
wasn't playing well against the Sharks the other night, he was kept
out of two power plays.
</P>
<P>
   He'll learn. They'll all learn. In Hitchcock's system, the hard
workers get the benefits, the playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody bag-skates anymore, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you need those games like San Jose because they're
`attention-getters,' '' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   They teach the E-word, the work-ethic word, he means. All good
teams have to learn it _ between now and Detroit.
</P>

 &HT;    History's hard knocks
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Newt Gingrich's recent drive for re-election,
one of his campaign buttons proclaimed membership in ``Newt's Army
to Save America.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular handout was a postcard of Gingrich and his wife,
Marianne _ he in a dark suit, she in a bright red dress.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was running to retain his seat in Georgia's 6th
Congressional District, Gingrich gave the impression that he had
something larger in mind.
</P>
<P>
   His staff, in fact, was studying the logistics of getting him on
presidential primary ballots even in the face of polls that
consistently showed Gingrich to be unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   At one point this year, Gingrich boosters floated a fantastic
scenario: Gingrich, the third-ranking constitutional officer, would
ascend to the presidency after scandal forced both President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore from office.
</P>
<P>
   It is by now well understood that Gingrich dreams big dreams and
sees himself, as he put it in 1994, as a ``transformational
figure.'' His critics say the dreams are frequently the product of
his hubris, which too often gets the better of his keen intellect.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics must also acknowledge that Gingrich has
prevailed against the odds more often than most politicians.
Polarizing and partisan, he also won.
</P>
<P>
   He has been knocked down and written off almost as often as
Clinton, the Democrat who is similar to Gingrich in so many ways
and whose fortunes seem to rise as Gingrich's fall, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has confounded his political enemies with his ability
to rise from the ashes of his setbacks. It is tempting to proclaim
the end of Gingrich's political life after Friday's shocking news
that he will step down as speaker and resign his seat, maybe as
early as January.
</P>
<P>
   Less confrontation
</P>
<P>
   But a safer course may be simply to declare an end to a
tumultuous political era in Washington that Gingrich has helped
define more than any one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go down as one of the most important speakers in
history,'' said Randall Strahan, an Emory University professor who
is at work on a book about Gingrich and other influential speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich elevated the office to ``at one point being the equal
of the president's,'' Strahan said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he continued, ``The part of the office that he never really
mastered is governing.''
</P>
<P>
   The denouement came more quickly than anyone expected, and it
was rich with irony. The conservative firebrands Gingrich helped
sweep into office in the Republican Revolution of 1994 were the
leaders of the move to dump him as speaker. These impatient novices
often seemed to Gingrich to be remarkably similar to himself when
he entered the House in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana used his prominence as House
Appropriations Committee chairman to launch a challenge to Gingrich
on Friday, hours before the speaker made his stunning announcement.
Livingston rose to chairman only because Gingrich picked him over
more senior Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president offered his congratulations to a ``worthy
adversary,'' just days after an election in which a Republican
victory would have been taken as a signal to ratchet up impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was factually correct to insist that he had led the
only Republican team since before the Great Depression to win three
successive majorities in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, however, was hollow to many Republicans who saw
their hopes of big gains slip away amid a poorly defined campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich found no grateful throng of Republicans hailing him and
little willingness to give him another chance to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Career of close calls
</P>
<P>
   There have been many narrow escapes and second chances in
Gingrich's political lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The shaggy-haired history professor at West Georgia College lost
his first two races for Congress, running first in the wake of
Watergate and then with Jimmy Carter at the top of the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But when he won on the third try in 1978, he immediately set
about making himself known, even at the cost of annoying his
party's elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of more senior Republicans who had grown
very, very comfortable with the way things were,'' said Rich Galen,
a longtime Gingrich aide.
</P>
<P>
   The cable television broadcast of the House of Representatives
on C-Span gave Gingrich his first national exposure. He and other
junior Republicans railed against the Democratic majority in
lengthy speeches to an empty House chamber, delighting the small
audience of Republican activists watching at home.
</P>
<P>
   Tip O'Neill, a Democrat who was then speaker, ordered the camera
operators to pan the deserted House floor in an effort to ridicule
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neill gave way to Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, Gingrich
launched an ethics crusade, which won him the undying enmity of
Democrats. Gingrich almost single-handedly forced Wright from the
House in 1989 over questions about a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled his career on the Wright case and it propelled him
into the Republican leadership, using the support of other young
Republicans to beat out a more senior colleague for the job of
Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was as comfortable taking on President Bush over the
1990 budget agreement to raise taxes as he was attacking Democrats,
glibly bashing whoever happened to be in his way.
</P>
<P>
   He left no doubt that his goal was to become speaker of the
House, a laughable notion perhaps in an era of comfortable
Democratic majorities and Republican leaders who did not see the
urgency as Gingrich did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to change Washington, to change the federal
government _ not to be a participant in sharing the spoils of the
current system,'' he said in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, however, Gingrich eked out a 984-vote win over
Democrat David Worley in the old 6th Congressional District, south
and west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Worley attacked Gingrich for supporting a pay hike for House
members, a vote incidentally that also riled his conservative
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But national Democratic leaders did not aggressively support
Worley because they had previously agreed not to make the salary
increase, which they also backed, a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mellowing of Newt'' was a headline in this newspaper a few
months after his close call in the 1990 election.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on that theme would pop up with some regularity in
the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich dutifully campaigned for Bush in 1992, but he was far
less distressed than many Republicans, who feared Clinton's
election would relegate them to obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   A telegenic, moderate southern Democrat was the GOP's worst
nightmare, in appearance and outlook the antithesis of someone like
O'Neill, the cigar-smoking, beefy Massachusetts pol.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's election liberated House Republicans from the
constraints of having to pledge fealty to a Republican White House,
even when it compromised with the Democratic Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton's missteps on health care and other issues
played a large role in the Republican takeover of Congress in the
1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich was free to campaign in a way he and other
Republicans were not in 1992. They set the agenda and it reflected
their priorities, not those of some other Republican who needed to
reach out.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's ups and downs had been well-chronicled locally. But
in the weeks before the election, he and his Contract with America
were unknown to the majority of the country. Election night changed
that forever.
</P>
<P>
   He was up, Clinton was down. Gingrich became the first
Republican speaker in 40 years and led a 100-day charge to pass
most provisions of the Contract in the House, including a balanced
budget bill and welfare reform. Clinton, stung by the election
results, meanwhile wondered about his own relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Problems crept up. He encountered resistance to a $4.5 million,
two-book deal with Rupert Murdoch-owned HarperCollins. He quickly
renounced the money, but the House ethics committee set strict
guidelines for how he could promote the books and pay his expenses.
</P>
<P>
   An ethics complaint filed by Ben Jones, a former congressman
from Georgia who ran against Gingrich in 1994, alleged that the
speaker improperly financed the college course he taught on
Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Gingrich basked in the national spotlight. When he
went to New Hampshire in 1995 to look at moose, the national press
corps followed. Gingrich was everywhere -- on the cover of Time, in
daily televised press briefings -- and his staff did little to
discourage talk of a presidential run in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics Problems
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of Gingrich's downfall as speaker can perhaps be found
in his presidential ambitions. As long as Gingrich's single-minded
goal was a Republican majority in the House, he was willing to be
as caustic and uncompromising as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich the bomb-thrower was the darling of conservatives who
banished their doubts about their leader's commitment to their
principles.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich as the leader of the House, and with an eye on a
broader public following, learned the hard way that governing was a
lot harder, and it required compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's minions stood with him in 1995 when a budget standoff
with Clinton resulted in the partial shutdown of the federal
government. Gingrich eventually relented in the face of
overwhelming public criticism of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives in Congress were angry that Gingrich had given
in.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker compounded the problem by complaining about having
to exit the back of Air Force One when the U.S. delegation returned
from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. The New York
Daily News ran its memorable ``Crybaby'' headline with a cartoon of
Gingrich in diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were emboldened by Gingrich's missteps and
</P>
<P>
   made the speaker the focus of the 1996 campaign. He was still
everywhere, but now Gingrich's face was appearing in Democratic
television ads warning of Republican extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was up, easily winning re-election. Gingrich was down
after the Republicans lost seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Things soon got worse.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics investigation produced a bi-partisan consensus on the
ethics committee that Gingrich had indeed violated House rules.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers worked out a deal that would give him another chance
and another term as speaker. He would admit to providing inaccurate
information to the committee and agree to a $300,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Second Term
</P>
<P>
   Nine Republicans chose not to support Gingrich for speaker in
January 1997, but he retained enough support to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened, he accepted the speaker's gavel followed later that
month by his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of 1997 was a mess for House Republicans.
Gingrich licked his wounds, while his narrow majority wandered from
issue to issue with no real plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich team's worst mistake was its opposition to a
disaster relief bill for Midwestern flood victims. Members of the
freshman class of 1994 plotted to depose Gingrich and enlisted the
support of some of the speaker's most trusted allies.
</P>
<P>
   The coup ultimately failed amid recriminations by House Majority
Leader Richard Armey of Texas and Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
Gingrich survived, mainly because moderates in the House could not
abide replacing Gingrich with a more conservative speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Six solid months of depressing news gave way to the signal
accomplishment of the 105th Congress, a balanced budget deal and
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement had overwhelming bi-partisan support, though
conservatives grumbled again about spending provisions.
</P>
<P>
   A slimmed-down Gingrich had re-emerged as a less partisan
figure, triumphant over the enactment of a major provision of the
Contract with America. Another item, welfare reform, had become law
in the midst of the presidential campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Gingrich returned to the lecture circuit, preaching
cooperation with the White House and relying more and more on
Republican moderates in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with Clinton, against most congressional Democrats, in
a failed effort to get the president broad authority to negotiate
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how 1998 would have gone had the nation not been
rocked by news of an alleged affair between the president and a
White House intern?
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich urged caution and patience. He promoted his new book,
Lessons Learned the Hard Way, which offered a more human side of
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Stops in key presidential primary states became commonplace.
Gingrich set a Labor Day 1999 deadline to make up his mind about a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton early this year appeared to have been through
the worst of the allegations -- months before his grand jury
testimony and admission of ``inappropriate behavior -- Gingrich
broke from his judicious appraisal of the situation and began
lambasting the administration for a pattern of corrupt behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers in New Hampshire walked out of Gingrich's
talk to that state's legislature in protest of the speaker's
references to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives applauded but some Republicans feared a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the Clinton-bashing from his speeches just as
abruptly. At the time, his advisors said he had accomplished his
goal of refocusing attention on the White House's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich struggled the rest of the year to strike the right
balance. When independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent his report to
Congress, Gingrich pressed for its release with all its tawdry
details.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself at one point told a closed-door meeting of
Republicans to stop talking about sex and start talking about
``crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee began an impeachment inquiry with
Gingrich leading Republicans in a pledge to do their constitutional
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the final days of the campaign, Republicans ran
television ads invoking the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a clear message, the GOP lost another five seats in the
House last week. Gingrich admitted he had misjudged public reaction
to Clinton's problems and took responsibility for the poor showing
at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich has never tiptoed away from anything in his life.
It would be surprising to see that change now.
</P>
<P>
   How dramatic would his final days as presiding officer of the
House be, then, if his last official act was to gavel down a vote
on articles of impeachment against the president.

 &HT;    Livingston letter spelled the end of speakership
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For days House Speaker Newt Gingrich endured a rash
of criticism for the Republican losses on Election Day, but perhaps
nothing hit him harder than a letter that came from his trusted
protege Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.).
</P>
<P>
   In a four-page letter, Livingston, known for his fiery temper,
demanded that Gingrich relinquish complete control of the
money-doling Appropriations Committee to him. The tersely written
letter suggests that Gingrich had lost control of the Republican
Conference and a structure was needed to regain confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the majority to complete its work and demonstrate
that we can properly govern, I believe it imperative that you
acknowledge and agree to these suggested changes in house
procedure,'' Livingston wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Such demands on the speaker of the House are highly unusual and
widely considered an affront, akin to a middle manager telling the
CEO of a company how to run it. More importantly, the letter
reveals how icy the relationship between the two friends had become
and it offers a glimpse at the disciplined fashion in which
Livingston operates.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gingrich who plucked Livingston out of the pack to be the
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, leap-frogging him over
several more senior members of the blue chip committee.
</P>
<P>
   And in January 1997, when Gingrich became the first speaker to
be punished for violating House rules, Livingston was one of the
trusted inner circle that he reached out to for advice. It was
through the support of lawmakers like Livingston that Gingrich was
able to overcome the group of nine who opposed him as speaker and
who openly called him ``road kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship was not just political, as so many are out of
necessity in Washington, but personal. It goes back to Gingrich's
plans to lead the GOP out of the so-called ``wilderness,'' to take
over Congress. Last year, when Livingston contemplated leaving
Congress, it was Gingrich who persuaded him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   When the letter arrived, it was a surprise to Gingrich. The two
conferred, and Livingston retracted the letter by noon on Friday. A
few hours later, he announced that he would run against Gingrich
for speaker of the house. A few hours after that, Gingrich stunned
Washington when he announced he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolutionizing takes some talents _ many talents,'' said
Livingston, making his bid for the speakership. ``My friend Newt
Gingrich brought those talents to bear and put the Republicans in
the majority. Day-to-day governing takes others. I believe I have
those talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been silent on the letter and oblique about what he
thinks about Livingston's bid. It was no secret on Capitol Hill
that Livingston hoped to replace Gingrich, but he had hoped to do
it with his blessing. Whether such a blessing would be offered
after Gingrich received such a letter is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Livingston asserts that as the chairman of the
appropriations committee he would be given the full responsibility
to ``run the committee as I see fit and in the best interest of the
Republican majority, but without being subject to the dictates of
any other Member of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that would appear to directly address the problem
of Gingrich interfering with the will of his committee chairman, a
complaint that has been often heard on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The letter indirectly refers to the narrowly averted budget
fiasco where the House stayed in session several weeks past its
departure date because of feuding over routine spending bills.
Livingston asks that Gingrich agree that ``all future budget
resolutions be completed for House approval between April 15 and
April 30 and that thereafter all Appropriations bills are free to
proceed with or without a Budget Resolutions, for completion in the
House of Representatives by the end of June of every calendar
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston continues to say that as the chairman of the
committee, he ``shall be present in all leadership discussions of
the budget affecting appropriations matters.'' And no decision on
appropriations issues would be made without consulting with him
first.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Livingston complains that the legislative
schedule is too short. ``We should have longer work weeks and fewer
holidays,'' he wrote. And he said that the GOP should meet with the
Democrats for an hour each week, a direct reference to the partisan
rancor that has developed between the two parties and the open
hostility that the leadership of each party has for the other.

 &HT;    Gingrich decides to `let a new team take over'
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich confirmed Saturday that he
will not return to Congress next term despite being overwhelmingly
re-elected by his district's voters just a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said it would weaken House Republicans if he remained
in office and it was more important to have a unified party than
for Georgia to keep its senior congressman _ and the clout that
brought federal funds and kept military bases open in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a practical matter for me to stay in the House
would make it impossible for a new leader,'' Gingrich said Saturday
afternoon in front of his east Cobb home. ``I think there comes a
time when you've got to step out and let a new team take over, let
a new team try to do the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich holed up in his house for most of the day. Television
news crews arrived early in the morning and gathered outside,
apparently annoying neighbors, until the speaker appeared to give a
brief statement in midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, said he was looking into the legalities of
vacating his seat after being re-elected Tuesday to the
conservative Sixth Congressional District for his 11th term. He
promised to work hard to elect a Republican in a special election
next year.
</P>
<P>
   He was noncommittal about his plans or presidential aspirations.
He took credit for helping bring about two of the pivotal political
events in the last 20 years _ the election of Ronald Reagan as
president and the collapse of the Soviet Union. After his brief
statement at the end of his driveway, he pivoted and walked briskly
back to the house as two Cobb County sheriff's deputies waited to
make sure no one followed.
</P>
<P>
   Just before his statement, the speaker hugged neighbor Lucia Roy
and thanked her for her kind telephone call and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick and tired of the whole thing,'' Roy said. Her
husband, Terrence, doubted Gingrich had much of a national
electoral future left. ``I don't think he'll ever get elected
because he talks too honest.

REAL ESTATE: VOTING IN CO-OPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fact of co-op life is that a board of directors is
responsible for the sometimes complicated business of running the
building. Co-op bylaws guarantee that the board must be elected by
the shareholders _ but provide no guarantee that the election
process will be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting in co-ops can get pretty messy,'' said Donald Klein, a
Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law. One
reason, Klein said, is that co-op voting rules are often based on
more complex formulas than the ``one-person, one-vote'' rules
covering government elections. Co-ops use three types of voting
procedures, he said _ straight voting, cumulative voting and ``one
shareholder, one vote'' _ which is the simplest but also the least
common.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Gussaroff, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in
government-subsidized co-ops, said that in buildings that use the
latter procedure _ most of which are government-subsidized _ every
unit is allocated one vote, regardless of the size or value of the
unit. Accordingly, when the time comes to vote, each unit owner is
entitled to vote one share for each open seat on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that every shareholder would be equal,''
Gussaroff said. ``They didn't want to create a situation whereby if
you have a larger apartment, you have more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, however, most co-ops created under New York
state's Business Corporation Law _ which accounts for most of the
co-ops in New York today _ take a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `one-shareholder, one-vote' formula ignores the fact that
shareholders with larger apartments pay a larger share of the
maintenance and should therefore have a greater influence in the
building's affairs,'' said Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Cholst said, in most co-ops, the number of shares
allocated to an apartment is based primarily on the size and value
of the apartment in relation to others in the building. And most
co-ops, Cholst said, use what is known as a straight voting system
to elect directors.
</P>
<P>
   With such a system, he said, unit owners are given a specific
number of votes equal to their number of shares. Those votes can
then be cast for a specific candidate for each board opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a straight voting system, the number of votes an
individual unit owner can award to a particular candidate is
limited by the number of votes the unit owner has,'' Cholst said.
</P>
<P>
   And while such a voting process may seem democratic, Cholst
said, it nevertheless allows for some seemingly undemocratic
results.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, if there are a small number of unit owners
who own very large apartments that have been allocated great
numbers of shares, it is possible for that small minority to
control the building if the number of shares they collectively own
gives them a majority of votes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cholst said, with a straight voting system, it
is possible for a small number of individuals _ such as investors
or a sponsor _ who own a large number of units to exercise control
by pooling their votes.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Cholst said, with a straight voting system, if one
group of shareholders manages to put together enough votes to
constitute a majority, that group will be able to elect its
candidates to every seat on the board, preventing the minority from
having any influence.
</P>
<P>
   There is a way, however, for minority shareholders to get a
foothold on the board and have some influence _ if a building
allows what is known as cumulative voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cumulative voting is essentially a very democratic process,''
said Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the
Council of New York Cooperatives. ``It helps assure that a minority
group of shareholders can get proportionate representation on the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   With cumulative voting, as with straight voting, each unit owner
is allocated a number of votes equal to the number of his shares.
Unlike straight voting, however, Weinstein said, the votes are then
multiplied by the number of seats on the board that are up for
election. For example, he said, in a building with straight voting
and seven open board seats, a unit owner with 200 shares will have
200 votes to cast for a particular candidate for each of the seven
open seats.
</P>
<P>
   With cumulative voting, however, that same unit owner would have
a total of 1,400 votes to cast any way he or she wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spread them out among several candidates for several
seats or you can cast all 1,400 votes for one candidate for one
seat,'' Weinstein said. ``And therein lie the strategies possible
with cumulative voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, he said, if there are opposing groups of shareholders
vying for power, it is possible with cumulative voting for a
well-organized minority to take control of the board from a
less-well-organized majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic strategy is to gain control of the board,''
Weinstein said. ``So in a contested election for, say, seven board
seats, a well-organized minority group of shareholders can throw
all their votes to just four candidates while the less-organized
majority spreads its votes among seven candidates for seven
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Weinstein said, if the majority is as well-organized
as the minority, it is possible for the more powerful group to
undermine the minority's attempt to gain control by using the same
four-candidates-only strategy. However, he said, even in that
situation, cumulative voting can give minority shareholders the
ability to gain at least a foothold on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minority group can bullet-ballot every one of their votes
for just one or two candidates,'' Weinstein said, adding that while
such a strategy would not give the minority control, the election
of one or two friendly directors would give it the ability to
influence actions of other board members.
</P>
<P>
   And if the majority tried to duplicate the minority's strategy,
by voting for only one or two candidates, it would risk losing
control of the other open seats.
</P>
<P>
   Cumulative voting, however, has one problem that co-op lawyers
must constantly confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so darn complicated,'' said Stuart Saft, a Manhattan
lawyer and chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Saft said, all the benefits of cumulative voting could
be lost if a shareholder makes an arithmetic error when allocating
votes among several candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mess up,'' he said, ``your ballot is void.''

 &HT;    Ga. school chairman emerges as contender to replace Gingrich
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When news of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's abdication
hit the airwaves Friday evening, Georgia school board Chairman
Johnny Isakson was boarding an airplane for a convention in
California.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Isakson arrived, he was probably one of the few
people from the 6th Congressional District who hadn't heard the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to my hotel they said, `You must have a family
emergency, because you have a stack of phone messages,''' Isakson
said during a telephone interview Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was no illness in Isakson's family, only an outbreak of
political fever among Republicans wondering who might run for
Gingrich's seat. Much of the speculation centered on Isakson, one
of the most respected and best-known Republicans in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson said he is considering running for the seat, but won't
make up his mind until he returns to Atlanta early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a statement at the appropriate time,'' Isakson said.
``I would be in consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson wasn't the only Republican weighing a bid to replace
Gingrich over the weekend, but if he does decide to run, many
others might defer to him, predicted Matt Towery, a Gingrich
confidant and a former member of the state House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if Isakson gets in, no other credible Republican
candidate would consider it,'' said Towery, who squashed rumors
that he might seek the seat himself. ``I have no desire to ever be
in politics again.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Randy Sauder (R-Cobb) said he is considering a run
for the 6th District seat, but would probably stay out if Isakson
gets in. Sauder and Isakson talked by telephone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds more and more like'' Isakson will run, Sauder said.
``He's a Republican icon in Cobb County, and I have a great deal of
respsect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans being mentioned as possible candidates include
former state Sen. Charles Clay (R-Marietta), former Christian
Coalition head Jerry Keen of Roswell, and state Rep. Mitch Kaye
(R-East Cobb).
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expressed hope that former U.S. Rep. Buddy
Darden, who lives in Marietta, might run for the seat, but Darden
did little to stoke that rumor. ``I'm not going to think about it
right now,'' Darden said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich completes his current term and steps down before the
start of the 107th Congress, his resignation could take effect a
few days before Gov.-elect Roy Barnes takes over from Gov. Zell
Miller. Either Miller or Barnes would have to call a special
election to fill the two-year term that begins next year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor could decide the election will be partisan, which
would involve primaries for both parties, or nonpartisan, in which
all candidates would run in a primary together, and the top two
would meet in a runoff if nobody got a majority. Special elections
are usually nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Miller could not be reached for comment Saturday, and Barnes
noted that the decision about a special election might not be his
to make. If it is, Barnes said, ''I would talk to the secretary of
state and get cost estimates before I would make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a nonpartisan election is ordered, Democrats conceded
that Isakson would have the advantage because of his popularity in
the 6th District.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson has already represented parts of the district at the
state Capitol. He was the Republican leader in the state House
before making a run for governor in 1990, when he captured the GOP
nominatino but lost to Miller in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson then served two terms in the state Senate before running
for U.S. Senate in 1996, when he lost to businessman Guy Millner in
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Miller tapped Isakson to head the state school
board illustrates that Isakson is well respected by Democrats as
well as Republicans.

<P>
   When California voters approved a measure last week giving
Indian tribes broad permission to run casinos unhampered by state
control, it was a big loss for the Coalition for Unregulated
Gambling, one of the measure's fiercest opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the coalition disapproves of gambling; in fact, it
was financed largely by gambling companies based in that granddaddy
of gambling states, Nevada. Why did Nevada's gambling bigwigs, many
of whom have pushed aggressively for the acceptance of gambling in
other parts of the country, work so hard to keep California from
joining the club? Raw fear.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of Nevada's casino patrons come from
California, and many of them will stay closer to home if Native
Americans offer a more enticing menu of table games and slot
machines, which the ballot measure permits. You don't need to be a
bookie to know how bad that would be for business in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   California's tribes could end up with legal casinos with about
20,000 gaming devices, about 5 times the number at Foxwoods, the
Indian casino in Connecticut, according to William Eadington, an
economist at the University of Nevada at Reno. Foxwoods is the
biggest gambling joint in the Western Hemisphere. Legislators in
California may now feel compelled to legalize or expand gambling at
card clubs, race tracks, bars and taverns, and other recreation
centers. ``All of this would indeed be bad news for Las Vegas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevadans also know that wagering is now a national industry and
that the explosive growth of the business has made it available
everywhere _ on street corners, on the Internet, and all along the
Mississippi River. By the year 2000, 90 percent of Americans will
live within 200 miles of a legal casino, the Las Vegas Convention
and Visitors Authority noted in a recent report that pointed out
challenges facing a town that is still regarded as the mecca of
American gambling. Only a generation ago gamblers had few choices
but Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But all gambling moguls, not just those based in Las Vegas, are
looking over their shoulders. Gambling's ubiquity is forcing the
industry's impresarios to fret about the best ways to drum up new
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have all the gambling they want,'' said Eugene
Christiansen, a gambling analyst with Christiansen/Cummings
Associates in New York. ``The driver of growth over the past three
decades _ the satiation of unsatiated demand _ is no longer
there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steve Wynn's new $1.9 billion Las Vegas casino, the
Bellagio, aims to attract new gamblers with luxurious rooms, posh
shops and a collection of Picassos and Matisses, analysts expect
most gambling concerns to focus on something more basic to stir up
new business: gamblers' thirst for action and the fast-paced,
mindless devices like slot machines and video lottery games that
quench that thirst most effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Even if its growth slows, gambling is still a colossal business.
Americans bet $638.6 billion legally in 1997 and lost about $51
billion of that amount _ more than the loot pulled in by the
recording, movie and theme park businesses combined. Those losing
bets were also up 70 percent from the $30 billion gamblers forked
over in 1992, according to International Gaming &AMP; Wagering
Business, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   But that money is being lost in a lot more places now. In 1989,
nearly all casino gambling took place in Atlantic City, N.J., and
Las Vegas; now it's just over half. Riverboat gambling is now far
bigger than the action in Atlantic City. And the boats are no
longer confined to rivers. Last week, voters in Missouri approved a
measure legalizing slot machines in casinos floating in artificial
basins.
</P>
<P>
   So most gambling concerns are now focused on a core mission:
pushing games that appeal to gamblers' need for speed. Speed sells.
Speed hooks gamblers. Slot machines have long since replaced the
plodding table games of craps and roulette as the mainstays of the
casino business.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone walking into a casino a few decades ago, when the Rat
Pack was in full swing in Las Vegas, would have encountered a room
full of table games like blackjack and craps with slot machines
relegated to the periphery where the little old ladies played.
Today, slot machines dominate the floors of every casino and the
allegiance of most gamblers _ especially retirees parked in front
of the slots at their local gambling den. Slot machines are fast
and simple; crap games are not. So slots and other electronic
gambling devices accounted for about 70 percent of the money that
gamblers lost in casinos last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many state lotteries, the recent Powerball mania
notwithstanding, are encountering gamblers who are increasingly
blase about huge jackpots. The lottery industry calls it ``jackpot
fatigue,'' and many lotteries are relying on the speed of
instant-ticket games to snag more gamblers. If piles of money
aren't enough to get gamblers' attention, the adrenaline blast from
a quick gambling hit usually will do the trick. The New York
lottery, the largest state lottery in the nation, now gets more
money from instant games than it does from its better known Lotto
games that offer big jackpots and snare the lion's share of media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And online lottery games like New York's Quick Draw game _
labeled ``video crack'' by its critics _ let gamblers play a new
game every few minutes. Video lottery terminals, though legal in
only five states, generated a quarter of all lottery sales
nationwide last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that when you make these machines
available, people use them,'' said Christiansen, the gambling
analyst. ``The other side of this is that with increased gambling
you create social friction like compulsive gambling. It's a
legitimate policy concern.'' The stakes in all of this are high,
because compulsive gambling is still a fuzzy issue and is one of
the key concerns of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission,
which is currently examining the industry. It is expected to report
its findings next year.
</P>
<P>
   When criticized, the gambling industry rightly points out that
most gamblers wager within their budgets and just do it for fun.
Still, a significant number of gamblers _ about 20 percent in most
markets _ lose the lion's share of the money, about 80 percent,
according to casino executives. And within this core group, a
sizeable though unquantifiable chunk are compulsive or problem
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that about 5 percent of the adult
population, or some 10 million people, are compulsive gamblers.
That is, they are hooked on gambling like others are hooked on
nicotine, heroin or alcohol. But terms like compulsive and problem
gambling are notoriously fuzzy, given that they are used to
describe a wide variety of behaviors that do not fit easy
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Harvard Medical School published a study
indicating that about 1 percent of the adult population and 6
percent of youths are what could be described as active compulsive
gamblers. The same study found that about 3 percent of adults and
15 percent of youths are what could be described as problem
gamblers, those who regularly wage beyond their means but are not
addicted.
</P>
<P>
   The same study also found that gambling disorders in the United
States have been increasing over the last two decades. Needless to
say, the growth in gambling problems coincides with the expansion
of the gambling industry, and with faster games. It is the faster,
repetitive games that tend to be the most addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, attempts to put the brakes on gambling have little
success. New York state Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, sponsored
legislation earlier this year to limit gambling, but it failed.
``Compulsive gambling disorders,'' he said, ``may be for Generation
X what cocaine and crack were for their parents' generation.''

 &HT;    Falcons must show hand
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ It's lovely up here this time of year with the
leaves having changed colors and that cool crisp snap of autumn in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta Falcons are grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   They're tired of reading and hearing how their 6-2 record _ best
in the 33-year history of the franchise _ has been a gift; that
they haven't beaten anybody; that their schedule, which has
afforded the luxury of six wins against teams that are collectively
12-36, has been soft.
</P>
<P>
   So today offers the second shot in three weeks at validation.
</P>
<P>
   Here the Falcons hope that it goes better this time than the
28-3 lashing suffered two weeks ago against the Jets, when the
Falcons' stated goal was to prove they could win without injured
quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots (5-3) are good, better than their
record, some would say, and Foxboro Stadium is no picnic for a
visiting team, especially one that hasn't played here since 1986,
or won here since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   All that would make a victory here sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that there are 12 teams whose records would have
been better if we hadn't beaten them,'' said coach Dan Reeves,
alluding to the Falcons' mark of 12-4 since the middle of last
season. ``We haven't ... won a game on the road against a good
opponent so this is important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a good thing that the Jets game is still fresher on
the minds of many Falcons than last week's 37-15 win over the Rams,
when Jamal Anderson ran for a career-high 172 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's attitude (for the Jets game), mine included, was
probably more like, `If we do everything just right, we can come
away with a victory,' instead of `We're going to win regardless,'''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wakeup call because we were tremendously different
last week. We really let (the Jets) take it to us. We let ourselves
down. I knew I had to rebound in a way that people hadn't seen
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, 2-2 on the road, will have to grit their teeth
again today.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has rushed for more than 100 yards in five of the past
six games. He isn't sneaking into town.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons say it's not so much that X's and O's will
matter. It's moxie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got to take the attitude we had last week into every
game,'' Falcons wide receiver Tony Martin said. ``They put their
pants on just like we do. They have tremendous athletes, and to ...
get a victory would get us some respect.''

 &HT;    Patriots salute Edwards
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before a private workout in the spring, Robert Edwards
had never been to the Northeast, but the way fans of the New
England Patriots have embraced the former University of Georgia
running back, you would think he's a native.
</P>
<P>
   Few NFL tacklers have been able to embrace the Pats' first-round
draft choice, as he leads all rookies with 580 rushing yards and
has scored eight touchdowns, second-most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-11, 218-pounder from Tenille , he owns an NFL record,
after scoring at least once in each of his first six games as a
pro. The Patriots had six rushing touchdowns all of last season;
Edwards has seven already.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons (6-2) visit New England (5-3) this afternoon,
one of their chief concerns will be the Patriots' rookie running
back.
</P>
<P>
   What they've seen on film is a running back who has blossomed in
knowledge and talent. At Georgia, Edwards was known chiefly for his
speed after switching from defensive back his junior year. Now, his
speed is considered slightly above average, but other skills have
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't say much, but others are talking about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``On film, he looks like a very complete running back,'' Falcons
defensive lineman Lester Archambeau said. ``He can really cut back,
he runs hard, he's strong, and he's pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The part you have to like about him,'' Patriots coach Pete
Carroll said, ``is his ability to break a tackle. He runs the ball
well inside, and he attacks the line of scrimmage. He does a very
nice job of deflecting tacklers. And he's got hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Chiefs a few weeks ago, when the Patriots hit the
zenith of their season with a 40-10 win that made them 4-1, Edwards
caught a touchdown pass. There was a little more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play wasn't designed to go to me,'' Edwards said. ``I was
supposed to be blocking the back side, and I looked back and saw
that (quarterback) Drew (Bledsoe) was scrambling. We were always
taught ... that whenever Drew scrambles, we should try to get
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was open, but the ball was overthrown. No problem. He
laid out and caught it with his fingertips while landing on his
belly in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an incredible catch,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   After all the fretting Patriots fans did when the team declined
to re-sign former running back Curtis Martin and all the
hand-wringing when the Pats used the 18th pick of the draft to
select an oft-injured running back who never rushed for 1,000 yards
in a college season and fumbled often, they got Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   One five-year, $5.725 million contract later, everybody is
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming, because I've had tremendous opportunities
to score,'' said Edwards, who missed the preseason with a groin
injury. ``I didn't know how all that (business with Martin) worked;
I was just excited about getting drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards at a glance
</P>
<P>
   Age: 24.
</P>
<P>
   Birthplace: Tennille, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   College: University of Georgia, where he is 11th in school
history with 1,955 rushing yards, and 27 TDs. Played first two
seasons as a cornerback. Was second-team All-American as a senior
(830 yards, 5.9-yard average).
</P>
<P>
   Personal: Edwards helped Washington County High to the Class AA
state championship game in 1992. He still loves to fish in Georgia
with his grandmother. His younger brother, Terrance, will enter
Georgia in January on a football scholarship. Edwards was a high
school teammate of Bengals rookie linebacker Takeo Spikes and
Boston Celtics forward Greg Minor.

 &HT;    Hooks put Fryatt down for count
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ After playing for two days as though he
genuinely belonged on the PGA Tour _ two 67s and the Subaru Sarazen
World Open lead _Edward Fryatt played Saturday more closely
resembling the fellow who had missed 16 cuts in 25 Nike Tour events
this year. With a disastrous 11-over-par 83, Fryatt went from 10
under par and leading by two strokes to 1 over par and trailing by
15.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad scene to observe. Fryatt's front nine looked like
something from the amateur side of Wednesday's pro-am. He made two
double-bogeys and a triple-bogey on the way to a 44. The par-5 9th,
one of the tournament's best birdie opportunities, became The
Nightmare Off Legends Drive. His patience dwindling, Fryatt hooked
yet another drive, blocked his second shot into the trees, hit
through the fairway behind more trees, hit a tree and shot
backward, flew over the green, pitched back and two-putted for
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Fryatt said, ``I was kind of looking for something to hide in.''
</P>
<P>
   From the day's beginning, the gremlins seemed to be working
against Fryatt, as he three-putted from 5feet for double-bogey at
No. 1. He power-lipped the first putt, then missed the resulting
putt _ a cruel payment for making birdie from 40 feet the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just went bad from the start and snowballed from
there,'' Fryatt said. ``It was a disappointing day, but the sun
will come up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just very unfortunate,'' said playing partner Bob Tway,
who emerged as the 54-hole leader. ``You hate to see it happen to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryatt wandered from the scoring tent, shaking his head in
disbelief after a property that in four hours became his Chateau
Alarm. He accepted a hug from his wife near the clubhouse and a
pledge to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at the bottom,'' Fryatt said, ``there's nowhere to
go but up.''
</P>
<P>
   Struver aces Legends No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Sven Struver managed the fifth hole-in-one in the
Sarazen's five-year history, on the 191-yard No. 3 hole, with a
5-iron. Struver shot a 71 for 3-over 219. It was the third ace at
No. 3 in five years. ... Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain became the
first player in tournament history to birdie each of the four
par-3s in one round. ... Mark CalcavecchiaDesvonte BotesStewart

 &HT;    Success has dried up for Earnhardt, Elliott, Waltrip
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Their names are part of stock-car racing lore. Among
them, they have 11 Winston Cup championships and 195 victories. So
famous are they, they go by nicknames and initials: ``The
Intimidator.'' ``Awesome Bill.'' ``D.W.''
</P>
<P>
   That is their legacy. This is their reality: Dale Earnhardt,
Bill Elliott and Darrell Waltrip have struggled around race tracks
recently, as the Pepsi Generation has taken over. Among these three
aging legends, there has been one victory in a combined 411 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has been at it since 1975, has seven championships and
has stayed around long enough for his son to graduate to Winston
Cup. He ended a career-longest 59-race winless streak by taking the
season-opening Daytona 500 this year in his 20th try. Since then,
he's had only four top-five finishes and has qualified poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, Winston Cup champion in 1988, last won a race in 1994,
126 races ago. He hasn't had a top-five finish since Martinsville
in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup champ, has finished 21st or
worse in his last seven races. His last win came in 1992 at
Darlington, 194 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   Are their cars ready to disappear into the sunset?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Buddy Baker, a former Winston Cup driver and
veteran TV analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's don't bury these guys yet,'' Baker said. ``I think
they've still got some magic left. When Earnhardt finished third at
Phoenix (two weeks ago), he started from 39th and worked his way up
to third place. That's a tremendous run for this day and time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Elliott, I've watched him several times this year when
his car was on target and he can still drive,'' Baker said. ``I
still enjoy watching ol' D.W. when he takes a car with a
provisional starting spot and runs that baby right up to the front.
I get a certain thrill from that. I can say, `OK, they threw some
dirt on him but they didn't cover him up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't forget how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But their days of domination seem to have passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Earnhardt can still win,'' Baker said. ``I feel that Bill
Elliott can still win. I think Waltrip, in the right situation, can
be successful. Maybe they're not 100 percent, but they're 97
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The three are racing treasures, Baker said, but he says they're
not ready to be bronzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnhardt finished third at Phoenix and you go, 'OK, he's two
spots from being back where he was.' Maybe it's just for that day,
but for Dale Earnhardt fans, that was a great day because it shows
them he's still got the spark, that desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And they'll know when to hang it up, just as Baker did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until you lose that competitive edge,'' Baker
said. ``If you get hurt physically, then you start sliding. I
really think, as long as you're mentally alert and keep yourself in
great shape, you'll be OK. If you get tired in a race car, that's
when you know your days are numbered. You start hearing a guy say,
`Well, halfway I kind of ran out of steam.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A look at yesterday's heroes:
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt
</P>
<P>
   The victories have become fewer in recent years, but Earnhardt
has retained his surliness. He's too busy pushing a line of health
foods to pay attention to his public relations, which was never his
strong suit, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   His year went from the heights of winning the Daytona 500 to
being mired in the back of the pack in most qualifying sessions.
Larry McReynolds, his former crew chief in the Richard
Childress-owned No. 3 Chevrolet, was a victim of the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start off winning the Daytona 500 with Dale certainly was
the peak of the last several seasons,'' McReynolds said. ``But
after we left there, it was like a snowball rolling down a hill
that nobody could stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Richard Childress swapped crew chiefs, with
McReynolds moving to Mike Skinner and the 31 Chevy and Kevin Hamlin
working with Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended the season up last year, with a lot of momentum,''
Childress said. ``I think when NASCAR changed the rules we kind of
lost the handle on the car. So we go into Daytona and win the
Daytona 500, win the 125-miler and start out carrying momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it just seemed like we never could get the handle on this
new `five-and-five' rule (affecting the downforce of the car by
raising the nose five inches and the rear spoiler five inches). We
struggled a lot with it. We've had some good runs and have been in
a position to win some other races, but it's been a disappointing
season for Dale, myself and all of us, because we set out
expectations so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress thinks the Earnhardt legend will live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dale Earnhardt can drive a race car as good as he's
ever driven it,'' Childress said. ``He showed that at Phoenix; he
showed that at Daytona, Talladega. We've just got to get him the
feel that he's looking for. If we get that feel in this chassis and
in his car, that he wants, Dale Earnhardt can still win that eighth
championship. I ain't giving up on him. And anybody that does,
they're losing their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott
</P>
<P>
   Was it really 10 years ago that Elliott was the Winston Cup
champion? Has it been 13 years since it seemed he won everything he
entered, gathering 11 victories, 11 poles and the wonderful
nickname, Awesome Bill From Dawsonville?
</P>
<P>
   Now, all Elliott wins are popularity contests.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season, he won an unprecedented 12th Most Popular
Driver award. But he hasn't been to victory lane since the
September 1994 Southern 500 at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   His decline seems to parallel his emergence as a car owner in
1995. His winless streak has reached 126 races. It's been a year
between top-five finishes. But bad luck and tragedy have been his
riding companions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he broke a leg in a wreck at Talladega and ran
only 24 races, finishing 30th in points. He rebounded last year to
finish eighth in points and came in second at Michigan in June.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he lost his father during the season. He qualified
27th or worse 12 times in 31 races. He was taken out by wrecks
three times. Rumors abound that he is shopping the second car he
co-owns with Dan Marino, the No. 13 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating years are beginning to stack up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been like about '86, '89, '91,'' Elliott said,
reeling in the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-one (with one win, running out of the top 10 15 times)
probably was the most frustrating,'' he said. ``I think '86 was a
bad one, too. You've got to take the good with the bad. Try to work
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I made a lot of decisions (in equipment) that
sounded like good, right decisions at the time. But some of the
decisions didn't seem to weigh out in the good direction that I
should be going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said he thinks things are turning around. Last week at
Darlington, he started 26th and finished 12th. His best finish was
the spring race at Rockingham, where he came in sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a lot better position than what we were, but I still
feel like we're kind of hot and cold, and I want to be more
consistent,'' Elliott said. ``That's what we're trying to work on
the last couple of races, so we can have a basis of starting next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year. That's always the motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to work through stuff,'' Elliott said. ``We
felt good when we started out this season, but we just kept making
changes, and we never could get back ahead, for whatever reason _
the wrecks we've had and some other stuff going on. We couldn't
seem to get headed to where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip
</P>
<P>
   After an illustrious 25-year career, Waltrip knows it's time to
walk away. But he'd like to do it on his terms: Get a ride in a
competitive car in 1999 and have a goodbye tour in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He might not get the opportunity. The sponsor of the No. 35
Pontiac announced last week that Waltrip would not return next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think by the time you've been around as long as I have
and as old as I am, that you'd pretty well be established and know
where you stood and what you were doing,'' Waltrip said. ``But it's
been a funny year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip had three seasons in one this year, starting off in the
17 car that he owned. When his sponsor quit on him, he sold his
team and became the substitute driver in the No. 1 Chevrolet after
rookie Steve Park was injured. He stayed through the 18th race, at
Pocono, which was one of his better days in the last several years.
He started 18th and finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He closed out the year in a bad car, starting in the back of the
field, 43rd, 12 times in the last 14 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most unusual year I've ever had,'' Waltrip
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappointing thing was I felt I could have won in the 1
car. I was really excited in the middle of the year because I'd
kind of gotten where I knew I could win. That was exciting. Then,
to have that kind of snapped out from under you, that was
disappointing. It's been that kind of year, a roller coaster.
That's the only thing I haven't driven this year, a roller coaster,
but I have been on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of looking forward to this year getting over with.
I'm ready to figure out what I'm going to do next year, and I
really don't know right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not ready for the retirement party just yet, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to drive next year and retire in the year 2000,''
Waltrip said. ``I'd like to get in a situation where next year
would be kind of a year to get some good credibility, get some
identity with some sponsor and have a farewell tour in 2000. That's
what I'd like to do.

AWESOME AGAIN WINS BREEDERS' CUP CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to lede with results of Classic; includes Juvenile and other
races)  (Eds: See also RAC-RHODEN-COLUMN, BREEDERS-CUP-HISTORY)

 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ On a day when Skip Away ran out of the money
and lost his chance to become the world's richest race horse,
Awesome Again won the world's richest race Saturday when he rushed
through the pack near the finish line to take the $5.2 million
Breeders' Cup Classic by three-quarters of a length over Silver
Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again not only won the laurels and the loot but also won
his sixth consecutive race. Still, he needed a furious dash through
the homestretch to knife his way through the 10-horse field and hit
the finish line in front. And in doing so he redeemed his trainer,
Patrick Byrne, who dominated last year's Breeders' Cup with two
juvenile winners, and gave Pat Day his biggest ride of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, who presumably will retire with career earnings of
$9.6 million, $400,000 short of Cigar's record total, stalked the
leaders through most of the mile and a quarter. But he could not
keep up, and he faded to sixth place just when he might have scored
his greatest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Swain, the 6-year-old Irish horse, finished third as the deepest
field in recent racing memory provided an exciting conclusion to a
day of championship performances. It was a classic finish: Silver
Charm by a neck over Swain, who held third by a nose over Victory
Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was the main event of a festive, sunny and chilly
afternoon filled with tight finishes and memorable moments, and it
was run before a record Breeders' Cup crowd of 80,452 at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day that featured the dramatic return of Da Hoss after
a two-year absence from racing forced by a series of injuries, and
the 6-year-old horse repeated his success of two years ago: He won
the Breeders' Cup Mile as he did in 1986. And it was a day that saw
the trainer Bob Baffert saddle horses who ran first and second in
the Juvenile Fillies while D. Wayne Lukas got shut out with five
horses in the Juvenile, and the strong European contingent shut out
with 16 horses.
</P>
<P>
   The day got off to a rousing start when Answer Lively won the $1
million Juvenile by a head over the 76-1 long shot Aly's Alley, and
cast a lengthening shadow toward next year's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   He won it under a skillful ride by Jerry Bailey, who was riding
the colt for the first time but was riding a Breeders' Cup winner
for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Silverbulletday won the Juvenile Fillies with
Excellent Meeting finishing second and Three Ring finishing third;
Reraise won the Sprint, with Grand Slam finishing second and Kona
Gold taking third, and Da Hoss won the Mile, with Hawksley Hill
second and Labeeb third.
</P>
<P>
   The program may not have included a race with the traditions and
history of the 124-year-old Kentucky Derby, and the crowd was only
half the size of the multitudes that flock to Churchill Downs in
May for the Derby. But the Breeders' Cup featured 85 of the finest
horses from three continents, and the Juvenile kicked off a day of
unquestioned riches but unknown fates.
</P>
<P>
   The unknown fate involved the winning colt and his chances of
going on to stardom next year at 3. Since the Breeders' Cup was
established 15 years ago, no colt who won the Juvenile returned the
next year to win the Kentucky Derby. In fact, no colt has won the
2-year-old championship and come back to win the Derby since
Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively, a son of Lively One, is owned by John Franks, an
oil man from Louisiana, and he was not exactly a secret with the
bettors. He had won three of his six starts before he went to the
post as the favorite, and he responded with a well-rated effort
under Bailey's guidance that not only won but also outran the small
herd of five colts entered by D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, he had a head on the long shot Aly's Alley, who
was closing fast, and Aly's Alley had three-quarters of a length on
Cat Thief, the only Lukas entry to run in the money.
</P>
<P>
   Franks was asked if he was happy that he hadn't changed his mind
about selling Answer Lively to any of the many people offering
substantial money for the horse, and he replied dryly: ``I didn't
change my mind, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was asked how he felt being shut out, and he replied: ``I
was hoping to get a better finish. But the race set up for a closer
to win. The horses there at the end were the ones that figured to
be there, including Aly's Alley. He's run well all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively won two races in Louisiana this fall before
running second to Cat Thief in the Breeder's Futurity at nearby
Keeneland just three weeks ago. And he ran a strategic race
Saturday, stalking the lead before making his move in the
homestretch. And he had enough gas left to hold off the late rush
by Aly's Alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trick was to see how he would rate behind horses,
and he did that real nice'' Bailey said. ``Near the finish, I knew
somebody was coming up on the inside, but I also felt the inside
wasn't the best place to run. That's why I chose an outside lane
for the finish, and my colt responded beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Prado, the jockey on Aly's Alley, held up his fingers
about three inches apart and said: ``I got beat this far. I tell
you, we were in front two jumps after the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Answer Lively outran and even buried some highly
regarded 2-year-old colts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes It's True, the leader of the Lukas band, held the lead for
three-quarters of a mile but gave way and finished 11th in a field
of 13. Scotty Schulhofer's Lemon Drop Kid, second in the Champagne
Stakes at Belmont Park last month, moved up gradually from eighth
place but could not pass the four top finishers.
</P>
<P>
   The Groom Is Red, owned by Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino and
trained by Nick Zito, got pinched coming out of the gate and ran
last almost to the homestretch, rallied but finished sixth. The
other Lukas horses finished eighth, ninth and 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Two colts acted up and one was even scratched at the gate as the
suspense built. Prime Directive balked and flailed when entering
the gate, prompting Jorge Chavez to dismount and leading the
trackside veterinarian to scratch the horse. Then Red Sea, a star
in Britain, broke through the gate, prompting Kent Desormeaux to
jump off. They got back in the gate and ran the race, but finished
12th.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively ran the mile and a sixteenth on a fast track in
1:44, paid $7.40 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $520,000
and hopes of beating the curse of the Juvenile winners.

 &HT;    Points shuffle continues
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Richard Petty picks Jeff Gordon to win today's NAPA
500, and it has nothing do with the new spoiler heights or longer
air dams.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to protect his points or anything else, so
there's no pressure,'' said Petty, winner of seven Winston Cup
championships. ``He can go out and not worry about that part of it.
He's one the few that's here and doesn't have to worry about the
points deal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon and Mark Martin have locked up Nos. 1 and 2 in the
points race, every other driver has something to fight for today.
For instance, three of the top 10 positions could change.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 46 points separate Dale Jarrett, who is in third, and
fourth-place Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dale Earnhardt holds a 45-point lead over Terry Labonte for
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bobby Hamilton leads John Andretti by only 26 for 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that 46 points may not sound like much, but it really
is,'' Wallace said. ``If it gets down to the final laps, and we're
in position to where the number of spots between us decides who's
third, we'll focus on it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVane OK
</P>
<P>
   Cuthbert's Harris DeVane crashed hard into the turn two wall
during second round qualifying and was transported to Georgia
Baptist for a Cat scan and was released. It was DeVane's first
attempt to qualify for a Winston Cup event, a day after finishing
28th in the ARCA Winn-Dixie 250k.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip in a Ford!
</P>
<P>
   Longtime General Motors stalwart Darrell Waltrip will make a
concession and drive the No. 88 Ford Quality Care Taurus for Robert
Yates Racing when NASCAR starts its engines in Japan at Twin Ring
Motegi for the Thunder Special Coca Cola 500 Nov. 22. Waltrip is
replacing Jarrett, who will be recovering from gallbladder surgery.
``I've driven everything there is to drive in NASCAR this year
except a rollercoaster, and I feel like I've been riding one of
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Donahue has been chosen as crew chief for the Gordon-Ray
Evernham No. 24 entry in the Busch Series next year. Donahue has
served as mechanic on the Winston Cup team the last four years.
``It's a perfect fit for our race teams plan to provide talented
individuals with an opportunity to progress in their career,''
Evernham said.
</P>
<P>
   Up close
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's point total of 5,143 assures him of the highest total
under the current points system. However, it is not the most
dominant total. Cale Yarborough scored 5,000 in 1977, the third
year of this system, in just 30 races. Gordon's point total after
30 races was just 4,817.

 &HT;    Testing ground, dividing spoils at NAPA 500
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox Nerws Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With no championship to chase or celebrate, today's
NAPA 500 is left with a two-fold purpose _ a testing ground for
1999 and divvying up the spoils that remain for this year's top 25
teams.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the Winston Cup teams came here facing the unknown
and got a full dose of it. Speeds were too fast even for these
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Now NASCAR is requiring taller spoilers and larger air dams for
safer racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NASCAR is comfortable with the way the rules are
now,'' said newly crowned Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon. ``We
want to race side-by-side and put on a good show and do some
passing. With the (old rules) we weren't able to do that. We're
hoping this will bring that back.''
</P>
<P>
   It will do that, but many drivers believe all the spoiler in the
world won't make the track what it was before. Not that it's bad,
but the new configuration can't offer the type of racing they've
had here before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shape of the track, the surface, everything they've done
to it has totally changed the way it used to be. I really like the
old one better,'' Gordon said. ``I think it offered much better
racing where we could run side by side and really put on a great
show for the fans and enjoy driving it at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a full day of practice and qualifying Friday, followed
by two long practice sessions Saturday, there has been nothing but
praise for NASCAR's spoiler-air dam adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be better racing, no doubt about that,'' said
pole winner Kenny Irwin, who started fifth in March and finished
fifth. ``More downforce will slow you down on the straightaways,
but if anything it's going to make you faster through the corners
because you're gonna have more downforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going 180 miles an hour going into the corner. I'm sure
everybody is concerned by that, but with the rules change it's made
it harder to spin out or get the car loose. So it's gonna be an
advantage in the race. It makes it easier to hold the line.

LEHIGH BEATS COLGATE, 41-22 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ Nick Martucci and Brian Wolovich, Lehigh's
defensive ends, did not believe that Ryan Vena, Colgate's heralded
quarterback, could walk on water. They chased him and chased him
Saturday, and caught him often enough to contain the Red Raiders'
high-octane offense in a stunning 41-22 victory for the Mountain
Hawks before a crowd of 13,432 at Goodman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the pivotal game in the Patriot League this season, one
that probably decided the championship and the conference's
automatic bid to the Division I-AA playoffs. Lehigh (9-0) continued
unbeaten, matching its best record since 1950, and it is alone in
first place with two games remaining, against Bucknell (5-4, 2-2 in
the Patriot League) and Lafayette (3-6, 3-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure felt good after last year,'' said Wolovich, who had
two of the four sacks of Vena. Last year Colgate beat Lehigh,
61-28, on the way to the Patriot League title.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's loss snapped a streak of nine straight league
victories for the Red Raiders (6-3, 3-1). Vena was held to 161
yards passing and 43 yards rushing; he was averaging 319 yards a
game in total offense, second in Division I-AA, and his team was
averaging 37.5 points. Colgate was favored, in part because it had
played some stronger opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh had 471 total yards and 29 first downs to 280 and 16 for
Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh's offensive standout was receiver Deron Braswell, who
caught two touchdown passes and threw one, too, on a play that
fooled the Colgate secondary. The two he caught were good for 46
and 26 yards, and they came from Phil Stambaugh, the latest in a
long line of outstanding Lehigh quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Stambaugh completed 26 of 40 passes for 273 yards and three
touchdowns. But his third and seventh attempts were intercepted,
resulting in touchdowns for Colgate, which led by 14-0 after nine
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   Stambaugh was intercepted three times in all, but two came on
deflections. One was returned 70 yards for a score by Jesse Boyd,
the Colgate free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a start like that, something good had to happen,''
Stambaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Much happened. Lehigh scored 35 unanswered points in the second
and third periods. Six came when Stambaugh threw the ball out wide
to Braswell, who in turn threw it 30 yards down the field to a
wide-open Kody Fedorcha.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 35-22 early in the fourth quarter, Vena took the Red
Raiders to the Lehigh 4-yard line. There, on fourth down, Martucci
and some teammates pursued Vena close to the sideline, where the
harried Colgate quarterback let go a wild incomplete pass into the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh then marched 96 yards for its final, convincing
touchdown, on Stambaugh's fourth-down, 26-yard pass to Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Vena at the 4 was the game's key play, according to
both coaches, Lehigh's Kevin Higgins and Dick Biddle of Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we score there, we're behind by only six points,'' Biddle
said. ``We didn't make the play. They made the big plays. We got
beat because they outplayed us.''

PENN BEATS PRINCETON, 27-14  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ Penn buried Princeton under an avalanche of 21
unanswered points five minutes into the game Saturday and watched
as the Tigers spent the rest of the afternoon struggling to dig
their way out. The Tigers couldn't do it, so Penn (6-2), which
entered the game tied with Princeton and Harvard for first place in
the Ivy League, walked away with a 27-14 victory before a crowd of
20,230 at Princeton Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Penn also walked away with sole possession of first place
because Brown defeated Harvard, 27-6, Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton (4-4) fell into a four-way tie with Brown, Harvard and
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, life is good,'' said Penn Coach Al Bagnoli. ``We
don't want to share this with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton entered the game with the best rushing defense in
Division I-AA, yielding an average of 54.1 yards a game. The Tigers
had given up a total of 156 rushing yards in four Ivy League games
and had not had a running back run for over 100 yards against them
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Penn running back Jim Finn was averaging 157 yards rushing
against Ivy League teams and was the last running back to rush for
over 100 yards against Princeton (146 yards last year).
</P>
<P>
   Finn cracked 1,000 yards for the season on his second carry of
the day (a 12-yard run) and proceeded to trample Princeton's
defense the remainder of the afternoon. He had 101 yards rushing by
halftime and finished with 164 yards on 39 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' problems began when they fumbled the opening
kickoff. Penn recovered the football at the Princeton 32 and five
plays later Quakers quarterback Matt Rader hit receiver Brandon
Carson, who had lined up wide left and alone, on a 13 yard
touchdown pass. That blown coverage was Princeton's first mix up of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Penn poured it on. A 34-yard punt return by safety Joe
Piela gave the Quakers a first down at the Tigers 28. On the first
play from scrimmage Finn took a pitch from Rader and threw a
touchdown pass to tight end Brandon Clay to help give Penn a 14-0
lead. It was the second time this year that Finn had thrown a
touchdown pass off that play and it was the second time this season
that a halfback pass had gone for a score against the Princeton
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The fumble bug hit the Tigers again on their next possession
when running back Derek Theisen lost the ball at Princeton's
18-yard line. Linebacker Jim Higsen recovered and on the next play,
Rader threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to receiver David Rogers. The
Quakers had taken a commanding 21-0 lead and with 10 minutes 10
seconds still to play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're sitting on the sideline and you've only run one
play and they're up 21-0, you're in shock,'' said Princeton
quarterback John Burnham, who completed 14-of-30 passes for 249
yards and 1 touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a complete knockout blow. Princeton managed to climb
back into the game by putting together a long scoring drive at the
beginning of the second quarter (11 plays, 71 yards in 4:54) and a
quick one near the end (five plays, 61 yards in 57 seconds).
</P>
<P>
   The first drive was capped by a 1-yard run by Theisen and the
second score came on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Burnham to
receiver Phillip Wendler. Penn had a 24-14 lead at half, but it
wasn't nearly as imposing as it once was. Even so, Princeton wasn't
able to get any closer than that and its chances to take sole
possession of first place in the Ivy League was washed away in a
sea of mistakes and missed opportunities.

 &HT;    Heat chills hunt
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Statistically, every Georgia hunter will get 1.25 deer
during the three-month hunting season this year. Hunters in the
early 1970s would have died for the opportunity; they rarely saw
deer, and the season was only a few weeks long.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is trouble in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters have complained about uncomfortable conditions in the
early part of deer season, since opening day was moved up from
November to October more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year is no different, but North Georgia hunters are
beginning to realize that missing even the first two weeks of the
season might not be critical, might even be a good idea now,
because they no longer have to deal with the December break.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the North Georgia deer season has been
interrupted near Dec. 7 and reopened for the week after Christmas,
cutting out two weeks of prime hunting time. No more.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of those weeks accounted for one theory on the
lower-than-normal turnouts in the Northern Zone. In the Southern
Zone the reason is obvious _ it's just plain hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deer don't move and hunters don't hunt,'' said Todd Holbrook,
game management chief of the Wildlife Resources Division of the
state Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters agree. ``I spent this past weekend in South Georgia and
saw a couple of young deer but nothing to shoot at,'' Russ Wheeler
of Fairburn said. ``The dry weather, coupled with 80-degree days,
have the deer laying low. Not much movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook's people concluded that deer hunting in general has
been a little slow for the first two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Deer processors agree that the heat might be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too hot for the deer to move well,'' said Mark Poole of
Shuler's Deer Cooler in Gainesville. ``A lot of hunters say they
haven't seen the deer moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Food source is another problem, because of the low acorn crop in
some areas, from weather problems caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's been a bad year for acorns, I thought they'd move
to other places, but a wildlife biologist told me they don't do
that,'' said Bill Hilsman of Hilsman's Cooler in McDonough. ``They
go to the trees they've fed at before and if they don't find acorns
they don't travel. They browse on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, then, will have to change their patterns and locate the
other food sources.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, those who live in suburban areas that
were formerly deer habitat have learned that deer also fancy
landscape plants. Shrubs in some areas are now nubs, and flowers
are history.
</P>
<P>
   And the mass of hunters in the field in October also might be
history if late November and mid-December hunting is as good as
some think it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rut takes place in Hall County about the week before
Christmas,'' Poole said. ``I expect we'll get some of the biggest
racks ever this year, because the season is open straight
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunters from Macon northward might find similar conditions, or
at least a respite from sweat, ticks and flying, stinging insects.
</P>
<P>
   Here's WRD's quick look around the state over the first two
weekends:
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest Georgia: The buck harvest so far is good to
excellent. Opening day was one of the best, according to wildlife
biologists in the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northeast Georgia: A typical buck harvest opening day. A few
counties had doe days the second weekend, and the harvest was off a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eastern Piedmont: The buck harvest is a little below average,
and the doe harvest is off some. Cooler lockers had mostly bucks on
the first doe day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Western Piedmont: Buck and doe harvest a little slow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southwest Georgia: Slow for bucks and does. It probably is
related to warm, dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southeast flat woods country: A little bit slow for bucks and
does, but not bad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coast: Good hunting, but the coast has an early rut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special points of interest: The Blue Ridge WMA had an
excellent primitive-weapons hunt, mostly muzzle-loaders, with more
than 100 deer and 10 bear. There was a good harvest in Dooly
County, one of Georgia's quality deer-management counties.

 &HT;    Hunting down a good read

<P>
   ATLANTA _ ON THE NEWS STAND
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta businessman Rex Baker has hunted just about everywhere
and his name has appeared in some of the biggest publications, but
now he's really made the big time, HOWL magazine.
</P>
<P>
   HOWL is written, edited, published and marketed by students at
Haralson County High School. They even sell the ads. It costs $3.50
a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is featured in the latest edition, which is also loaded
with a wealth of deer hunting information, from scouting to
skinning. Anyone wondering if there are any good teenagers left in
the world will get a welcome answer in HOWL.
</P>
<P>
   For information on where to get HOWL, call 770-574-5552.
</P>
<P>
   WANNA CATCH TROUT?
</P>
<P>
   You have to find a stream somewhere in North Georgia to fly fish
for trout, right? Well, not necessarily. A trip to Callaway Gardens
in Pine Mountain, an hour and a half south of Atlanta, may do the
trick, thanks to a stocking program. This is the fourth year
Callaway Gardens has stocked trout in Wren Lake; 500 pounds of
rainbows, weighing up to four pounds, will be stocked this year for
fishing to begin in November. Callaway also is stocking trout in
one of its creeks _ the name is being kept secret _ for guided
trips only. Guided trips, costing $175 for a half-day for one or
two people on Wren Lake, and $125 for one and $175 for two on the
stream, are available mid-November through March. For information,
call 1-800-225-5292.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S TIP
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.S. Army has come up with a way to prevent foot
blisters, and in the process keep your foot aroma from running your
partners away from camp. Field &AMP; Stream magazine reports in this
month's issue that the Army contends applying some deodorant
directly to the bottom of feet can decrease blisters during hikes.
Volunteers who applied antiperspirants to their feet at bedtime
three nights in a row before embarking on a long hike had a blister
rate of 21 percent, while those using a placebo had a rate of 48
percent.

 &HT;    In fall, deer road danger
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell, Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fall is one of the peak times of the year for deer-car
collisions. As deer begin to move around to find food and to breed,
they are more suspectible to being hit by a car, according to the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the heat of the summer, deer tend to move less and stay
in the woods under tree cover where it is cool,'' said Todd
Holbrook, chief of game management for DNR's Wildlife Resources
Division. ``As temperatures drop, deer become more active. People
see more deer this time of year than at any other time, and,
unfortunately, many of them are along roadsides.''
</P>
<P>
   Food source is a main reason the deer are on the move. Human
population also plays a role. Holbrook said metro Atlanta counties
Coweta, Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett all have high numbers of car-deer
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's deer herd is about 1.25 million, and the state's
319,000 hunters harvested more than 500,000 deer last season.
</P>
<P>
   Instant gun check coming
</P>
<P>
   Many hunters might not be aware that all new firearms purchases
_ rifles and shotguns, as well as handguns _ will require an
instant background check effective Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the proposed $14 fee for each check was repealed,
the National Shooting Sports Foundation said it still has concerns
about the transition to the National Instant Criminal Background
Check.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier duck hunting back
</P>
<P>
   Duck hunting is returning to Lake Lanier for the first time
since the 1980s, when the U.S. Corps of Engineers eliminated all
hunting on the 38,000-acre reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of successful goose hunting on the lake, the
Corps granted permission to hunt ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason they allowed duck hunting is because we've had zero
problems with goose hunting,'' WRD biologist Kent Kammermeyer said.
``They found out you could put quite a number of goose hunters on
the lake, and home owners didn't even realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   The season will run Nov. 21- Jan. 19, and as with goose hunting,
no duck hunting will be allowed within 1,000 feet of any dock,
house, structure, bridge, road, boat ramp, marina or open
recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   Kammermeyer said the area north of the Ga. 53 bridge probably
will have the best hunting. Hunters aren't likely to have a lot of
luck in the big part of the lake below Brown's Bridge. For more
information, contact the WRD's Gainesville office at 770-535-5700.
</P>
<P>
   Expect big catches
</P>
<P>
   If the bass fishing is as good on the Mississippi River Delta
late next summer as it was in the past month, look for some big
catches when the BASS Masters Classic stops in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The premier bass tournament will be held there for the first
time the final weekend of July, it was announced last week, and
although the tournament-record catch of 75 pounds, 9 ounces (Rick
Clunn, 21 fish, Arkansas River, 1984) might never be beaten,
because catch limits are now five fish per day, a three-day catch
near 50 pounds seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louisiana Top 150 Bassmaster Trail tournament held on the
Delta Oct. 14-17, Kenyon Hill won with a four-day total of 60-5.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian officials cracked down Saturday on
leaders of Islamic Jihad after the radical group claimed
responsibility for the suicide bombing of a packed Jerusalem
marketplace and vowed more such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday car bomb at the Mahane Yehuda market, which killed
the two assailants and wounded 21 passersby, has tested Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's pledge to do more to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian leaders said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, whose Cabinet halted talks on the ratification of the
new peace deal in response to the attack, should not use the
incident to avoid following through on the land-for-security deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Israeli government is as guilty as those who want to
destroy the peace process with acts of violence,'' Palestinian
Cabinet minister Nabil Shaath told reporters in Cairo. ``The
Israeli government seems happy to continue procrastinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said the Cabinet
would not convene again on whether to ratify the US-mediated
agreement until the Israeli prime minister is convinced the
Palestinian Authority is making a concerted effort to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the soonest the Cabinet would meet would be Tuesday
before ratification hearings scheduled for Wednesday in the Israeli
parliament. He also maintained that Netanyahu still has the nine
votes needed in his 17-member Cabinet to approve the plan, despite
speculation by many analysts that Friday's attack could unravel
Netanyahu's carefully crafted majority.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian forces said they had arrested at least six leaders
of the Islamic Jihad over the weekend and that they had raided and
shut down the Islamic Purity Nursery School in Bethlehem, which is
affiliated with the militant organization.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian forces also have rounded up several leaders of the
military wing of the Islamic organization Hamas and placed its
spiritual leader under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   These moves are a step toward Israel's demands that Palestinians
not only arrest militants, but clamp down on schools, mosques and
charities that Israeli officials have said serve as fronts for
militant activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Bar-Illan was skeptical of the measures, saying, ``We have
seen this charade of arresting people and releasing them before. It
is the revolving-door policy. We are tired of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack Friday night.
Leaders are now expressing fear that Netanyahu, who faces intense
political opposition from far-right factions of his coalition, will
use the bombing as a pretext for delaying implementation of the
two-week-old Wye agreement hammered out by both sides last month in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu seems to always have a reservoir of excuses for not
implementing the peace process,''Palestinian legislator Hanan
Ashrawi said. ``We fear that he will continue to delay while
simultaneously moving forward on the expansion of settlements and
laying the groundwork for the breakdown of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi also said that both of the bombers, who were identified
Saturday as brothers-in-law Yousef Zughayar, 21, and Suleiman
Tahayneh, 24, lived in areas of the West Bank which fall under full
Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making a 100 percent effort, but the fact that the two
men came from Israeli-controlled areas illustrates the difficulty
in stopping terrorism,'' Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan said, ``This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever
heard. The organizations, both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, exist in
the Palestinian Authority areas. This is where the terrorists are
recruited, trained, equipped, and where they get their orders.''
</P>
<P>
   A leaflet faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem Saturday in the name of
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. It was also
confirmed by a group leader in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This heroic attack, which was not the first and will not be
the last, was carried out ... to confront the great conspiracy that
aims to liquidate the Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye
Plantation agreements,'' the leaflet said.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant step toward meeting a key Israeli
condition within the staged implementation of the Wye agreement,
the PLO Executive Committee on Friday night approved a letter from
Arafat to President Clinton specifying that the clauses of the PLO
charter that call for Israel's destruction were null and void.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wye accord, the 300-member Palestinian Central Council
must next ratify the letter by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Israeli Cabinet said it would not carry out the
13 percent further troop withdrawls from the West Bank called for
under the accord unless the 700-member Palestine National Council
voted to annul the offending clauses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has plans for Clinton to attend the
Palestinian Central Council gathering in Gaza Dec. 17 and claims it
is intended to settle the charter issue once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic Jihad said the two bombers were members of the armed
wing of their organization. Both were killed in their red Fiat.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the two men said they met as teenagers in an
Israeli prison, where their fiery Islamic ideology took root.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Tahayneh in the Anata refugee camp said he had
recently married Zughayar's sister. They said he was an active
member of the young forces of the Palestinian intifada, or
uprising, in the late 1980s. They said he was wounded by Israeli
forces during a clash, which served to fuel his militancy.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Basma, showed reporters photographs of her husband
Saturday and a letter she said he wrote to her before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the Wye agreement, not the Palestinian Authority, or the
Israelis, or even Clinton, will stop me from meeting my God,'' the
letter said. ``If they can, let them try to stop me.''

DEVILS BEAT PANTHERS, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Devils found themselves Saturday reveling in
the new-found excitement of winning a scoring duel while wondering
about their old calling card, defense.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bobby Holik, the Devils' talented center, said it best:
``We got a great win, but we didn't play a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils made up for several defensive lapses by defeating the
Florida Panthers, 4-3, at National Car Rental Center. Asked about
his team's season-high offensive production, Devils Coach Robbie
Ftorek shrugged and said, ``It would have been nice if they didn't
get the three against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' victory, their fourth straight and their second over
Florida in a week, raised their record to 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they are now 4-1 on the road with a game at Tampa Bay
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Jay Pandolfo provided the clincher at 10 minutes 49
seconds of the third period. With his back to the net, he accepted
a pass from Brian Rolston, made a sudden half-turn right from eight
feet out and beat goalie Sean Burke in the net's left corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian was going to shoot it, but then he saw me and kind of
took a shot-pass and I just tipped it,'' Pandolfo said. ``A
redirection like that, the goalie doesn't know where the puck is
going to go. It was a great pass by Rollie.''
</P>
<P>
   Even defenseman Ken Daneyko scored Saturday. It was his first
goal since last Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more offensive under Robbie,'' he said. ``We're starting
to believe we can win these 4-3 games as well as the 2-1's.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors also received a controversial goal from wing Dave
Andreychuk. Petr Sykora's shot had been batted in the air and
sailed toward Andreychuk, who guided it to the ice with his hand
and slammed a 2-foot shot by Burke.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league rule, a player is not allowed to fold his
fingers on the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk admitted there was no way he could grab the puck from
over his head and not clutch it with his hand. Yet there was no
review.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he violated the rule, Andreychuk said sheepishly:
``Probably yes, I guess. They should have called it.''
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the situation with the referee Bill McCreary
afterward. ``He said it was close, but because I wasn't skating or
wasn't going by anybody, he decided not to call it,'' Andreychuk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the call that the referee did not make, Andreychuk
admitted to some luck in registering his fifth goal of the season.
``It's a quick play and I don't know where the goalie is,'' he
said. ``It's a lucky play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had opened the scoring on right wing Randy McKay's
15-footer just 6:09 into the game, following a perfect pass from
Holik.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this euphoria about scoring, the Devils allowed a
season-high 13 shots in the first period, made neutral-zone
mistakes that drew the ire of Ftorek and in general played worse
than the coach would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we did a very good job at times,'' Ftorek said. ``Then
we did some things that were out of the territory of our game plan,
and we had some problems. In the defensive zone, we didn't attack
like we're supposed to and we ran around instead of staying in
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Added goalie Martin Brodeur, talking about defense: ``This is
not the type of game we should be playing. If it is, it's going to
be a long year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of this game's scoring occurred in the first period, as if
the teams took time to work out the kinks of an early-afternoon
starting time.

NASCAR SAYS RULE NOT A CURB ON GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ NASCAR official Mike Helton said the decision to
alter the Winston Cup Series' aerodynamic ``Five-and-Five Rule''
for today's season-ending NAPA 500 is not a response to Jeff
Gordon's runaway season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to say that. It is not a reaction to his
dominance,'' said Helton, NASCAR's vice president for competition.
``Gordon and \Rcrew chief\S Ray Evernham and the Hendrick operation
are at a level right now that is pretty tough to beat. But it's
more a reaction to an overall perception among the drivers of being
comfortable to drive fast and race with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a 12-time winner this season, clinched his third
championship in four years at Rockingham, N.C., last Sunday. On
Monday, NASCAR officials announced modifications to the
``Five-and-Five'' governing rear-spoiler heights and front air-dam
clearances on the series' three makes of cars for this event at
Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Burton questions change
</P>
<P>
   While Jeff Gordon has the driver's championship in hand and Mark
Martin has clinched second place, several points races remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bobby Labonte _ who has won three of the last four
races at AMS _ is 109 points behind fifth-place Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explained Burton's disgust after qualifying only
35th in the 43-car field Friday at 189.073 mph. Burton started 10th
and finished eighth in the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus
during the Primestar 500 here in March under the ``Five-and-Five''
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I think about it, the more sense it doesn't make as
to why they did it,'' said Burton, referring to the modifications.
``I know the championship is over, but there still are a lot of us
battling for some crucial spots in the points standings. They
should have left everything alone because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the top 25 positions are separated by 50 points or
less.
Taz goes for a title
</P>
<P>
   Team Monte Carlo drivers will take a two-point lead _ and
special Tazmanian Devil Bowtie decals on their hoods _ into today's
finale for the NASCAR Manufacturers' Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet leads archrival Ford by 231-229. Points are awarded on
a 9-6-4 basis, with only the highest finisher for Chevy, Ford and
Pontiac receiving points. Chevy must finish ahead of Ford to win
its 21st title of NASCAR's modern era (since 1972).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for your brand to be No. 1,'' said seven-time
Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench
Service Plus Chevy. ``We won at Daytona, but Jeff Gordon has won
all season for Chevrolet. We'd like to contribute one more time
ourselves.''
Get out the vote
</P>
<P>
   Former Cup champion Bill Elliott is leading the fan vote that
would bag him his 13th NASCAR Winston Cup Most Popular Driver Award
in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon are the top three in
voting conducted by the National Motorsports Press Association.
Voting ends at midnight tomorrow. To vote, call 1-900-903-0909. The
call costs 79 cents.

KEVIN SMITH'S PLAY ROOTED IN CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Kevin Smith, a cornerback under fire, was
talking this week at Valley Ranch about growing up on the Texas
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tree in the yard, and when it was summer, I loved
that tree,'' he said. ``It provided so much shade. But in the fall,
the leaves fell, and my father made me rake the yard. I hated that
tree then.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith paused, waiting on a visitor to grasp his analogy between
being a cornerback and dealing with that tree back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm playing well, people like me,'' he continued. ``At
the moment, people don't like me. The panic button is being pushed.
Just because the tree lost some leaves, it doesn't mean it isn't a
good tree. With me, the results haven't been the same this season.
But I'm the same. I'm still a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? What about the ``loss of confidence'' theory? ``Not at
all,'' answered Smith, firmly.
</P>
<P>
   What about Achilles tendon surgery stripping physical skills?
``Wrong ... very wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What about the ``Deion factor'' causing an overload of work?
``Somewhat legitimate, but what it really means is I should be
making more plays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On that part, there is no debate. Then again, Kevin Smith, 28,
has made such a habit of being open and honest, debate has rarely
been an option during his seven years with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Search every corner of an NFL locker room, and the most
confident, self-assured team member usually is a cornerback. The
nature of the position demands it. They are out there alone so
often. Their mistakes are instant replay heaven for the TV guys.
</P>
<P>
   What always has separated Smith is a stand-up-guy approach to
the job. That has been magnified this season more than any, maybe
because this, by far, has been his worst. But Smith does not hide.
He does not pout. He does not make excuses. He does not blame
outside critics like the media or the fans. He does not ask out of
a game by faking injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, even some top stars on the Cowboys do not
qualify on all those points.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all that, however, Smith is paid like a top corner in the
NFL. This season he hasn't performed like one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay strong, because I have a belief in myself,'' he said.
``I am what I am, and I thank my parents for that. I can guarantee
everybody one thing _ when my career is over, nobody will have to
take a board and hit me in the head to get my attention. I will
know when it's time to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   For this season, Smith had a rare criticism-free game last
Monday in Philly. But against the Eagles' offense, well ...
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giants are at Texas Stadium today, and it's another
struggling offense, although not as bad as the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was sitting in a dark meeting room, watching tape of the
Giants against Washington last weekend. Then he switched to the
last meeting between the Giants and Cowboys, and used the clicker
to fast-forward to the play where he was beaten for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch the bottom (of the screen),'' he said to a visitor.
``See, I'm right there on him. He's got position on me, but I'm
right there. See that, I touched the ball. But it's still six.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mentioned that the film showed the safety arrived late
and there also was no quarterback pressure. Smith ignored the
comment. ``It's my play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith keeps count of the touchdown passes this season he feels
responsible for. ``There's been four, and I had my hand on the ball
on three of them,'' he said. ``That's the aggravating part. Why
didn't I make all three of those plays? I'd be desperate right now
if (the receivers) had beaten me by 10 yards. But I'm right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret the Cowboys have a pass rush problem. To create
pressure, the blitz is necessary. The corners are often left in
single coverage. Plus, Deion rarely sees action on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say the standards are very high around here,'' said
Smith. ``The fans, the media, a lot of them think we aren't ever
suppose to give up anything. It doesn't work that way, of course. I
want to be part of a good defensive unit, and thus far, we've been
a good unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one has to tell me my game hasn't been what my game has
been in the past. I know it. I also know what I can do. I have not
lost confidence in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Smith still seeks the shade of that yard
tree.

   ``Let's just say the standards are very high around here,'' said
Smith. ``The fans, the media, a lot of them think we aren't ever
suppose to give up anything. It doesn't work that way, of course. I
want to be part of a good defensive unit, and thus far, we've been
a good unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one has to tell me my game hasn't been what my game has
been in the past. I know it. I also know what I can do. I have not
lost confidence in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Smith still seeks the shade of that yard
tree.

THESE 10 FACING BUMP OFF THE COACHING CAROUSEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is to Dick Vermeil's credit: When he does something, he goes
all-out.
</P>
<P>
   So when the St. Louis Rams fire Vermeil (and that's not a risky
prediction; in the unlikely event it doesn't happen after this
season, it inevitably happens soon after that, right?), he will at
least be able to say he did it his way.
</P>
<P>
   His coaching epitaph:
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach went all-out. And then he just went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil is a good coach and a good man. Example:
</P>
<P>
   After the Rams lost their home opener to the Saints, Vermeil got
a letter from season-ticket holder Jeff Roberts. Roberts wrote that
he'd worked hard to make the money to afford the tickets and was
``disgusted with the way the team played and more or less the way
you coached.'' He enclosed his remaining tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil had his wife track down Roberts and invited him and his
6-year-old son to the team meeting the night before the next home
game. After the meeting, Vermeil reached into his pocket for the
tickets and said, ``I believe these belong to you, if you want them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil earned himself a fan for life _ but not a job for life.
He's one of as many as 10 NFL coaches who seem to be on the same
hot seat that ejected Kevin Gilbride from San Diego. The coaches
listed in an educated-guess order of their possible departure:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ray Rhodes, Philadelphia: Rhodes finds himself enveloped by
rumors that have him getting canned and the specifics of who would
replace him. Eagles players are likely to push for defensive
coordinator Emmitt Thomas. Owner Jeff Lurie, a star-gazer, is
enamored with the idea of hanging around with legend Don Shula.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ted Marchibroda, Baltimore: Marchibroda's task with the
Ravens was to give them offensive spark. This 2-6 team has no
offense and no spark. Owner Art Modell issued Marchibroda, who is
in the final year of his contract, a vote of confidence ``before
the season.'' That should have been our first hint.
</P>
<P>
   3. Norv Turner, Washington: Nice guys finish last. And when
you're a nice guy who can't develop a quarterback, can't get your
star receiver to attend practice (that's why Michael Westbrook was
benched last Sunday) and can't get production out of a pair of $57
million defensive tackles, you not only finish last, you might be
lucky to finish the season.
</P>
<P>
   4. June Jones, San Diego: If Gilbride's replacement with the
Chargers can show progress with rookie QB Ryan Leaf, he stands a
chance. Of course, I've always wondered about an assistant in a bad
program getting promoted to lead the bad program. If the assistant
has solutions to the problems, why doesn't he implement them while
he's an assistant?
</P>
<P>
   5. Vermeil, St. Louis: Old-timer Vermeil is plagued by
young-timer problems. From the well-documented difficulties of
Lawrence Phillips to rookie Leonard Little allegedly driving drunk
and killing a woman to quarterback Tony Banks missing a team flight
to hang with his girlfriend, the Rams' on-field problems seem
minute. If Vermeil isn't fired, it'll be because he remains one of
the great self-salesmen in football and because he'd be due $5.7
million for the three years remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bruce Coslet, Cincinnati: Coslet has continued a Cincinnati
tradition. At 2-6, he fits right in with the Bengals' traditional
first-half woes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Dave Wannstedt, Chicago: Wannstedt's record (3-5) is
improving. So is his relationship with personnel boss Mark Hatley.
Bears ownership is pondering the question: Would Wannstedt have
been successful long ago had he not been given personnel power? Or
is his relative success now a fluke that has nothing to do with
Hatley assuming control?
</P>
<P>
   8. Vince Tobin, Arizona: It all depends on both how the
Cardinals finish and how high owner Bill Bidwill set the bar.
Arizona is 4-4. Is that perceived as good? Maybe, since the
Cardinals haven't been as good as 4-4 since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   9. Dennis Erickson, Seattle: Had Mike Holmgren been able to pry
himself loose from the Packers last off-season, Erickson would be
unemployed now. Seattle's 1998 spending spree suggests that
Erickson must get something out of all that money (playoff berth)
to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   10. Dom Capers, Carolina: He was once the perfect man for this
spot, and this season is the first time his Panthers have ever been
less than respectable. Owner Jerry Richardson is likely to stick
with his chosen one, though a record of say, 3-13, should earn
Capers some scrutiny.
Numbers Game
</P>
<P>
   4: The number of different quarterbacks that started for the
Saints last season, and the same number that will start for the
Saints this season, as soon as Kerry Collins moves to the first
team. In 1997, it was Heath Shuler, Billy Joe Hobert, Doug
Nussmeier and Danny Wuerffel. This season it's Hobert, Wuerffel,
Billy Joe Tolliver and, eventually, Collins.
Trivial pursuit
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Pro Bowl backfield of Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn
have combined for five touchdowns this season. All five have come
at home.
Quotable
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not a better team than us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Eagles defensive end Hugh Douglas on the Cowboys. Dallas is
5-3. Douglas' Eagles are 1-7. News flash, Hugh: Every team is a
better team than the Eagles.
Check out ...
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that Bill Parcells' magic kicks in right about
now. The Jets coach, at 5-3 and involved in a four-way tie for the
AFC East lead, has a reputation for willing his teams to success
this time of year. Jets watchers are reporting that Parcells makes
certain his injured players are truly injured by poking at their
injuries. Really. ``I'll be fine,'' says Jets receiver Wayne
Chrebet, issuing a medical update on his ankle problem, ``if
certain people quit kicking me in the ankle.''
AFC Buzz
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says you can't win big without a passing
game. Even if that's not true, I say you can't win big without some
contribution from the quarterback. Case in point: Pittsburgh's
Kordell Stewart continues to struggle as a passer (he threw three
interceptions in last week's lost to the Oilers and then called it
``my best game of the year'') and doesn't make up for it by running
(three carries, 4 yards). And don't think there aren't Steelers
insiders who think veteran Mike Tomczak might give Pittsburgh a
better chance to win. ... Is Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac,
with the Chiefs 0-3 since his return from injury, playing well
enough himself to openly criticize underachieving teammates? Grbac
has since apologized for naming names, but the damage may have
already been done to a disappointing 4-4 team that trails Denver by
four games in the AFC West. ... The Dolphins are at home against
the 1-7 Colts, a team playing well on offense with rookie
quarterback Peyton Manning against a Dolphins team that has allowed
just 16 points at home this season. ... Look for Miami rookie
runner John Avery to get substantial time against Indianapolis. ...
Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde is getting some MVP attention now
that he's taken over for Glenn Foley. But in 11 NFL seasons,
Testaverde's had only one winning season. ... The voters of Denver
approved the new stadium. Now they need to make certain Mile High
Magic moves across the street, too. The Broncos have won 20
consecutive home games. ... Jacksonville rookie runner Fred Taylor
is battling injuries to score seven touchdowns in his past five
games. ... The Chiefs play Seattle looking for an eighth
consecutive victory against the Seahawks. ... Baltimore's Priest
Holmes made a huge impression five weeks ago with a 173-yard
rushing total. In the four games since, he has 156 yards.
NFC Buzz
</P>
<P>
   The best-kept secret as a most valuable player candidate? How
about Atlanta's Jamal Anderson, the third most productive runner in
the NFL (trailing only a couple of guys named Terrell Davis and
Barry Sanders) and the main reason the surprising Falcons are 6-2.
... NFC East teams are 5-17 outside the division. ... A slump is
relative. That's why Vikings rookie Randy Moss, who hasn't scored a
touchdown in three games after catching six in his first five, is
considered to be in a slump. ... Giants critics arguing for the
replacement of quarterback Danny Kanell must be forgetting that his
backup is Kent Graham. ... A chance for Washington to gain some
respectability: The Redskins play the Cardinals twice in the next
three weeks. If you believe in matchups, you believe the 1-7
Redskins will keep them close. Washington swept the Cardinals last
season. ... The 2-6 Rams are coming off a first half that featured
eight games against teams that are .500 or better (42-22). ... A
49ers vulnerability: San Francisco has missed three extra points
and six of 15 field-goal attempts. ... Is it fair to criticize
Atlanta, whose victories are against teams with a combined record
of 12-36? ... Philadelphia averages 10 points a game, less than
half the league average. ... You think Kevin Smith is the only
cornerback having a tough year? New England's Chris Canty had his
driver's license suspended this week for driving with expired
plates and with an open alcohol container is his car. And San
Francisco's Antonio Langham is still reeling from being benched two
weeks ago. The 49ers paid Langham a $3.2 million signing bonus to
jump from Baltimore. His numbers in his first six games: six
touchdown passes allowed, eight penalties. Now, Langham is fourth
on the depth chart, behind rookie J.W. McQuarters. ... Quarterback
Steve Beuerlein hasn't been bad for Carolina; his 66.4 completion
percentage leads the NFL. Too bad he can't get help from a running
game that ranks last in the NFL.

NHL LOOKING TO CURE DETERIORATING ICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue of bad ice is heating up in the NHL, and league
general managers who were meeting in New York last week said they
hope to do something about it soon.
</P>
<P>
   Not a moment too soon, Stars players are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice is awful everywhere, especially'' at Reunion Arena,
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``The snow is piling up four or five
minutes into the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Media pundits in Detroit and Edmonton last season unfairly
referred to the Reunion Arena ice as having the consistency of a
Slurpee. Led by players like Modano, the Stars rallied to the
defense of the North Texas ice makers who had brought in
dehumidifiers to make the ice ``just as good as Joe Louis Arena,''
Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   But Modano and his teammates say that ice has had serious
problems this fall. The portable dehumidifiers, which were an
expensive addition for the playoffs, have since been returned and
humid weather in North Texas has created a soft ice surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the ice is soft, the sharp blades of the players' skates
chew it up more quickly and the end product is ``snow,'' or ice
shavings, on the ice. When snow piles up too high, the puck won't
move as quickly and players can't skate as fast. The end result is
the quality of the game goes down because Mike Modano can't keep
the puck on his stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he can't do it, think about the rest of us,''
defenseman Shawn Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't unique to Reunion Arena. With more teams
moving to the hot and humid Sun Belt, there are more arenas with
bad ice. With more teams creating huge buildings that are almost
impossible to keep cool and dry, the ice is going to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   So the league is looking into making a few minor adjustments as
quickly as possible, Stars general manager Bob Gainey said. The
league's general managers have decided to first study a plan that
would prevent the traditional warmup skate between periods. This is
one of the key moments in the ice-curing process as more and more
arenas stage between period activities on the ice. The Zambonis
then have to rush to flood the ice between periods, and 40 players
are back out on the ice chopping it up in the warmup skate before
it's had a chance to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is thinking about allowing only the six players who will
start the ensuing period on the ice, while the rest of the players
go straight to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it's done in juniors and in the Olympics,'' Gainey
said. `'It's a very small change and if it can improve the quality
of the game, it's worth looking into.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said the change could come as quickly as within the next
month. Also studied was a plan to move the pregame skate, typically
starting 30 minutes before the game to 40-45 minutes before the
game. That would give the ice more time to cure after it gets an
extensive chewing. In addition, the NHL has talked about making
sure any between-period activities are completed quickly so that
the Zamboni can resurface the ice in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the ice problems come at a time when the NBA lockout
has given arenas the chance to leave the ice uncovered for long
periods of time _ something that should make for better ice. But
the NHL is in a vicious cycle as players try to adjust. As one
insider said, ``When the ice is bad, the players say they want
their skates sharper. The sharper they make their skates, the more
it tears up the ice. I don't know how you stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For right now, the NHL will try one step at a time.
Slap shots
Cat fur flying
</P>
<P>
   The agent for Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Felix ``The Cat''
Potvin is steaming. The Leafs apparently have stopped shopping
Potvin, who demanded a trade three months ago when Toronto acquired
free-agent goalie Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix's nerves are basically raw right now,'' said his agent,
Jay Fee, who said Potvin has told the Maple Leafs how he feels.
Glass houses
</P>
<P>
   Senators fans are up in arms over the fact Flyers center Eric
Lindros wasn't suspended for a hit that gave Senators winger
Andreas Dackell a concussion. But Lindros' brother Brett, who had
his career ended by post-concussion syndrome, said the NHL should
look at seamless glass, the rock hard substance that the Senators
employ, instead of his brother's ability to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the NHL should share the cost \Rto replace it\S because
not only is it the teams losing players, but the whole league,''
Brett Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano's shoulder injury last season was, in
part, blamed on the seamless glass in Phoenix.
Spark plug The New York Rangers can't stop buzzing about how much
former Stars winger Todd Harvey has meant to their team. Harvey,
who came in a trade for Brian Skrudland and Mike Keane in March,
has three goals and two assists, but more importantly has given the
tired Blueshirts a kick in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings so much energy and feistiness to our lineup,''
goalie Mike Richter told ``Newsday''. ``Every shift he seems to be
working hard, and you can't have enough of that because other guys
see that, take a cue from him and do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars winger Bob Errey, who came along in the package, is
playing in the minors, and the Rangers say they still feel they got
the best of the deal.
Another view ``I say raise a glass to unnecessary risks, because my
theory has always been there are 27 people on this continent who
like to see good defensive hockey, and not a one pays to see a
hockey game _ they're all NHL coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton Journal'' columnist Mark Spector on the Oilers' brand
of taking risks and playing ``Firewagon Hockey.'' The Buzz Western
Conference Coyotes fans are scratching their heads after watching
hard-working veteran center Cliff Ronning get traded to the
Nashville Predators for future considerations. Coyotes general
manager Bobby Smith is hoping to open up playing time for rookie
Daniel Briere on the second line. ... From the ``Could you use a
Sniper'' Department, the Blues have outshot opponents 290-199 but
have outscored them only 23-21 through nine games. You think they
miss that Hull fella yet. ... Maybe Canucks coach Mike Keenan is
smarter than everyone else. When outsiders thought the Canucks had
no defense, youngsters Mattias Ohlund and Adrian Aucoin are not
only scoring 10 and 8 points, respectively, but are among the
league-leaders in plus-minus. ... With the Avalanche continuing its
slump, it appears unsigned defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh is not close
to coming to terms. Avs GM Pierre LaCroix and Ozolinsh's agent Paul
Theofanous were arguing about who wouldn't call whom last week and
hadn't even started working toward a contract compromise. ... The
Hawks have sent 330 goal-scorer Eddie Olczyk to the minors and are
concentrating on their young forwards. ... Talk about all or
nothing. Flames winger Theo Fleury has seven goals in 10 games, six
on two hat tricks.
Eastern Conference
</P>
<P>
   The Senators have used as motivation the bone-jarring hit on
winger Andreas Dackell by Flyers center Eric Lindros that gave
Dackell a concussion. Since the hit, the Senators beat the Flyers
twice and took over the top spot in the East. ... Hoping for the
kind of breakout year Jason Allison had last season, the Bruins are
growing frustrated with Joe Thornton's progress. Coach Pat Burns
benched him last week during a 2-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes.
``If you don't try, you're not going to play,'' Burns said.
Thornton had eights shots through the first 11 games. ... Winger
Geoff Sanderson already has improved on last season's output with
the Sabres. He has five goals in nine games, as opposed to four in
26 after last season's trade from the Canucks. ... Domink Hasek is
now the winningest goalies in Sabres' history with a 157-120-48
record, topping Don Edwards. The Stars' franchise record for wins
is 143 set by Cesare Maniago. ... Bruins winger P.J. Axelsson
received his second concussion in as many weeks. This one courtesy
of the Sabres' Matthew Barnaby. The last from Dave Manson. Manson
was suspended. Barnaby is expected to be. Geez, leave the little
guy alone, already. ... Panthers winger Mark Parrish was selected
rookie of the month after scoring six goals in 10 games. ... The
Canadiens have lost winger Scott Thornton (torn abdomen muscle) to
go with center Saku Koivu, who has the same problem.

<P>
   Wednesday, Edmonton at Toronto: Curtis Joseph faces the Oilers,
for whom he played last season, in a surprisingly important meeting
between two surprisingly winning clubs.

   Thursday, Carolina at San Jose: Hurricanes goalie Arturs Irbe
makes his only appearance of the season at the Shark Tank as a
conquering hero and NHL player of the month.

RIVALRIES ENGULF POST-GINGRICH HOUSE GOP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite throughout)   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Speaker Newt Gingrich's abrupt
resignation, the race for House Speaker was far from settled and
Republicans predicted Saturday that the roiling competition would
soon engulf most of the top positions in the House Republican
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief appearance outside his home in suburban Atlanta,
Gingrich repeated his warning to his divided party not to
``cannibalize itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed in a brown leather bomber jacket, he said, ``The
prospects of Al Gore as president and a Democratic Congress should
be enough to focus every Republican in the country on learning to
work as a team in a powerful way to make sure we have a better
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich had hoped to bring some unity to his fractious
caucus by stepping down, his departure instead started a scramble
to reassess support and opened the floodgates for candidates of a
party reeling from an election that cost Republicans five House
seats instead of bringing the opposition party its traditional
gains in an off-year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, whose challenge drove Gingrich out of the
speaker's chair, was considered the favorite in the race, having
worked for a year to line up votes.
</P>
<P>
   His position was strengthened further when Rep. Bill Archer of
Texas, the Ways and Means chairman, announced that he had decided
overnight not to run. But Archer, 70, declined to endorse anyone
for speaker. ``We're going through a catharsis in the Republican
Party discussing how we should move ahead in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Christopher Cox, 46, a telegenic soft-spoken lawmaker
from California, announced his candidacy for speaker overnight on
CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' He reminded Republicans that he had
served in the Reagan White House and stressed his relative youth.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than recoiling from a fight, many Republicans said they
were relishing the open competition as they considered what face
they wanted to put forward to the nation in place of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a smile on my face and joy in my heart because this is
a day I've been looking for,'' Rep. Steve Largent, of Oklahoma,
said on Friday night in his own appearance with Larry King to
promote his candidacy for House majority leader against Rep. Dick
Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Largent said, ``What the Republican Party needs so desperately
is not retreads, not the old has-beens, but the new fresh ideas,
fresh faces, and I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   In one odd moment of humor, showing the flux in the House, Cox
joked that he could lobby for support from Largent, even as the two
were using the program as a platform for their separate
candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   The House leadership races are likely to become not just a
battle of personalities, but a struggle between different factions
of the Republican Party with conflicting ideological agendas. Rep.
Mark Foley, a Florida Republican, said that whoever became speaker
will face a difficult job moderating among all the House factions.
``Whoever is running for Speaker ought to start jogging, lifting
weights, taking multi-vitamins and praying because it will be a
long haul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether the struggle would have any effect
on the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton. Asked about the
inquiry on Friday, Livingston said simply that the matter was being
handled by the House Judiciary Committee and that ``I, like all of
the other members, await their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates worked the phones through the weekend and Republican
offices on Capitol Hill were unusually packed with staff members
and vote counters for a Saturday in a Congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they were longing for a speaker who could
become a Ronald Reagan or who could replicate the successes of the
Republicans who had won gubernatorial elections in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida and Texas, by putting forward a conservatism that
seems inclusive and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Scarborough, a Florida Republican pointed to the
transformation of Jeb Bush, who lost a race for governor of Florida
four years ago but won on his second try on Tuesday and captured
more than half of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, Jeb sounded like us,'' he said, referring to his own
revolutionary class of Republicans who won the House in 1994 on the
``Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In '98, he sounded like very few Republicans I have ever
heard,'' Scarborough said. ``I heard him talk to Hispanics and
African-Americans, and he was on fire. He came across better with
those groups than middle-class whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the signs that the speaker's race was consolidating into
a fight between Livingston, a pragmatic committee baron, and Cox, a
conservative stressing his youth and California base, Republicans
said the situation was fluid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``The Newt bombshell completely threw off the vote counts,''
said a House Republican official. ``There was not enough time to
gauge how many votes people had and members weren't committing
their votes one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas said that members who had given
their backing to Livingston had done so expecting him to challenge
either Armey or Gingrich. ``It was seen as a Livingston versus
Gingrich fight,'' Sessions said. The Livingston forces, he said,
``will have to go back and retest what they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.James M. Talent, 42, of Missouri, also indicated that he
might seek the speaker's post. And Republicans dissatisfied with
the field were casting about for possible draft candidates, like
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the Budget Committee chairman, or Rep.
Henry Hyde, the 74-year-old chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. Some Republicans even tried unsuccessfully to recruit
Rep. Bill Paxon of upstate New York, who is retiring. A speaker
does not have to be a sitting member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is the most powerful figure in the House and follows
the vice president as the next in the line of succession for the
presidency. The speaker also controls committee assignments and
chairmanships, in that way exerting powerful sway over the
legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But many other positions will be up for grabs when House
Republicans convene later this month to select their leaders for
the incoming 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hell is breaking loose,'' said a senior Republican aide.
``Everybody's jumping in. I wouldn't be surprised if members start
running for multiple positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, a folksy conservative, has already been challenged by
Largent. And some Republicans said that Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois was considering a race for majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio, the fourth-ranking leader who
serves as chairman of the House Republican Conference, faces one
rival so far, Rep. George P. Radanovich of California, another
member of the class of '94. Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., an Oklahoma
Republican, was also entering the competition.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Rep. Tom DeLay, a Texan who is the Republican whip
in the House, appeared to be fending off competition. DeLay, whose
role is to count votes, has the support of his 65-member whip
organization. Republicans now have just under two weeks to mount
their leadership campaigns. Republicans select their new leaders at
an organizing meeting for the 106th Congress scheduled for Nov. 18.
The session is presided over by the chairman of the Republican
conference, Boehner, and the voting takes place by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The winners must be elected later on the House floor when the
new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia Saturday, Gingrich explained his reason for choosing
to leave Congress altogether. ``I think as a practical matter for
me to stay in the House would make it impossible for a new leader
to have a chance to grow, to lead, and to do what they need to
do,'' he said. He said he was confident a Republican would hold his
district.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his stunning departure, Gingrich won praise from
many of the Republicans he had worked with most closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few men or women have had a greater impact on the Republican
Party and the nation over the last decade than Newt Gingrich,''
said Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. ``I will
miss his visionary leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate leadership elections come in December. Thus far, Lott
appears safe, although the editors of the conservative magazine
National Review publicly urged Lott's second-in-command, Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, to challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who for four years had been Gingrich's second-in-command,
said, ``Newt Gingrich deserves a place in history right next to
Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans Saturday were already showcasing fresh faces and
a new tone. Their weekly radio address was delivered by one of the
newly elected incoming representatives, Greg Walden of Oregon, a
41-year-old radio station owner.
</P>
<P>
   He asked President Clinton to join with Republicans in Congress
``in dedicating the next two years not to partisanship and
posturing, but to real honest-to-goodness problem- solving where we
debate policies, not personalities.''

GLENN, CREWMATES RETURN TO EARTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MARK CARREAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Astronaut John Glenn, the world's oldest
space traveler, returned to Earth on Saturday ready for a short
stroll and full of graditude for those who followed his voyage so
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle swept to a landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center at
11:03 a.m., CST, with shuttle commander Curt Brown and pilot Steve
Lindsey at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's braking parachute, exposed during the spacecraft's
Oct. 29 liftoff when a cover panel fell away, remained secured
within its unprotected tail compartment, just as engineers
predicted. Re-entry was never jeopardized by the loss of the
11-pound aluminum plate.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old Glenn joined his six crewmates for a
seven-minute walk-around inspection of Discovery after the landing.
Nearly two hours after plunging back to Earth, Glenn appeared a bit
wobbly on the tour and accepted discreet assistance from NASA
administrator Dan Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   The unsteadiness is common among astronauts when they return to
Earth and a temporary condition, said Dr. Sam Pool, NASA's director
of space medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference for Glenn and his crewmates was canceled
Saturday night when flight surgeon Dr. Philip Stepaniak ruled that
rest was more important. The crew will speak with reporters this
(Sunday) morning before returning to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was not too ill to participate, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone. ``He's fine. They just have a lot of medical exams to take.
They have been awake since 3 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The aging astronaut offered strong assurances of his well being
moments after the landing, while still strapped into Discovery's
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to reprise a statement I made a long, long time
ago,'' Glenn radioed mission control. ``One G (force of Earth's
gravity) and I feel fine.``
</P>
<P>
   When he became the first American to orbit the Earth on Feb. 20,
1962, Glenn informed ground controllers from his rising Mercury
capsule: ``Zero G, and I feel fine.``
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's communique was Glenn's way of reassuring a landing
audience that included his wife, Annie, and his son and daughter,
David and Lyn.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Glenn said her mother was delighted when her father came
down from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw dad, mom said `Look at him walk!' She was so happy
he walked off the shuttle,'' Lyn Glenn said.`` She knew that was
very important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In his radio message after touchdown, Glenn thanked the legions
of people around the world who watched this mission as closely as
his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those whose prayers, along with my own, followed us around
the world, our heartfelt thanks and appreciation,'' he said Glenn.
``To all the NASA team ... that continue to do the superb research
job that benefits every home in this nation, and often without
notice or proper recognition, our thanks and my personal thanks for
a job well done.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission marked a personal triumph for Glenn, who after his
solo Mercury mission was denied a second opportunity to fly during
the race to the moon because of his celebrity status. He had to
wait until attaining successful careers in business and politics to
press his case again.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Goldin announced that the Ohio senator would fly on
Discovery and participate in a range of medical experiments. The
research was designed to take advantage of Glenn's age, 16 years
greater than the previous oldest human to fly, and allow
researchers to compare the stresses of spaceflight with those that
accompany the natural aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin hailed the success of the venture on Saturday but said
NASA will turn its efforts to the more demanding task of building
the U.S.-led international space station rather than pursue new
experiments with elderly astronauts or flying others with a
celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into flying someone who has a scientific contribution to
make or if there is a specific reason to send them,'' Goldin said.
``But we're not going to send celebrities into space.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight engineer Scott Parazynski, payload commander Steve
Robinson, Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai, European Space Agency
astronaut Pedro Duque, Brown, Lindsey and Glenn remained in Florida
overnight undergoing medical exams, visiting with family and
resting.
</P>
<P>
   They were to return to Houston today, (Sunday) with arrival
expected at Ellington Field in Clear Lake at about 2 p.m., CST. The
Johnson Space Center planned a public welcoming ceremony at hangar
990.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew tackled more than 80 experiments in disciplines
as wide-ranging as astronomy and biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn participated in a dozen medical experiments that will give
scientists a hint of how the cardiovascular, nervous, muscle,
skeletal and immune systems of the elderly respond to
weightlessness. In contrast, Glenn's 1962 flight spanned less than
five hours and he remained restrained in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   The most extensive investigations Glenn participated in will
study changes in the way his body metabolized proteins for muscle
tissue renewal as well as his sleep patterns. The Earthbound
elderly and younger astronauts in orbit experience similar losses
of muscle mass and problems sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's physical readaptation to gravity will be scrutinized as
well, likely keeping him at JSC until Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dibs on Sen. Glenn for a little while after the
flight,'' said John Charles, the NASA scientist who is coordinating
the medical studies. ``But we will be willing to share him as much
as possible.``
</P>
<P>
   The city of Houston plans a parade for Glenn and his shuttle
crewmates on Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, (Sunday) Glenn will stay at Johnson dressed in a
sensor-laden helmet that will record his brain waves, pulse,
respiration and muscle movements as he sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   He's free Monday night but must return to Johnson on Tuesday and
Wednesday to repeat the sleep monitoring. He was similarly
monitored while he trained for the flight and for four nights while
in space as part of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will also join several other members of the crew at the
Baylor College of Medicine for muscle studies.
</P>
<P>
   In one evaluation, researchers will use magnetic resonance
imaging to measure changes in the soft tissue between the bones of
the vertebra as well as changes in calf and upper body muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The post-mission debriefings and medical testing should draw to
a close in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn has said she hopes her husband's spaceflight will
mark an end to his long and often risky public career as a Marine
Corps aviator, test pilot, NASA astronaut and member of Congress.
In January, he retires from the Senate after 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to have him home,'' Annie Glenn said in
Houston last week. ``I would like to have some private time. We
have our car here and I know we both are looking forward to taking
at least five days alone in our car as Mr. and Mrs. John Glenn.``

STATE COLLEGES SAID TO ACCECT TOO MANY NEEDING REMEDIAL CLASSES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three state colleges and three University of
Massachusetts campuses have violated the state's new academic
policies by accepting too many freshmen who did not meet admissions
standards or who needed remedial help, according to a state
auditor's report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While several schools cited in the report denied any violations,
Higher Education Chancellor Stanley Z. Koplik vowed to impose stiff
financial penalties on schools failing to meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the business of making policy and ignoring
implementation,'' he said. ``The policy is made for a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The report from Auditor Joseph DeNucci looked at whether
four-year undergraduate campuses complied with tougher admission
standards that began in fall 1997. The audit reflected a random
sample of 10 percent of each college's entering class that fall.
</P>
<P>
   The report also investigated whether the schools followed rules
on remedial education. After many campuses were found to be
educating many undergraduates still struggling with high
school-level reading and math, the state Board of Higher Education
adopted standards in 1995 to shift remedial assistance to community
colleges and upgrade the quality of four-year institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Fitchburg State College, Westfield State College, and the
Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts in North Adams were cited for
violating the 15 percent cap on the number of ``special
admissions'' students admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Special admissions students, who are admitted based on
potential, are defined as those who fail to meet set grade-point
and academic criteria for the schools. They also do not fit into
other specialized categories, such as admission programs for the
learning disabled or vocational-technical students.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowell and Dartmouth campuses of the University of
Massachusetts also were cited for violating the special admissions
limit. These two campuses, as well as UMass-Boston, were cited for
violating the state mandate that no more than 10 percent of
freshman could be enrolled in remedial reading, writing, and math
courses.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's office said it was scheduling an audit of
UMass-Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Salem State College was cited for violations in a previous
audit, and was excluded from Friday's report.
</P>
<P>
   While some schools took issue with the final numbers in the
auditor's report, Bob Powilatis, deputy state auditor, said
everything is based on documents and records. ``When we say a
report is official, we stand by it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitchburg State was the biggest violator of the special
admissions cap, accepting 24 percent of such students, according to
the auditor's report. The school's own figures showed 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fitchburg State spokesman Michael Shanley said he believes some
``honest mistakes'' created the perception that the school violated
the limit. He said some students were admitted under a program to
help those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. He said
the auditor took issue with the school's failure to classify these
students as ``special admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanley said his school needs to serve the community and also
work to raise academic levels. ``We've spent a lot of money to
raise standards, but it's not going to happen overnight,'' he said.
``We can't abandon our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine McKenna, spokeswoman for UMass-Lowell, said she is
shocked that the auditor's final report shows the campus violating
the special admissions cap. She said the auditor's office had at
one point told the school it was in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna said the school, however, does not dispute the auditor's
calculation that it violated the remedial education limitation. The
auditor found that 20 percent of the freshman class was enrolled in
remedial courses.
</P>
<P>
   At Westfield State, James Stakenas, executive assistant to the
president, said a data-reporting error explains why the auditor
found the school in violation of the special admissions cap. He
said he is confident his college ultimately will not be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties for colleges out of compliance could be hefty, if
the sanctions Koplik plans to propose to the Board of Higher
Education are approved.
</P>
<P>
   Koplik said offending schools could lose state appropriation
funds for every freshman admitted who does not meet the new
standards. He said schools get about $2,500 in state funds for each
student.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also will propose to bar any school from applying for
performance-improvement grants if it is found in violation of the
standards. He said the state's undergraduate campuses get anywhere
from $50,000 to $400,000 in such grant money.

INDIANA BEATS SETON HALL, 83-69  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Within minutes, the first game of this National
Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball season became a
camp clinic. The Indiana Hoosiers played the role of teacher and,
with all the tenderness of a military commander, forced the Seton
Hall Pirates into the role of the aggravated pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Before 15,509 mostly red-and-white clad fans at the RCA Dome on
Saturday, the Hoosiers, ranked 22nd by The Associated Press,
tutored their guests on the finer aspects of hard-nosed,
fundamental basketball to open the National Association of
Basketball Coaches Classic with an 83-69 victory. Don't be fooled
by the final margin: a testament to the Pirates' heart, it says
nothing about the competitiveness of the game. Indiana, which led
by 32-13 six minutes before halftime and 69-45 six minutes before
game's end, controlled the action from baseline to baseline for all
but a few moments. To its credit, Seton Hall closed the gap against
the Hoosiers' bench, which Coach Bobby Knight cleared with 6
minutes 26 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team is very good,'' said Pirates swingman Reggie
Saunders, who led all scorers with a career-high 29 points. ``They
play great together. They came out with more intensity than us. The
only good thing for us was that we didn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   With Knight walking the sideline and barking out orders, the
Hoosiers mastered the Pirates on both ends of the floor.
Defensively, they hounded Seton Hall's players from the midcourt
line to the basket, moving their feet to get in position to block
the Pirates' view of their teammates, using their hands to deny
entry passes and hustling relentlessly to contest shots and
retrieve loose balls. Offensively, they taught lessons about
setting screens, making backdoor cuts, boxing out underneath the
basket, following shots and finding the open man.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the outcome was decided well before halftime.
After a nifty driving layup by Shaheen Holloway cut Indiana's lead
to 7-4 at the 16:57 mark, Seton Hall melted under the Hoosiers'
stifling defensive pressure. While Indiana forced turnovers and
converted them into easy baskets, the Pirates went more than seven
minutes without scoring a basket. During that stretch, they got off
just one shot inside the paint, a heavily contested jump hook that
the freshman center Damien Dawkins missed. By the time Rimas
Kaukenas ended the drought with a 3-pointer, Indiana was ahead by
26-11.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana forced 12 turnovers, shot 61 percent from the floor and
held Seton Hall to 30 percent shooting in the first half to take a
41-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really knocked us back in the first half,'' said Tommy
Amaker, Seton Hall's coach. ``Their defense was suffocating. It was
aggressive. It was all of the things you think of when you think of
Indiana basketball and Coach Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Harrington, the first-round draft pick of the Indiana Pacers
who entered the National Basketball Association draft directly out
of New Jersey's St. Patrick's High School, watched the game from a
courtside seat near Seton Hall's bench. His thoughts? ``Man, in the
first half, it looked like Indiana had six players on the court,''
said the 6-foot-9-inch Harrington, who would have attended Seton
Hall. ``They were everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   William Gladness, a 6-8 senior forward, sparked Indiana. Playing
with both athleticism and muscle, he controlled the area around the
basket and finished with 16 points, a game-high 14 rebounds and 5
assists. Dawkins and his fellow freshman, Charles Manga, both of
whom are 6-10, could do nothing to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely dominated,'' Amaker said. ``He was relentless.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Guyton, the Hoosiers' preseason all-America point guard,
led Indiana with 23 points, 14 of which came in the second half.
The matchup between him and Holloway, the Pirates' all-Big East
playmaker, never materialized because the game was so out of hand.
Holloway scored just 6 points on 3-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The high point total of Saunders, a transfer from Georgia Tech,
is somewhat offset by the fact that he scored 22 in the second
half. But he and Duane Jordan (19 points) showed that they know how
to put the ball in the basket, perhaps giving the Pirates two
scorers besides Holloway. Seton Hall will face Valparaiso on
Sunday.

SOME REGARD LAWSUITS AS WAY TO CURB GUN INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Njuzi Ray died in an anonymous blur of homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Shot dead on a Brooklyn street in 1993, he was buried without a
single headline, and the man suspected of pulling the trigger
walked free when a jury voted to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   But five years later, the case is going back to court.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, thanks to an unexpected shift in the legal winds,
it is drawing widespread attention with a new star defendant: the
$2 billion gun industry, which, like the tobacco industry before
it, is facing a rapidly growing number of lawsuits nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to three major civil suits filed in recent years,
the mayor of New Orleans last week announced the first lawsuit by a
city against the industry; as many as 60 mayors are threatening to
follow his lead; in Chicago, Mayor Richard Daley may file suit as
early as this month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these cases will flop or break the back of the powerful
firearms industry _ represented in Massachusetts by the
headquarters of one of the leading targets, Smith &AMP; Wesson in
Springfield _ remains to be seen. But both sides agree: the suits
represent a dramatic change in the way gun-control advocates _
victims' families among them _ are fighting the industry, which for
years has faced antigun legislation as its only threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to think creatively,'' said Tom Diaz,
senior advisor at the Violence Policy Center in Washington. ``There
have been several waves of litigation against the gun industry in
the past, but they never got at the role of the industry. ...
There's been some inspiration from the tobacco industry. I think
the gun case is really stronger than the tobacco case was.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, gun-makers fended off most lawsuits with relative
ease, persuading judges to toss out product liability cases with
the industry credo: Guns don't kill people; people do. After all,
gun-makers argued, are car companies held responsible for motorists
who drive drunk?
</P>
<P>
   That defense _ like the cigarette companies' defense that
smokers were to blame for their own illnesses _ could be on the
verge of crumbling under new attacks by activist lawyers and
legislators, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than targeting damage done by a particular gun, lawyers
are beginning to ask questions about what the industry has done to
protect the public safety, and to market its product responsibly,
as other manufacturers of other products (beer, for example) are
required to do.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, three families have filed suit against a group of
firearms-makers using a negligence argument: The industry has been
reckless in its marketing, they say, promoting guns with gimmicks
that attract criminals, such as ``fingerprint-resistant'' handguns
or small weapons that are easy to hide.
</P>
<P>
   That suit also argues that gun- makers create a public nuisance
by flooding the market with handguns, knowing that many eventually
end up on urban streets, according to one of the attorneys, Locke
Bowman, legal director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the
University of Chicago. Daley's lawsuit is expected to take a
similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear these gangbangers go to the suburbs to buy
guns'' because gun sales are banned in Chicago, mayoral spokesman
John Camper said. ``We feel the gun manufacturers are well aware of
this, and are serving this market, even though they're not supposed
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the industry is aware of its role may be the
most striking similarity to the tobacco suits, analysts say,
drawing comparisons between cigarette companies' secret
manipulation of nicotine levels and gun-makers' alleged approval of
illegal gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like cigarette companies, there's even an inside source: Robert
I. Hass, a former head of marketing for Smith &AMP; Wesson. Testimony
by Hass, alleging the industry's failure to monitor illegal
distribution, is expected to appear in the Brooklyn case, known as
Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, which is scheduled to go to trial in federal
court at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson _ which employs 750 people in Massachusetts and
pays some $1 million in state taxes each year _ is one of some
40-plus gun-makers named in the Hamilton suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Smith &AMP; Wesson deny Hass can provide any damaging
information. Calling the case an ``aberration,'' attorney Anne G.
Kimball said Hass ``has had no experience with either this company
or any other firearms company since 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of such testimony, the Brooklyn case has already
cleared its first hurdle: getting approval to proceed. When Judge
Jack B. Weinstein announced in May that he would allow the suit to
go forward, it was a departure from previous rulings that tossed
product liability cases out of court. Even some industry officials
admit that the courtroom favor may soon swing in a new direction _
as it did for tobacco companies, who for decades did not lose a
single case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our track record is stellar ... in court,'' said Bob Ricker,
of the industry-financed American Shooting Sports Council. ``But we
recognize there are a lot of activist judges out there, and,
depending on what court and what judge, we've got to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Massachusetts has not been a major factor in the
shifting strategies of gun litigation. Although Boston Mayor Thomas
M. Menino looked into suing the gun industry in 1996, he chose to
introduce handgun legislation instead.
</P>
<P>
   And although that legislation _ to require gun-makers to install
``smart mechanisms'' in handguns that would prevent them from being
fired by anyone but their owners _ has still not passed, Menino
remains reluctant to file a suit, according to Peter Welsh, chief
of policy and planning. ``Our intent is to continue to push our
legislation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In several dozen other cities, however, a wave of lawsuits
appears increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell is leading the charge. If
ongoing negotiations between the US Conference of Mayors and the
Shooting Sports Council fail, Rendell plans to file suit against
the industry as early as next year _ either alone, or with 30 to 60
city mayors who are considering similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one Massachusetts man who hopes the trend will make
its way here, it is March Mathieu, whose 12-year-old son was
unintentionally shot and killed by a classmate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mathieu, a New Bedford resident, has filed a lawsuit against
gunmaker Beretta, charging the company with having designed a
negligent product. The gun, he argued, should have been equipped
with some sort of safety lock, or a mechanism to let the user know
a bullet was in the chamber (the young boy who fired the handgun
thought it was empty at the time).
</P>
<P>
   The case, expected to be tried in federal court in Boston next
year, is not part of ``some unified movement'' designed to change
the gun industry, attorney Paul M. Robertson said. But Mathieu said
he would be glad if that were the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Big Tobacco lost, all of a sudden they started to change
their tune on everything,'' he said. ``When car manufacturers were
sued ... all of a sudden they put air bags in their cars. And as
soon as one company is forced into making guns safer, I think it
might change the whole atmosphere of gun manufacturers
everywhere.''

PAZIENZA RESULT HARD TO HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION _ Some guys need an enemy _ real
or imagined _ to function at their best. Vinny Pazienza is such a
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Hate has been a strong motivator for Pazienza, who has achieved
much of his success via the ability to psyche himself into a
frenzy. That is why the two-time world champion was worried as his
bout with Arthur Allen approached Friday at Foxwoods; because, try
as he might, he simply could not summon up much hatred for Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate liking the guy I'm going to fight,'' Pazienza said
during the week, ``but he seems like a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, such absence of malice did not seem to affect Pazienza
too much _ he pounded out a unanimous 10-round decision on ESPN2's
``Friday Night Fights'' to keep his world title hopes alive _ and
it will certainly not affect him if he ever grants a rematch to
Malden middleweight Dana Rosenblatt, his chief New England rival of
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Pazienza knocked Rosenblatt flat with a wild
overhand right that left the then-undefeated Rosenblatt
semiconscious and suddenly defeated in a bout he thought he was in
control of, the enmity that was clear between them during the weeks
leading up to the fight remains for Pazienza, even though they no
longer even fight in the same weight class.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt has somehow become the embodiment of everything
Pazienza hates, and so, Pazienza acknowledged, he was rooting
against Rosenblatt when he fought Allen a few months back and is
rooting for the opportunity to face him one more time before his
career ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think he's likable, but he's not likable to me,''
Pazienza said. ``He's a little smart ass with a community college
degree. He bothers me because of the condescending way he talks
crap about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I win another world title, I'd love to fight him again.
He's a good enough fighter, but I'd beat him up when I'm 85. I
ruined that kid's life. Right now he should be fighting at 168
pounds, but he's afraid he'll get knocked out because of what I did
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he's having all the stamina problems is he's afraid
to move to a weight that's suitable to his body. Of course he's
getting dehydrated. But he won't move up because he's afraid of
getting knocked out again.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rosenblatt, a doctor determined that a salt
deficiency was the cause of the stamina problems that surfaced in
his last two outings, wins over Allen and Terry Norris, but
Pazienza doesn't want to hear about medical opinions. He has his
own opinion about Rosenblatt, and obviously it is not a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if he somehow lands a title shot with newly crowned
International Boxing Federation super middleweight champion Sven
Ottke, who upset Charles Brewer recently in Germany, Pazienza may
have no more need for or interest in Dana Rosenblatt.

NOW MOOG IS MINDING THE NET PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By day, and sometimes by dusk, Andy Moog is the best street
hockey player that Coppell, Texas, has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we've got 10 or 12 of the neighborhood guys out
there,'' said Moog, now barely six months past his higher-profile
playing days as one of the NHL's top netminders. ``I get my turn in
net _ it's not by choice, but everyone takes their turn at it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the rest of the day, and on many nights, Moog is acting
president of the Fort Worth Brahmas, one of 17 franchises in the
Western Pro Hockey League, a developmental circuit on a par with,
say, Double A baseball. Moog has an equity position in the club,
and hopes his experience in the front office _ handling budgets and
promoting sales _ might lead to a similar position with an NHL
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this as my apprenticeship or internship to
understand the game better from this side,'' said the former Bruins
netminder, who'll be back in the Hub Sunday, signing autographs at
Sportsworld in Everett. ``Obviously, you understand the game as a
player, but that's only to a certain level _ there's a lot more to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The key these days in any front office, of course, is trying to
make a profit while paying exorbitant and ever-escalating player
salaries. The WPHL has a hard salary cap, which, Moog says with a
chuckle, is ``the only way I'd get involved.'' He laughingly calls
himself a hypocrite for saying such a thing, a reflection on his
active days with the NHL Players' Association when salary caps were
deemed evil by union leadership and members alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``As players, it was a lot of guesswork, trying to figure out
just what ownership's economic conditions were,'' said Moog, asked
if he now thinks an NHL hard cap could be in everyone's best
interests. ``At the time _ and this is four or five years ago _
based on our information at hand, a cap wasn't necessary. Four or
five years later, things have changed, but I don't know if a cap is
necessary yet. I don't have enough information to make that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog, 38, still had a year left on his contract with Montreal
(worth $1.7 million) when he made his decision to retire shortly
before last June's expansion draft. He immediately moved back to
Texas to rejoin his family _ they never moved en masse to Montreal
_ and resisted an offer from the Canucks in the offseason to play
one more season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two reasons why I decided not to do it,'' said Moog. ``One was
my back. The amount of time I would need to commit and sacrifice to
be able to play, all the time getting ready to play just took the
fun out of playing. And the other was, Vancouver has a coach (Mike
Keenan) who needs his No. 1 goalie to play all the time. I would
have had no trouble playing for him, but there probably would have
been a problem in the end because he's had a tough time juggling
goalies in his coaching career.''
</P>
<P>
   The pads put away and his ice time swapped for hot asphalt, Moog
now thinks about wearing suit and tie in a front office, or working
as a goalie coach/consultant in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Reggie's job,'' said Moog, referring to Reggie Lemelin,
his ex-Boston partner, who is a netminder coach/consultant with the
Flyers. ``My front office work now, I think, will help me if it's
what I want to do. But otherwise, I think I'd like to be in some
coaching capacity, maybe not strictly with goalies, but something
that would get me back in the game.''
</P>

<P>
   He's graying and small, but  &UR; Cliff Ronning's  &LR; sudden departure
from Phoenix _ dished to Nashville last weekend for draft picks _
was a mild shock. He was about the only hot hand the Coyotes had
going down the stretch run last season, only to be pushed aside for
promising rookie  &UR; Daniel Briere  &LR; (ex- of Springfield, AHL), another
small pivot who was the No. 24 pick in the '96 draft. By his draft
year, Briere already had averaged 140-plus points in two seasons at
Drummondville, but his lack of size (5 feet 9 inches, 170 pounds)
frightened away a lot of potential suitors. He sparkled in his
debut, slotted between  &UR; Rick Tocchet  &LR; and  &UR; Greg Adams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; picking up
an assist in a 3-0 win over the Kings. Another factor in the move:
Ronning will make $1.35 million this year and Briere $500,000 (not
including a $300,000 signing bonus) ... The Lords of the Boards at
NHL headquarters put together a debt list that shows the Penguins,
now in bankruptcy protection for the second time in team history,
owe a mountainous $35 million in deferred salaries and signing
bonuses, including more than $750,000 to general manager  &UR; Craig
Patrick &LR; . Where is this mess headed? Nowhere fast. Remember,
though, that Pittsburgh is a viable, proven hockey market _ unlike
places such as Nashville, North Carolina (Greensboro, et al), and
Columbus _ and the league's No. 1 mission will be to find a new
sweetheart owner with bottomless pockets to keep the Penguins in
Steeltown. But with debt so onerous, the chance of finding such a
sugar daddy is virtually nil. The key to the whole deal could be
finding a way to appease  &UR; Mario Lemieux &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is owed more than 50
percent of that $35 million, and then city fathers coming forward
with one of those we'll-do-anything-to-keep-you-here deals ... In
the thick of those rumors out of Ottawa that the Bruins were
interested in acquiring  &UR; Radek Bonk  &LR; _ rumors that were shot down
by Causeway Camp Denial _ the underachieving forward popped in
three goals in three games. What would anyone want with that kind
of talent?
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Just more than a year after handing  &UR; Luke Richardson  &LR; a
five-year free agent deal worth $12.5 million, it appears the
Flyers would be only too happy to dish the former Oiler defenseman.
Meanwhile, the Rangers are waiting to see something _ anything _
out of onetime Dartmouth center  &UR; Scott Fraser &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the ex-Oiler they
wooed to Broadway this summer. There are just some guys who make
more out of their careers up there in the plains, where the winters
are long, the distractions are few, and playing hockey is as much
lifestyle as career. Latest example:  &UR; Bill Guerin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; scoring as he
never did in New Jersey. True, the Oilers attack more than the
Devils, but environment has its role ... The longer  &UR; Ziggy Palffy
 &LR; sits, and the longer  &UR; Pavel Bure  &LR; stays out, the more likely an
Islander-Canuck deal becomes ... Nashville GM  &UR; David Poile's
 &LR; string-pulling has left the Predators with no fewer than eight
picks in the first three rounds of the June draft (to be held here
in Boston). Numbers don't guarantee success, but Poile has plotted
a foundation that at least has a chance of paying off. There are a
dozen or more NHL franchises that don't have anything even close to
a blueprint ... The two-referee system gets two big thumbs-up here,
but not when  &UR; Bill McCreary  &LR; and  &UR; Don Koharski  &LR; _ paired up in a
recent Stars-Blues game _ are working the same patch of ice in the
regular season. Come on, roll out that tandem for Game 7 of the
finals, will ya? ... Word is the Capitals might be shopping  &UR; Chris
Simon &LR; . They don't come much nastier, and he is a presence, but the
game has less and less room for gun-slingers. He makes only $1.2
million _ don't you love those ``onlys''? _ but no one in '98 is
going to swap skill for drill. If he goes, the Capitals might get
only a decent draft pick _ a third-rounder, maybe a second _ in
return. He could be an interesting jump-start back in Colorado, but
he torched Avalanche management upon his departure two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping a stopwatch on  &UR; Joe Thornton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; wondering just
when he'll break through and become a real contributor, take note:
It appears that  &UR; Owen Nolan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; captain of the Sharks this season,
is just now playing like ``the package.'' Nolan, the first pick
(Nordiques) in the '90 draft, will be 27 in February. Thornton
turned 20 over the summer and is not even 17 months past draft day.
It can happen overnight (witness  &UR; Jaromir Jagr &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the No. 5 pick in
'90), but it usually doesn't _ and it often doesn't happen at all.
Read: you might want to replace that stopwatch with an hourglass
... Speaking of No. 1 picks,  &UR; Eric Lindros's  &LR; recent pulverization
of the Senators'  &UR; Andreas Dackell  &LR; reminds us that L'Enfant
Terrible is the best destroyer in the game. No one can do that for
the full regular season and keep it up through four rounds of
playoffs, but if the Flyers are ever going to win the Cup under
Lindros's watch, he'll have to learn how to keep that image _ as a
90-point terrorist _ intact for nine months. If not, he is just a
very big, very expensive spare part ... This just in from Madison
Square Garden's lost and found. FOUND: 20 NHLers, all in blue
shirts, many of them with a pulse (they were 3-0-3 before losing
early last week). And to think, it was the deal for  &UR; Mathieu
Schneider  &LR; that revived the Rangers, along with the continued
feistiness of  &UR; Todd Harvey &LR; . Meanwhile,  &UR; Alexander
Karpovtsev &LR; , &UR;  &LR; sent to Toronto in the Schneider exchange, wasn't
even asked to dress last weekend against the hated Sabres ... The
Leafs' early-season euphoria has diminished, and there are hints
around Canada's Club Dead that disgruntled goalie  &UR; Felix
Potvin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the distant backup to  &UR; Curtis Joseph &LR; , &UR;  &LR; will pack his
bags and force a trade. A Potvin-Schneider package would have been
the way to go, landing the Leafs at least one impact player in
return, but Schneider brought next to nothing, and now the Leafs
are in the impossible position of having to hit a home run with a
guy they've turned into, well, a backup goalie. Ugh. But, hey, the
new building will open soon _ the '90s way of turning cornerstone
franchises into expansion clubs with little expectations _ and no
paying customers in Toronto would dare stop buying tickets. Would
they? ... Colorado's play is so dreadful that, realistically, its
season could be over before Christmas. The only real help could be
the end to mobile defenseman  &UR; Sandis Ozolinsh's  &LR; holdout. Short of
that, right or wrong, rookie coach  &UR; Bob Hartley  &LR; will be sent
packing with this year's  &UR; George Burnett  &LR; award ... Visitors
 &UR; today &LR;  to Sportsworld, noon to 2 p.m., will have to ante up $15
for a Moog autograph. According to shop owner  &UR; Phil
Castinetti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; part of the proceeds will be donated in his father's
memory to New England Baptist Hospital.  &UR; Chester Castinetti  &LR; died a
week ago Friday at age 76.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I know he's been somewhat of a headache and has had his share of
injuries, but I'd still take the gamble and trade for Rangers right
wing  &UR; Alexei Kovalev &LR; . He's only 25 years old and has the skill to
score 100 points (his career high is 58). Just imagine the look of
a  &UR; Sergei Samsonov &LR; - &UR; Jason Allison &LR; -Kovalev trio. Anyone else see
the obvious  &UR; Rick Middleton  &LR; comparisons? Kovalev makes $1.5
million this year and is a Group 2 free agent as of next July 1 ...
That was a nice swap the Kings made, reacquiring  &UR; Eric Lacroix  &LR; for
nondescript center  &UR; Roman Vopat  &LR; (another of the spare parts
acquired by LA in the '96  &UR; Wayne Gretzky  &LR; deal to St. Louis).
Lacroix is a good-sized block of granite (6-2, 210), but it was a
difficult fit in Colorado, where his father (ex-agent  &UR; Pierre
Lacroix &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; is the general manager. Lacroix got his start in LA,
then joined the Avalanche in '96 in a deal that netted the Kings
goalie  &UR; Stephane Fiset  &LR; ... Former Chicago blue liner  &UR; Elmer
 &LR; ``Moose''  &UR; Vasko  &LR; died 10 days ago at age 62. Moose played on the
Blackhawks' '61 Cup team, in an era when 6-3/220 was considered
big; in  &UR; today &LR; 's game that's barely elk status. There's definitely
a little less zip left in your wrister if you remember the chants
of ``Mooooose ... Moooose ... Mooose'' cascading from the Chicago
Stadium rafters each time he took the ice ... The Sharks figured
 &UR; Al Iafrate  &LR; could be their No. 1 menace from the point, but two
injury-plagued seasons (59 games/24 points) proved otherwise. Then
they forked over $10 million to bring in  &UR; Gary Suter  &LR; as a free
agent. Thus far, the hard-shooting Suter has paid only 40 minutes
in dividends. He had offseason surgery to repair his right triceps,
then reinjured it upon his Oct. 24 debut. Another operation, if
necessary, could put him out for the year. No tears, of course,
farther south in the Golden State. It was a cross-check to the head
by Suter, then with the Blackhawks, that ended  &UR; Paul Kariya's
 &LR; 1997-98 season with the Ducks just before the Olympics ... Hall of
Famer  &UR; Larry Robinson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 47, now in his fourth year as the Kings'
coach, reported to work last weekend with his graying hair dyed
brown. Did La-La Land just get to him, or is this another marketing
ploy, one that will have coaches changing hair color for selected
games _ you know, the way the Bruins sport their Beargram sweaters
for matinees? Can't you see Keenan with a dazzling red mohawk? Just
for Sunday games, of course.

SEASON GOING NOWHERE HALTED AGAIN

<P>
   Mike Cloud will have more chances. There will be nationally
televised goal-line plunges in loud, packed stadiums against
various Lions and Bears. Someday, perhaps, even a Super Bowl will
be in Cloud's capable hands.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the young men who play football at Boston
College, Saturday's final four-play sequence _ which came up short
from the 1-foot line against Notre Dame _ will be the defining
moment of a frustrating college football career.
</P>
<P>
   Outlined against a blue-gray November sky, driving toward the
din of the south goal where the BC student body stood as one, Cloud
and the Eagles had four tries to run it in, starting from the 4.
They had four tries to defeat 13th-ranked (and possibly Rose
Bowl-bound) Notre Dame. They had four tries to score a touchdown
that would have defeated the New York Yankees of college football.
Four tries for a victory that would have salvaged a season and the
NCAA careers of seniors who have been at the Heights for four
losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They needed 4 yards to win. They got 3 yards and a dust of
Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   BC's star running back carried all four times, but was stoned on
third-and-goal from the 1, then dropped in the backfield for a
1-yard loss on the Eagles' final play. Heavily favored Notre Dame
won the Catholic Super Bowl, 31-26, drawing the curtain on BC's
1998 home season.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other football games of interest for New
Englanders this weekend. The Patriots play the 6-2 Falcons in
Foxborough Sunday and the Parcells Jets entertain BC grad Doug
Flutie and the Bills in the Meadowlands. But it's unlikely that
those games will offer anything to match the final scene at the
Heights Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The closing moments at Alumni Stadium reminded us that our town
still can occasionally enjoy a slice of the big-time college
football pie that enthralls so much of the United States. Boston
College is our region's last link to the glory days of college
football, and beating Notre Dame at home on national TV is about as
good as it's going to get.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a surprisingly competitive game and the Eagles found
themselves in position to pull off the upset. A Scott Mutryn-to-Rob
Tardio pass put the Eagles on the ND 4 for a first down with 1:07
left and the clock stopped.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt about the BC strategy and there should be
no second-guessing now that it's over and we've all seen the film.
BC had four cracks to score, and Cloud is one of the finest running
backs in the country. He ran for 141 yards Saturday but would
gladly have traded all that acreage for one final foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to swallow,'' said Cloud. ``The last game here at
home, against a top 25 team, on national television. And to come so
close. We all felt we were going to score. But Notre Dame stepped
up and made the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud's first carry produced 2 yards. He got another tough yard
on second down. Then came the close third-down plunge when he was
stopped by inside linebacker Jimmy Friday as he tried to leap over
the pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is it,''' said Cloud. ``My eyes were wide.
But then two guys came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien and some BC players thought the ball crossed
the plane of the end zone, but there was no touchdown signal from
the official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought so,'' Cloud said. ``But it doesn't show up on the
scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   BC called time out after the third-down plunge. There were 11
seconds showing on the scoreboard. The ball was no more than 12
inches from the goal line. It was loud.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had no doubts about what play to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my best back,'' said the choked-up coach. ``We're playing
at home. The season's on him. He's going to have the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The play is ``29 Zone'' in the BC playbook. Simple stuff. Give
it to your best back and block for him. Mutryn took the snap and
handed to Cloud, who cut to the left and was immediately met in the
backfield by free safety Deke Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got the handoff, he was right there,'' said
Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   And so after all the drama of the first three attempts, there
was never a chance on fourth down. O'Brien blamed it on a missed
assignment. Somebody neglected to make his block. Not since David
Green fumbled against West Virginia five years ago had a single
error cost BC so dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn merely ran off toward the sideline after handing off and
seeing Cloud stopped so abruptly. Cloud sat stunned while the Irish
players celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   There are two more games to play (at Pittsburgh and West
Virginia) in this 3-6 Eagle season, but nothing matters much after
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough one to come back from,'' said
O'Brien. ``To try to describe the emotions for them is totally
impossible right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't forget this game as long as I live,'' said Mutryn, a
senior, ``if I live to be 80 years old and have kids and grandkids.
I'll remember this game for the rest of my life. It would have been
great to go out beating Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been great.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In a remarkable display of class, Da Hoss, who
won the $1 million Mile in 1996, repeated that victory Saturday
before a record Breeders' Cup crowd of 80,452 at Churchill Downs
after having run just once since winning the event at Woodbine two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Off at 11-1 ($25.20 to win), Da Hoss, a gallant 6-year-old
gelding who had been sidelined by a series of ailments caused by
arthritis, forced his nose past Hawksley Hill's at the finish line.
Da Hoss was ridden by John Velazquez, who outfinished Alex Solis,
aboard Hawksley Hill, in the time of 1:35 1/5. Labeeb and Kent
Desormeaux finished a well-beaten third.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick, the 1997 Horse of the Year and 5-2 favorite,
went right to the front with Pat Day aboard. He battled gamely
along the hedge for nearly 7 furlongs but then gave it up and faded
to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph by Da Hoss was a testament to the horsemanship of
trainer Michael Dickinson. He ran Da Hoss in an allowance race at
Colonial Downs Oct. 11, which he won, just to get the attention of
the Breeders' Cup committee, which made Da Hoss the first
alternate. When the connections of Wild Rush opted for the Sprint,
in which he finished 14th and last, at the time of pre-entry, Da
Hoss got into the Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My owners (Prestonwood Farm) are horsemen and they're
sportsmen,'' said Dickinson, who earned the nickname ``The Mad
Genius'' for the way he handled Da Hoss. ``They've given me the
time and they've been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the time of the day's first race, it was obvious
that the Churchill strip favored speed. Escena, a true frontrunner,
took advantage of the situation and received a strong ride from
Gary Stevens to capture the $2 million Distaff by a nose. Escena, a
5-year-old who was sent off at 3-1 ($8 to win), held off Jerry
Bailey's 4-5 ride, Banshee Breeze, a top 3-year-old who had taken
three straight Grade I races, in the time of 1:49 4/5 for 1 1/8
mile. Keeper Hill was a distant third with Chris McCarron aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty special,'' said Bill Mott, who trains Escena
for Allen Paulsen. ``We won it last year with Ajina, and Escena was
third as part of the entry. She had enough today to gut it out and
win when it counted.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, speed was also dangerous in the $2 million
Turf. Buck's Boy, another noted frontrunner, went all the way in
2:28 3/5 over the demanding distance of 1 1/2 mile under Shane
Sellers at odds of 7-2 ($9.20 toi win). Buck's Boy jumped right out
to the lead and looked like a winner every step of the way as he
scored by 1 1/4 length over 19-1 Yagli, under Corey Nakatani, and
58-1 Dushyantor and Desormeaux. Top European Royal Anthem was never
prominent and finished seventh at 5-2 with Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rather fortunate that we drew a good post (No. 2),''
said trainer Nole Hickey, who used to train in New England. ``He's
a very fast horse, and Sellers did a real good job of riding him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the $1 million Juvenile, Answer Lively, a colt with big speed
numbers who became a hot horse during the week, rewarded the
backers who made him the 5-2 ($7.40 to win) favorite, winning by a
head. Ridden by Bailey, Answer Lively took command turning for home
and held off 76-1 Aly's Alley and Edgar Prado at the wire. Cat
Thief and Calvin Borel finished third. The time for the mile and
one-16th was 1:44.
</P>
<P>
   The race was a big dispapointment for the connections of The
Groom is Red, owned by the Celtics Pride Stable of Rick Pitino. The
Groom is Red, who was coming off a sharp win on a sloppy track in
the Champagne at Belmont Oct. 10 and was co-second choice at 3-1,
was last around the turn under Nakatani, and he began shaking his
head as the dirt flew up into his face. He managed to finish sixth,
beaten a total of about 8 lengths, in the 13-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track was cuppy and he didn't like it a bit,'' said
Nakatani. ``It's just one of those things. A horse either likes the
track or they don't. We'll get them the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too far back; the pace didn't set up for him,'' said a
disappointed Pitino. ``It wasn't fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all Bob Baffert in the $1 million Juvenile Fillies. The
trainer, who has won the last two Kentucky Derbys (Silver Charm and
Real Quiet), saddled 4-5 ($3.60 to win) choice Silverbulletday to a
half-length tally over his other starter, Excellent Meeting.
Silverbulletday, who has captured five of six career starts, made a
big move on the turn under Stevens and lasted over charging
Excellent Meeting, who was 4-1 with Desormeaux. The time for the
mile and one-16th was 1:43 3/5, faster than the colts ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they could run 1-2,'' said Baffert, who trains
Silverbulletday for Mike Pegram, who also owns Real Quiet, and
Excellent Meeting for the Golden Eagle Farm. ``Silverbulletday is
just an exceptional filly. If I didn't win the Juvenile Fillies, it
was going to be tough to take. We had them over a barrel, and I
would have been totally embarrassed if we had not come back a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Reraise, whose owners, a consortium headed by concert promoter
Barry Fey, put up a 12 percent supplemental fee of $120,000 for his
entry, justified their faith by going wire-to-wire to take the $1.1
million Sprint by 2 lengths in 1:09. Trained by Craig Dollase,
Reraise, a reformed $62,500 claimer, took advantage of the bias and
zipped 6 furlongs in 1:09 under Corey Nakatani, who won the Sprint
for the third year in a row (Lit De Justice and Elmhurst).

THIS DEFEAT WAS MOST BITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He went up in the elevator, exchanged pleasantries with former
Boston College president Father J. Donald Monan, then slipped off
to his third-floor office.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom O'Brien, it was another emotional roller-coaster ride
that had left him with a pain in the pit of his stomach that will
not soon go away.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had asked his team for the same thing he had asked for
since he took over last season _ its best effort.
</P>
<P>
   This time, on a November Saturday afternoon that closed out the
home portion of the 1998 season, the Eagles had given it. And then
some.
</P>
<P>
   They had shrugged off whatever emotional or physical maladies
had contributed to their five-game losing streak and left them on
the precipice of a losing season at 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   But now it seemed that a corner was about to be turned. Trailing
Notre Dame by 11 points with 9:23 left, the Eagles had clawed their
way to within inches of a win that would have ranked with their
highlight-film victories of their past, the Doug Flutie Hail Mary
Pass in 1984 over Miami and the David Gordon field goal that beat
Notre Dame in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 5. Eleven seconds. Inches from the goal line. One
play. That's all it would take and the nightmare of that failed
goal-line surge against Virginia Tech would have been forgiven, if
not forgotten. The wide field goal attempt that would have beaten
Navy would have become less painful.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen. Notre Dame's Deke Cooper broke through the
left side of the line and nailed running back Mike Cloud before he
could even get started.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, watching from midfield with his hands on his knees,
bowed his head in frustration, anger, hurt. You name it. The
second-year BC coach felt it all.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no question about emotional peaks and
valleys. The Eagles came out flying from the start. They led at
halftime, overcame a second-half surge by the Irish, and had driven
to within an inch of a victory that would have given them
confidence and hope to finish the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team that I can't describe the effort they gave,''
said O'Brien after the 31-26 setback. ``I can't tell them in words
the pain I feel for them, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain Saturday afternoon was real. You could feel it as you
saw the Eagles sprawled on the green carpet of Alumni Stadium,
their efforts once again coming up short.
</P>
<P>
   Give Notre Dame credit for making play after play down the
stretch in a game in which it could never completely take control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough way to lose a game,'' offered Notre Dame coach
Bob Davie.
</P>
<P>
   Tough? It was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough one to come back from,'' said
O'Brien. ``But we're going to find a way to do it. It's hard now.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be tough. But that has been the course of BC's season.
Tough losses piling on top of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing to say is that they will be character-builders.
O'Brien believes that. Not that he has a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to turn sometime,'' he said. ``And when it does,
it's going to be downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien must feel like Sisyphus pushing that rock up the hill,
wondering when he'll ever reach the top.
</P>
<P>
   It might not come this year. Closing out the season at
Pittsburgh and West Virginia will be as taxing as trying to beat
Notre Dame. The Eagles' emotional gas tank is on E.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be so close you could taste it and to have it slip away, I
can't describe it,'' said quarterback Scott Mutryn.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn, a senior playing his last home game, could barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, some of the Eagles, in their postgame
comments, had referred to being ``flat'' O'Brien had said such talk
was nonsense, that it was simply a matter of being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, BC gave its best effort from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   That it wasn't good enough left the Eagles battered. Now O'Brien
must bring them back to competitive speed in the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   It will be far from easy, especially on the road in November.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and his staff will start that process Monday. But for
now, the Eagles will get a day of rest, one they deserve, even
though the outcome didn't turn out the way they wanted.

REDFERN HAS ALL THE RIGHT MOVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unless you've tried walking 10 yards in Pete
Redfern's shoes, you can't imagine what his life is like. Of
course, that doesn't stop people from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Redfern was sitting in his wheelchair at the end of a check-out
aisle in a store one day when a woman passed him on her way to the
exit. Redfern glanced up at her and smiled. The next thing he knew,
the woman had dropped a quarter into the cup of water he keeps at
his side.
</P>
<P>
   Able-bodied, addle-brained? It happens all the time, people
taking pity on Redfern for no reason other than that he's in a
wheelchair. The real pity is they can't see that he needs their
sympathy and their change about as much as Bill Gates does.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Redfern's life is richer now than it ever was. Once
upon a time he was a well-set, well-known, well-off pitcher for the
Minnesota Twins. But he didn't really experience the feeling of
sitting on top of the world until after a diving accident left him
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   When Redfern looks at his life he has to laugh. For someone who
lived and died with his control on the mound for a quarter of a
century, it's bizarre not to control how people view you. And
there's no pitching around the irony that crowds Redfern's plate of
activities every day and never fails to humble him.
</P>
<P>
   It took deadened nerves in his limbs for him to feel his life
instead of merely inhabit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is so good right now,'' Redfern said the other day.
``I'm happier than I've ever been. I can definitely say that. I'm a
lot more down-to-earth than I was before the accident. I have more
peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Redfern was entertaining a visitor in the family room of his
Sylmar home after submitting to his twice-weekly 90-minute physical
therapy session. Later he would rise out of his chair and, with the
help of a walker, step out onto Haddon Avenue. That's how he
measures his athletic prowess these days, eight or 10 yards at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Redfern is more proud of the tentative steps he takes once a
week than he is the strides that carried him from a standout
baseball career at Sylmar High to a stellar stint at USC to the
No.1 pick in the 1976 winter draft to the ace of a middling
Minnesota team.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight he takes another big step.
</P>
<P>
   Redfern will be feted at the Roy and Roxie Campanella Foundation
Second Life dinner for coping courageously with his spinal cord
injuries. Redfern is in awe of receiving the Foundation's Second
Life Award. He also is a little apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner is being held at a hotel in Newport Beach, not far
from the spot where Redfern, a little more than 15 years ago to the
day, dove headfirst into the water and struck a sandbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's nervous,'' said Redfern's son Chad, a senior at
Chatsworth High.
</P>
<P>
   Redfern has returned to Newport Beach only a couple of times
since the accident and not at all in more than a decade, since
settling a lawsuit with the city out of court. He never has been
able to bring himself to re-visit the site of the diving mishap and
that won't change today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, I don't want to,'' Redfern said. ``I was there once.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. For all his gallantry Redfern is only
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out where the banquet was being held, I went,
`Oh, boy,''' Redfern said. ``The way I look at it, it's just kind
of like coming full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of his life. Since 1990 Redfern, 44, has
been a fixture on many of the same Valley fields he graced as a
player. He coached an American Legion team in Chatsworth for five
years, lent his pitching expertise to the Chatsworth High staff for
four years and coached the pitchers at The Master's College for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down from the latter job in 1996 so he could tend to
his duties as a dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my son started at Chatsworth I found myself losing my
concentration,'' Redfern said. ``I'd find myself watching our games
and wondering how my son was doing in his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Redfern continues to give private pitching lessons. He will
wheel himself just about anywhere to assist a kid, so long as it
doesn't cut into his time with 17-year-old Chad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treasure my son,'' Redfern said. ``If my life hadn't been
changed by the accident I wouldn't have had the time, day in and
day out, to be with him. Professional baseball is kind of like life
in the fast lane. When I played baseball, I took a lot of things
for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't anymore. Indeed, he takes great delight in the
mundane. ``If the feeling comes over me, I'll take off wheeling
around or I'll go watch kids on the playground,'' Redfern said.
</P>
<P>
   He might listen to one of the 930 compact discs he owns _ he's
partial to Jimmy Buffett _ or sit outside and read a book and feel
the sunshine on his shoulders. When you've survived after very
nearly dying three times in a hospital's critical care unit, it
doesn't take much to make you happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know the quest for fame and material things is not what
life's all about,'' he said. ``I have more riches and prestige
today than I ever had when I was playing baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has a teen-aged son who refers to him as ``my best
friend.'' How many fathers can claim that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if any of my friends have the same relationship
with their dads as I do with mine,'' Chad said. ``They're always
telling me I'm so lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The son was asked what he admired most about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``That he always makes the extra effort, whether he's doing his
therapy or helping me,'' Chad said. ``How far he has come since he
first got hurt. That he can get up every day and still be happy
with his life the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you want to feel sorry for a paralyzed person,
here's a tip: Don't. Because if the person is at all like Redfern,
chances are he or she has contentment to spare (and share). &QL;

BRUINS MAKE THEIR POINT WITH PENGUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Bruins will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   They faced the National Hockey League's leading scorer in
Jaromir Jagr, and the league's best power-play unit in opening a
two-game weekend road trip.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins packed their bags after Saturday's 0-0 duel with
the Pittsburgh Penguins at the Civic Arena happy with the tie and _
except for Ted Donato _ headed for Greensboro, N.C., for Sunday's 5
p.m. game against the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Donato was traded to the New York Islanders for tough guy Ken
Belanger in a swap of left wings Saturday and stayed behind in an
empty visitors' locker room trying to make plans to meet his new
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, meanwhile, moved on to Greensboro, where Byron
Dafoe, who earned his third shutout of the season Saturday, is
likely to get the call again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron played well,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``He's hot
right now. He's our No. 1 guy. We considered going with Robbie
(Tallas), but said no, we'll go with our instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Score one for instincts. And defense. For this was definitely a
victory for team defense.
</P>
<P>
   There was Dafoe in the net. Ray Bourque (35 minutes, 12 seconds)
and Hal Gill kept Jagr in check. There was a big save by Jason
Allison in the second period, getting back into the play to deny
Robert Lang in close.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe made 26 saves and Penguins goalie Jean-Sebastian Aubin,
making his third career start, had 18 saves. Aubin played in place
of Tom Barrasso, still out with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins were 0 for 2 in power-play chances, the Bruins 0
for 3.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's main assignment was to keep an eye on Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal did a great job,'' said Don Sweeney. ``He does a great job
matching up against Jagr all the time. I don't think I've seen
anyone in the league neutralize him like he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring chances, say nothing of goals, were hard to come by in
the early going. The Bruins had five shots on net in the first
period. The Penguins had four, testing Dafoe on the first couple in
the first two minutes and showing little after that.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr had no shots in the first period and he and his linemates
had five for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for me to go up against the best,'' Gill
said. ``You pin him, you hold him, you keep right on him and don't
worry too much about the rest of the players, the other guys can
take care of them. And any time we get a shutout, it's great for
the defense and the goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had the only two power plays of the first period _
and couldn't even muster a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins picked things up a bit in the second. While the
Bruins were still getting a few good shots on Aubin, who won his
first NHL game Thursday night, the Penguins were getting a few on
Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Allison had one of the big saves in the period. Jagr made a nice
move to set up Lang in close. As Lang shot, Allison slid across and
broke up the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get in the way,'' Allison said. ``The guy
fortunately got a piece of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe twice stopped Kevin Hatcher bids, with a kick save early
and a quick glove late.
</P>
<P>
   Another Jagr play in the last minute of the period led to a Brad
Werenka shot from straight on. But Dafoe came across to pick it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``(German) Titov or someone took me wide and passed back in
front of the net,'' Dafoe said. ``I was almost in the corner and
just scrambled to get back. I don't know who shot it, but he put it
into my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had only four more shots in the third period, but a
couple were good chances. Allison got in tight for a shorthanded
opportunity and with 5:32 left Steve Heinze cut into the middle for
a shot that was kicked out by Aubin.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had three more shots in the overtime and ended up with 18
shots for the game.
</P>
<P>
   But that was OK. They got the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the shots down, keep the chances down,'' Burns said.
``They're a good defensive team. They play a lot like us. It was a
neutral zone game. Make a mistake in the neutral zone and give them
an outnumbered chance and you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins mostly stayed out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-earned point,'' Dafoe said. ``We shut down Jagr
with our defense and that is very confidence-building for us. He's
the leading scorer and we didn't give him a sniff. That says a lot
for our defense.''

EARNHARDT JR. CLOSES IN ON TITLE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ The race for the 1998 NASCAR Busch Grand National
Series driver's championship technically will be decided during the
final event of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, series rookie Dale Earnhardt Jr. locked up his
first NASCAR title and further stamped himself as a future
superstar with a second-place finish to Mark Martin in yesterday's
Stihl 300.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., the 24-year-old son of seven-time Winston Cup
champion Dale Earnhardt, exited Atlanta Motor Speedway with a
166-point lead over series runner-up and best buddy Matt Kenseth.
To clinch the title in Homestead, Fla., next Sunday, Earnhardt must
start the Jiffy Lube Miami 300 and complete the first lap.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll climb in that car next week if all my legs and all my
bones are broken. I don't care,'' said Earnhardt, driver of the No.
3 ACDelco Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by his famous father. ``We've
been blessed by the man upstairs. And I want to thank my dad for
everything he's done for me. He's helped me fulfill my dream as a
race-car driver, and soon-to-be championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The series' winningest driver, Martin took the lead from
``Little E'' on lap 172 of the 195-lapper around the 1.54-mile
quadoval. Martin dove under Earnhardt through Turn 4 and remained
at the point despite two late-race cautions that bunched the field.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-time winner this season, Earnhardt could not mount a
serious challenge on restarts at either lap 182 or 188 and finished
0.309 seconds behind Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior ran a great race, and he ran a real smart race,''
Martin said of Earnhardt. ``He ran off with it when he could and in
the end we just had an awful strong car.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the car wasn't even from Martin's stable. Martin
said the No. 60 Winn-Dixie Ford Taurus he drove actually was on
loan from the Busch inventory of Roush Racing teammate Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We borrowed this car because we wrecked up everything we had.
I really liked the car. It ran well,'' said Martin, whose 34 career
BGN victories are the most in history. But Martin, who captured six
Busch races in each of the past two seasons, won for only the
second time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had many wins this year in this \RBGN\S car,'' said
Martin, a seven-time winner in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series.
``Today was a good one for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin led twice for 31 laps, a distant second to Earnhardt. He
led on four occasions for 126 laps to add 10 bonus points in his
one-on-one against Kenseth. A protege of Martin and car owner Jack
Roush, Kenseth was running third until the white-flag lap, when he
was passed by former Pep Boys Indy Racing League champion Tony
Stewart. Stewart, who battled back from a lap down, forced Kenseth
to settle for fourth in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth then conceded the points chase to Dale Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the championship, but we've had a super year,'' said
Kenseth, driver of the No. 17 Lycos.com Chevy. ``It was a building
year for us with three wins and a pole. You can't complain about
that.''

   Mo Vaughn was home in Easton Friday afternoon when his agent,
Tom Reich, phoned and told him what the Anaheim Angels had just
offered.
</P>
<P>
   His mouth dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just shocked that it happened so soon,'' said Vaughn.
``I'm used to things taking a while. It was just ... how many hours
after the free agency thing began? ... and they just told us what
they were going to give us and I was stunned. They really stepped
to the plate and I appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the free agent first baseman who has been free to
entertain offers since Friday, was not willing to discuss terms of
the offer, but sources close to the negotiations said the Disney
deal isn't far off Pedro Martinez's six-year, $75 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that Vaughn, who late last week set the bar at
a minimum five years of guaranteed money, has received an initial
offer that's beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn acknowledged that the Dodgers were one of the teams who
had expressed interest. He said the others expected to put forth
offers include the Yankees, Mets, Rockies, White Sox, and Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that it had never reached this stage, but we gave the
Red Sox a window to be able to come in with something, but it
didn't happen,'' said Vaughn. ``To be honest, I'm now enjoying this
quite a bit. To see the interest that was shown that quick just
blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said the Angels' offer wasn't take-it-or-leave-it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great,'' he said. ``They understood we were going to
be fielding other offers and they made it clear to us that the
offer was negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was impressive was that they didn't need preliminary
meetings or they didn't have to feel out the market or any of that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he has no idea where the Red Sox stand or what they
will do. Regardless, the market is being established for John
Harrington and Dan Duquette: It's going to take Martinez money or
better to sign Vaughn.

IRISH AT THEIR BEST WHEN IT COUNTED

<P>
   Boston College had to like its chances. Trailing 13th-ranked
Notre Dame, 31-26, Saturday at Alumni Stadium, the Eagles had
driven to the 4-yard line with 1:07 left and had four cracks to
reach the end zone and pull off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   But four carries by star running back Mike Cloud _ the last from
the 1 that resulted in a 1-yard loss _ couldn't get the job done
against a fired-up Irish defense.
</P>
<P>
   The first two tackles were made by inside linebacker Bobbie
Howard, the third on a terrific play by inside linebacker Jimmy
Friday, and the fourth by free safety Deke Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told our team,'' said Notre Dame coach Bob Davie, ``that
lady on the Dome is smiling on us right now because I think we
played hard enough to win the football game, but I'm not sure we
played well enough to win the football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie's team improved its record to 7-1 and has a possible Rose
Bowl berth in it future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as fine (a goal-line stand) as I've been around
to win a game,'' he added. ``Certainly you're thankful and grateful
to win. It's hard to be real happy now, other than that you come
out of here 7-1.''
</P>
<P>
   BC quarterback Scott Mutryn had moved his team with a 10-yarder
to Anthony DiCosmo, a 25-yarder to Dennis Harding, and a 26-yarder
to Rob Tardio, which put the ball on the 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we didn't play nearly well enough to win
this game on defense,'' said Davie. ``I knew going into this game
that BC was not a 3-5 team based on its performance, that it's the
best offensive team with balance we've played this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the four-play final series, Davie worried that BC
would try a bootleg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't tackle the quarterback the whole game,'' said the
second-year Irish coach. ``All the time you go with the goal-line
defense, just coming after them, and you challenge them to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie, a former defensive coordinator, thought the bootleg might
come on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough play, if you get up and pinch everyone and clog
the gap, the bootleg's there,'' he said. ``The bottom line is that
we kept them out of the end zone. We're happy to have won and
you're fortunate that you won, but you know you have to get a lot
better. We won a close game and no one was pointing fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper made the biggest play, on what is called the ``razor
man'' when both safeties charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical Notre Dame play,'' Cooper said. ``I happened to
be at the right place at the right time, rushing in underneath,
designed to stop the running play. This was the most important play
I've had.''

AWESOME FINISH TO BREEDERS' CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Sonny Hine was wearing a cowboy hat, not just
any one but a lucky cowboy hat ``that my father gave me 25 years
ago, one I wear for only special days.'' Bob Baffert arrived at the
Chuchill Downs paddock humming ``My Old Kentucky Home'' because
Kentucky always had been so sweet for him.
</P>
<P>
   But when the greatest collection of horseflesh ever to be put in
a starting gate turned for the final stretch in Saturday's
Breeders' Cup Classic _ history's richest horse race ($5,120,000) _
Hine's cowboy hat brought no luck, as Awesome Again was the one
that surged to a three-quarter-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, the horse Hine trains for his wife, Carolyn, had a
hole inside Coronado's Quest but just couldn't slip through,
instead retreating. ``There was a hole there,'' said Jerry Bailey,
Skip Away's jockey, ``but the hole was moving faster than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   When the horses roared into in midstretch, Baffert's Silver
Charm had victory by the neck, but Baffert's Kentucky luck also ran
out.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing happened at the worst possible moment, the
European Swain running past on the outside, ``and I know Silver
Charm needs to see horses or he stops running,'' said Silver
Charm's jockey, Gary Stevens, ``so I took him outside.'' But Swain
drifted out farther and farther, attracted as if by a magnet to the
grandstand lights in the gloaming, almost reaching the outside
fence.
</P>
<P>
   So the whole inside opened up for jockey Pat Day and Awesome
Again, like a gift from the racing gods, and ``when I came out of
the turn I was following Silver Charm and I was anticipating going
on the outside of him,'' said Day, ``but he started drifting and I
changed my plans and I went to the inside of him. There was ample
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The Breeders' Cup Classic was a classic, but with
different classic characters than expected, Awesome Again winning,
his sixth victory this year without a loss. ``It left me
teary-eyed,'' said Day.
</P>
<P>
   The what-might-have-beens are infinite in this race, because
Awesome Again won by a mere three-quarters of a length over the
drifting Silver Charm, who himself was just a neck ahead of
off-his-bearings Swain, way out there in Mint Julep Land, almost
touching the furs and cigars in the first row of stands at the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate Skip Away, who raced twice too many times this
year, finished a discouraged sixth, earning nothing, failing to
reach the $10 million career earnings mark that Sonny and Carolyn
Hine so much wanted _ or even Cigar's all-time record of
$9,999,815. Nine races this year for Skip Away, seven wins, but his
last two races were monumentally disappointing _ a third in New
York and now this end-of-the-road sixth at Churchill Downs.
Magnificent athletes sometimes retire a bit too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew 50 yards into the race that I was in trouble,'' said
Bailey. ``He just could not handle this track.'' Just as Skip Away
could not handle the peculiar Churhcill racing surface in the 1996
Kentucky Derby, finishing a dismal 12th. With this horrible sixth,
the two worst races of Skip Away's 37 starts have come here in
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ride him in the Derby, so I had no past history, but
I could tell real quick that he would not handle this track,'' said
Bailey. ``Some horses handle some tracks and some don't.'' But now?
In this Classic of all classics?
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was a classic horse race of the truest kind, because
Gary Stevens will forever think about what he did in mid-stretch to
cost Silver Charm the race and Lanfranco Dettori, Swain's jockey,
will forever know he would have won the race if only he hadn't kept
whacking his horse lefthanded when Swain briefly took the lead from
Silver Charm, the lefthanded whacks sending Swain toward the
outside fence and costing him untold yards that should not be given
up when the richest race of all time is in its final strides.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, said Stevens, ``I know Silver Charm likes
competition. Swain actually went by us, so I moved Silver Sharm out
so he could see Swain (better), and Silver Charm dug back in and
got in front of Swain. And then here comes Awesome Again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dettori, Europe's best jockey riding Europe's best horse,
the loss truly was a bolt from the blue, because those legendary
blue colors of Godolphin Stable zipped past Silver Charm in
mid-stretch and apparently had the race won. But suddenly Swain
veered to the right _ then more to the right and then even more to
the right _ and when Swain finally crossed the finish line, less
than a length behind Awesome Again, Dettori raised his right hand
in supplication to the sky _ to the racing gods _ as if say, as
Bailey could, ``Why now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My ride was great until the last 100 yards,'' said Dettori.
``Swain was going to win, and all of a sudden he saw the lights. He
saw the lights and veered right.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again is 6 for 6 this year and Byrne, the magnificent
trainer who guided Favorite Trick to an 8-for-8 record and Horse of
the Year honors last year, lobbied that his horse deserves the same
honors this year. ``I think he's a brilliant race horse,'' said
Byrne. ``He loves this racetrack and he's done everything perfect,
and I think he should be considered for Horse of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as this Classic must be the Race of the Year, if not the
ages, because it showed that horse racing can be brutally cruel. As
Hine put it regarding Skip Away's final race, ``It's a shame it
turned out the way it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even crueler was the fate of Gentlemen, who barely could canter
across the finish line in his last race, too, dead last, after R.D.
Hubbard, his owner, put up $800,000 just to enter him.
</P>
<P>
   But horse racing also is glorious, because Awesome Again is
perfect for the year, and this was a race, as Gary Stevens put it,
``that was great.'' Even if the what-might-have-beens are infinite.

NOTRE DAME MAKES STAND AGAINST BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They needed to cover 77 yards in four minutes for a game-winning
touchdown that would have saved their season.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with three timeouts, Boston College roared from its own 23
to the Notre Dame 4 in eight plays, giving a sellout crowd of
44,500 at Alumni Stadium visions of a miraculous comeback
reminiscent of BC's upset of the top-ranked Fighting Irish five
years ago at South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   But that last yard _ no, that last inch _ proved to be the
longest and most painful of all for the Eagles, who were pinned
with a heartbreaking 31-26 loss in their final home game of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Mutryn connected with Rob Tardio for a 26-yard pass
to the 4, the Eagles (3-6) were on the threshold of snapping their
five-game losing streak. Senior running back Mike Cloud ran for
gains of 2 yards and 1 yard, and with less than a minute to go, and
Notre Dame out of timeouts, the Eagles had two cracks from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   With inches separating them from defeat, the Irish responded
with a gallant goal-line stand. Senior linebacker Jimmy Friday
stopped Cloud for no gain on third down with a tremendous hit, and
junior safety Deke Cooper clinched it by dropping Cloud for a
1-yard loss on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough ending to a great effort,'' said coach Tom
O'Brien, after BC lost its sixth straight for the first time since
the 0-11 season of 1978 under Ed Chlebek. ``I told the team that I
can't describe the effort that they gave. I can't tell them in
words the pain that I feel for them, either. We have to be strong
enough to fight through this and come back and play a game next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   How could there be any fight left after Saturday's gut-wrenching
loss? Certainly, it's going to take some time for the Eagles to
complete the healing process, especially Cloud, in whose hands
O'Brien put the game and the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Cloud didn't have a chance,'' O'Brien said. ``It was a
blown assignment and the guy came free (on fourth-and-goal). He
didn't have a chance to get in. I thought he was in on third down,
but I guess he wasn't. He's my best back. He's going to take the
ball. He's a fifth-year guy, playing at home for the last time,
he's going to have the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, too, thought he had scored on third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had, but obviously not,'' said Cloud, who finished
with 28 carries for 141 yards and an 11-yard TD in the first
quarter that answered Autry Denson's 1-yard TD and tied it, 7-7.
``Notre Dame just came up and made some plays. I take my hat off to
those guys, because they made some great plays, but we did as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on an outside play called ``29 Zone,'' Cloud was stopped
for a 1-yard loss by Cooper on fourth-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got the handoff, he was there,'' Cloud said.
``There was no time for me to make a move or to spin off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cooper, ``We had a play called `razor man.' I just rushed
in underneath the backs. I have any dive play, but I had no idea
what they were going to do. They came in my area and I just had to
make a play. I was just hoping they wouldn't jump over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events at game's end overshadowed a brilliant effort
by the Eagles, who fell behind, 14-7, on Jarious Jackson's 28-yard
TD strike to Joey Geatherall but rallied in the final 9:21 of the
half to take a 17-14 lead on Anthony DiCosmo's 23-yard catch and
John Matich's 43-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, who improved to 7-1 and increased their chances in
the Bowl Championship Series, tied it, 17-17, on Jim Sanson's
31-yard field goal in the third quarter, then took a 24-17 lead
when Jackson (10 of 21, 210 yards, 2 TDs) hit Malcolm Johnson with
an 8-yard pass with 4:07 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   After Willie Wright recovered a Joey Goodspeed fumble at the
Notre Dame 41, BC was forced to settle for another field goal by
Matich, who missed from 50 and 49 yards, but converted a 35-yarder
that pulled the Eagles within 24-20 with 12:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   Denson (28 carries, 128 yards) scored his second TD of the day
on a 2-yard run that lifted ND to a 31-20 lead, but Mutryn (22 of
35, 318 yards) capped a nine-play, 68-yard drive with a 6-yard TD
pass to DiCosmo, who had a career day with 8 catches for 140 yards
and 2 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers are great and everything, but in the end it doesn't
mean anything until you can get a W,'' said Mutryn, his voice
cracking. ``This really hurts when you can practically taste the
end zone and taste like the biggest victory of your entire life,
and to be so close that you can touch it, only to watch it slip
away, is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other way to describe it.''

NOTRE DAME BEATS BOSTON COLLEGE, 31-26  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ Boston College had lost five straight
games while yielding an average of 35.3 points, and it seemed
likely that the Eagles would be overmatched Saturday against Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Irish were No. 8 in the New York Times computer
ranking and No. 13 in the Associated Press poll, and came to Alumni
Stadium with a 6-1 record that included five consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame, leading by 31-26 in the final minute, had to
muster a resolute goal-line stand to stop tailback Mike Cloud on
three straight carries inside the 2-yard line _ the last time from
a foot out with 6 seconds left _ before it could prevail in a
pulsating contest.
</P>
<P>
   A crushing, low tackle by Notre Dame free safety Deke Cooper,
who burst through the right side of the Boston College line,
stopped Cloud for a 1-yard loss on fourth down to preserve the
Irish victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as fine a goal-line stand as I have been around,''
said Bob Davie, Notre Dame's second-year coach. ``In the back of my
mind, I thought they might run the boot with their quarterback, who
we had trouble tackling all day. But I knew they were going to give
it to Cloud or run the boot, and we decided to go all goal-line
defense and challenge them to throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the loss as a ``tough ending to a great effort,''
Boston College Coach Tom O'Brien said of Cooper's tackle: ``It was
a blown assignment and the guy came free. Mike didn't have a chance
to get in. I thought he was in on third down, but I guess he
wasn't. But he's my best back and he's going to get the ball in
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The play dashed the hopes of the Eagles, and most of those among
a capacity crowd of 44,500, that the home team might replicate its
stunning last-second victory over an undefeated Notre Dame team
five years ago in South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by 31-20 early in the final quarter, Boston
College (3-6) drew within 5 points with 5 minutes 23 seconds left
when split end Anthony DiCosmo caught his second touchdown pass
from quarterback Scott Mutryn, from 6 yards out, to cap a 68-yard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Then after forcing the Irish to punt, the Eagles drove from
their 23-yard line to the Notre Dame 4. Mutryn completed four
passes in the drive, the last for 26 yards to Rob Tardio.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, who gained 141 yards on 28 carries to surpass 100 yards
for the eighth time this season, then plowed to the 2, was stopped
for no gain and then plunged to the 1-foot line before he was
stopped by Cooper on the climactic play.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn, who has had an erratic season, was outstanding in
defeat. The senior completed 22 of 35 passes for 318 yards and the
2 touchdowns to DiCosmo, who caught 8 passes for 140 yards. Mutryn
also gained 24 yards on 8 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame quarterback Jarious Jackson also threw for 2
touchdowns while completing 11 of 21 passes for 210 yards.
Jackson's passing was complemented by the running of Autry Denson,
who picked up 128 yards on 28 rushes and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, which held a 17-14 halftime lead, outgained the
Irish in net yards, 491 to 383. Boston College recorded 26 first
downs to 19 by Notre Dame, which now holds an 8-2 edge in the
series.

REPUBLICANS INTENSIFY SEARCH FOR NEW SPEAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   By BENNETT ROTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The maneuvering to be the next speaker of the House
intensified Saturday as Houston Rep. Bill Archer bowed out and
Republicans pursuing the top post worked the phones incessantly in
search of support.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that even
though he believed he could win the leadership position he would
not become a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the right man for the job, but the job just isn't
right for me at this time in my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., under attack after Republican
reverses in last week's midterm elections, shocked his colleagues
and the political establishment Friday when he stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday he confirmed that he would also resign the
congressional seat he won for the 10th time in Tuesday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who had been urged to run by some conservatives, refused
to endorse any of the current candidates. Appropriations Committee
Chairman Bob Livingston of Louisiana has emerged as front-runner to
replace Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston congressman warned that the GOP leadership had to
``change its approach'' so the voters could better understand the
Republican agenda of lower taxes and smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's decision followed a dizzying series of events that
began Friday when his office issued a statement saying the
congressman would spend the weekend deciding whether to try for
speaker. As late as Saturday morning aides believed there was a
good chance he would run.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said that Archer's wife Sharon was not happy with
the prospect of his seeking such a time-consuming job and wanted
him to abide by his pledge to leave Congress by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Archer reiterated he would abide by his
vow to leave office in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's announcement produced some immediate fallout as House
Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Sugar Land, threw his support behind
Livingston, who announced his intention to seek the speakership
even before Gingrich stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, speaking to reporters outside his home in Marietta,
Ga., on Saturday repeated his intention to resign from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a practical matter for me to stay in the House
would make it impossible for a new leader to have a chance to grow,
to work and do what they need to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich did not set a deadline for leaving Congress but said he
would do so after consulting with authorities to see when it would
be possible to hold a special election. He is expected to leave
before the new Congress is sworn in Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the Republican majority that took power in 1994
said he was stepping down to avoid the growing infighting after the
party's poor showing in last week's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly stand by and allow the party to cannibalize
itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's fall has been stunningly rapid. When House
Republicans lost five seats in last week's midterm election,
defying historical patterns, many colleagues immediately blamed
Gingrich, who had approved a last-minute $10 million anti-Clinton
ad blitz that was deemed ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   House members had also been angry at their leader's willingness
to compromise with the president in budget negotiations that did
not include a major tax cut sought by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And they have grown weary of supporting the pugnacious and
outspoken speaker who remained unpopular with voters since he
engineered a government shutdown in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Facing only a 12-seat majority next year, they have begun
searching for a leader who can better hold together a fractious
coalition of moderates and conservatives and be a better salesman
for their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said the new speaker won't
necessarily win based on ideology but more on a style and an
ability to cultivate members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Republicans apparently concluded they needed a kinder and
gentler face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston seems to fill the bill for many Republicans. The
silver-haired Louisianan is known more for quiet budget dealing
than engaging in noisy ideological debates over social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as the point man responsible for doling out
spending, he has collected valuable IOUs from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston received a boost Saturday when DeLay, the
third-ranking House Republican, agreed to back his bid for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an effective leader who can bring all the factions of the
party together. He will unite the majority and expand it,'' said a
DeLay aide.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston has made a number of enemies among younger
conservatives who view him as an old-style lawmaker too willing to
compromise on budget matters. He is also known for a temper that
occasionally flares in public.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those unhappy with Livingston are likely to throw their
support to Rep. Chris Cox, a soft-spoken Californian who led a
probe into allegations that China obtained secret missile
technology from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cox announced Friday night and was making phone calls Saturday
seeking supporters. Rep. James Talent, R-Mo., has also indicated
interest.
</P>
<P>
   While Livingston may be the front-runner, there are still a
sizable number of lawmakers who remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, was among those who have not
made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   While Brady said he had been excited by an Archer candidacy, he
was not prepared to support Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he wanted a leader who not just a manager, but
someone who could express a clear vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want someone who is a statesman in their manner and a bit of
rebel in their heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's job is not the only GOP leadership role being
contested. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, who has been
criticized by many conservatives for going along with Gingrich, is
being challenged by Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Republican Conference, John Boehner of
Ohio, will likely also draw opponents, as will John Linder of
Georgia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee.

 &HT;    Coaches on shaky ground in S.C.
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When things are going well, there is no more upbeat
place than a college football office. Coaches can't wait to get
into work each morning. The secretaries smile and are pleasant on
the telephone. Life is good.
</P>
<P>
   But when things aren't going well, a college football office is
not a whole lot of fun. When the phone rings, it's usually bad
news. When the press comes around, the head coach knows it's not to
tell the world what a smart guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Brad Scott and Clemson's Tommy West aren't
having a whole lot of fun right now.
</P>
<P>
   The two coaches are a combined 3-15 going into the final two
games of the regular season. Both were off Saturday. Clemson hosts
No. 23 Georgia Tech in a Thursday night ESPN game, while South
Carolina hosts No. 5 Florida on Saturday. South Carolina (1-8) has
lost eight games in a row for the first time in school history.
Clemson (2-7) will be sitting at home in December after going to
three consecutive bowls.
</P>
<P>
   And both coaches are sitting on Palmetto State hot seats.
Officials at both schools are mum, but it is very possible that the
meeting between South Carolina and Clemson on Nov. 21 could be the
last for both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are not going well, I'm subject to being
evaluated, just like any member of my staff,'' said West, who is
30-27. ``All I can do is continue to work at my job as hard as I
can and to help these football players get better.''
</P>
<P>
   While West has a winning record and has been to three bowls in
five years, Scott has struggled mightily since his first season
(1994), when the Gamecocks went 7-5 and got the first bowl victory
in their history. Since then, South Carolina is 16-25-1, including
9-21-1 in the SEC. Against the SEC East's big three of Florida,
Tennessee and Georgia, Scott is 1-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true we have not progressed as fast as I would have
liked,'' Scott said, ``but you have to remember that you're
competing against a lot of tradition when you go against the top of
the SEC. We are still trying to build our tradition here and you
don't do that overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clemson, the Tigers went 5-6 in West's first season and have
lost all three of the bowl games. And like Scott, West has not
fared well against the top of his conference, going 3-12 against
Florida State (0-5), North Carolina (2-3) and Virginia (1-4). At
one time in its history, Clemson was 29-0 against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been competitive against the top of the conference, but
we just haven't been able to make enough plays to win,'' West said.
``We've had some setbacks this year, but this group of guys has
never quit. They are still trying to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   They came to the state about the same time, and both hires
seemed to make good sense. West was 40, although with just a year
of experience as a head coach, at Chattanooga. But for eight years
he had been a popular assistant to Danny Ford during Tigers
football's glory days. After Ken Hatfield left for Rice, West was
Clemson's link to a better past.
</P>
<P>
   Scott spent 11 years at Florida State being groomed by Bobby
Bowden for a head coaching job. Scott had developed the fast-beak
offense and used it to turn Charlie Ward into a Heisman Trophy
winner and the Seminoles into national champions. South Carolina
had won in the past, but never consistently. Scott was the guy,
Gamecocks fans thought, who could make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked out for either school. Attendance is down in
both places, and opposing schools are flooding the state with
recruiters, hoping to take advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The two both have said recently that they never would consider
leaving before the end of the season, as Terry Bowden did at
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start something, you finish it,'' West said. ``That's
the way I was always taught.''
</P>
<P>
   So, now what? South Carolina is said to be talking to Tulane's
Tommy Bowden, Mississippi's Tommy Tuberville and ESPN's Mike
Gottfried, the former coach at Kansas and Pittsburgh. Former N.C.
State coach Dick Sheridan, a South Carolina graduate, reportedly
would be a candidate if a change is made.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, if it makes a change, also might want to talk to Tommy
Bowden, whose Tulane team is undefeated. Former Tigers player Ricky
Bustle, now the offensive coordinator at Virginia Tech, is another
possibility.

 &HT;    A `Mighty Mouse' roars in Buffalo
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Seven blocks from the Buffalo Bills'
inflated-bubble practice site outside Rich Stadium, as the offense
was culminating its Friday afternoon walk-through for today's AFC
East game against the New York Jets, a delivery truck backed up to
the loading dock of a weather-beaten convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, three cars screeched into spots near the front door.
From them leaped seven men and women, apparently the modern-day
descendants of those Wild West outlaws who would stake out the bank
and lay in wait for the stagecoach to deliver the gold, all with
one fixation.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they bellied up to the cash register and placed
their orders: Flutie Flakes, partner, and keep 'em comin' until the
shelves are bare.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, when told of the latest frenzy over a cereal that
Buffalo's citizens are threatening to make more popular than even
their best-known local delicacies _ hot wings, Genesee Cream Ale
and beef on a weck _ coach Wade Phillips acknowledged he is playing
a bit part in a real-life fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, in the feel-good story of this NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me what it's like, and all I can think of is that
cartoon song: `Here he comes to save the day,' '' croaked Phillips,
clearly a better coach than singer. ``Right now, he is the hero of
this entire area. Doug Flutie is like, well, our version of Mighty
Mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In this latest incarnation as franchise savior, the
muchkin-sized quarterback is standing tall.
</P>
<P>
   Entering today's game, a Bills team that was moribund under Rob
Johnson suddenly has won five straight games and is tied for the
division lead. The sale of club seats, vital to meeting a Dec. 1
quota that will ensure the franchise remains in western New York
for at least five more seasons, has skyrocketed. Single-game ticket
sales are through the roof as well, and the Bills are commanding
the sort of attention they have not enjoyed since capturing four
straight conference titles, 1990-93.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, Flutie was a centerpiece feature for USA Today,
graced the cover of Sports Illustrated and was named the NFL's
offensive player of the week for the second time this season. Area
sporting goods stores can't keep in stock his uniform jersey No. 7,
now a bigger seller than those of Bills heroes Bruce Smith and
Andre Reed.
</P>
<P>
   At age 36 and following two miserable stints with the Chicago
Bears and New England Patriots, then an eight-year hiatus to the
Canadian Football League, the 1984 Heisman Trophy winner has become
an overnight sensation 15 years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, all of this is the gravy,'' said Flutie, who at
mid-week was named Buffalo's starter for the rest of the season.
``It's never really been a part of my character to go out and try
to prove everyone wrong. But ... hey, I'd be a liar to say it
didn't feel pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of years, I tried way too hard to please people and
subconsciously I put that ahead of just playing football. Now I
don't worry about the peripheral stuff anymore. I'm having too much
fun to let it get in the way. Pretty ironic, that just when I was
starting to phase it all out, I'm all wound up again. Who'd have
thought it?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not most NFL personnel directors, who virtually
ignored Flutie's CFL tenure in which he captured three Grey Cup
titles, won most valuable player six times and passed for 41,355
yards. The other Heisman winner in today's matchup, New York's
Vinny Testaverde, kept getting opportunities in the league, even
when he struggled. But Flutie couldn't even get call-backs from NFL
general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Although he reiterated Friday he would not trade his CFL stint
even for a Super Bowl ring, Flutie allows some bitterness to
resurface when the subject of being snubbed is raised. He went to
the CFL for some exposure; instead, it turned into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as big as they get for football up there,'' said Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   The time in Canada kept him away from his family for long
stretches and given that 6-year-old son Doug Jr. is so severely
autistic that he cannot speak, that was painful. All proceeds from
the sale of Flutie Flakes go to a foundation named for Doug Jr.
``I'd trade in every piece of success I've ever had just to hear
him say, `Dad,' '' Flutie said.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate mogul Donald Trump, who in 1985 signed Flutie to
play for the New Jersey Generals of the USFL, on Thursday spoke of
a ``determination in his eyes so intense that it was like a
beacon.'' If league scouts saw that glare emanating from Canada,
however, they apparently concluded it was just the northern lights.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Buffalo pro personnel director A.J. Smith
persuaded Phillips and general manager John Butler in January that
it was time to bring Flutie home. There had been a few flirtations
with Flutie in recent years, most notably by the New Orleans Saints
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Smith scrutinized Flutie, three times scouting
him in person and watching a dozen videotapes. Over a period of
time, he put aside all the typical prejudices against Flutie, who
is listed at 5 feet 10 but is actually 5-9 1/2. Although Flutie has
just 4.9-second stopwatch speed in the 40-yard dash, Smith watched
him elude the pass rush in the CFL. His arm strength, Smith
assessed, was well above average.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four days after Flutie's $1million-a-year CFL contract
expired in December, he signed a two-year, $625,000 deal with the
Bills that pays him $275,000 for 1998. Owner Ralph Wilson already
has contacted agent Jack Mula about an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wonders why it took so long for somebody to bring him
back, but it's kind of like, `Out of sight, out of mind,' '' Smith
said. ``There's the fact he's small and he's old. It was a feeling
of, `Let's not get involved. You'll look like a fool bringing in an
old, short guy. Defenses will smother him and you'll look like an
idiot.' What's happened now, though, is every scout's dream.

 &HT;    Safe return sends Glenn family chomping
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Sen. John Glenn glided safely back to
Earth aboard the space shuttle Discovery Saturday to end his nine
days in space and reestablish his place among American pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Medical exams ran late at the Kennedy Space Center, forcing the
cancellation of a scheduled Saturday evening crew news conference.
But soon after the physicals ended the Glenn family dug into the
chewing gum Glenn gave his wife Annie the night before the launch.
Gum is a powerful historical symbol for the Glenns, who put it at
the center of a goodbye ritual they used frequently when he was a
combat pilot; he would say he was going to the store for gum and
she would admonish him not to take too long.
</P>
<P>
   They played the game again by telephone in 1962 while he was
strapped into a capsule atop the rocket that would make him the
first American to fly in orbit. The flight that ended Saturday made
Glenn at 77 the oldest man ever in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ecstatic,'' his daughter Lyn, 51, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although a bit shaky from the transition back into a world of
gravitational force, Glenn smiled broadly as he stepped slowly back
onto earth. The families of the crew had watched the shuttle float
in from a set of bleachers near the long runway, but then went to
the crew quarters to get their first glimpse of the astronauts on
NASA television when they stepped out almost two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw dad, mom said, 'Look at him walk!''' Lyn Glenn
said. ``She was so happy he walked off the shuttle. She knew that
was very important to him and was happy his dream came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the crew was bused back to their living quarters
at the space center, where the family was waiting. After so much
holding on, a set of elevator doors pulled open and suddenly a
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ecstatic to hug mother,'' Lyn Glenn said. ``It was a
very long hug, and they both seemed very grateful to be together.

 &HT;    Tway gets between hot, cold
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ Bob Tway could see both sides of the game
Saturday in the third round of the Subaru Sarazen World Open. In
Tway's own threesome, he watched as two-day leader Edward Fryatt
self-destructed to an 83. On the scoreboard, Tway observed the
other extreme as Dudley Hart, his PGA Tour colleague, shot a
masterly front-nine of 28 on the way to a record-tying,
10-under-par 62.
</P>
<P>
   Managing successfully to be distracted by neither development,
Tway toured the Chateau Elan Legends Course in 6-under 66 to take a
one-stroke lead at 14-under 202 entering today's final round of the
$2million tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, whose only win on the PGA Tour came two years ago at the
Canadian Open, is one stroke back at 13-under 203 following a
near-flawless day. Once in position to think seriously about a 59,
Hart swore he never did. He eventually finished with a bogey at the
18th hole after missing the green. The 62 matched Mark
Calcavecchia's in the first round last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Tway, an Oklahoma native who went to high school
in Marietta, he birdied two of his first three holes and kept pace
with Hart. ``I looked up on the board,'' Tway said later, ``and I
was way behind. ... Dudley obviously played a fantastic round of
golf. I've seen him do that before.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hart used to be known for getting hot, a trail of broken
clubs might have been the giveaway. Calmer now, however, he heats
up with his game. Saturday was quite a scorcher. Hart eagled the
5th hole then followed with six consecutive birdies. He broke the
Legends front nine record by three strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I had an incredible front side _ the best nine
holes that I have ever played on Tour,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of his composure as much as his composite, Hart drove away
thoughts of a 59 _ it would not have been official, anyway _ and
played his round shot by shot. His only other 62, at a spot he
could not recall, came on a par-70 course. On the PGA Tour, he's
been no lower than 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``59? It never really crossed my mind, to be honest with you,''
said Hart, who picked up 16 shots on Fryatt just on Saturday's
front nine. ``I've played so much golf that I know a good nine
holes doesn't mean you're going to have another good nine holes.''
</P>
<P>
   No slouch himself, Tway shot a front-nine 32, then added two
more birdies on the back nine. He has made one bogey in 54 holes
and none for 46 holes, since the 8th hole on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Considering greens he insists are as speedy as those at East
Lake last week, Tway could not be more satisfied. A late entry into
the Sarazen, he's 18 holes away from $360,000 and his first win
since the 1995 MCI Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years I've played very well and pretty
consistent,'' said Tway, who earned more than $1million in 1998.
``But I think the thing we all strive for is to win golf
tournaments. Unfortunately, with the competition on the PGA Tour
these days, you don't get that many chances to win. It would just
be nice to win any golf tournament.

 &HT;    Baltimore coach could face the ax
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a loss owner Art Modell termed ``a horror
show,'' Baltimore coach Ted Marchibroda could be fired if the team
is embarrassed today. Twice in 14 years Modell has axed coaches in
mid-season, Sam Rutigliano, replaced by Marty Schottenheimer, in
1984 and Bud Carson, replaced by Jim Shofner, in '90, with mixed
results. Modell would prefer to avoid the hat-trick. Working in
Marchibroda's favor is that Modell isn't enamored with any of the
staffers. Defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis has been lobbying for
the interim job, but some officials prefer offensive boss Kirk
Ferentz. No matter today's outcome, the Ravens will be looking for
a coach come late December. Scratch current Eagles coach Ray
Rhodes, a close friend of personnel director Ozzie Newsome, as a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs concerns
</P>
<P>
   For only the third time in Schottenheimer's tenure, Kansas City
is riding a three-game losing streak, and things are getting dicey.
Some veterans think tailback Donnell Bennett should be replaced by
Bam Morris, who has more instinct. The internal debate over the
quarterback situation, where some players favor backup Rich Gannon
over Elvis Grbac, is heating up. Linebacker Derrick Thomas is used
only on pass-rush downs now, making him a $3.85 million-a-year
situational player.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny, vidi, vici
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to say the marriage of Bill Parcells and Vinny
Testaverde was more like a shotgun wedding arranged by Jets
assistant head coach Bill Belichick, the head coach in Cleveland
during the quarterback's three seasons there. But now the club is
trying to assure there is no quick divorce. Jets cap expert Mike
Tannenbaum recently intiated talks with agent Mike Azzarelli about
an extension for Testaverde. His current contract gives the Jets an
option for 1999 at a salary of $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward ailing
</P>
<P>
   There is concern in Indianapolis for the health of fullback
Craig Heyward. Neurologist Julius Goodman detected a growth at the
base of the player's skull and agent Jack Mills acknowledged the
situation is ``potentially serious.'' GM Bill Polian expects more
test results Monday. ``From a personal standpoint, it's scary,''
said coach Jim Mora, who labeled the mood of his team as ``grim.''
From a practical standpoint, the loss of Heyward, even for a short
time, will force offensive coordinator Tom Moore to expand use of
the shotgun. To afford Peyton Manning a better look at defenses,
Indy has used the shotgun 103 of 229 snaps the last four games and
passed 95 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   No new Leaf
</P>
<P>
   Even during San Diego's bye week, QB Ryan Leaf couldn't avoid
trouble. Last weekend, the petulant one was in Pullman, Wash., to
donate $200,000 to alma mater Washington State. Part of the
donation was made in the name of Andrew Rypien, former NFL
quarterback Mark Rypien's son, who died in August from a brain
tumor. On Saturday, Leaf was bounced from one bar and kicked a hole
in the wall of another.
</P>
<P>
   Home alone
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs defensive lineman Dan Williams, the lone hold-out in '98,
apparently is prepared to miss the season. Labeled a ``franchise''
free agent, the five-year vet balked at signing a one-year deal.
Negotiator Dennis Thum and agent Rosey Barnes have not talked. To
get pension and benefits credit for this season, Williams must sign
by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Cox has supplanted James Farrior as the starting weakside
linebacker for the Jets. Look for nickel linebacker Chad Cascadden
to be used as a ``spy'' on Buffalo's Doug Flutie today. ... The
Miami offensive line is hurting. Left tackle Richmond Webb could
miss six weeks with a torn triceps, and right tackle James Brown is
playing with separated ribs.

 &HT;    Quitting time for Rams
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been apparent to such veterans as linebacker
Eric Hill that many of the younger St. Louis players have quit on
coach Dick Vermeil. It took running backs assistant Wilbert
Montgomery, however, to acknowledge it publicly. Montgomery told
Walter Payton on a Chicago radio station last week that the Rams
have ``a lot of guys that don't have a lot of heart.'' Asked by
host Dan Jiggetts whether the Rams possess football savvy, he said:
``You're roughly speaking about 10 or 12 guys.'' Because he has
three more seasons on his contract, at $1.9 million annually, it
will be difficult for the Rams to fire Vermeil. But if Vermeil
offers to resign, team president John Shaw won't try to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Strangle hold
</P>
<P>
   Several Vikings players _ linebacker Ed McDaniel, defensive end
Derrick Alexander and cornerback Corey Fuller, among them _ are
tight with Minnesota governor-elect Jesse Ventura. But their
support of the former pro wrestler might not help new Vikes owner
Red McCombs. During his campaign, Ventura opposed plans to spend
public funds on the new stadium the Vikings want.
</P>
<P>
   What's their line?
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick will have two
new starters for today's game and the changes aren't over. For now,
Steve Gordon replaces injured Chris Dalman at center and the
unretired Kirk Scrafford starts at right tackle. Derrick Deese, who
has been playing right tackle, goes to the left side for Jamie
Brown. It's expected Dave Fiore, who started the first three games
at left tackle, will be back from injury within two weeks. He'll
regain his starting job. Deese will go to the bench or replace one
of the guards, Kevin Gogan or Ray Brown, if their play doesn't
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Skinny on the Skins
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution has confirmed that financial statements
sent recently to prospective buyers of the Redskins indicate the
club had operating profits of $68.2 million in 1997 and projections
of $70.0 million for this year. That would make the Skins the
second-most profitable team, behind only Jerry Jones' Dallas
Cowboys. President John Kent Cooke, son of late owner Jack Kent
Cooke, continues to line up financing and insisted he could
complete a deal with his father's estate by February. The board of
trustees that runs the team is committed to Cooke. But they will
listen to bids by outsiders Andrew Penson and Howard Milstein.
Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos has an interest, but trustees
know a battle over the NFL's cross-ownership rules would delay a
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Birds of a feather
</P>
<P>
   Eagles vice president Joe Banner took advantage of salary-cap
room last week by reaching contract extensions with cornerback
Bobby Taylor, defensive end Greg Jefferson and free safety Brian
Dawkins. Those moves, along with an earlier extension for wideout
Irving Fryar, are a sign of the stability that operations director
Tom Modrak is attempting to bring to the franchise. On the flip
side, Arizona has more than $3 million in salary-cap room, and some
vets have noted the club has yet to make overtures toward wide
receiver Rob Moore, offensive tackle Lomas Brown or linebacker
Jamir Miller. All three can be unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 4-0 in the NFC East and has outscored its opponents
134-27. ... If Minnesota gets a commanding lead today, coach Dennis
Green will use it to get quarterback Brad Johnson some work. ...
Green Bay quarterbacks coach Andy Reid will keep Brett Favre
throwing off three- and five-step drops. The Packers used the
seven-step drop four times last week and Favre threw two
interceptions. ... Carolina gets offensive lineman Matt Campbell
back from injury today, but he'll line up at right tackle, not his
usual left guard spot. Incumbent right tackle Norberto
Davidds-Garrido got in the doghouse of coach Dom Capers with too
many false-start flags.

 &HT;    Jets QB Testaverde looking to win
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ TWO-MINUTE DRILL
</P>
<P>
   Subject: New York Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: The success of journeyman quarterbacks in the NFL this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Background: After winning the Heisman Trophy at Miami in '86,
Testa-verde was the first overall pick in the '87 draft. He was the
starter five of six seasons in Tampa Bay, but the club never won
more than six games. Testa-verde then played five years in
Cleveland and Baltimore before signing with the Jets after his
release this spring by the Ravens. In 11 previous seasons, his
record as a starter was 48-83-1. Having replaced Glenn Foley as
starter in New York, however, he is 5-0 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several itinerant quarterbacks such as you, Randall
Cunningham, Doug Flutie and Chris Chandler are enjoying big
seasons. Why do you think that is?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you reach a point where you're moving around a lot, you
consciously look for a place where there's a real chance to win.
Money becomes secondary to winning a Super Bowl. So you look around
and then gravitate to teams that have a chance to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So does older make wiser?
</P>
<P>
   A: Playing makes you wiser. Getting on the field, being put in
different circumstances. The guys who are over 30 (years old) and
having good years ... it isn't like it happened overnight. We
learned while we were paying our dues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You came into the NFL when the philosophy was that it takes
five years to develop a quarterback. Is that still the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: With all the zone blitzes and different coverages now, it
takes two or three years to get really comfortable. I look at guys
like Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf and realize that was me 12 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON . . .
</P>
<P>
   Veteran: In his second season and minus the negative influence
of Chester McGlockton, Oakland defensive tackle Darrell Russell is
dominating opponents. Russell has recorded 36 tackles and six
sacks. Some NFL folks in the Bay Area contend he is playing better
than San Francisco tackle Bryant Young.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: Baltimore first-round corner Duane Starks leads league
rookies with three interceptions, but also has been beaten for
three touchdowns of 30-plus yards. He gets his first start today
and will line up against Oakland sprinter James Jett, who since '97
has averaged 32.1 yards on 15 touchdown catches.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent: A week after Steve Young was sacked a career-high
nine times, the injury to San Francisco center Chris Dalman moves
little-used Steve Gordon into the starting lineup. Gordon faces the
challenge of identifying where the pass rush is coming from in the
still-dangerous zone-blitz scheme of Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: When Jimmy Raye replaced Paul Hackett as the offensive
coordinator in Kansas City, he promised a strong running game and a
vertical passing attack. Tailback Donnell Bennett is slumping,
though, and the wide receivers along with tight end Tony Gonzalez
have been running very sloppy routes over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   TIP SHEET
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons have only about $130,000 worth of tickets
left for next Sunday's showdown with San Francisco. That all but
assures a sellout, since vice president Rob Jackson can get Fox to
buy whatever is left, and the first televised home game since Oct.
29, 1995. ... When Mike Holmgren departs the Packers, don't be
surprised if GM Ron Wolf considers soon-to-be-deposed Eagles coach
Ray Rhodes as a replacement. ... Look for Washington to leave wide
receiver Michael Westbrook unprotected in the expansion draft next
Feb. 9. GM Charley Casserly has his fingers crossed Cleveland will
take him. ... Several West Coast scouts feel Oregon's Akili Smith,
not more heralded Cade McNown of UCLA, is the best quarterback
prospect in the Pac-10. ... One reason Oakland coach Jon Gruden has
his team 6-2 is owner Al Davis now attends just one practice
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans quarterback Kerry Collins, now a multiple winner,
can retire the award. After last week's drunken-driving arrest, he
faces league-mandated medical and psychological evaluations, which
will be reviewed by commissioner Paul Tagliabue. His latest
incident could keep Saints president Bill Kuharich from making a
contract offer to keep Collins in New Orleans beyond this year.
</P>
<P>
   STAT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco rookie kicker Wade Richey has made nine of 15
field-goal attempts and 23 of 25 extra points. Those eight misses
are three more than the total of the four kickers let go by the
49ers but still in the league. Gary Anderson (Minnesota), Doug
Brien (New Orleans), Ryan Longwell (Green Bay) and Jeff Wilkins
(St. Louis) have made 48 of 50 three-pointers and 92 of 95 extra
points.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   Washington cornerback Darrell Green, moved to tears by the
Redskins' 1-7 start and, at age 38, now contemplating retirement:
``I know a lot of people think I'm Superman. But this is me. This
is all there is. I don't have a cape.''

 &HT;    Agency leader tours mud-slick Honduras, tries to provide CARE
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA LIMA, Honduras _ Maria Luz de Padilla leaned against the
doorway of the classroom in the Instituto Patria, a room that has
become home. Her 3-year-old daughter clung to her legs.
</P>
<P>
   She lost everything when Hurricane Mitch flooded this area, even
her house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a poor house, but we lived peacefully,'' she said. And
then she wept.
</P>
<P>
   There was little that Peter Bell, president of CARE-USA, the
Atlanta-based relief organization, could say.
</P>
<P>
   He murmured some words of comfort, then said, ''There's not a
lot that can be done immediately for her. The most important thing
is that she have food, shelter, water and protection from
infectious diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, having looked at hurricane-caused damage in Nicaragua on
Friday, took Saturday to tour areas of Honduras hit hard by the
storm. He flew to the city of San Pedro Sula, perhaps 250 miles
northwest of Tegucigalpa, the capital, and looked at a
neighborhood, a shelter and a food distribution center there and in
the nearby city of La Lima.
</P>
<P>
   He said the devastation caused by Mitch in Honduras will require
both short-term emergency assistance, such as that needed by
Padilla, and long-term economic rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   After the mud-soaked tour, Bell, wearing a yellow rain slicker
and khaki pants, tromped into the the office of Honduran President
Carlos Flores to pledge CARE's help with both of those tasks.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's country director in Honduras, Marc de Lamotte, will try
to raise $5 million for emergency relief, on top of the annual $9
million budget for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, CARE worked here exclusively on development
programs, such as agricultural development, and water and
sanitation programs. All that work has come screeching to a halt as
CARE has put its entire 220-person staff to work on the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials say more than 6,000 people are confirmed
dead, thousands more are missing, and hundreds of thousands are
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   CARE hopes shortly to provide food, shelter, plastic sheeting
and water purification to 350,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's day started well, with news that Coca-Cola has agreed to
donate $250,000 to CARE for relief projects in Central America -
the largest donation Coke has ever made to CARE.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is great news for us,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight from Tegucigalpa to San Pedro Sula showed a country
devastated by impossibly broad swaths of huge, horrendous flooding.
In the town of La Libertad, 60 or more homes had been washed away
by the river. In the El Cajon lake, formed by the largest
hydro-electric dam in Central America, people used fishery boats to
search for bodies washed into the lake from upstream.
</P>
<P>
   Corn fields that had just been ready for harvest were flooded.
Banana plantations looked like rice paddies. Acres of sugar cane
were under water.
</P>
<P>
   Cows grazed on levees; nearby, an impromptu town of tents and
shanties stretched along a levee as animals and people alike sought
the only high ground available.
</P>
<P>
   After landing, Bell saw that much of San Pedro Sula and La Lima
were covered with two feet of mud. Pickup trucks slithered sideways
trying to negotiate the streets. People with belongings on their
backs walked thigh-deep in muck. Officials said that foot fungus
serious enough to lead to loss of a limb, if left untreated, has
become a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit to the shelter, Bell visited a site where CARE
is distributing food - corn, beans, oil, soy and rice. People stood
in line, knee-deep in water, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's economic consequences were painfully apparent.
Thousands of people here have small home businesses, and they were
completely wiped out. And a local congressman said that Tela
Railroad Co., an American-owned banana company, has announced it is
laying off 7,300 workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the per capita income is about $600, one
salary usually supports a half dozen people or more.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people we saw today, overwhelmingly, they were poor two
weeks ago,'' Bell said. ''And now, they're even poorer. Right now,
the challenge is to save their lives and stop acute suffering. But
the longer-term challenge is to provide hope and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said CARE did not want its emergency feeding programs to
create permanent dependency, and within three months or so, the
agency would seek to renew its development programs designed to
increase self-sufficiency and reduce economic inequities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with Bell, President Flores said the government
wants to turn over relief efforts to private agencies, such as the
Catholic Church and CARE, both to avoid the appearance of
corruption, and because the government cannot handle all the tasks
it faces.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said economic rebuilding and foreign investment are the
key to Honduras's long-term recovery from the effects of the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, there is a lot of solidarity in terms of
contributions, because this is newsworthy,'' Flores said. ''That's
our main concern -- that people still have the solidarity once this
is no longer in the news.''

LIVINGSTON FRONT-RUNNER IN RACE TO SUCCEED GINGRICH AS SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The race to succeed House Speaker Newt Gingrich
began to crystallize Saturday, as a top prospect for the post bowed
out and Louisiana Representative Bob Livingston emerged as a
formidable front-runner after capturing a key endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 2 of the siege of Gingrich and most of his top
lieutenants, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the influential
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, propelled
Livingston's candidacy by spurning appeals to enter the contest
from several GOP conservatives who led the revolt against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The only likely survivor on Gingrich's leadership team, majority
whip Tom DeLay of Texas, provided Livingston additional momentum by
pledging to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the scramble to replace Gingrich and the core of his team,
the lame-duck speaker emerged briefly from his home in Marietta,
Ga., to make his first public comments since his startling demise
Friday. Gingrich said he agreed to forfeit his hard-won speakership
and 20-year hold on his House seat to try to curb the infighting
within the fragile, factionalized GOP majority.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has controlled the speaker's gavel since he
masterminded the Republican revolution in 1994, ending 40 years of
Democratic rule on Capitol Hill. He will relinquish the speakership
in January and his House seat soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having led the party to three consecutive victories in terms
of having a majority,'' Gingrich said, ``I could hardly stand by
and let the party cannibalize itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's decision to forgo the speaker's race left Livingston,
55, chairman of the 60-member House Appropriations Committee, with
only one official challenger, Representative Christopher Cox of
California. ``I might be the right man for the job, but the job
just isn't right for me,'' said Archer, 77, who vowed to retire
from Congress after his next term.
</P>
<P>
   The only other lawmaker who has publicly expressed serious
interest in the speaker's job, Representative James M. Talent of
Missouri, was close to announcing Saturday whether he will
challenge Livingston and Cox.
</P>
<P>
   But Talent, who is chairman of the Small Business Committee,
abruptly postponed the announcement after word surfaced of DeLay's
endorsement. A spokeswoman said Talent will continue weighing the
decision until at least tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who quietly backed an aborted coup last year against
Gingrich, remains highly influential among much of the
overwhelmingly conservative House Republican caucus. With DeLay's
aid, Livingston could be positioned to seize the 112 votes he will
need to win the speakership when the GOP caucus votes Nov. 18 by
secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's spokesman said he has pledged his ``full and
whole-hearted'' support to Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's supporters said he has secured commitments from
about 80 Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But his candidacy is not without controversy. Despite his
generally conservative record, the hot-tempered Livingston was
assailed by the Coalition for Traditional Values as ``more of a
dictator and control freak than the reasonable leader he arrogantly
perceives himself to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also is not the first choice of the 40 or more
moderate GOP lawmakers, including several from New England.
Although the bloc has virtually no hope of controlling the
speakership, it is large enough that its will cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those individuals who want to replace the speaker or any other
member of the leadership team have an affirmative responsibility to
show what they would do differently from what has been done
before,'' said Representative Charles F. Bass, a moderate from New
Hampshire. ``So far, there has been no substance at all from Bob
Livingston.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass said he has not committed yet to a candidate. But he is
likely to be part of a group of moderates, including
Representatives Nancy Johnson and Christopher Shays of Connecticut,
that will wield a measure of clout in the leadership races.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, 46, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee,
announced his candidacy Friday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
A graduate of Harvard Law School, Cox also received an MBA from
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is influential because of his leadership post and
his California base, Cox is seen as trailing Livingston by a wide
margin.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cox received a boost when several Archer supporters,
including Representative David McIntosh of Indiana, a leading
insurgent against Gingrich, pledged support after Archer bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who spent the day calling more than 100 Republican
colleagues from his Capitol Hill office, said he could not estimate
how many support him. ``We have found a highly fluid situation,''
he said. ``It's anyone's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, DeLay's chief deputy whip, Representative J. Dennis
Hastert of Illinois, also joined the effort to secure the
speakership for Livingston, complicating Cox's effort.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay has not endorsed Gingrich's top associate, majority
leader Dick Armey, who is being challenged by one of the
conservative insurgents, Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Livingston, Largent, and DeLay could end up in
control of the top three leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
   But a new face may also emerge in the No. 4 spot, as
Representative J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma announced Saturday he
will challenge the incumbent chairman of the House Republican
Conference, Representative John A. Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, like Largent, is a conservative Christian and former
football player. He also is the highest-ranking black elected
official in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to take a new communications approach and advance
the message,'' said Watts, who would have a key role in setting the
party's political agenda if he won the post. ``I would be
privileged to help lead and prepare our members to share our
message with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Boehner also are expected to face a challenge from
Representative Rick A. Lazio of New York, a deputy majority whip
who has a moderate record, particularly on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the top-to-bottom attack on Gingrich's team, his fellow
Georgian, Representative John Linder, also is facing a challenge as
he tries to hold his job as chairman of the National Republican
Campaign Committee. Representative George P. Radanovich of
California, who was president of the 74-member GOP freshman class
of 1994 that gave Republicans the House majority, is seeking the
job, as is Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, who is backed by
DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   For Gingrich's part, he said he will vacate his House seat next
year so he will not interfere with his successors. ``There comes a
time to step aside and let a new team take over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's demise comes nearly a decade after he played a key
role in bringing down former House Speaker Jim Wright over
allegations of ethical wrongdoing. In citing the threat that his
party would ``cannibalize'' itself, Gingrich's remarks were eerily
similar to Wright's when he resigned in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, referring to the partisan attacks in the House, said,
``All of us, in both political parties, must resolve to bring this
period of &UR;  &LR; mindless cannibalism to an end.''

ISLAMIC HOLY WAR TAKES CREDIT FOR JERUSALEM SUICIDE BOMBING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War
said Saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a
Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompted arrests by the
Palestinian Authority overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said they had jailed several of the small
but radical group's members from the West Bank, and raided and then
shut down a nursery school linked to the organization in Bethlehem,
which is controlled by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, which led the
Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security
accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as
members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli
security control.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, the Damascus-based leader of Islamic
Holy War, said ``martyrs'' from his movement had carried out the
Jerusalem attack in response to Israel's settlement policy and
``Judaization'' of the West Bank. He spoke in an interview with
Monte Carlo Radio, an Arabic station broadcasting from Paris that
is widely listened to in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   A leaflet signed by the group and faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem
said the ``heroic attack,'' in which 24 people were injured and the
2 bombers killed, had been carried out ``to confront the great
conspiracy that aims to liquidate the Palestinian cause through the
Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements of submission.''
</P>
<P>
   Islamic Holy War and its counterpart, Hamas, have denounced as a
sellout of Palestinian rights the 1993 Oslo self-rule accord and
the latest agreement, known as the Wye Memorandum, named for the
Wye Plantation in Maryland, where the deal was worked out with
strenuous American mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Shallah's claim of responsibility from abroad contrasted with
the muted response of Islamic Holy War's leadership in the Gaza
Strip, which has reportedly given commitments to the Palestinian
Authority to refrain from such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no knowledge in the movement about the operation that
occurred in Jerusalem,'' said Nafez Azzam, a senior leader of
Islamic Holy War in Gaza. ``From its conditions we consider it
likely that it was an individual effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian cabinet, in a statement issued after a meeting
on Friday night, accused ``foreign forces'' of standing behind the
attack. One cabinet member, who declined to be identified, pointed
a finger at Iran, saying a search of one bomber's home had
uncovered a letter he had written to the Iranian supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, expressing condolences for the recent
killing of several Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, which has backed militant Islamic groups opposed to the
Arab-Israeli peace efforts, has denounced the Wye agreement,
branding Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a traitor to the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian cabinet promised to crack down on the militants,
who it said were jeopardizing the recovery of Palestinian land and
hopes for statehood by giving Israel a pretext to postpone carrying
out the Wye accord. The Israeli Cabinet suspended a meeting to
ratify the agreement after the bombing, demanding that the
Palestinians conduct an ``all-out war on terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials had no comment Saturday on the measures taken
by the Palestinian Authority on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye agreement calls for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent more of the West Bank in exchange for specific Palestinian
measures against violent militants.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian security official said several Islamic Holy War
members were arrested in the West Bank on Friday night. Arrests
were also reported in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Itaf Alayan, a supporter of the group who runs the Islamic
Purity Nursery in Bethlehem, said Palestinian officers had raided
the school and confiscated videotapes and educational cassettes
before locking it up.
</P>
<P>
   The two bombers were identified as Youssef Zughayer, 21, from
Anata, near Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh,
24, from Silat al-Harithiya, near the West Bank town of Jenin. Both
had served time in Israeli jails and were known to be members of
Islamic Holy War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought he would do something like this,'' said
Muhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father. ``We condemn such acts, but
the only thing we can do now is to say may he rest in peace.''

A PHONE CALL MAY HAVE BEEN BEGINNING OF THE END
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not a vintage Gingrich moment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the House speaker's post-election conference call to
angry Republicans Wednesday _ members derisively refer to it now as
``1-800-CLUELESS'' _ may have been the turning point in the
dizzying blur last week that brought the speaker down.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of Republicans who demanded to know why the party
lost five House seats Tuesday instead of winning 14 or more, as the
speaker had predicted, Newt Gingrich was uncharacteristically
stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly don't understand all the things that happened out
there,'' he told House members during the conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have the answers, and members were disappointed,
saddened, and shocked,'' said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster and
former Gingrich adviser. ``After that, several hard-core Gingrich
loyalists were willing to entertain options, and even more started
saying they couldn't support the speaker under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by Friday, the handful of House Republicans who said
they would not vote for the speaker in the Nov. 18 GOP caucus had
grown to 12 _ more than enough to deny Gingrich a majority when his
nomination came before the closely divided House of the 106th
Congress in January. For Gingrich, the choice came down to
resigning or being fired.
</P>
<P>
   So after four tumultuous years at the helm of the House and as
the lightning rod of the Republican Revolution, it took just four
days for Gingrich to decide that he not only had to relinquish the
leadership post he loved, but also to leave the Congress that his
ideology and energy had largely molded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to stay in the House would make it impossible for a new
leader to learn, to grow, to do what they have to do,'' Gingrich
said Saturday outside his home in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's stunning repudiation by the Republican rank-and-file
began with election-night rumblings Tuesday and grew into a
full-throated revolt by Friday. ``His support melted like a snowman
in the Sahara,'' said Norman Ornstein, an expert on Congress at the
American Enterprise Institute. ``It happened much quicker than
anyone anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the party that doesn't control the White House
gains congressional seats in midterm elections. The poor showing
Tuesday was even more disturbing to Republicans because Gingrich
and the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee had been
predicting President Clinton's sex scandal would help produce
double-digit gains in the House for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for the second election in a row, Republicans lost
House seats. They saw their majority shrink to 12 from 26 in 1994,
when Republicans took control of the House and elected Gingrich as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started Wednesday morning; the members were disappointed in
the results and almost simultaneously, they began a concentrated
exercise in finger-pointing, one we will talk about for decades,''
said Representative Charles Bass, a New Hampshire Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in a company, the speaker is ultimately responsible for
the fate of his conference,'' Bass said. ``The blame was being
assessed, and it was clear Gingrich was going to have to fight
within his own conference like he had never done before, or step
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight was joined, but because the speaker and most members
of the House were in their home districts for the election, the
battle for control of the GOP caucus was waged over the telephone
rather than in the Capitol. Communication problems simply added to
the week's confusion, according to Bass, because some members
missed calls their staff normally would have fielded, and some
callers were reluctant to leave their home phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gingrich said he was ``not particularly concerned'' by
the Republican unrest, he spent Wednesday on the phone with his
leadership deputies, firming up their support, making the fateful
caucus call, and speaking privately to his friend Representative
Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who had voiced an interest in being
speaker if Gingrich ever stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston reportedly told Gingrich to do some
``soul-searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was taking his own advice, and by Thursday had
initiated a serious but undeclared campaign for speaker. Livingston
was torn; he was indebted to Gingrich for making him chairman of
the Appropriations Committee in 1994, but he was also annoyed the
speaker had not shown stronger leadership in getting 1999 spending
bills passed, a failure that gave President Clinton the upper hand
in budget negotiations and the Democrats some important
election-year victories.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Representative Steve Largent, a telegenic Oklahoma
conservative, had flown back to Washington to try to persuade
Livingston to form a slate of challengers to the Gingrich
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the move, majority leader Dick Armey and majority whip
Tom Delay, both Texans, were working the phones themselves to save
their jobs. According to Bass, neither made the case for Gingrich
when they talked to him.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Largent went forward without Livingston, holding
a press conference to announce his challenge to the majority
leader. Tuesday's election, Largent said, was like ``hitting an
iceberg.'' The question he then posed was ``whether we retain the
crew of the Titanic or we look for some new leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Livingston was on the lawn of the Capitol and
before the cameras, promising to be the sensible, responsible
choice between ``inspirational speeches and perspiration-filled
achievement,'' and suggesting that he had the votes to defeat
Gingrich in the GOP caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz endorsed that claim. ``Gingrich was losing support from
everywhere _ the establishment committee chairmen, the conservative
freshmen of 1994, the moderates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was on the telephone again, but this time with the
stunning admission that the game was over and he would step aside
as speaker. He had discussed it with his wife, Marianne, and made
the decision in midafternoon. He spoke to his staff, his friends,
his deputies, and, once again, the House conference.
</P>
<P>
   He was proud and defiant, according to those who talked to
Gingrich. ``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison
that is in the system,'' said Gingrich, who reportedly referred to
some House conservatives who wanted to get rid of him as
``cannibals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladonna Lee, a Republican consultant, said: ``I think he looked
in the mirror, talked to his wife, and said he wasn't going to take
the beating any more. I read it as a fairly selfless act, done for
the good of the party.''

CAPTIVE ELEPHANTS LIKE RUBY FADING AWAY AS BREEDING EFFORTS FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenix Zoo will never see another one like her.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, say zoo experts around the country, there may not be an
elephant like Ruby in North American zoos for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two culprits are leading to a swift decline in the number of
elephants in zoos in this country: more restrictions on importing
endangered species from Asia and Africa, and the animals' poor
success rate in breeding in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Especially those like Ruby, who was born in the wilds of
Thailand in the area of a logging camp.
</P>
<P>
   The last elephant imported from Asia to a U.S. zoo was six years
ago and it's even been longer from Africa, said Robert Wiese, an
elephant expert and animal collector for the Fort Worth zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's research projects that the 276 Asian elephants in North
America will fall to just 22 in the next 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   And each of the remaining elephants will be more than 30 years
old, past the prime age of reproduction, Wiese said.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants normally live to about 50 years in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really applaud the Phoenix Zoo for taking on the problem of
trying to increase the numbers,'' Wiese said. ``So many zoos in the
past have sat on their hands and said, `We have our elephant,' and
done nothing more. Now, we have a real crisis in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   It's even more serious among the African elephants, Wiese said.
While about 120 Asian elephant calves have been born in North
America, only about 10 African elephant calves have been born in
this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   When there's a loss of two, like Ruby and her calf, the impact
is huge, said Janis Joslin, a veterinarian at Woodland Park
Zoological Gardens in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This animal is irreplaceable as far as genetics since we
aren't seeing them from the wild any more,'' Joslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby's death sent shock waves through workers at the Seattle
zoo, zoo spokeswoman Gigi Ogilvie said. That's because one of its
four elephants, Chai, was sent to Dickerson Park Zoo in
Springfield, Mo., in September for breeding after six years of
unsuccessful attempts at artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   As in Ruby's case, Seattle zoo officials felt it of utmost
importance to get Chai pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Elephant Species Survival Plan, administered by
the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, urges all zoos to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruby's death really hit home because we have two elephants who
paint up here, also,'' Ogilvie said. ``But Ruby was the pioneer in
that regard. What happened to her was a tragedy and it's something
we fear with our elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   Joslin said that operations such as the Caesarean section on
Ruby have been unsuccessful for a number of reasons. It's difficult
to replace fluids lost in the animals. Operating areas can't be
kept as clean as in hospitals. Surgeons operate in the dark because
the huge bulk of intestines cover the uterus. When elephants are
cut into, they often don't heal properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of one to survive an operation similar to this only to
die quickly thereafter of kidney failure,'' Joslin said. ``With
every operation, though, we get closer to success.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is little solace to Wiese and other elephant researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going, the captive elephant population may
go extinct well before the wild populations that are currently
receiving more attention,'' Wiese said. &QL;

THE FLUTIE FACTOR RISES HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing)  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Doug Flutie eats Flutie Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had some yesterday,'' he said one day last week in Buffalo,
referring to his own brand of cereal that is a hot seller in that
town, just like the hot quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you eat them every day?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't eat anything every day,'' he snapped. His face looked
twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was flustered. With all the hype, glare and intensity
being hurled his way, no wonder his patience was thinning. His free
space has now become the size of a thimble.
</P>
<P>
   Could be that way when Flutie and the Bills jostle with the Jets
Sunday afternoon at Giants Stadium. Both teams are 5-3, so first
place in the American Football Conference East goes to the winner.
Big game. But Flutie played in plenty of those in the last eight
years in the Canadian Football League. It has been some trek:
magical star and Heisman Trophy winner at Boston College, four
seasons and only 14 starts with two teams (Chicago and New England)
in the National Football League, off to Canada (banished to
Canada?) for eight seasons, back this year to the NFL. Back with
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive Bills starts now. Three straight victories.
And the talk of the league. All eyes are on him.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, 36, knows there is a difference between playing in the
CFL and in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the reads and the delivery a little quicker
here. There is that bit of adjustment because the field is shorter.
The windows of opportunity are smaller. You don't have the luxury
of having your receiver run a longer route and develop it more on a
defender. Plus the C.F.L. plays with 12 men and you have 11 in the
NFL. It is a totally different read and a faster game here. When I
first got here, my head was spinning. But now the pace is slowing
down for me. I'm getting used to the pace. It's not so fast
anymore. I'm slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating, really. Doug Flutie is slowing down and everyone
else, the NFL included, is speeding up. Catching up. The entire
league did not think he could play _ too short (5 feet 9 inches),
too light (175 pounds) _ and did not think his arm was strong
enough or his game big enough. So, Canada became Flutie's playing
ground for eight long seasons, from 1990 through 1997. He is back
now.
</P>
<P>
   And his window of opportunity just blew wide open. He has been
named the Bills' starter for the rest of the season, supplanting
Rob Johnson, who was injured four games ago and is ready to play
again. The Bills will stick with Flutie. The hot hand.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo loves him now. The NFL adores the interest he has
piqued. Bills ticket sales are improving. Teammates love his fire
and desire. Opponents marvel at his determination and skill.
Reporters tug at him. Television cameras cannot get enough shots.
His No. 7 jersey is a favorite with the fans. Everyone wants to
shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Get your Flutie Flakes!
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonderful time for Doug Flutie. It is, too, a time of
some consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is aggravating to my wife, Laurie, and me is that I
haven't been doing anything different from what I've been doing in
the last eight years in Canada,'' he said last week in Buffalo.
``Now all of a sudden everybody cares. Something about that is not
right to us. It's aggravating. People would recognize me before and
maybe wave or nod. Now they all want that extra two or three
minutes or to shake hands. There's some sincerity lost in that.''
</P>
<P>
   His face looked twisted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the fact that I had to go play in Toronto and
Vancouver and British Columbia and all over Canada for eight years
just to get a real shot in the NFL. I was never with an offense in
the NFL before that was open-minded and did some of the things I
need to do. They never really let me throw the ball. So, I was a
guy that was too short and too this and that and had little choice
but to go to Canada, and I missed a lot. I missed a chance to see
my kids grow up. I could have been doing this the last eight years
in New England all along.''
</P>
<P>
   His face no longer looked twisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know, it sounds like I have a chip on my shoulder,''
Flutie said, forcing a small smile. ``Maybe I do. Rob Johnson tells
me that all of that time.''
</P>
<P>
   A chip for the other 29 NFL teams that looked the other way. A
little something for everyone who doubted. A little something for
not even a window of opportunity for eight straight years.
</P>
<P>
   And now this.
</P>
<P>
   So, forgive Flutie if you will, but he is playing football this
fall with a stick-it-to-you, sock-it-to-you redemptive attitude.
Every pass, every touchdown, every victory is another triumph in
his season of personal statement as well as the Bills'
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie loves the NFL adulation. He also resents it.
</P>
<P>
   If only it could have happened long ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The height, the weight, the speed _ he fit the perfect
stereotype of the guy who can't play quarterback,'' said Ozzie
Newsome, the Baltimore Ravens vice president and chief of player
personnel. ``How many under-6-foot quarterbacks have been
successful in this league? That is why the NFL didn't believe. He
is a huge exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every one Doug Flutie there are 20 that didn't make it and
couldn't do it. And the thing about it is that many quarterbacks
have shown that they can play three or four games and be good.
Bobby Hoying, Danny Kanell, Jake Plummer _ they all did that last
year. Look at them this year. Teams start circulating that tape and
these defensive coaches come up with things to make it tough. If
Flutie can sustain what he has done over the next 10 or 12 games,
he will really be the exception. And, let me make this clear _ I'm
not saying he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is the top-rated passer in the American Football
Conference with a 102.7 passer rating. He has thrown 10 touchdown
passes and only 3 interceptions. He has completed 62.8 percent of
his passes. In Canada, he was a similar star and more: In his eight
seasons there he won the league's most outstanding player award six
times and his teams won the league championship three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug is the new guy on the block, a new story,'' said Wade
Phillips, Buffalo's head coach. ``He's like Mighty Mouse _ he's
come in to save the day. He's a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, the Bills' mighty defensive end, said: ``To be
honest, I don't think anyone in their right mind could foresee what
was going to happen in the last five weeks. We lost three straight,
won five straight, we're in first place and Doug Flutie is our
starting quarterback. He does things that can't be done up there on
the chalkboard. In boxing, they call it ring management. He
improvises and takes control. He has a heart as big as any
300-pound linemen I've ever played against.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Bills say they wanted Flutie to remain the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if something happens to Doug that we have a great
quarterback in Rob who can come right in and win for us,'' said
Bills defensive end Marcellus Wiley. ``But the coaches' decision
reflects the players. We are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie gives the Bills mobility at quarterback. Defenses today
fiercely pursue quarterbacks and Flutie counters that with
elusiveness and breaks down defenses. His arm strength is good, his
play-fakes and ball-handling are special and his intelligence is
supreme. That is his real game, his smarts and his experience. And
the combination of all of that enables him to find unique and
uncanny ways with his talent to win.
</P>
<P>
   He makes others around him who have more talent, who have more
speed, work harder, produce more. They see little Doug Flutie
busting to win and they think, ``Gee, I'm twice as big as him,
twice as fast _ why can't I do that? I can!'' They do.
</P>
<P>
   So Buffalo rolls. Flutie rolls. Others are at the forefront.
Receiver Eric Moulds is making big plays. Fullback Sam Gash brings
extra oomph. Running back Thurman Thomas, in a reduced role, still
makes big Thurman Thomas plays. The former Dallas receiver Kevin
Williams contributes. The Bills' offensive line is having an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets this afternoon will most likely command that their pass
rushers stay in their lanes, remain disciplined, and force Flutie
to beat them from the pocket with passes down field. No mad
scrambling. The Jets will attempt to make Flutie's fame fleeting
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie knows the ride can derail. His plan, though, is to keep
sticking, keep socking. It was A.J. Smith, the Bills' director of
pro personnel, who sold the owner Ralph Wilson and the Bills on
Flutie. Smith saw the winner, and, simply, the football player that
Flutie is. Flutie initially wondered if his new teammates would,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first arrived in minicamp in May,'' Flutie said, ``I
knew I could play. But I didn't know what to expect from the team.
I didn't know if they would treat me like a rookie or a veteran.
But I think I've showed them something.''
</P>
<P>
   Showed them all.

SYMINGTON SOUFFLE HAS YET TO RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a man in his 50s. He was con victed on seven counts of
fraud and sentenced to 2{ years in prison. He has no job, no power,
no money (or so he says).
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for J. Fife Symington III, these are the salad days.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, they're the soup days.
</P>
<P>
   Or the vegetable days.
</P>
<P>
   Or the days he learns all about pate.
</P>
<P>
   Long after other convicted crimi nals from 1997 have been
carved, cubed and dumped into the prison stew _ with the timer set
for the next century _ Symington walks free.
</P>
<P>
   Most days, the former governor of Arizona attends classes at the
Scottsdale Culinary Institute, where prison garb gives way to
pressed white smocks and floppy chef hats.
</P>
<P>
   Students from all over the nation attend the school, located
about a mile from downtown Scottsdale, on a quiet corner near a
park.
</P>
<P>
   While Symington, according to student guidelines, attempts to
``ob tain a working knowledge of meat, poultry and fish
fabrications,'' his legal team attempts to uncook his goose.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, it turns out, is fairly simple.
</P>
<P>
   1. Select the finest cuts of legal suits.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add several heaping truckloads of cash.
</P>
<P>
   3. Simmer. &QL; 
HARD-BOILED LAWYERS
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Symington was in San Francisco to watch his lawyers
ar gue before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He wants a new
trial.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the former governor should be in his 14th month of con
finement at the federal pen at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's working his way through a $8,075-per-year curricu
lum in which students ``are intro duced to the fundamental
concepts, skills and techniques involved in cooking,'' with special
emphasis on ``classical French'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon his skill level and study habits, Symington
eventu ally may graduate as, among other things, a pantry cook,
saucier, food and beverage director or sous chef.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how this will benefit him in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Among prison inmates, I'd guess a fellow is even less likely to
admit he's a sous chef than to admit he's a politician.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't to say the institute's courses aren't without
potential value for a man facing jail. At least two classes at the
school promise to improve a student's ``knife handling skills.''

SYMINGTON SOUFFLE HAS YET TO RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a man in his 50s. He was con victed on seven counts of
fraud and sentenced to 2{ years in prison. He has no job, no power,
no money (or so he says).
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for J. Fife Symington III, these are the salad days.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, they're the soup days.
</P>
<P>
   Or the vegetable days.
</P>
<P>
   Or the days he learns all about pate.
</P>
<P>
   Long after other convicted crimi nals from 1997 have been
carved, cubed and dumped into the prison stew _ with the timer set
for the next century _ Symington walks free.
</P>
<P>
   Most days, the former governor of Arizona attends classes at the
Scottsdale Culinary Institute, where prison garb gives way to
pressed white smocks and floppy chef hats.
</P>
<P>
   Students from all over the nation attend the school, located
about a mile from downtown Scottsdale, on a quiet corner near a
park.
</P>
<P>
   While Symington, according to student guidelines, attempts to
``ob tain a working knowledge of meat, poultry and fish
fabrications,'' his legal team attempts to uncook his goose.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, it turns out, is fairly simple.
</P>
<P>
   1. Select the finest cuts of legal suits.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add several heaping truckloads of cash.
</P>
<P>
   3. Simmer. &QL; 
HARD-BOILED LAWYERS
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Symington was in San Francisco to watch his lawyers
ar gue before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He wants a new
trial.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the former governor should be in his 14th month of con
finement at the federal pen at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's working his way through a $8,075-per-year curricu
lum in which students ``are intro duced to the fundamental
concepts, skills and techniques involved in cooking,'' with special
emphasis on ``classical French'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon his skill level and study habits, Symington
eventu ally may graduate as, among other things, a pantry cook,
saucier, food and beverage director or sous chef.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how this will benefit him in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Among prison inmates, I'd guess a fellow is even less likely to
admit he's a sous chef than to admit he's a politician.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't to say the institute's courses aren't without
potential value for a man facing jail. At least two classes at the
school promise to improve a student's ``knife handling skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that such a thing will be nec essary for Symington.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in hot water for years. Prosecutors haven't been
able to bring it to a boil. Even conviction didn't do it.

VEGAS ROLLS DICE BY ADDING CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Peter the Great would've dug Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced he would take to it like a fish to water,'' said
Dr. Vadim Znamenov, director of the State Museum Reserve-Peterhof.
</P>
<P>
   Znamenov should know _ it is from his facility that 1,150
treasures of czarist Russia were borrowed for a head-spinning
exhibit that opened here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The glittering artifacts celebrate the 200-year Romanov dynasty
that ended with the Russian revolution of 1917. They are on display
just a few yards above the shining slot machines and frenzied card
tables of the Rio All-Suite Casino Resort.
</P>
<P>
   And just down Flamingo Road sits Stephen Wynn's $1.6 billion
Bellagio, where a $300 million fine-art collection is displayed in
two quiet rooms not far from the whirring casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasures of Russia _ estimated value: priceless _ coupled
with Wynn's new art-appreciation destination, add a fresh dimension
of disorientation to a city constructed of disorienting sights and
sounds, from its make-believe pyramid, castle and New York City
skyline to its time-melting casino interiors. It also signals yet
another new phase for the City Formerly Known as Lost Wages.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Las Vegas has high culture beyond the Liberace Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that Las Vegas is all of a sudden trying to
become something that it's not,'' said Rob Powers, spokesman for
the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ``The bottom line
is, we have to change, and we are going to keep having to change
because people can gamble anywhere they want now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, everything in Las Vegas focused on the
casinos and (showroom) entertainment. The mind-set back then was
that any diversion away from casinos was considered heresy. I think
we're grown up a lot as a destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular growth has been the norm here for a good long run.
But for the first time since 1993, Nevada's annual growth rate has
dropped below 5 percent, and for the first time since 1983, fewer
people will visit Las Vegas this year than the previous.
</P>
<P>
   According to Convention and Visitors Authority projections, 1998
will finish a little more than 1 percent below 1997's 30.5 million
total, approximately 1.2 million of whom visited from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The average Las Vegas gambler spends just 3.9 hours in the
casinos each day, a figure that has been steadily declining. The
take from gaming is now about 50 percent of a typical big
operation's gross, said Powers, down from 60 percent at the
beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Once, vice _ gambling, drinking, smoking, carousing with
prostitutes, etc. _ was enough. Shopping was confined to hotel
arcades where canary-yellow sports coats passed for snappy attire.
Dining was defined by the 99-cent breakfast special, which provided
fuel for gamblers but little palate pleasure. Entertainment was
provided by swingin' lounge acts and big-name showroom stars
enveloped in feathery production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That image held well into the 1980s, and many remnants _ see
Newton, Wayne _ remain.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas' last big growth spurt, launched with the 1993
openings of Treasure Island, where boatloads of bogus buccaneers do
battle each night, the glass Luxor pyramid and the MGM Grand
megalopolis, was targeted at ``the family trade,'' and brought a
roller coaster to the Strip. Now there are several.
</P>
<P>
   Vegas' family phase ``was, frankly, way overblown,'' said
Powers. It's a phase that properties such as Bellagio and
attractions like the Rio's seem to signal as being, frankly, way
over.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple elegant restaurants _ with famous attached chefs from
culinary capitols such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco _
are now a feature of every new or planned property. Picasso, a
Bellagio restaurant decorated with originals by the namesake
artist, is booked solid into next year. There, diners can
experience living with the paintings and sculpture _ for four or
five courses, at least.
</P>
<P>
   High-end shops _ Gucci, Armani and Tiffany line Bellagio's
retail gallery _ fill costly square footage up and down the Strip.
Health spas and golf courses are eating up ever more desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to think and mention Las Vegas in the same
breath with New York and Paris or some of the great (destination
cities) of the world,'' Powers said. ``And I think we're really
legitimately moving there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Catherine the Great was a devoted gambler. Her card
table is one of the Treasures of Russia, along with the gilded
thrones of Peter the Great, Empress Maria Alexandrovna and Nicolas
II.
</P>
<P>
   Other historical highlights of the show are the football-size
Imperial Chanticleer Faberge Egg, the nightshirt Paul I was wearing
the night of his murder, and the inkwell into which Nicolas II
dipped his pen as he signed his abdication, the signature that
ended his family's reign and ultimately ended his life.
</P>
<P>
   All now join Wynn's personal Jackson Pollocks and Pablo Picassos
in the Las Vegas entertainment mix.
</P>
<P>
   `It stands to reason that the more alternatives to gambling you
offer, the more dollars are going to be spent on those
alternatives,'' Powers said. ``Twenty years ago, the mind-set was
get 'em in casinos and keep 'em there.'' In the next few years,
however, the Las Vegas mind-set is likely to be, ``Get 'em here,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio's 3,000 rooms _ rates: $159 to $1,400, with possible
discounting on the lower end _ will compete for occupants with at
least four new massive projects scheduled for completion in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical-themed Mandalay Bay, with 3,276 rooms, which will
be topped, literally, by a separately managed Four Seasons hotel,
will debut in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Venetian, fashioned in the style of 15th century Venice,
will open in April with 3,000 rooms on the site of the fabled
Sands, but is planned to grow 3,000 more rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Paris, a 2,914-room resort built around a 50-story virtual
Eiffel Tower, is rising across the street from the Bellagio, with a
completion date in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And, for 2000, they're rebuilding the recently imploded Aladdin,
which is expected to add at least 2,600 more rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has survived such marketing challenges as Atlantic
City and the proliferation of Indian casinos before. It remains a
thriving convention city with a year-round occupancy rate that
other big cities covet. In 1997, 3,749 conventions kept local
hotels humming at 86 percent of capacity. The American average: 64
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, Houston and Louisville were the three finalists for the
Treasures of Russia show until Robert Nargassans, managing director
of the exhibit, was approached by a personal friend at the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The Peterhof's Znamenov was wary at first _ Nargassans said that
the Russians' image of Las Vegas was formed by watching old
gangster movies _ but is now convinced that his museum pieces are
in a highly appropriate setting.
</P>
<P>
   Peter the Great founded Peterhof in 1705 on the shores of Gulf
of Finland near St. Petersburg. Succeeding czars added to the
complex, building palaces and gardens, gold statuary and blue
fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter the Great built Peterhof as an amusement center, where
not only official ceremonies took place,'' said Znamenov, whose
treasures will remain on display at the Rio until mid-April, then
return to Russia. ``Peterhof was the happiest place in Russia. It
was a joyous place. It was a place where you make merry.''

HUD OVERCHARGING LOW-INCOME BUYERS ON HOUSE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agency created to help Americans find cheap, decent housing
has victimized many of the people it was supposed to serve, selling
hundreds of homes nationally for more than they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing itself as the home buyer's friend, the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development was actually grabbing for profits
to cover the costs of an important federal insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Under congressional pressure to pay for its programs, HUD in a
recent 12-month period raked in about $50 million more than what
its own appraisals said its properties were worth. The sales often
were to unsophisticated and first-time buyers of modest means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who ended up on the short side of the equation was the
lower income buyer,'' said former Phoenix mayor Terry Goddard,
HUD's Phoenix district director.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, top HUD officials defended the policy,
saying that it was fiscally sound and that overbidding was not
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Phoenix was one of the worst markets for buyers paying too
much. Valley home buyers overpaid about $7.6 million since the
start of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses sold for 25 percent more than what they were worth.
A few went for 50 percent higher. Others were money pits, failing
to meet HUD's minimum health and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by HUD's soft-sell advertising, buyers commonly assumed
these houses were bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone has a dream home,'' says the computerized
online sales pitch, ``a place they like to wander through in their
thoughts, choosing imaginary wallpaper and putting in imaginary
skylights.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for many people,'' it teases, ``dream homes remain just
that _ dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD promises to help ``by making home buying easier and more
affordable.'' The bottom line: houses ``at attractive prices and
economical terms.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD does help put thousands of Americans in homes each year _
and at a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   But for many buyers, that isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' reviewed hundreds of pages of
government records, interviewed HUD homeowners and government
workers, and conducted a computer-aided analysis of Phoenix HUD
home sales.
</P>
<P>
   The real bottom line: HUD ran a program that sometimes sold
substandard housing for top dollar and stubbornly fought to protect
its policy and profits even after federal auditors sternly called
for a halt to the practice.
</P>
<P>
   `` The Republic'' review and a HUD analysis found one-third to
two-thirds of all Phoenix HUD homes sold for at least 10 percent
more than what HUD knew they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also paid inflated prices in other cities doing hot HUD
business, notably Atlanta; Fort Worth; Coral Gables, Fla.; San
Diego; and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 8,800 homes sold nationally during 12 months in
1995 and 1996, HUD's own analysis showed that two-thirds were
unloaded for more than their appraised value. About half of those
had prices exceeding their value by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   HUD also ignored complaints from its front-line employees who
opposed the for-profit policy and who said it was contrary to the
agency's mission.
</P>
<P>
   And for more than two years HUD stonewalled its own Office of
Inspector General, which charged HUD with taking advantage of
unsuspecting clients. The inspector general, HUD's independent
auditing and investigative arm, said HUD had adopted a buyer-beware
attitude and was ``knowingly allowing others to take advantage of
uninformed first-time low- and moderate-income home buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, three weeks ago, HUD finally blinked. It changed its
policy, starting this Friday, an action that is expected to deflate
overblown HUD home prices nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision as soon as I found it was a problem,''
said deputy Federal Housing Commissioner Ira Peppercorn, who joined
the agency late last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that almost didn't happen. After verbally
committing to the move months ago, agency officials apparently
forgot about the issue, distracted by other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change languished for months and HUD rang up more
inflated home sales. ``The Republic,'' using the Freedom of
Information Act, requested internal memos, electronic mail and
agency reports, and pressed officials for evidence of a policy
shift.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, machinist Larry O'Hanlon didn't know what top
government officials knew. He just wanted a home. And he thought he
found a good deal in a two-bedroom HUD town home in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The town home ended up in HUD's hands in the usual way: Someone
defaulted on a home loan insured by the Federal Housing
Administration. The lender foreclosed, and FHA paid off the lender,
took ownership, then flipped it back onto the market.
</P>
<P>
   And it was sold in the usual way: competitive sealed bidding.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon put down $500 in earnest money to be able to make a bid
on the home, which had a list price of $70,000 _ $1,000 more than
the appraised value. As usual, none of the bidders knew the
appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon said his agent told him the price to offer in his bid:
$83,420, or 21 percent above HUD's appraised value. O'Hanlon can't
remember his agent's name, and HUD won't tell, citing privacy
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that O'Hanlon didn't get good advice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon said he bid high because he was told by his agent that
the list price was 10 to 20 percent below market. He didn't know it
was based on an independent appraisal that is supposed to reflect
true market value.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon's agent also showed him prices of what he was told were
comparable area sales. He felt his bid was in the ballpark. He
later learned from federal auditors that the comparable sales had
been of larger properties with more improvements.
</P>
<P>
   When he won the bid, his agent told him it was by the skin of
his teeth. Months later, he learned the truth from federal
auditors: The next closest bid was about $10,000 less. &QL; 
HOME, SOGGY HOME
</P>
<P>
   But at least he had a home. What O'Hanlon didn't know was that
his troubles were just starting.
</P>
<P>
   The place was a disaster. O'Hanlon knew that, but he expected
HUD to fix it up. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Many HUD houses are in poor shape. All are sold as is, though
HUD is supposed to make sure that they meet minimum health and
safety standards: no leaky roofs, bare floors, exposed wires or bad
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon's roof leaked badly, leaving the carpet in some rooms
moldy and uncleanable. A bedroom wall was moldy, its wallpaper
peeling from water damage. The kitchen sink leaked. There were no
shower heads in the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the sale federal auditors worked with
O'Hanlon to get HUD to do what it was supposed to: put on a roof
that didn't leak, repair the water damage and fix the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   HUD did install a new roof _ a year after O'Hanlon moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The new roof leaked, too. Back came the HUD inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the guy from HUD told me?'' O'Hanlon recalled
recently. ``He told me, `The low bid gets the job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The roof was repaired _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Water damage on the ceiling was finally fixed in March of this
year, 21 months after O'Hanlon moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 28 months after O'Hanlon moved in, the floors in some
areas are still bare where carpet was damaged by the leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to get the carpet in here,'' O'Hanlon said.
``They said to me, everything that could've gone wrong did go wrong
here. They were pretty apologetic. But you just can't get them out
to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD says it is looking into the matter. &QL; 
BID HIGH OR LOSE
</P>
<P>
   Problems such as O'Hanlon's aren't news to people inside HUD or
knowledgeable outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Carrillo, executive director of Neighborhood Housing
Services of Phoenix Inc., said HUD's sales policies hit her agency
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo's agency buys low-cost houses and fixes them up for
sale to low-income families. They shop for bargains. Nowadays, that
means resale homes, not HUD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, we're being outbid'' for HUD homes, Carrillo
said, even though her agency is entitled to a non-profit agency
discount on HUD homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want to bid above appraisal,'' she said.
``We've very rarely been successful (bidding) in the last couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of problems and high prices in Phoenix HUD homes reached
the HUD inspector general in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After investigating, the inspector general worked for months to
persuade HUD's Washington, D.C., leadership to make sure buyers
weren't paying too much.
</P>
<P>
   In memo after memo, report after report, the inspector general
blamed both HUD policies and real estate agents for the problem.
Auditors felt that HUD's policies were encouraging overbidding, and
that individual agents were taking advantage of that policy.
</P>
<P>
   HUD steadfastly maintained that overbidding was mostly in hot
housing markets where appraisals could not keep up with market
values.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franklin, special assistant to the Federal Housing
Commissioner, said it was notunreasonable to believe that buyers
paying more than appraised value for a home might still be getting
a fair deal because of fluctuating market values.
</P>
<P>
   Every home is appraised as soon as HUD gets it, he said. But it
takes two to three more months to get it back onto the market.
During that time, the home's value can rise.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Thomas, head of HUD's Phoenix real estate office, said
repair escrows are often to blame for driving up area list prices.
</P>
<P>
   If repairs are needed to meet minimal safety standards, up to
$5,000 in repair costs may be added into the list price by HUD.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector general auditors saw it differently. They decided the
appraisals were sound, based on their discussions with Goddard's
office.
</P>
<P>
   They instead zeroed in on the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found many buyers didn't understand how bidding worked.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some buyers told auditors they thought HUD's list
price was a discounted price. In reality, every house's list price
is supposed to be in line with the appraisal value.
</P>
<P>
   Local HUD offices also have some flexibility in setting list
prices. Their goal: Price houses to sell quickly while still making
as much money as possible. The profits go into the FHA's mortgage
insurance fund, which pays off other FHA-insured loans that go into
default.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, HUD homes that were sold for at least 10 percent
above appraised value usually had list prices higher than their
appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   Among homes sold for at least 10 percent more than appraised
value during the past two years:
</P>
<P>
   The average appraised value was $65,729.
</P>
<P>
   The average list price was about $4,500 higher.
</P>
<P>
   The average sales price was $78,235.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding bidders through the HUD rules are private sales agents.
HUD will not sell a home without a buyer having an agent. The
agents make their money from up to 6 percent commissions paid out
of the sales price.
</P>
<P>
   But federal auditors found that buyers often didn't understand
the ins and outs of buying a HUD home: what list prices meant, for
example, or that they could negotiate with their sales agents to
change commission amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, buyers relied heavily on their agents and a frequently
given bit of advice: Bid high.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers often plucked agents out of newspaper ads. Some
specialize exclusively in HUD homes. Many deal in volume _ they
want as many sales as possible from which to carve their
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In two cases, auditors said, winning bids were submitted without
the clients' knowing what the amounts were.
</P>
<P>
   HUD tried to combat the problem by requiring buyers to sign a
statement at closing indicating they knew the value of the home.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Flanagan, deputy director of HUD's Phoenix district,
said the notice had an impact: ``In a lot of the cases, the deal
didn't go through'' when buyers learned how high their bids were.
</P>
<P>
   James Duke, director of the Arizona Real Estate Department's
audit and investigations unit, acknowledged that some agents urge
their clients to bid high on HUD homes so they don't waste time
with losing bids.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Duke said, real estate sales people are simply
taking advantage of HUD's rules but are not breaking state laws. &QL; 
HIGH BID, FIXED INCOME
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to George Guy, 57, whose only income is a
monthly Social Security disability check.
</P>
<P>
   Guy paid $30,100 in late 1994 for a small two-bedroom
condominium in northwest Phoenix. The appraised value: $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got taken,'' Guy said. He blamed HUD and his real
estate agent, whom he found in a newspaper ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you really want this place, you have to bid such
and such','' Guy recalled. Guy wanted to bid $26,000 to $28,000. He
was told he wouldn't get the home unless he went higher. He said he
was never told the $1,800 commission was negotiable, or that
lowering it could have lowered his bid.
</P>
<P>
   Even agents who make sure their clients are well informed may
advise them to bid high, because of the bid competition HUD
policies have encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``It was a self-creating market,'' Goddard said. ``If you have
all Realtors telling their clients to bid 15 or 20 percent above,
it moves the market.''
</P>
<P>
   It generally takes only one agent to drive others into high bid
territory, Goddard added.
</P>
<P>
   Often, it is the same group of agents involved in bidding wars.
Twenty real estate agents made 74 Phoenix HUD sales reviewed by the
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified agent handled 28 of the sales. The average bid
in his deals was 19 percent higher than the average appraised
value.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind the high bidding is FHA's mortgage
insurance policy. The FHA has one policy for HUD homes and another,
more conservative policy for other homes.
</P>
<P>
   Under FHA's regular mortgage insurance program, a mortgage will
not be insured beyond the appraised value of a home.
</P>
<P>
   But the FHA will insure the full sales price on a HUD home, even
if it far exceeds the home's appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   That means agents can push bids higher, knowing lenders will
still cover the inflated sales price. For lenders, there is no
risk: If the borrower defaults, FHA covers in full.
</P>
<P>
   HUD buyers were getting something in return. If the houses
weren't as cheap as they might have expected, they often landed
small down payments and repair allowances.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly what sold Richard McGuirk, a first-grade teacher
in Phoenix. McGuirk was embarrassed as he recently recounted the
lessons he took away from his home-buying venture in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though poorly versed on HUD's procedures when he bid on homes
two years ago, McGuirk desperately wanted a house for himself and
his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   After losing roughly a dozen bids _ sometimes by $20,000 to
$30,000 _ he came to believe that HUD's appraised values were low.
He bid high on a northwest Phoenix house. McGuirk paid $75,000 for
a home appraised at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame some of this on HUD,'' McGuirk said, noting that he
didn't understand how badly he overbid until auditors knocked on
his door months later. &QL; 
NEW POLICY COMING
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 2{ years after the first voice was raised against its
policy, HUD will clamp down on high bidding by changing its
mortgage insurance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   FHA insurance on HUD homes will be applied the same as it is to
the general housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Most lenders no longer will be willing to lend at the higher
sales prices because their loans will be insured only up to the
appraised value of the house. Bids higher than the appraised value
will force buyers to come up with hard cash to pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Some HUD officials suspect low-income buyers will be slowly
squeezed out of the market under the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Peppercorn, a relative newcomer to HUD, said
hindsight makes the policy choice seem clear: The consumer should
come before FHA's moneymaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be selling homes for more than they're worth,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard said HUD's past agenda was partly to blame.
Congressional pressure on HUD to help pay for itself led to making
more money through FHA one of the agency's management goals, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that conflicted with HUD's mission to create and support
safe, affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough question, philosophically, as to where the
government's obligations start and stop,'' Goddard said.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard sees the policy change as a vote of confidence for HUD's
broader mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral issue here _ there is an agency philosophy
and purpose here,'' he said. ``Ultimately, that is what
prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   But people were victimized along the way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a presumption . . . that these are good deals,''
Goddard said. ``These were not good deals.''  &QL;

RANGERS TIE LEAFS, 6-6  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers broke out for six goals Saturday night,
doubling their highest total of the season. But it wasn't enough to
beat the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, thanks to a last-minute goal by Wayne Gretzky, it was
just enough for a tie. After blowing a one-goal lead early in the
third period, the Rangers managed to pull out a 6-6 draw at Maple
Leaf Gardens and end a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's goal with 37 seconds remaining capped an exciting,
back-and-forth third period. With six attackers on the ice for the
Rangers, Gretzky, standing just to the right of the Toronto net,
tapped the puck in midair past Maple Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal of the third period was scored by Manny Malhotra,
the Rangers' 18-year-old first-round draft pick who is from nearby
Mississauga, Ontario. Playing in front of his family and friends
for the first time in a National Hockey League uniform, Malhotra
scored at 1 minute 43 seconds of the period to tie the score at
4-4.
</P>
<P>
   As the momentum clearly shifted toward the Rangers (3-6-4), Adam
Graves beat Joseph over the shoulder for his second goal of the
game at 6:57 to give the Rangers their first lead of the game at
5-4. But it did not last long. Toronto's Steve Thomas scored at
7:55 on a perfect, cross-ice pass from Mats Sundin, the Maple
Leafs' best playmaker. Thomas beat the sliding Dan Cloutier, who
had replaced Mike Richter in net at the start of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Yushkevich put the Maple Leafs ahead by 6-5 at 15:28. The
goal came on a weak wrist shot from the point, beating Cloutier's
glove hand. The Rangers' goalie appeared to have been screened.
</P>
<P>
   Derek King, taking advantage of a failed breakout attempt by the
Rangers, scored at 2:34 seconds to give Toronto a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harvey tied the score at 1-1 midway through the first
period on a wrist shot from the slot. Marc Savard, who was called
up from the Rangers' farm team in Hartford last Thursday, set up
Harvey with a nifty pass from the side boards.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Korolev gave the Maple Leafs a 2-1 advantage at 3:44 of the
second period, tapping in a cross-ice pass from Steve Sullivan.
Harvey's second goal, which came at 6:34 of the second period, was
his team-leading fifth of the season and tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs scored twice more in the second period and the
Rangers scored once late to enter the third period, trailing by
4-3. Mike Johnson scored Toronto's third goal at 9:45 on a sneaky
back-handed wrap-around, sliding the puck under Richter's stick.
Korolev beat a screened Richter at 15:12 with low snap shot from
the slot for his second goal of the game. The puck changed
directions at least twice before entering the Rangers' net.
</P>
<P>
   Graves scored the Rangers' third goal at 19:00, ripping a slap
shot over Joseph's shoulder. His third goal of the season was
engineered by Savard, who passed cross ice to the streaking Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Rangers visit Maple Leaf Gardens, the spotlight
always shines brightly on Gretzky, a local hero who is from nearby
Brantford, Ontario. Games here are a homecoming for Gretzky, and
dozens of friends and family members attend. Saturday night,
however, he shared the spotlight with two teammates, Mathieu
Schneider and Malhotra.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who was awarded the assist on the Rangers'
first-period goal, was playing in his first game at Maple Leaf
Gardens since the Oct. 14 trade that brought him to the Rangers for
Aleksandr Karpovtsev. ``I want to show them they made a mistake,''
Schneider said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in this building is obviously something great for
me,'' said Malhotra, who was used sparingly but received a warm
round of applause from the sold-out Gardens crowd. ``It's obviously
a hard ticket to get when Wayne Gretzky is in town.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman ULF SAMUELSSON did not play against the Maple Leafs
because of an inflamed left knee. The knee was injected with a
synthetic joint lubricant last Thursday, setting off what the
Rangers thought might have been an allergic reaction, although the
injection was Samuelsson's fourth of the season and this was the
first occurrence of any swelling. ... ESA TIKKANEN sprained his
ankle in the second period and did not return.

SKATING ON SOLID ICE  
 FAMILY'S SUPPORT GUIDES COYOTES' BRIERE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For much of the 1990s, their hectic life was
symbolized by the sandwiches sitting on the corner of the table.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Constance Briere, with daughter Guylaine in tow,
grabbed dinner quickly on the way out to the family van in
Gantineau, Quebec, before they set out to travel to another of
their young son Daniel's hockey games in some far-off Canadian city
or province.
</P>
<P>
   And there were his baseball games. Plus daily trips to the golf
course during the summer. The family's yearly vacations to Daytona
Beach, Fla., were shelved for the their son's pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where I told him he had to make a choice _
hockey, baseball or golf _ that there were others in the family who
needed a vacation, too,'' said Robert, an insurance agent, in his
French-Canadian accent. ``It was always a sandwich on the end of
the table for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That investment of time and considerable finances has paid off
in an even longer journey.
</P>
<P>
   The family set off Saturday on the long journey to Phoenix,
where it will deliver to 21-year-old Daniel Briere, emerging NHL
center, his Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that, hours after the Phoenix Coyotes traded
proven veteran Cliff Ronning to Nashville to create ice time for
rookie Briere, his first thoughts were of his family in general and
his father in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad will be as excited about this as I am,'' Briere said
after hearing the news. ``It's as much a dream for him as it is me.
My parents put me on skates when I was 2 and built a rink in our
back yard for me and the kids in the neighborhood to play until I
was 11 or 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of hard work to take care of the ice and the
boards, but they did it and made sure everything was nice. They
sacrificed a lot, financially and with their time. And it wasn't
easy on my sister, who's three years younger. She always had to
follow along to watch her big brother play all over. When you're a
girl 9 or 10, you don't want to watch hockey, you want to play with
your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point the 5-foot-9, 180-pound rookie's dark eyes started
to cloud and the voice choked a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all sacrificed so much, and I just don't know how to
thank them . . . there just aren't strong enough words.'' Briere
said. &QL; 
Opening the storybook &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It puts into context what happened in Los Angeles a year ago.
After he scored his first NHL goal during a brief stint with the
Coyotes last year, Daniel called his father to report it. They
cried together on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now the kid the hockey world said was too small finally appears
to be in the show for good.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the end of the story, by any means. Many think it's
only the beginning of what will be a long-running and special story
for hockey.
</P>
<P>
   What is known for sure is it's the beginning of the Daniel
Briere's next challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Briere was a pretty nifty center himself as a youngster,
but at 5-10, 145 pounds when his junior career ended, he knew he'd
be wise to try other pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny was always told that he was too small and wouldn't make
it to the next level,'' Robert said. ``It was like that all the way
to juniors. It wasn't until he played Midget AAA, when he led the
league in scoring and was Rookie of the Year, that I had visions
that he might have a chance to play at NHL level someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that, Mr. (Frank) Bonello (director of NHL Central
Scouting) said he probably wouldn't make it because of his size. It
was exactly the kind of boost Danny needed. It didn't discourage
him. He's a very strong-willed kid who just won't take no for an
answer.'' &QL; 
His performance that year in Midget AAA for L'Intrieide was
amazing, especially considering he was 14, living 250 miles from
his home with strangers, and was playing for a team that finished
6-42. A year later, behind Briere, the team won the Quebec
championship and won the Bronze Medal in the Air Canada Cup
competition, where he first caught the attention of scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back from that first year a completely different
kid,'' Robert Briere said. ``It was hard on him, but it was a
character-building experience. I think his being away was harder on
his Mom than him. There was one night, though, that I think if I
had asked him to hop in the van and come home with us, he would
have. But he's always been very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The family put 45,000 kilometers on their van and spent some
$16,000 after his two-year midget career. While always interested,
Robert never coached his son. He says that job was always reserved
for coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the midget success, naysayers declared him too small to
survive in junior hockey. Bad call, again. While playing three
years for Drummondville in the Quebec Junior Major Hockey League he
scored 170 goals and had 246 assists for 416 points in 198 games.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the Rookie of the Year, joining such types as Darryl
Sutter, Ron Hextall, Brett Hull and Felix Potvin in earning the
honor. He never finished lower than third in scoring and once
topped the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had seen him in street clothes when he came to juniors,
the last thing you would've taken him for is a hockey player,''
said Blair Mackasey, Briere's coach for two years at Drummondville
who, ironically, is now a Coyotes' scout. ``He was about 147 pounds
and looked anything but athletic. But as soon as he put on the
equipment, it was unbelievable what he could accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, he had a very average training camp. I
thought this kid might be a good junior someday, but not a great
junior. Then in the first game he had three goals and an assist. It
was like he said, `The season's started, so let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   More important, Mackasey says, he can't recall anyone having a
bad word to say about Briere, the person. Or, of Briere saying bad
things about others. He is quiet by nature, respectful to a fault.
His game does all his talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him frustrated, but never to the point of
quitting,'' Mackasey said. ``In fact, the more frustrated he gets,
the harder he goes after it. To a point almost where you have to
call him off for his own good. Danny lives off challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why when the Coyotes trade off a player like Ronning to
make room for him, he will take it as a challenge to fill Cliff's
shoes. That will be his challenge this year, and he will thrive on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackasey also believes Briere's toughness belies his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (team officials) were having a discussion during his first
year, that with him being only 147 pounds, we probably should
acquire a big guy to protect him on the ice,'' Mackasey said. ``He
told us, `I don't need a big guy. Get a guy I can pass the puck to
who can put it in the net. I'll take care of myself.'' &QL; 
Calgary, New Jersey, Edmonton and the New York Islanders were
interested in drafting Briere, but only the Coyotes, owning two
first-round picks, gambled on the mighty mite and selected him with
the second choice (No. 24) and assigned him to Springfield in the
American Hockey League last year.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, his detractors expected ``the runt'' to fall short
in his first pro season. Nice try, but sorry. He was Rookie of the
Year. He also was the AHL's No. 3 scorer with 36 goals and 92
points and likely would have won the scoring title had he not
suffered a shoulder injury during his five-game stint with the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith sending Ronning to Nashville
to create ice time for Briere was a risk for which he's willing to
be accountable. Coach Jim Schoenfeld looks at it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an educated evaluation that you do because of credentials
and playing ability,'' Schoenfeld said. ``His first game in Los
Angeles Sunday, after the trade, was a good indication that he has
a lot going for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere said he grew up idolizing the likes of Wayne Gretzky,
Mats Naslund, Pat LaFontaine and Paul Kariya, but not copying them.
Yet they share something in common. None is considered large in
physical stature.
</P>
<P>
   Some even compare Briere's physical skills to those of
Gretzky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get into the comparison game. I think Daniel is going
to carve out a strong niche for himself,'' Schoenfeld said. ``He
might become the player that other players are reminded of. He's a
pretty sharp player. He's intelligent, sees and reads the ice well,
a good passer and playmaker, and he's a real good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but is he big enough to do the job defensively in the
NHL?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's big enough to do it offensively, then he should be
able to do it defensively,'' Schoenfeld said. ``With Danny and a
lot of highly skilled players, they're so good with the puck and
handle it so much that they don't learn how to play without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the process with a young player is to teach them how.
Like I said, he's an intelligent kid. If he wants to, he'll be a
real good player without it, and I know he wants to do it. So it's
just an ongoing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, just another challenge. &QL;

`JUST PHENOMENAL' 
 ASU CENTER COMES BACK FROM DEVASTATING ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Okeme Oziwo remembers nothing about the actual
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Before, yes. After, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But when he talks about falling asleep at the wheel and plowing
into a bus bench and then a wall, it's what others have told him.
</P>
<P>
   What he does remember is his left arm, shredded by windshield
glass. He remembers the searing pain that came from his left leg
being bent across his chest, and then more pain as paramedics
straightened the leg, causing him to pass out. He remembers
thinking he probably was going to die. And he remembers how doctors
told him his basketball career at Arizona State or anywhere else
was finished, that he should be happy just to walk again, perhaps
without a limp.
</P>
<P>
   That was in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, 1998, wearing No. 25, Okeme Oziwo walked without a
limp onto the basketball court at Wells Fargo Arena and started for
the Sun Devils in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the milestone debut for new Coach Rob Evans, but for
Oziwo, the meaning was even larger. A junior forward, Oziwo had
five points, 10 rebounds and two blocks. He could have registered
all zeroes, and it wouldn't have mattered. He was the happiest
basketball player on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a smile on my face before the game,'' he said after
playing 25 minutes. ``I was just delighted to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who served 22 years as an assistant before becoming the
first African-American basketball coach at Mississippi, said about
Oziwo's comeback, ``Phenomenal. Just phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Oziwo's previous appearance in an ASU uniform was on Jan. 6,
1997, when he scored two points against Chaminade. Then, after
battling stress fractures in his leg, he was shut down for the
season. But he had played in only three games and was allowed to
take a redshirt year. The injury healed and Oziwo (pronounced
O-zee-woh), who started 12 games as a freshman, was looking forward
to coming back for his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   On an August evening, a female friend of Oziwo's suggested they
see a movie in Los Angeles, near his mother's house. But other
friends, out where he used to live in San Bernadino, also had movie
plans. He chose San Bernadino, more than an hour away. They went to
see ``Spawn.'' Afterward, Oziwo visited with others he wanted to
see before returning to ASU, got something to eat and drove home.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 4 a.m. when Oziwo exited Highway 134 at Glendale
Boulevard and, apparently asleep at the wheel, lost control of the
Eagle Premier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent several late-night hours on the road,'' he said,
still incredulous over how it happened. ``That whole falling asleep
concept is unbelievable.'' &QL; 
Rescue difficult &QL; 
Rescue workers needed the Jaws of Life to pry the 6-foot-8 Oziwo
out because he was ``literally a pretzel in the car,'' he said. ``I
remember the steering wheel was pressed against my chest. I saw
blood gushing from my arm and I passed out. I remember a fireman
telling me to keep calm and I remember praying. If it was my time
to go, Lord forgive me for all my sins. I really did think it was
my time to go. But I guess I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Oziwo's injuries were not life-threatening, they
nonetheless were horrific, especially for an athlete. In addition
to having a mangled left arm, he had a separated pelvis. He had a
fractured left femur, the big bone in the thigh. His left fibula,
the small bone in the leg, was broken. So was the fourth metacarpal
bone in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors inserted a plate in Oziwo's pelvis and a rod in his left
thigh, along with the screws to hold them in place. They put pins
in his hand and a cast on his arm. He was in bed for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me from Day 1 it wouldn't be possible for me to play
ball again,'' Oziwo said. ``That hopefully, I'd be able to walk
without a limp. They said from all the surgeries like that they had
done, chances are you'd have a limp and not even think about
competing in athletics again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to accept it. And I didn't accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was doubt. And emotions. Right after the accident,
ASU teammate Mike Batiste, who had played against Oziwo in high
school, came to visit. He left somewhat shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like Okeme,'' Batiste said. ``He had a screw
going through one knee, his leg was in a cast, his face was
swollen. I just felt real bad for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oziwo, meanwhile, cried.
</P>
<P>
   The physical pain persisted, too. Oziwo was hooked up to a
machine that allowed him to administer medicine whenever the pain
became unbearable, which was often. &QL; 
Family support &QL; 
But it helped that Oziwo, whose first name, Okeme, means ``first
born'' in his father's native Nigerian, always had family around,
his mother and his ``aunties,'' especially. His parents are
divorced and he didn't see his dad that much. Franzetta, his
mother, had paid for Oziwo to live in an apartment so he could
attend high school in Rialto, outside the city, where he felt more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse occasionally would help Oziwo out of bed and into a
wheelchair, where he could roll to his seventh-floor window and
look outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd watch people walk,'' he said. ``To have that taken away,
it's something else. You've got to be grateful for everything you
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   That was reinforced when, after he got out of the hospital, his
mom took him to the movies. He was in a wheelchair, ``and people
look at you differently,'' he said. ``They'd be rude to you. You'd
try to get a door open, and they'd say, `Move, move.' I really try
to look out for the handicapped now. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer enrolled at ASU, Oziwo recuperated at his
grandmother's home in south-central Los Angeles. He started
exercising with an in-house nurse, simple stuff such as stretching
and leg lifts. His grandmother, Madeline Beavers, had to help him
out of bed and wash him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pathetic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oziwo eventually began physical therapy. Again, nothing fancy.
He walked, jogged a little. He was feeling better and wanted to
speed up the process. So he found a treadmill in the garage and
used it one hour, twice a day. By January, he was back at ASU and
back on the court, hobbling around. But back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real slow thing,'' he said. ``I remember that limp. I
didn't get rid of the limp until March or April.'' &QL; 
Work ethic lauded &QL; 
Evans was hired in April, bringing a staff that included assistant
Tony Benford. During the summer, Benford and strength coach Rich
Wenner oversaw Oziwo's return to basketball shape. Wenner was in
the weight room with Oziwo. Benford handled the conditioning and
the drills. He harangued Oziwo on his slide steps, hassled him over
his defensive stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give them a lot of credit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed,'' Benford said. ``One time, he was doing squats
and he only had a bar and 25-pounds on each side. I went back a
couple of months later and he had two 45s on there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a heck of a kid. And he comes from a good upbringing.
Sometimes, a lot of inner-city kids act like they've had it real
hard, but you go back and meet their people and they know right
from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to Oziwo's upbringing was his grandmother. In July,
Madeline Beavers was diagnosed with breast cancer. She died in
August. Her grandson spoke at the funeral and tried to remain calm,
even though the plate and the rod the surgeons had inserted
couldn't keep his insides from coming apart.
</P>
<P>
   It was his grandma who prodded Oziwo into exercising when he
didn't feel like it, his grandma who literally jammed food down his
throat when he didn't feel like eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she died, everyone showed their emotions and was crying
and everything,'' he said. ``So I guess I had to be strong. You
couldn't have a house with everybody crying. I had to step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Oziwo continued to step it up, gradually rounding into physical
shape, although he isn't there yet. On a team with little size, he
will be counted on to bump, grind and do a lot of the dirty work
inside. His weight is up to 225 pounds, counting the hardware
supporting his bones. Batiste said Oziwo might be the strongest
player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know `O' like I know him, he's got this spirit,''
Batiste said. ``There was no doubt in my mind he was going to come
back and do what he loves to do, which is play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who repaired Oziwo's leg and hand, Yu Fon Lee, said,
``Having gotten to know him and his family, they're very motivated
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Oziwo has responded to the new regime as well as
anyone, showing up early, staying late, working hard. Oziwo, he
said, has ``a great learning curve.'' When Evans arrived, Oziwo had
trouble running straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been impressed with his toughness,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Benford said, ``We've done a lot of fundamental things with him.
He's like a sophomore, really. But he's had a great attitude. One
thing I've said, we'll never have a problem with this kid in the
classroom or with anything. He's really focused on what he's got to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who survive a near-death experience turn philosophical,
and Oziwo is no different. Like many, he said he no longer takes
things for granted and appreciates the little things. But he also
appreciates the big things, such as what he has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said, ``a lot of determination on my part.'' &QL;

BILL FRIEDER ENJOYING LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The day he resigned, Bill Frieder looked to the future
with some uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 55 years old,'' he said, as if he had just done the
addition for the first time and was sobered by sum. Of those 55
years, he spent 32 coaching basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was out of a job, forced to leave Arizona State in the
wake of a point-shaving scandal.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years he lived in the gym and on the telephone and in
front of the VCR, coaching and recruiting and studying films and
spending all his waking hours, it seemed _ did the man ever sleep?
_ immersed in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Frieder never read books. The last movie he saw in a theater was
``The'' ``Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting what I'll be doing in a year from
now,'' Frieder said Sept. 10, 1997. ``I'm kind of intrigued by
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Bill, what are you doing now?
</P>
<P>
   While studying his chicken sandwich, peeking under the bun in
search of the mustard he requested but didn't get, Frieder began
talking about Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, Frieder starts his morning watching back-to-back
episodes of ``The Andy Griffith Show''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today _ oh, this is ``great,'''' Frieder said, forgetting
lunch. ``Andy arrests this criminal and then goes on vacation.
Barney screws up. Barney lets the guy out of jail and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Frieder recounted the adventure in detail, laughing out loud at
the comic picture of Mayberry's nervous deputy trying to undo his
mistake and recapture the felon single-handedly. If Frieder feels a
kinship with Deputy Fife, it may be because Bill is as hyper as
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Coach, what else is going on? ``Coach.'' Friends and strangers
still call him that even though Frieder won't coach again.
</P>
<P>
   New interests &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man with the tousled cottony hair produced his business
card. He is president of Frieder Bros., an investment firm he
operates with his younger brother. Frieder also is assistant
director of Michael Jordan's fantasy camp. He runs Jason Kidd's
basketball camp. He is involved in Charles Barkley's camp, too.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday, Frieder will broadcast a college game. Santa
Barbara vs. Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Frieder said of his part-time TV job. ``And easy.
Fifteen minutes after the game, you're done. You're not sitting
alone in the locker room (after a loss) spitting up blood and
getting hemorrhoids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now and then his ego whispers in his ear. Before retiring,
Frieder wanted to put in 20 seasons as a college head coach and win
400 games. He fell three seasons and 77 games short.
</P>
<P>
   Frieder took the Sun Devils to the Sweet 16, but his last years
turned sour, on and off the court. ASU finished 11-16 and 10-20.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he thinks about coaching again, but not for very
long. His choices would be limited. As Frieder said, accepting
reality, ``I'm sure lots of places think, `We can't take a chance
on Frieder.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One NCAA Division I school, he said, called him about a job.
</P>
<P>
   He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   No, he won't coach again. He has turned the page. He likes
playing the stock market and enjoys the freedom to travel. When the
Frieders went to Europe this summer, it was his first trip without
the luggage of a basketball team. Daughter Laura, an ASU senior,
was writing an honors thesis about Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard of Bob Dylan,'' Frieder said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who once confessed he had never heard of ``The
Wizard'' ``of Oz''.
</P>
<P>
   While overseas with his family, Frieder attended two Dylan
concerts in Europe. As he spoke proudly of his daughter, he reached
into a worn leather briefcase and pulled out her grade transcript.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight A's,'' the father said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   He is still restless, a night owl, still a bit eccentric in a
humorous way. But the former coach finally is exploring a life he
didn't know existed. The only world he knew was flat, and varnished
to a high shine. It measured 94 by 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Happy for ASU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is happy for himself. He is also happy for ASU, which placed
the stewardship of its roundball program where it belongs, in the
firm and caring hands of Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely the best man in the country for the job,'' Frieder
said.
</P>
<P>
   His cheeriness slips only when The Story resurfaces, as it did
last week when Stevin Smith described his sins in a 6-page
confession in ``Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Frieder read Smith's firsthand account. He wonders how the
former guard _ an ASU Student Athlete of the Year _ could claim his
coach never confronted him about point-shaving allegations. When
rumors surfaced, Frieder quizzed Smith, and every other player on
that team, individually, in his office.
</P>
<P>
   What would he say to Smith if he could speak to him? After a
long silence, he said, ``I would ask him, `When you first got into
debt, why didn't you come to me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal still troubles him, and should. It happened on his
watch, to his team, under his nose. The stain won't go away. But
then, neither will his affection for ASU and the athletes he
recruited and coached. On Wednesday, Frieder telephoned Evans and
asked the coach if he would mind if he dropped by practice and
wished his former players well. Not at all, Evans said. The reunion
went well.
</P>
<P>
   Then Frieder left the campus. He had things to do, people to
see, places to go.
</P>
<P>
   What will Andy and Barney do tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit there and laugh,'' Frieder said of the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   It must beat wondering if an 18-year-old is going to make a free
throw at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Frieder nodded. ``Or wondering if he's trying.'' &QL;

FALL LEAGUE GIVES SHOWALTER CHANCE TO SCOUT FRIEND, FOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Between meetings, making up for lost time with his
family and just being manager of the Diamondbacks,  &UR; Buck Showalter
has been an occasional visitor to Fall League games.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter figures he's been to about 10 games so far, mostly to
check up on the seven Diamondbacks prospects and to visit with
Scottsdale Manager  &UR; Chris Speier, who has six of them.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also there to scout other players, to get a handle on
what to look for next season and to see who can play should anyone
become available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to go to as many games as my schedule allows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reason is to see our kids, but also to show support
for Chris. And I want to familiarize myself with other people's
prospects. I think you need to stay up to date. There's a good
chance we'll see a lot of these guys in the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them is  &UR; J.D. Drew, the outstanding St. Louis Cardinals
prospect who hit .417 with five home runs during a brief call-up
during September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're gonna see him next year,'' Showalter said.
``We've got to figure out some way to get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. Drew went 4 for 4 with a home run on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter gets daily reports on the Diamondbacks, but you always
learn more by watching. Here are some brief assessments:
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Jason Conti: ``Jason's always done well with
everything thrown at him. He's a survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Rob Ryan (playing for Sun Cities): ``He reminds me a
lot of (Diamondbacks outfielder  &UR; David)  &UR; Dellucci.''
</P>
<P>
   Infielder  &UR; Junior Spivey: ``I like him a lot. Very athletic. He
hasn't played a lot of baseball, per se. He's gonna get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Infielder  &UR; Julius Matos: ``I've seen him very little. I need to
see him play more.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Vladimir Nunez: ``It's been a long year for him. He's
been gone (from home) for a long time, but he's gonna tough it out
here. Chris has done a good job motivating him to finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Stephen Randolph: ``A very intriguing guy for me. An
above-average arm for a left-handed pitcher. He's going to figure
it out. All these guys are learning to trust their stuff a little
bit. At some point, he'll realize how good his stuff is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Russell Jacob: ``A big, strong kid who touched 98, 99
(miles an hour) a couple of times this year but has been kind of
inconsistent down here. Back and forth, health-wise. He's 6-6, 250
and he's got some work to do on his body to get it to major league
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter noted that Conti, Ryan and Spivey are subject to the
minor league Rule 5 draft, ``and we have to make up our minds
whether to protect them.'' To be protected, they must be added to
the 40-man roster. &QL; 
Short hops &QL; 
Maryvale last week turned its second triple play of the season.
This one happened against Sun Cities. With runners on first and
second, &UR; Mark Derosa lined out to shortstop  &UR; Julio Lugo, who stepped
on second to double off  &UR; Peter Bergeron and threw to first baseman
 &UR; Julio Zuleta to get  &UR; Marlon Anderson. Prior to this year, there
had been just two triple plays since the Fall League began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ben Davis (San Diego) and  &UR; Glenn Davis (Los Angeles), who play
for Scottsdale, no longer are the only brother act in the league.
They have been joined by  &UR; Jeff and  &UR; Jordan Zimmerman of Peoria.
Both are pitchers. Jordan (Texas) just joined the Javelinas last
week. Jeff is a Seattle prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix lost three players off its roster last week, including
pitcher  &UR; Matt Anderson, the former No. 1 pick of the Detroit
Tigers. Anderson was sent home when Tigers officials felt he had
pitched enough this year. &QL;

NORTH TEXAS FALLS TO KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GENE MENEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ The North Texas Eagles had an opportunity to
upset Kansas right in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Eagles, that was the worst place to put it
on this wet, cold and dreary day.
</P>
<P>
   Shackled by two inexperienced quarterbacks, North Texas wasted a
prime opportunity against the Big 12 Jayhawks, losing, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were within one score for most of the game, until
Kansas cornerback Andrew Davison returned an interception 30 yards
for a touchdown with 7 minutes, 31 seconds remaining for the final
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plays were there,'' UNT receiver Broderick McGrew said.
``It was right there in our hands. We couldn't get any closer to
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Eagles dropped the ball on their chances _ and on
many of the passes by UNT quarterbacks. The Eagles (2-7) reached at
least the Kansas 33 on four drives without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Corley, a third-string quarterback who was making his
first start since his senior year at Mesquite High School in 1994,
and Richard Bridges, a freshman from Grand Prairie who saw his
first collegiate action, combined to complete three of 20 passes
for 76 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Corley's most critical pass was caught when Davison intercepted
a pass intended for receiver Kendrick Hollie. Corley completed
three of 15 passes, and 48 of his 76 yards came on a first-quarter
touchdown on a screen pass to McGrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of my worst games I've ever played,'' said
Corley, who was forced into action for his third collegiate
appearance because of injuries to starter Jason Attaway and backup
LaDarrin McLane. ``I think I let the weather get to me a little
bit. I just didn't make the plays when they were there to be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges, who UNT coach Darrell Dickey had planned to redshirt
this season, entered the game with 4:08 remaining in the first
half. He did not complete a pass on five attempts and lost 24 yards
on five carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked like a rookie out there today,'' Bridges admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The inept passing attack ruined a strong defensive effort.
Defensive tackle Brian Waters stripped Kansas running back Mitch
Bowles and returned the fumble 74 yards to give North Texas a 14-10
lead in the first half, and the Eagles limited Kansas (4-6) to 79
yards total offense in the second half. Even though the defense
gave up 131 yards and two touchdowns to Jayhawks running back David
Winbush, North Texas forced Winbush to fumble at midfield with 2:05
remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But that drive ended when Kansas blocked Garrett Courtney's
38-yard field-goal attempt, the Eagles' second failed attempt. The
first miss, also on a 38-yard attempt, came with eight seconds
remaining in the first half and would have tied the score at 17.
</P>
<P>
   UNT running back Ja'Quay Wilburn, starting for the first time
since the season opener at Oklahoma, rushed for a season-high 134
yards on 14 carries.
Extra points
The Eagles recorded their longest passing play (48 yards by
McGrew), rushing play (61 yards by Wilburn), kickoff return (64
yards by McGrew) and defensive return (74 yards by Waters) of the
season. They rank as four of the five longest plays of the season.
... Waters' 74-yard fumble return was the 10th career touchdown for
the senior, his first on defense.

Foster Handicap beneath the historic twin spires, and yesterday,
with much more money and prestige at stake, he proved it was no
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Facing what many have called the greatest field ever assembled
in the Breeders' Cup Classic, the 4-year-old colt dashed through an
opening between Silver Charm and Swain in midstretch and ran into
the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with the hot team of trainer Patrick Byrne and jockey
Pat Day, Awesome Again won by 1 1/4 lengths over Silver Charm and
earned $2.88 million of the Classic's world-record $5.12 million
purse, the largest payday ever from a single race.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated showdown between Skip Away and Silver Charm
never materialized. Skip Away didn't show his trademark speed or
aggressiveness and finished fifth in the final race of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply cannot handle this surface,'' jockey Jerry Bailey
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Skip Away was practically a no-show yesterday,
failing in his quest to finish at least third and surpass Cigar as
racing's top money-winning horse, he probably clinched the
horse-of-the-year award since Silver Charm also lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was the highlight of the richest seven-race
Breeders' Cup card, which has a huge impact on the sport's year-end
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Buck's Boy took a step toward the grass title after a
wire-to-wire victory in the Turf, although Da Hoss will also
receive support on the strength of his miraculous repeat victory in
the Mile in just his second race in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively (Juvenile) and Silverbulletday (Juvenile Fillies)
wrapped up championships. Other winners were Escena (Distaff) and
Reraise (Sprint).
</P>
<P>
   The Distaff winner usually takes the filly-and-mare Eclipse
Award, but an equally strong case can be made for Sharp Cat, who
didn't make the race. Reraise's brilliant victory should give him
enough impetus to unseat vanquished favorite Affirmed Success in
the sprinter category.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic, the mile-and-a-quarter race that millions tuned in
to watch, turned into a mad scramble in the long stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm and Swain were on even terms in the upper stretch,
a virtual rematch of the Dubai World Cup in March, when Silver
Charm edged his European opponent by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, the field scattered like a covey of quail.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Gary Stevens steered Silver Charm toward Swain in an
attempt to stir his colt's competitive spirit. Swain, however,
suddenly ducked to the far outside _ supposedly startled by camera
flashbulbs popped by infield fans _ as jockey Frankie Dettori
continued a left-handed whip.
</P>
<P>
   That left a gaping hole down the middle of the track for Awesome
Again, who had picked up a head of steam after what Day described
as a ``lethargic'' beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Day had plotted a course to the outside of Silver Charm, but
instead veered Awesome Again toward the inside and burst through in
deep stretch for the victory in a solid 2:02.16 clocking.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time a horse owned by Canadian industrialist
Frank Stronach snatched away a huge potential payday from Silver
Charm. In last year's Belmont Stakes, Stronach's Touch Gold spoiled
Silver Charm's bid for the Triple Crown and the accompanying $5
million bonus. Touch Gold also ran yesterday, finishing eighth in
the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm finished a neck in front of third-place Swain, who
probably would have won with a straight course through the lane. He
crossed the finish only about 30 feet from the outside rail.
</P>
<P>
   Dettori's claims that Swain was shying from flashbulbs might
have merit, since Swain dumped him twice just before the race as
fans gathered along the outer rail snapped his picture in the
late-afternoon dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not used to this sort of thing,'' Dettori explained.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away had no such excuses, but still finished just four
lengths from first in his swan song, after leaving the gate
sluggishly and racing in a crowd throughout the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I'm ready to cry, but I won't,'' said Sonny Hine, Skip Away's
trainer. ``He's one of the best I've ever seen. It's too bad it had
to end on a sour note.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes continue to be nothing but sweet music for Byrne, who
burst from obscurity onto the Breeders' Cup scene last year by
saddling eventual horse of the year Favorite Trick and Countess
Diana to victories. He gave up his stable to take a private
training job for Stronach this year, but maintained his
relationship with Day, the all-time leader in Breeders' Cup
victories (10) who also rode Favorite Trick.
</P>
<P>
   At the first of the year, Byrne said he might have erred by
underestimating Awesome Again, who once said, ``They're two
different kind of horses'' when comparing him to stablemate Touch
Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Now Byrne is lobbying for Awesome Again as horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone's got Skip Away tattooed for horse of the year
already,'' Byrne said. ``But this horse shouldn't be thrown out of
the balloting.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again, however, probably won't be a contender for the
honor, despite his flawless six-for-six record this year.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne boosted the colt's confidence by finding the easiest
competition. Ironically, while his skillful and conservative
handling may have been the primary reason for Awesome Again's
victory in the world's richest race, it will almost surely backfire
at the end of the year when Eclipse Award voters compare the
overall accomplishments of Awesome Again and Skip Away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ At the conclusion of a comforting 33-3 rout of Tulsa
yesterday, SMU coach Mike Cavan peered through the gloom and beheld
a sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time this year,'' he said, ``things have not been
easy for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today was a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he nodded toward the visitors' dressing room at the Cotton
Bowl and added, ``I also feel a lot of empathy for those guys. I've
been in that situation before, and I know what they're going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Tulsa (3-6, 1-5 Western Athletic Conference) was yesterday
was at the bottom of a landslide. The Mustangs (4-6, 4-3) rolled up
25 first downs, 440 total yards, and controlled the ball for nearly
37 minutes. It was their greatest margin of victory during Cavan's
two years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Missing three running backs and alternating their third- and
fourth-string quarterbacks much of the way, the Golden Hurricane
got an early field goal off a bad SMU punt snap then faded away.
</P>
<P>
   They rushed for 29 yards, threw three interceptions, and had the
ball for nine minutes in the first half. Their leading rusher was a
previously redshirted freshman who was not on the depth chart. They
finished with the fewest yards (155) by a Tulsa team in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of injuries on both sides of the ball,'' Tulsa
quarterback Jerrold Smith said. ``We're just in a funk right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were rolled under grudgingly. SMU took the lead with
10:31 left in the first half when Rodnick Phillips swept 13 yards
at the end of a short 39-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs scored again with 48 seconds left in the half at
the end of a 14-play, 76-yard march. From the Tulsa 8, Chris
Sanders tossed to running back Kelsey Adams, who fumbled the ball
when hit. Receiver Damond Blueitt alertly plucked the fumble out of
the air and completed the touchdown play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw the touchdown,'' Adams said, laughing. ``He led
me, and I stretched for the ball and got hit. That's the last thing
I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams (97 yards) and Phillips (88) keyed a 267-yard SMU's
rushing effort, and Sanders was 16 of 27 for 173 yards. But the
day's key offensive play was delivered by cornerback Jacoby
Rhinehart on a 47-yard reverse that put SMU up 20-3 in the third
quarter and effectively doomed the struggling Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was gone as soon as I touched the ball,'' said
Rhinehart, who Cavan has used increasingly on the offensive side of
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Phillips ran 17 yards to cap an 83-yard
drive. SMU's final touchdown was provided by reserve Brendan
McGraw, who bounced off the stack and ran 61 yards with 3:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a game like this,'' Cavan said. ``I know they were
banged up, but this was still probably the best overall game we've
played all year.''
Extra points
Although only 11,143 fans attended in the frigid drizzle, the
Mustangs were happy to be home again. It was their sixth
consecutive WAC victory at the Cotton Bowl. In their past three
home games, they have allowed 16 points. ... Two of SMU's
interceptions were by free safety Raymon Brown, who stopped two
Rice scoring threats earlier this year by causing fumbles inside
the 10-yard line.

NO. 4 KANSAS STATE CRUISES PAST BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Wendell Barnhouse 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Time to stop avoiding the question. Time to start
thinking about The Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the next game on Kansas State's schedule is Nebraska.
The biggest game in the history of Manhattan, Kan., is scheduled
for Saturday. And the Wildcats can honestly answer questions about
the Cornhuskers. One game at a time is now one game.
</P>
<P>
   So, coach Bill Snyder, when do you start thinking about
Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, we already have,'' he said. He was not smiling.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Kansas State (9-0, 6-0 Big 12) moved into position to
challenge Nebraska by disposing of Baylor (2-7, 1-5) yesterday,
49-6. The Wildcats scored 21 fourth-quarter points _ including a
touchdown at the gun _ to pad the margin in their 17th consecutive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the aftermath of top-ranked Ohio State's 28-24 loss to
Michigan State, Kansas State will be paying particular attention
when the polls and Bowl Championship Series rankings are released
today and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas State played poorly enough that Snyder can hammer
home plenty of coaching points as his team prepares for Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Can you be unhappy with 49-6 win?
</P>
<P>
   Snyder: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder does not grade on a curve.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State had 518 yards of total offense. Its first two
touchdowns required a total of 51 seconds of clock time, thanks to
two Baylor turnovers. And even though the score didn't get out of
hand until the final minutes, the Wildcats were in control
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not pleased with how we played in the first half after
the first two touchdowns,'' Snyder said. ``On both sides of the
ball, kicking game, kickoff-coverage unit, we really struggled.
We're not playing like we're capable of playing. I didn't think we
played well after we got 14 points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was particularly miffed that Kansas State, with a 14-0
lead, failed to score from the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing to be stopped on the 1-yard line,'' said
running back Eric Hickson, who rushed for 108 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have got a little lackadaisical,'' said Kansas State
wide receiver Aaron Lockett, who had seven catches for 157 yards.
``Now, we've got the opportunity to think about Nebraska. It's been
hard not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has not lost to Kansas State since 1968. That's 29
consecutive victories. The jinx is long and effective. Kansas State
and its resurrected program is on the cusp of making history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be exciting,'' Wildcats tight end Justin Swift
said. ``This might be a turning point for Kansas State
University.''

RECORDS IN JEOPARDY, BUT DORSETT SAYS HIS LEGACY SECURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Tony Dorsett is grooving now.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising down Texas 114, heading toward Texas Stadium in his
sparkling black Lincoln Navigator, Dorsett negotiates calls on two
cellular phones while singing along with the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasons'' by Earth Wind and Fire is playing and Dorsett is
doing his best imitation of lead singer Philip Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons. The reasons that we are here. The reasons that we
fear won't disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeccably dressed as usual in a black suit and black suede
shoes highlighted by a gold shirt, Dorsett is all smiles as he
pulls into the parking lot of his old stamping grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as T.D. certainly doesn't look the part of
somebody whose football records are under assault on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith is only 95 yards from passing Dorsett as the
Cowboys' all-time leading rusher. Dorsett amassed 12,036 yards in
his 11 seasons with the Cowboys. Smith could accomplish the feat
today when the Cowboys meet the Giants at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And 22 years after Dorsett set the NCAA career rushing record
with 6,082 yards during his glorious run at Pittsburgh (1973-1976),
Texas running back Ricky Williams is close to breaking that mark.
Williams is only 204 yards behind with two regular-season games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Dorsett, known for his sweet moves and blazing speed, said
he could not be happier for Smith and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, just as the years have failed to rob him of his
youthful countenance _ he's 44 and looks to be around his playing
weight of 185 pounds _ Dorsett realizes there are reasons that he
is here. No matter what happens in the next three weeks, he has no
fear his achievements will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am a little skinny kid from Aliquippa, Pennsylvania,''
Dorsett said. ``I wouldn't ever dream I'd have the kind of success
I had in college and as a pro. People keep asking me, how do I feel
about the records. I don't feel anything. You realize that records
are made to be broken. It's nice to have a record. That says
something about the career itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I appreciate is the guys doing their thing. Ricky and
Emmitt are quality guys. You can't help but wish for the best for
them. If that means breaking records of Tony Dorsett, so be it.''
 &LR; subheds:Renewed appreciation Dorsett actually is flattered by the
attention the record chases have brought him eight years after he
retired from football.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dorsett made a smooth transition into life after
football, he enjoys remembering his football career. He also says
all the talk about the records has brought ``visibility and
publicity back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who didn't know about Tony Dorsett,''
he said. ``I'm sure there are kids playing at Texas and other
schools who are wondering who is this Dorsett guy and what kind of
career did he have. It brings visibility to my career and the
things I was able to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype has brought hordes of interview requests, adding to
Dorsett's busy schedule. In addition to running a successful
specialty marketing business, he does promotional work for Sprint
every weekend at NFL stadiums. He also does a weekly football
preview show for Player's Inc., and he's a co-chairman of the Texas
Black Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson, who introduced Dorsett at
a reception in his honor on Wednesday, said the attention is good
for the ego in addition to Dorsett's business career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good any time you can keep your name out there after
football,'' Pearson said. ``As a former athlete, you appreciate
anything that keeps people talking about you.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed attention also is giving Dorsett and his friends a
chance to look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about it the other day going to Kansas City,''
said former Cowboys fullback Ron Springs, who in addition to being
Dorsett's business partner is also his ``best friend and drinking
buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to think about some of the things he did as small
as he was. That's what people don't understand. I just enjoyed
being in the same backfield with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1976 and was inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994, said he sat down the
other day and watched a tape of himself and couldn't believe what
he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody back in Pittsburgh did a video, `Hail To Dorsett,'''
he said. ``They started off with the pro career, showing clips of
that, then went to the Hall of Fame ceremony and then to college.
After seeing some of the runs, me and a buddy of mine pulled up
closer to the television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Damn,''' continued Dorsett, now laughing. ``It was
exciting to see some of the things I could do back in the day. I
was cold.''  &LR; subheds:No comparisons Because they soon will be
linked by the records, Dorsett has been bombarded with questions
about Williams and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He says there are no comparisons. As Dorsett describes it,
Williams and Smith are ``thick.'' The 6-foot Williams weighs 225
pounds and the 5-9 Smith weighs 209.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely different runners,'' Dorsett said. ``Those
guys rely on power. They don't have the speed that I had. When I
went to college, I weighed 150 pounds. I was always on the move. I
realized for me to survive, I had to make people miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett's speed created a memorable 99-yard touchdown run in the
regular-season finale in January 1983 and led him to four Pro
Bowls. Smith has made six Pro Bowls, has won an NFL MVP award and
has nine more 100-yard rushing games than Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett admires the play of both Smith and Williams. He said
Smith's accomplishments are more than earned and that Williams
``has it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The admiration runs both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said because the record he is chasing is Dorsett's, the
achievement is even more special.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in position to become the Cowboys' all-time leading
rusher is a great honor,'' said Smith, who has surpassed nearly all
of Dorsett's team records since entering the NFL in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor I share very proudly with the individual I
consider a friend, model for the NFL, model for youth, a person I
admired growing up and a person I enjoyed watching as a kid. Now I
am here nine years later having the opportunity to be mentioned in
the same breath as him. It's a great honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who met Dorsett last year in Dallas at the Doak Walker
Award ceremonies, remembers watching Dorsett as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he was fast and scored a lot of touchdowns,''
Williams said. ``Now, to be mentioned in the same breath as him is
quite an honor.''  &LR; subheds:Differences in attitude The differences
between the players don't end on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Smith and Williams, who are being widely recognized for
their achievements and abilities while they are still playing,
Dorsett was never completely appreciated for his greatness during
his career.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he played like he had to continually prove himself
to critics who questioned his slight build and durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the Notre Dame coaches saying the little skinny kid
will never make it on the college level,'' Dorsett said. ``That
drove me every time I played Notre Dame. It was sweet to get that
303 \Ryards against Notre Dame as junior\S.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions only grew stronger when he joined the Cowboys in
1977. Even Cowboys coach Tom Landry used Dorsett's size as a reason
to limit his playing time. As a result, Dorsett never won an NFL
rushing title and thus was often overlooked when talk turned to
``the top backs of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``when the dust settled I retired as the second
all-time leading rusher in NFL history,'' said Dorsett, who now
ranks fourth in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett's confident demeanor led to his success on the field,
but his independent spirit didn't play well in conservative Fort
Worth-Dallas. He was once called the ``love-hate'' back because he
heard boos as frequently as the cheers. Cowboys fans didn't quite
know how to embrace this brash young black man, who brought flash
and style to the franchise well before Michael Irvin and Deion
Sanders and had the nerve to question Landry's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the norm when I came to Dallas,'' Dorsett said. ``A
young black kid from the Northeast coming to the South. I could
talk intelligently. I had my own personality, my own individuality.
I knew what I brought to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pearson put it, ``Dallas wasn't ready for Dorsett.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas was ready for `yes sir' and `no sir,''' Pearson said.
``Tony deterred away from that. He wasn't trying to make a
statement. He was just being himself. What was perceived as
arrogance was just Tony. He is the same today.''  &LR; subheds:Mellow
family man Though still his own man, Dorsett has regrets about the
way he handled some things with the Cowboys _ especially the manner
in which he strong-armed Landry into trading him to Denver after
the coach replaced him with Herschel Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I should have stayed here,'' Dorsett said. ``I
shouldn't have demanded a trade. But I felt so cheated. All the
blood and sweat I brought to the team, playing hurt and through
injuries. I came to play every day for them. That was my only
regret _ that I made the decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm more mature and can look at it from a different
vantage point, I think I should have sat there on the bench and
taken it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett credits his outlook to age and a happy home life. He has
a 3-month-old daughter, Madison Drew, and a live-in girl friend.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson _ pointing to the hardships Dorsett has endured _
including the deaths of a brother, his father and a fiance, plus a
failed marriage _ said his former teammate has survived a lot in
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing you can say about Tony right now is that he's
at peace with himself,'' Pearson said. ``He doesn't have to prove
anything to anybody. He's satisfied with what he's accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, who also has a son (Tennessee Oilers defensive back
Anthony Dorsett), went a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``If life got any better, they would have to make me a twin,''
he quipped. ``The little girl is one of the best things that ever
happened to me. It's quite an experience after 25 years. It's
interesting to see me changing diapers. I'm very happy in all
aspects. My business is good. My home life is wonderful. I'm just a
happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   That, above all, is the reason that he is here, the reason he
won't disappear.

   One of the last baseball players on the planet you would ever
expect to hear anything negative about stood up recently and
declared himself a human who has erred in one of the worst
imaginable ways.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta All-Star third baseman  &UR; Chipper Jones, easily one of the
classiest and most approachable players in the game, admitted he is
flawed in a severe way after he acknowledged he has become a father
through an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've messed up royally,'' Jones told  &UR; Bill Zack, who covers
the Braves for the Morris News Service in Georgia. ``I've messed up
just about as bad as a man can mess up without killing somebody.
I've committed adultery, and I'll pay for that the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Joneses, Chipper and wife  &UR; Karin, anybody would
have believed they had the perfect marriage. They're both young,
extremely attractive people who genuinely appeared happy together.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was raised in a small northern Florida town and
eventually became the first overall selection in the 1990 draft,
shot through Atlanta's minor league system and quickly became a
star waiting to blaze.
</P>
<P>
   That, he admitted, was part of the problem. Jones had never been
thrust into the limelight the way he had been after his first two
major league seasons in 1995 and '96, ending up in the World Series
each year.
</P>
<P>
   He began to believe all the talk of his being invincible and
quickly began cheating on his wife, the daughter of a preacher.
Jones began an affair with a Hooter's waitress in West Palm Beach
in the weeks after the Braves lost to the New York Yankees in the
1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through a rebellious period where it didn't matter
what Karin said,'' Jones said. ``I was going to do the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has acknowledged paternity and will support the
7-month-old boy. He and Karin are together and working through this
most difficult time of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when athletes have rightly been denounced for
fathering illegitimate children out of wedlock, here comes the most
unlikely person to the back of the line. Unlike most of the others,
though, Jones stood up and is taking his responsibility like a man
who cares.
</P>
<P>
   This in no way condones what Jones did, but other athletes can
learn from Chipper Jones, who seemed to have it all in the palm of
his hand. &QL; 
Making his mark &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time before shortstop  &UR; Alex Rodriguez
turned into the leader of the Seattle Mariners. This is a player
with incredible star appeal who truly cares about not only his
profession, but the club he plays for.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in south Florida, Rodriguez basically put forth an
agenda he would like the Mariners to address this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in the trades and talking to free agents that we are
going for guys with heart and desire,'' Rodriguez said. ``I've
played with those kinds of guys:  &UR; Tim Belcher,  &UR; Tino Martinez,  &UR; Jay
(Buhner). As a team, we need more character guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that character is what proves out over a long season.
When you don't have great character, dedicated to paying the price
to win, there is no way you can prevail over six months. I thought
we had guys who just showed up and thought ability would do it for
them, for the team. It doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, Rodriguez believes, began last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we prepared ourselves for that last winter or
last spring in training camp,'' he said. ``And let's get one thing
totally clear here: I'm including myself. I don't think we gave it
our best effort night in, night out. A lot of times we just weren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Did these statements get Rodriguez in hot water with his
manager,  &UR; Lou
 &UR; Piniella? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is right,'' Piniella said. ``I appreciate his willingness
to speak about it. We need more concern like that.'' &QL; 
It really was a joke &QL; 
Straight from St. Petersburg, Fla., where dangling catwalks and a
tilted roof are all the rage in major league stadiums, the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays have added a new twist to what can be called the
most comical ballpark in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding Tropicana Field was playing too much in the
hitters' favor, General Manager  &UR; Chuck LaMar decided to move back
the power alleys about 12 feet from their existing 370 feet.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: When they actually got out there and measured the
alleys, the Devil Rays discovered they were actually 359{ feet from
home plate. Now the fences are being moved back to the originally
planned 370 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we surveyed the field, we said, `No wonder we're moving
the power alleys back,' '' LaMar said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Devil Rays will raise the height of the fences
from 9{ feet to at least 11 feet and possibly 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move needed to be made for the integrity of the ballpark
and to make it an extremely good playing facility,'' he said.
``It's not based on statistics, or what kind of team we have, or
what kind of team the other teams are bringing in.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the place where a pair of Devil Rays pitchers got into
deep trouble with the organization after they called Tropicana
Field ``a joke.'' It turns out they were right, after all. &QL; 
Baseball's top 20 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's old news that  &UR; Mike Piazza became the highest-paid player
in the majors when he signed for an average of $13 million. He is
the only New York Mets player in the top 20 for salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The club with the most? Atlanta, which is paying  &UR; Greg Maddux an
average of $11.5 million,  &UR; Tom Glavine $8.5 million,  &UR; Andres
Galarraga $8.25 million and  &UR; John Smoltz $7.75 million. The only
other clubs with more than one player in the top 20 are Toronto
( &UR; Roger Clemensand  &UR; Pat
 &UR; Hentgen) and Los Angeles ( &UR; Gary Sheffield and  &UR; Raul Mondesi). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Just a bit more fine-tuning and they should have a deal wrapped
 &UR; up: Free-agent slugger  &UR; Jose Canseco, who belted a career-best 46
home runs this past season, has asked for a four-year $28 million
contract to remain in Toronto. The Blue Jays initial offer was a
one-year deal for $1.5 million and another $1.5 million through
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's amazing what kicking in some bucks will do for
 &UR; a person: Houston was all but set to start shopping outfielder
 &UR; Moises
 &UR; Alou, who had the right to demand a trade since he was acquired in
the middle of a long-term deal, but decided to throw in a $3
million payment on Jan. 15, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Danny Heep.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C'mon, if you're going to bluff at least try to make
 &UR; it believable: The Belgian brewers who own the Toronto Blue Jays,
Interbrew SA, are threatening to move the club from SkyDome to
Exhibition Stadium, where the club played until 1989. The owners
want _ what else? _ a better lease agreement. One thing _ if they
move, the Jays lose high-revenue luxury suites (there are zero at
the old stadium).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Just when you think you know this game:  &UR; Devon White just came
off a three-year $9 million deal he signed at age 32. Friday, he
signed a three-year deal with the Dodgers that guarantees him $12.4
million. He will be 38 when the deal is done. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Closer  &UR; Jeff Shaw, who decided to remain with the Dodgers after
all, saw his salary climb to among the very top in his profession.
Only  &UR; John Wetteland's average of $5.75 million per season ranks
higher than Shaw's $5.5 million average among closers.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's perennial All-Star shortstop  &UR; Barry
 &UR; Larkin led the majors in stolen-base percentage last season after
he was successful 26 times in 29 attempts for a nearly absurd .897
percentage. In his career, Larkin has been successful 315 times
while being caught just 57 times. That's an .847 success ratio.
</P>
<P>
   A quirk in pitcher  &UR; Kenny Rogers' contract calls for the New
York Yankees to pay Oakland $2.5 million next season. You'd think
that would transfer to whichever club has Rogers, who under his
right demanded to be traded last week. Not so. The Athletics will
collect that money no matter where Rogers is next season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Molitor, whose playing days probably ended on Sept. 27, is
mulling an offer to return to Milwaukee, where he played the first
15 years of his career. It would be an undetermined role. Molitor
could wind up anywhere from player-coach to base coach to an
assistant to the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs' new minor league hitting coordinator is  &UR; Randy
Bush, a career .252 hitter in 12 major league seasons with the
Minnesota Twins. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
St. Louis has made several phone calls to Cincinnati about trying
to acquire Larkin. The Reds' asking price? Outfielder  &UR; J.D. &UR; Drew.
The Cardinals' response to such a demand? Click.
</P>
<P>
   It appears  &UR; Ken Caminiti, a free agent for the first time in his
career, will decide between remaining in San Diego, at a reduced
rate from his $3.5 million salary, or return to Houston, where he
spent the first 10 years of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Los Angeles to step up big-time in an effort to sign
free-agent first baseman  &UR; Mo Vaughn, especially considering this
statement from new General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone: ``We've
acknowledged what's missing . . . a balanced offensive attack . . .
A player such as Mo Vaughn, he would be a fit in regard to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Should second baseman  &UR; Roberto Alomar head out of town in
Baltimore (a distinct possibility), the Orioles have made eyes at
 &UR; Jose Offerman, who quietly put together three solid seasons in
Kansas City, hitting a combined .305 while averaging 82 runs per
season.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cleveland closer  &UR; Jose Mesa, who was traded to San
Francisco late last season, is backtracking from a September
statement in which he said he wouldn't mind being  &UR; Robb Nen's
set-up man. Mesa wants a crack at closing again. Colorado and
Atlanta need a closer.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego offered free-agent catcher  &UR; Carlos
 &UR; Hernandez a two-year contract worth $3.25 million. Hernandez
swiftly turned down the deal. He is seeking a three-year deal for
$10 million and his agent plans to shop him to St. Louis and
Toronto. &QL;

MISTAKES DO IN TCU AGAINST RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Chris Kaylakie walked slowly as if each step
he took toward TCU's locker room hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm ashamed,'' Kaylakie said. ``It's my job to kick
field goals, and I didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kaylakie's mind, his miss of a 38-yard field-goal attempt
with 2:55 remaining and TCU trailing caused his team to lose to
Rice, 14-12, yesterday in a Western Athletic Conference game at
Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He finally arrived at TCU's locker room, a million thoughts
cluttering his mind. TCU coach Dennis Franchione called Kaylakie to
stand before his teammates. His message was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could've went around to every player in that game and found
a play that he didn't do as well as we needed for him to do,''
Franchione said. ``Chris doesn't play that many plays, and his draw
more focus and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He told them that Kaylakie's had been a single play in a long
game, and a couple of plays that followed were just as big.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Franchione was thinking about a certain fumble as he and
Kaylakie stood in TCU's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's defense stopped Rice (4-5, 4-2) after Kaylakie's miss,
providing another chance with more than two minutes remaining. TCU
began 52 yards away from a victory, but Horned Frogs quarterback
Jeff Dover fumbled on the first play, and Rice recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just dropped the ball,'' Dover said. ``I was trying to get a
couple more yards. They put a hand on the ball. It's my own fault
for not wrapping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover finished with 182 yards on 12-of-23 passing after
replacing starter Patrick Batteaux. He also led TCU to two of
second-half scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (4-5, 2-4) had one last chance after Dover's fumble.
They were sitting on Rice's 36 with 11 seconds remaining and it was
third-and-10. Dover's pass landed incomplete. That's when Frogs
tailback Basil Mitchell saw a flag and the referee signaling a chop
block on TCU. It effectively moved the comeback out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had cut somebody, so when I got up, I thought they called it
on me,'' Mitchell said. ``Then I saw it was somewhere on the line.
I kept my temper, but that was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione was thinking mostly about the chop block as he and
Kaylakie stood in TCU's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs called a penalty, an illegal chop or something like
that,'' Franchione said. ``It's disappointing. They've been told
not to decide the game at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The game looked at times like it was going to be decided by
TCU's offense. They had 21 first downs and 384 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The game looked at times like it was going to be decided by
TCU's defense. They held the Owls to 306 yards in offense. They
held them to 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their defensive staff did an excellent job of trying
to take certain things away from us,'' Owls coach Ken Hatfield
said. ``The defense made it hard to turn the corners. We had to go
north-south instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Franchione was thinking about the defense, too, as he and
Kaylakie stood in TCU's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' defense once again played exceptional if not for a
couple of plays. Those plays were two touchdown runs by Owls
fullback Jamie Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 15-yarder on third-and-five with 29 seconds
remaining in the first half. The second was a 46-yarder on
fourth-and-one 5:47 into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been games like this all year,'' Dover said. ``Whether we
win or we lose, it's been games like this. It always seems to come
down to one or two plays.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one play that Kaylakie could think about.
</P>
<P>
   His 12-of-15 accuracy on field-goal attempts entering the game
didn't seem to matter. His earlier field goals of 20 and 26 yards
were of little consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's words _ that it was only one play in the game _
didn't seem to matter much to Kaylakie after the game. It was the
only one he could remember.
</P>
<P>
   He said he pushed it, the ball sailing a little too far to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what happened,'' Kaylakie said. ``Right
now, it just really hurts.''

GLENN BACK ON GROUND, HEAD STILL ABOVE CLOUDS  
 (HLW)

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle Discovery returned
safely to the Kennedy Space Center Saturday after a nine-day
mission with the world's oldest astronaut, Sen. John Glenn, who
reassured Mission Control that he felt as good on Earth as he had
in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to reprise a statement that I made a long, long time
ago,'' the 77-year-old Glenn said on landing, ``except this time it
is, `One-G and I feel fine.' Discovery and this crew took us around
and around, and that view is still tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, when Glenn became the first American to circle the
planet, his first words from orbit were, ``Zero-G and I feel fine.
... Oh, that view is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Heralded by two sonic booms, the shuttle appeared in sunny skies
over Florida's east coast and touched down at 12:04 p.m. in what a
Mission Control commentator in Houston called ``a beautiful
landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife, Annie; his son, David; daughter, Lyn; two
grandchildren; and the Waterford High School band from Ohio, the
state that Glenn has represented as a U.S. senator for almost 25
years, were there to witness his return.
</P>
<P>
   The missing cover of a parachute compartment that fell off in
the launching on Oct. 29 did not pose a hazard in the landing, NASA
officials said. The absence of the cover forced the shuttle to do
without a stowed parachute to help brake the shuttle's speed on the
runway. Other shuttles have landed safely without such drag chutes,
and officials had not expected Discovery to experience problems.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle circled the Earth 134 times, traveling 3.6 million
miles.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours after the landing, Glenn emerged from the crew
transport vehicle with the other crew members, smiling as he
descended the stairs. With Glenn moving somewhat haltingly, they
walked around the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference scheduled for Saturday night was postponed
until Sunday morning on the recommendation of the chief crew
surgeon, Dr. Philip Stepaniak, to allow Glenn and the others to
rest after several hours of post-flight medical testing. Stepaniak
said that the crew had been up since 4:30 a.m. and that Glenn had
undergone the most extensive tests.
</P>
<P>
   Stepaniak described Glenn as ``animated and in high spirits''
and said that all seven were doing well after their nine days in
space. He said that all were able to leave the shuttle on their own
power and that initial examinations of vital signs and physical and
neurological function detected no significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   The arriving astronauts had a 15-minute visit with family
members. In a written statement, Glenn's daughter, Lyn Glenn, 51,
said: ``He is ecstatic. He's walking with a wide gait as he gets
his balance back. He was ecstatic to hug mother. It was a very long
hug and they both seemed very grateful to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her mother was delighted to see her husband emerge from
the shuttle walking _ ``Look at him walk!,'' Mrs. Glenn said,
``because she knew that was very important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who served both as subject of geriatric research and
part-time scientist, faces still more medical testing in the coming
weeks. Glenn was poked and prodded during the mission to measure
similarities between what happens to astronauts in space and bodily
changes occurring with age, like loss of bone and muscle mass,
greater susceptibility to infection and sleep difficulties. The
experiments required him to provide 10 blood samples and 16 urine
samples in space.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn's flight had been criticized in many quarters as a
public relations stunt with little scientific value. Asked whether
too much attention had been showered on Glenn, the NASA
administrator, Dan Goldin, said, ``Yes and no.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Glenn's return to space had created new interest in
science, but he said that his agency had no interest ``in getting
attention just to get more money.'' He added, ``It's our hope and
dream that the same excitement prevails'' for future projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't wait for Senator Glenn's third launch before you come
back,'' he told reporters gathered at the landing site.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said that any decision on whether future shuttle missions
would include elderly crew members would come in a year or two and
depended in part on the results of studies from Glenn's flight. He
said scientists agreed that ``this ought to be an exploratory
flight, not a pilot flight.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to tell Glenn: ``You're a true American hero.
You got back in that shuttle because you believed you'd improve
life here on Earth. You did everything you promised me you'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   William Readdy, NASA's shuttle program director and a veteran of
three shuttle missions, told reporters Saturday that after nine
days of weightlessness, Discovery's crew members would hit the
ground feeling heavy, clumsy and thirsty from dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like stepping on a pier after being at sea for a while,''
Readdy said. ``You're not quite as coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With younger people it's all reversible,'' he said. ``The
interesting thing would be how John Glenn recovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Readdy said the mission ``vastly exceeded everybody's
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery on Tuesday of an $11-million satellite carrying
images of the sun, two days after it was released by the shuttle
astronauts, was a vindication of sorts for NASA, which botched an
effort to use the satellite, Spartan, in a flight last year. It
tumbled out of control then because of crew errors, and two
space-walking astronauts had to go out and haul it in. This time
the shuttle's commander, Lt. Col. Curtis L. Brown Jr., 42, pulled
up alongside the satellite, and another crew member, Stephen K.
Robinson, 43, slowly caught the Spartan with a robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   NASA expected some 1,200 images of the sun's outer atmosphere,
or corona, and the charged particles streaming off the sun's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, back in orbit after 36 years, said during the mission
that he enjoyed floating in the shuttle, which is far more spacious
than the tiny cockpit he occupied on his first flight. He said he
had suffered no motion sickness and was eating heartily. Glenn, who
is retiring from the Senate in January, became the first American
to orbit Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the research on aging involving Glenn, the seven-man
crew conducted scores of experiments ranging from solar physics and
astronomy to the design of new drug delivery systems, studies of
artificial bone, and testing of insulation material for the
construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 80 experiments aboard the Discovery were
housed in a pressurized laboratory in the cargo bay that was
connected to the shuttle's crew quarters by a tunnel. This
laboratory, privately owned and operated by Spacehab Inc. of
Vienna, Va., contained research that included an experiment with
aerogel, the lightest solid known.
</P>
<P>
   Spacehab also housed a bioreactor, a device allowing cell
cultures to be grown in space in rotating cylinders. Astronauts
were tending several experiments for growing human cells, including
research into making artificial and synthetic material more
acceptable for human implantation by seeding it first with bone
cells. This work, researchers said, could lead to synthetic bone to
repair limbs damaged by accidents or for dental reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments, like the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital
Systems Test, or HOST, developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md., were in the shuttle's open cargo bay. A
platform in the bay contains several instruments and devices
tentatively scheduled to be installed on Hubble in its next
servicing mission, in the year 2000, said Rud V. Moe, payload
coordinator at Goddard.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments on Glenn required him to provide 10 blood
samples and 16 urine samples while in space. The bloodletting was
part of a ``protein turnover'' experiment to study muscle wasting
by tracking protein building and breakdown. Data are being
collected in six three-day sessions before, during and after the
flight. Each session, including the two in space, requires five
blood samples each taken from the Senator and a fellow crew member,
35-year-old Pedro Duque.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and another crewmate, Dr. Chiaki Mukai, 46, were also
doing sleep studies, wearing specially instrumented suits and caps
to measure breathing, chest expansion, eye movement and brain
waves.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining crew members were the pilot, Steven W. Lindsey,
38, and a mission specialist, Scott E. Parazynski, 37, the
senator's attending doctor in space.

 Changes length of victory, Skip Away's finish 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Five months ago, the upset took place right
here at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   So why couldn't it happen again?
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again outran Silver Charm last summer in the Stephen
Foster Handicap beneath the historic twin spires, and yesterday,
with much more money and prestige at stake, he proved it was no
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Facing what many have called the greatest field ever assembled
in the Breeders' Cup Classic, the 4-year-old colt dashed through an
opening between Silver Charm and Swain in midstretch and ran into
the record books before 80,452, the largest crowd for a Breeders'
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with the hot team of trainer Patrick Byrne and jockey
Pat Day, Awesome Again won a three-quarter-length victory over
Silver Charm and earned $2.66 million of the Classic's world-record
$5.12 million purse, the largest payday ever from a single race.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated showdown between Skip Away and Silver Charm
never materialized. Skip Away didn't show his trademark speed or
aggressiveness and finished sixth in the final race of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply cannot handle this surface,'' jockey Jerry Bailey
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Skip Away was practically a no-show yesterday,
failing in his quest to finish at least third and surpass Cigar as
racing's top money-winning horse, he probably clinched the
horse-of-the-year award since Silver Charm also lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was the highlight of the richest seven-race
Breeders' Cup card, which has a huge impact on the sport's year-end
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Buck's Boy took a step toward the grass title after a
wire-to-wire victory in the Turf, although Da Hoss will also
receive support on the strength of his miraculous repeat victory in
the Mile in just his second race in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively (Juvenile) and Silverbulletday (Juvenile Fillies)
wrapped up championships. Other winners were Escena (Distaff) and
Reraise (Sprint).
</P>
<P>
   The Distaff winner usually takes the filly-and-mare Eclipse
Award, but an equally strong case can be made for Sharp Cat, who
didn't make the race. Reraise's brilliant victory should give him
enough impetus to unseat vanquished favorite Affirmed Success in
the sprinter category.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic, the mile-and-a-quarter race that millions tuned in
to watch, turned into a mad scramble in the long stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm and Swain were on even terms in the upper stretch,
a virtual rematch of the Dubai World Cup in March, when Silver
Charm edged his European opponent by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, the field scattered like a covey of quail.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Gary Stevens steered Silver Charm toward Swain in an
attempt to stir his colt's competitive spirit. Swain, however,
suddenly ducked to the far outside _ supposedly startled by camera
flashbulbs popped by infield fans _ as jockey Frankie Dettori
continued a left-handed whip.
</P>
<P>
   That left a gaping hole down the middle of the track for Awesome
Again, who had picked up a head of steam after what Day described
as a ``lethargic'' beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Day had plotted a course to the outside of Silver Charm, but
instead veered Awesome Again toward the inside and burst through in
deep stretch for the victory in a solid 2:02.16 clocking.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time a horse owned by Canadian industrialist
Frank Stronach snatched away a huge potential payday from Silver
Charm. In last year's Belmont Stakes, Stronach's Touch Gold spoiled
Silver Charm's bid for the Triple Crown and the accompanying $5
million bonus. Touch Gold also ran yesterday, finishing eighth in
the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm finished a neck in front of third-place Swain, who
probably would have won with a straight course through the lane. He
crossed the finish only about 30 feet from the outside rail.
</P>
<P>
   Dettori's claims that Swain was shying from flash bulbs might
have merit, since Swain dumped him twice just before the race as
fans gathered along the outer rail snapped his picture in the
late-afternoon dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not used to this sort of thing,'' Dettori explained.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointments were Skip Away and Gentlemen, who
was supplemented into the race for $800,000 and finished last after
bleeding internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I'm ready to cry, but I won't,'' said Sonny Hine, Skip Away's
trainer. ``He's one of the best I've ever seen. It's too bad it had
to end on a sour note.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes continue to be nothing but sweet music for Byrne, who
burst from obscurity onto the Breeders' Cup scene last year by
saddling eventual horse of the year Favorite Trick and Countess
Diana to victories. He gave up his stable to take a private
training job for Stronach this year, but maintained his
relationship with Day, the all-time leader in Breeders' Cup
victories (10) who also rode Favorite Trick.
</P>
<P>
   At the first of the year, Byrne said he might have erred by
underestimating Awesome Again, who once said, ``They're two
different kind of horses'' when comparing him to stablemate Touch
Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Now Byrne is lobbying for Awesome Again as horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone's got Skip Away tattooed for horse of the year
already,'' Byrne said. ``But this horse shouldn't be thrown out of
the balloting.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again, however, probably won't be a contender for the
honor, despite his flawless six-for-six record this year.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne boosted the colt's confidence by finding the easiest
competition. Ironically, while his skillful and conservative
handling may have been the primary reason for Awesome Again's
victory in the world's richest race, it will almost surely backfire
at the end of the year when Eclipse Award voters compare the
overall accomplishments of Awesome Again and Skip Away.

REAL ESTATE: FOR BORROWERS, LOW RATES PIQUE INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., words in double parentheses should be set in brackets)  
 (HLW)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ With the recent cuts in interest rates, these have
been intense, nerve-jangling times for mortgage shoppers and
lenders alike.
</P>
<P>
   At the Marine Midland Mortgage office in New Rochelle, N.Y.,
loan officers are fielding between 400 and 500 mortgage-related
calls a day, compared with perhaps 100 a year ago. Even the current
pressures, though, are less than they were in early October, when
the decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates for the
first time since January 1996 drove mortgage rates to their lowest
level in a generation. In the week ending Oct. 2, the rates were
about 6.68 percent for a conventional 30-year fixed-rate loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting 600 to 700 calls back then,'' said James
Monaghan, a Marine Midland vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the Federal Reserve cut, the average mortgage
rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan rose to more than 7 percent
again. And that increase disappointed some consumers who had held
back from jumping into the market in hopes that rates might subside
still further.
</P>
<P>
   Those consumers could be in for a wait. Despite a few recent
dips that followed another Federal Reserve interest rate cut in
mid-October, mortgage rates haven't budged much lately from the
range of about 7 percent. And with some economists saying that it
is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates again
in November _ because, they say, economic growth, at least through
the third quarter, has been strong _ more torpor may be on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is fairly directionless right now,'' said Keith T.
Gumbinger, vice president at HSH Associates, a financial publisher
in Butler, N.J., that tracks mortgage rates. ``We're probably not
going to be going anywhere anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   According to HSH statistics, the average interest rates for all
30-year fixed-rate loans last Wednesday, the last full day before
this section went to press, was at 7.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lack of significant week-to-week change in rates for
30-year mortgages overall doesn't mean that rates for specific
types within the variety of 30-year mortgages are moving parallel
to the average. For example, rates on so-called conforming
fixed-rate mortgages, those for amounts less than $227,150, have
been slipping lately, with the rate for a 30-year loan at 6.76
percent last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gumbinger, so far this year conventional 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages have had a range of only about 0.6 percentage
point _ financial specialists express this as 60 basis points _
between the 7.28 percent high that they reached in May and their
year-to-date low of 6.68 percent. By contrast, in 1997, the most
stable year of the recent past, Gumbinger said, the range was 107
basis points, and in 1994 it was 233 basis points. ``For all this
talk of upheaval and volatility, there's actually been tremendous
stability in rates this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the home-financing landscape, however, has been
anything but stagnant lately. Among recent developments in the
mortgage market are the following:
</P>
<P>
   --The continuing popularity of fixed-rate loans, with
adjustable-rate mortgages, which represented more than half of the
loans nationwide a decade ago, now just above 10 percent of new
loans.
</P>
<P>
   --A boom in refinancings, which mortgage bankers estimate now
account for a whopping 70 percent of all current mortgage volume.
</P>
<P>
   --The broad acceptance of a credit scoring system that lenders
have begun relying on over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   --The growing availability of much larger loans insured by the
Federal Housing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   --New channels for obtaining mortgages, such as private-banking
divisions that banks have set up to pamper their most profitable
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nardi, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, thinks some of
the most flexible mortgages are now emerging from the private
banking divisions of major lenders like Chase Manhattan. ``These
loans aren't necessarily for people who have a lot of money,''
Nardi said. ``And because most people already have a banking
relationship, I always encourage my clients to look at them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Zizka, a managing vice president at First
Manhattan Consulting Group, which specializes in the banking
industry, the mortgages that now emanate from private banking
divisions tend to focus on jumbo loans, or those loans that are
over $227,150. Zizka said that the loans have become more common
over the last few years, as banks have both scaled up their private
banking businesses and spotted the potential for larger profits
with jumbo, versus conforming, loans.
</P>
<P>
   A typical offering, Zizka said, is a loan where a customer pays
interest only, and holds off on principal payments until some
preselected time, such as soon after getting his or her annual
bonus from work.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, consumers have also begun to benefit from
the flexibility that comes with on-line mortgage lending. It still
accounts for only about 1 percent of all mortgage loans, but the
online process can make the buying process significantly simpler,
as well as cheaper, by letting consumers compare mortgage rates
from dozens of lenders at a time, as well as by charging
commissions that are less than those charged by traditional
mortgage brokers. The degree of flexibility of the online services,
however, does not yet match that of individual brokers. ``The
online market really speaks to packaging plain-vanilla products,''
said Gumbinger of HSH.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shift in the mortgage market over the last year _
aside from the huge surge in refinancings _ has undoubtedly come
from consumers roaring into fixed-rate loans. Neil Bader, chief
executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, estimated that until about six
months ago, roughly 70 percent of his firm's mortgage volume was
going into five- and seven-year adjustable products. But now that
the difference in interest rates between fixed-rate and adjustable
mortgages is so slight, about 60 percent of his firm's mortgage
volume is going into fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should consumers take out a five- or seven-year
adjustable, when they can take out a 30-year product for almost the
same price,'' Bader said, adding that ``it's the first time in a
decade where fixed-rate loans have become a compelling option.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that message may not be getting out to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still walking in and saying that adjustable
mortgages are wonderful,'' said Edna Haber of Haber Mortgages in
Mount Vernon, N.Y. ``They don't seem to understand that the market
is entirely different now.''
</P>
<P>
   What about 15-year fixed-rate loans? After all, the loans _
relative to their 30-year cousins _ charge about one-half of one
percentage point less in interest.
</P>
<P>
   As mortgage lenders have expanded the types of loans they offer
over the last decade, and as prepayment penalties on shorter-term
mortgages have dwindled, Bader thinks the 15-year loans are less
popular than they once might have been. Indeed, he thinks the loans
are currently sparking interest only with consumers who are 50
years or older and who want to make sure that any fixed payments
that they have to make during their retirement years will be
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 15-year mortgages have their share of believers. At the
Marine Midland mortgage office in New Rochelle, Monaghan said that
about 60 percent of the loans that his office is currently handling
for home refinancings are for 15-year fixed loans, while 40 percent
are for 30-year products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed that 80 to 90 percent of people buying new homes
are still going for the 30-year loans,'' he said. ``But two-income
families, once they've been in a house for three or four years,
seem to think they can easily afford the 15-year loans.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ryan, a loan officer for Bankamerica Mortgage in
Tarrytown, N.Y., confirms the interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if you took out a 30-year loan at 9 percent in 1993, you
can now take out a 15-year loan at about 6 percent, and your
payments are basically the same, but you're cutting off 10 years
off the loan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a 30-year fixed rate loan, charging 9 percent
interest on a $200,000 mortgage, would cost a consumer a monthly
payment of $1,609. By contrast, a 15-year loan charging 6 percent
interest would cost only $1,687.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, mortgage experts say they're still seeing plenty of
consumers who are more interested in the upfront savings associated
with longer-term loans. But Ryan, for one, has noticed that more
consumers are buying loans with long-range savings in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Winter is one such long-term thinker. The president of his
eponymous Manhattan commercial brokerage firm, which handles a
variety of commercial loans, Winter is currently refinancing a
personal loan that covers the mortgages on both his co-op apartment
in the city and his primary residence on Long Island. Rather than
take a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that was offered to him recently
at 6.25 percent interest, Winter chose a 15-year fixed loan at 6
percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   To show how much a consumer might save with a 15-year fixed-rate
loan in the long run, Winter used the example of a $225,000
mortgage, which is just below the level at which a loan becomes a
jumbo loan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With a 30-year loan at 6.25 percent interest, Winter said, a
consumer would have a monthly mortgage payment of $1,385, and at
the end of 10 years, that loan would be paid down to $189,534. By
contrast, the monthly payments with a 15-year fixed mortgage at 6
percent would be $1,898, but at the end of 10 years the mortgage
would stand at only $98,210.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible difference,'' he said. ``Of course,
consumers have to ask themselves whether they want to have that
extra $513 a month to spend or do they want to pay off their house
much more rapidly. But 15-year loans have never been easier to
swallow than they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, consumers have also been increasingly making
another type of loan as well. These are the ``piggyback'' mortgages
that banks began offering about a year ago. At Chase Manhattan
Bank, interest in the loans _ which combine a primary mortgage with
either a secondary mortgage or a line of credit _ has doubled over
the last six months said Dan Inte- &QC; mann, a Chase vice president at
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the popularity is that by combining two
mortgages, the new piggyback loans let consumers take out higher
mortgages _ typically 90 percent financing _ on larger dollar
amounts, up to $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, mortgages for more than 80 percent financing
required consumers to buy private mortgage insurance, which was not
only expensive, but usually unavailable for loans over $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the piggyback loans, consumers generally pay slightly
higher interest rates _ usually in the range of 1.5 percentage
points _ on the second mortgages. Still, the loans tend to cost
consumers less in the long run because the second loan typically
doesn't carry a prepayment penalty, so it can be paid down rapidly.
Also, with the piggyback loans, the interest on the second
mortgages is tax-deductible, whereas private mortgage insurance
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Scott, a senior mortgage consultant at New York
Mortgage Corp., says the new loans are especially attractive to
consumers who are looking for a relatively inexpensive line of
credit, a bridge loan, or who perhaps anticipate coming into small
pile of money, say, a Wall Street bonus or an inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   But Bader thinks the loans are also attracting affluent
consumers who simply appreciate the loans' tax advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that we have affluent home buyers who want to
eke out every extra penny of borrowing that they can,'' he said.
``Probably a third of the people who are inquiring about maximum
financing are doing it for the tax advantages. And this is a
category of home buyer that hasn't typically gone after maximum
financing in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest in piggyback loans confirms what mortgage experts
say is still a strong trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without equivocation, there's been a shift by consumers away
from higher down payments and low interest rates, to those loans
where they accept a higher rate in exchange for low down payments,
as well as lower points ((the percentage of a loan, typically 1 or
2 percent that is due upon signing)) at closing,'' said Marc Smith,
the president of Crestar Mortgage and an immediate past president
of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But very large mortgages aren't for the faint-hearted,
especially now. And that's because the difference in cost between
jumbo loans and so-called conforming loans, which are less than
$227,150, has widened considerably over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gumbinger of HSH, as of the week that ended Oct.
30, the spread, or difference in cost, between a 30-year conforming
loan and a 30-year jumbo loan was 46 basis points, or almost half a
percentage point. By contrast, the spread between the two same
loans at the same time last year was only about 17 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean for mortgage shoppers? ``If you're on the
cusp between a conforming and a jumbo loan, it might make more
sense to put down more money and get the latter, versus putting
down less and getting a jumbo,'' Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some good news lately for consumers looking for
larger loans, if not necessarily jumbo-sized ones. And that news is
pinned to loans insured by the FHA _ still the most important loan
source nationwide for first-time home buyers, especially in
minority communities. The loans require as little as 3 percent
down, with borrowed money, if necessary. They also let home buyers
borrow closing costs for their mortgages and let borrowers carry
more debt than a private mortgage insurer would allow.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the Mortgage Bankers Association tried to expand
the availability of FHA-insured loans in higher-cost real estate
markets. As of mid-October, the group could finally claim success.
The reason is that a new Federal law has now raised the FHA-insured
loan limits in the lowest-cost markets in the country from $86,317
to $109,032, and in the highest-cost markets _ which includes most
metropolitan areas _ from $170,362, to $197,621. According to
Smith, the eased loan limits mean an extra 50,000 households a year
may now enter the home-owning market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But some mortgage experts suspect that shrinking interest rates
are benefiting less-affluent potential homeowners just as much as
the higher FHA limits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Haber credits low interest rates with helping
revive interest in the market for co-op apartments in certain parts
of Westchester County, like Yonkers and Port Chester. In general,
she said, demand for Westchester co-ops is up 40 percent since the
beginning of the year. Meanwhile, she added, prices _ unlike those
in Manhattan _ are still low, sometimes as low as $30,000 for an
apartment that might have sold for $100,000 in the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Westchester, people are putting down 10 percent, getting a
7 percent mortgage, adding in maintenance, and finding that it's
still cheaper, by and large, to buy an apartment, rather than
rent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As of next July, consumers will also be able to benefit from a
federal law enacted last summer that requires mortgage lenders and
services to notify consumers who pay private mortgage insurance of
the right to terminate their policies once a homeowner's equity
reaches 20 percent. While the law has been criticized for falling
short on several fronts _ it doesn't cover existing mortgages, for
example _ it's still expected to save thousands of homeowners from
making needless premium payments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same borrowers who were forced, because of their
inability to raise a significant amount of cash for a down payment,
to purchase private mortgage insurance may also be benefiting from
the new credit-scoring system. Originally developed by the credit
industry, it judges creditworthiness on a more consistent, graded
basis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bader of Skyscraper Mortgage, the new system is
already helping consumers with less-than-perfect credit records to
receive interest rates on their loans that are perhaps 2 percentage
points lower than what they might have received in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the lower mortgage rates generally, loan
executives said, some consumers a reluctant to lock in a rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing an inability to pull the trigger,'' said Denny
Kupferman, senior account executive at North American Mortgage
Corporation, a division of Dime Savings Bank of New York. ``People
are still hopeful that they may miss that one day that brings them
an all-time low. At the same time the ability to get mortgage
information on a momentary basis _ say, over the Internet _ is
contributing to information overload, and also making more people
think they're experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupferman's advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you can never determine where rates are going, so look
for a payment that you feel comfortable with, and then shift the
focus to the rest of your life,'' he said. ``It's just not worth
losing sleep trying to decide whether an interest rate that is
one-eighth of a point lower is going to save you an extra $100.''

KEALY'S KNEE, CAMPBELL'S ARM OPEN NEW QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEYJOE SMITH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Nine weeks ago, the season died on a Brock Huard
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, another was born.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how priorities, like football teams, evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing up,'' Sun Devils' Coach Bruce Snyder said.
``And I'm really proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With representatives from the Las Vegas Bowl watching from the
press box, the Sun Devils finally matched the hype. They throttled
a quality opponent, demolished a daunting defense, leaped over the
hurdle of mediocrity, primed themselves for the kind of finish that
could validate a season of dread.
</P>
<P>
   They finish on the road, at Oregon and Arizona, against two
ranked teams. If they run the table, they're in the postseason. And
everything that threatened to bury this team in the back of the
scrapbook will be forgotten, replaced by the syrupy tale of
resilience.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it was all true. From the resurgence of Ryan Kealy
to the emergence of an opportunistic defense right down to a story
line from Rudy. Or in this case, quarterback Steve Campbell, who
spent an entire career waiting in queue, only to have his number
called in his last afternoon at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a knee here, in my last game at ASU,'' said Campbell,
who will spend the next few days in a purple haze.
</P>
<P>
   So continues a fascinating soap opera at quarterback. Kealy has
got his groove back, but will a sprained knee linger into next
week? Is Campbell officially second on the depth chart or the
benefactor of a gracious coach on Senior Day? And what about Chad
Elliot?
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the game, Elliott was seen talking on the
sideline phone. Was he calling the admissions department at UCLA?
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's enough to say Kealy's resurgence has sparked all
of this. Before he was benched, Kealy threw eight touchdown passes
and seven interceptions. Since he returned to spark an overtime win
against Stanford, he has produced seven touchdown passes without a
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like a new quarterback,'' wide receiver Lenzie Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care as much about per-play performance,''
Kealy said. ``Now, it's just a matter of getting it done. I kind of
got away from having fun. I was harping too much on trying to make
things happen. You've got to have fun in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the three-game winning streak, a span in which the
offense has produced 137 points. This was the first impressive
victory of the season, a day when you could feel proud about the
Sun Devils. A day when the wide receivers were flying, the penalty
flags were not, and there was a beautiful zero in the turnover
ledger when the gun sounded.
</P>
<P>
   A day when Courtney Jackson looked like Charles Woodson, when
Snyder was the coach he says he is, when the Sun Devils didn't even
need the services of J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are starting to get their groove,'' Cal Coach Tom Holmoe
said. ``They just exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   From the wreckage comes a future, a shot at redemption, a chance
to become one of those bounce-back teams coaches love to wax
poetically about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of inspires us,'' Lenzie Jackson said. ``It's a race
to the bowl game, and we have to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the blowout, the apathy was growing. Before the game,
Mill Avenue was a sleepy stretch of cement, not a bustling
college-town artery getting juiced for its Saturday ritual.
Interest in this team has steadily waned since the Washington
debacle. And this was exactly the kind of performance needed to
make you care about the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time the defense and the offense played on
all cylinders,'' linebacker Joe Cesta said. ``And if we keep this
up the rest of the season, if we close it out, we can finish 7-4.
We can go to a big bowl game. I heard we can even finish second in
the conference. We can really erase the first half of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Fiesta Bowl, but nonetheless, it's a mission. And
maybe now, the Sun Devils know who they are and where they are
going. &QL;

CARDINALS `CLOSE,' TOBIN SAYS  
 COACH DEFENDS TEAM, HIS OWN PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - ``Vince Tobin is the most private of the five
head coaches the Cardinals have had since they came to the Valley
of the Sun 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a regular radio talk show. He doesn't make
commercials. He didn't open a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Because people don't know him well, he's often misunderstood.
They see him on the sidelines wearing beige pants, holding a
clipboard, rarely showing emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, however, don't hold back in their criticism. They often
wonder if Tobin, 15-25 in three seasons, is the guy who can get the
Cardinals turned around.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin talked about their 4-4 record, personnel decisions, the
struggles of second-year quarterback Jake Plummer and his own image
in a recent interview with The Republic's Steve Schoenfeld: &QL; 
Question: How bad was the salary cap situation when you took over,
and did you regret having to cut people like Garrison Hearst, Clyde
Simmons and Seth Joyner for salary cap reasons? &QL; 
Answer: When I was first hired, I didn't know much about the salary
cap situation. I didn't get into the nuts and bolts and what we had
to do. But certainly, I regretted having to cut (Hearst). My
philosophy is that you try to keep all of your good football
players, and that's how you build. Any time you have to trade one
for another _ sign one good football player and release another _
I'm not sure you strengthen your football team. There comes a point
when you can't keep everybody. &QL; 
Q: When you took over, there wasn't a lot good said about this
organization. People thought it was bad from top to bottom. What
about the organization today, and have you been given the tools to
win? &QL; 
A: My thinking when we arrived three years ago was that I wanted
the organization to be thought of as one people wanted to come to,
wanted to be a part of. My vision of this football team was that it
would be well-thought-of from top to bottom. I noticed on a lot of
occasions early that I had to confront people who were assuming
that what had gone on in the past would continue to go on. My
relationship with (owner Bill Bidwill) was that we were going to do
whatever was necessary to put a winning football team on the field.
Since we've been here, he has not gone back on that. What happened
prior to me coming here, I don't know and really am not concerned
with. We have made steady progress from top to bottom to becoming a
consistent football team and becoming a consistent organization. I
think it is viewed around the league, internally, in the city,
different than it was three years ago. &QL; 
Q: You have a very young team. In other situations, fans might cut
your team more slack. But because this team hasn't won for 10
years, are you paying the price for past failures, and when you
lose a game, people thinking, ``Here we go again''? &QL; 
A: I think certainly the perspective and attitude of the fans is
set over an 11-year period, over a two-year period and eight games.
It's understandable. They want to win. We want to win. That's how
you evaluate things. But I do think we have a young football team
that is very close to being a very good football team. We're 4-4 at
this time. &QL; 
Q: You would be in the playoffs if the season ended today. But how
good a team are you? Is it a dominant team? &QL; 
A: I'm not sure anybody knows. We haven't played as a dominant
team. We played well in spurts, well enough to win four of our
eight games and four of our last six after losing the first two.
That's what put us in a hole and dampened the enthusiasm of some of
the fans. It put them back in the mode of the ``here we go again''
type of thing. But this is not the same Cardinals team. It's not
the same Cardinals organization. This organization wants to put a
winning product on the field and is doing everything in our power
to do that. There is no panacea anywhere. &QL; 
Q: Did you expect your offense to be better than this? &QL; 
A: I expected our offense to be more consistent. We have played
well in spurts but haven't played well enough consistently to
become the type of offense we want to become. The quarterback (Jake
Plummer) had a lot of undue expectations put on him early. He made
some plays. He made some plays that aren't very good. &QL; 
Q: Did you cringe when people said (Plummer) would be the next MVP,
the next Joe Montana? &QL; 
A: I was kind of like a cymbal clanging in the desert. I was the
only one saying at the time we drafted him and at the time we
started playing him last year that we should let him develop at his
own pace and let him be Jake Plummer and not compare him to
somebody who played 15 years in the league. . . . I think Jake is a
quality young quarterback who is going to be an excellent
quarterback, but you have to go through some growing pains. &QL; 
Q: What about the people who say this offense, the West Coast
offense, doesn't fit him, that it inhibits him and doesn't let Jake
be Jake? &QL; 
A: When success is not what people anticipated or expected, they
look for reasons. Jake can run this offense fine. He'll run it
better and better. I think a lot is made too much of systems, the
offense, the West Coast offense. Every offense is a product of the
people who coach it and the players who run it. They are all
variations of everything. I think every offense has to be able to
run the football. I think every offense has to have a short-passing
game. I think every offense has to have a deep-passing game. In
order to have that happen, you have to have people in place who can
do those things. &QL; 
Q: You said before the season you thought the offensive line would
be fine. It gets ripped regularly. What is your opinion of the line
now? &QL; 
A: I don't think the offensive line is as bad as (people think). I
think we have three young guys (tackle James Dexter, center Aaron
Graham and guard Chris Dishman) who are playing really for the
first time and getting better. I think James Dexter is playing very
well. Aaron Graham has had some good games. He has had some games
he hasn't been as consistent as I'd like, but I think he's going to
be a fine football player. The (left) guard _ Dishman started, then
got hurt and been out the past few weeks. &QL; 
Q: Is the offensive line something you are going to continue to
need to address in the off-season? &QL; 
A: Obviously, we would have liked to have had Anthony Clement, our
second-round pick. We thought we had a good football player, but he
hasn't played a snap this year (because of injury). But at the
draft, we'll certainly look at the offensive line. Whether we take
one with the first pick will depend on when we draft and who's
there. &QL; 
Q: After Dick Jamieson was let go as offensive coordinator, you
hired Marc Trestman. What kind of job has he done? &QL; 
A: I think he has done a good job. We've had three offensive
coordinators in three years. I've tried to keep pretty much the
same system, terminology, so the players haven't had to learn
radically new concepts, plays to call. That has probably hurt the
coaches who have come in, having to learn a system that has
basically been intact. Once they have arrived, I've allowed them to
take it the direction their personality and coaching strengths are.
. . . Jake has had two coaches in two years, and I think that
affects you. I've been on the defensive side of the ball most of my
career. I know that the first year, there is a lot of new learning
for defenses. The second year, you should get better, and when the
third year comes around, if you've kept pretty much the same
players, you've got something going. I think it's the same thing
for an offense. &QL; 
Q: What do you think of your image? Does it bother you that one
columnist calls you Mr. Beige? &QL; 
A: I'm not sure I know what that means. &QL; 
Q: Plain, drab. &QL; 
A: I learned a long time ago you can't be something somebody wants
you to be. You've got to be who you are. If you try to be somebody
else, it comes across as phony. My strength is being who I am,
knowing who I am. Players know what to expect from me. People who
write have never been in a meeting with me, with my football team.
They don't know what I say to them, how I say it to them. Their
perceptions are not always based on reality. I'm not going to try
to set the record straight because it doesn't do any good. I do
things the way I think things need to be done. I've been associated
with successful football teams and good football teams wherever
I've been, and I'll let my record speak for itself. &QL; 
Q: Fans say you don't seem to be a motivator. Why is that? &QL; 
A: How would fans know? They haven't sat in my meetings and seen
how I act towards my players, what I say to them before ballgames,
after ballgames, before and after practice. The only perception
they would have of knowing that is how it is reported, and
reporters don't know. &QL; 
Q: But you're not a holler guy. You don't scream and shout publicly
and throw things. Do you understand why people might think you're
bland? &QL; 
A: There are an awful lot of coaches who don't scream and shout and
throw things. I don't remember Chuck Noll throwing a lot of things,
and he won an awful lot of football games. I don't know that Tom
Landry threw things. He won an awful lot of football games. I don't
remember Bud Grant throwing things. I don't correlate screaming and
hollering and throwing things with being a successful football
coach. If that's your personality, that's what you have to do. &QL;

VENTURA'S WIN CAN'T TOP BIZARRE 1ST HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top-rated quarterback in the NFL is going back to the bench
in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The top-rated quarterback in the AFC was headed back to the
bench until the team owner stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   After eight games, the coach of the league's best team tells his
players they have a chance to be the greatest in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   If the first half of the NFL season hasn't been bizarre enough,
one quarterback  &UR; (Kerry Collins, then of Carolina) quits on his
team. Another  &UR; (Tony Banks of St. Louis) decides not to take the
team plane home after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the AFC breaks a 13-game Super Bowl losing streak,
it has a chance to become the first conference to record 40
victories in interconference games.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is picked to win the NFC East and then goes out and
loses its first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, picked by many publications to win the NFC Central
and by ``Sports Illustrated'' to go to the Super Bowl, is winless
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings Coach  &UR; Dennis Green goes from almost being
dumped in the off-season to getting a new contract to helping a
former pro wrestler and Vikings and Buccaneers announcer get
elected governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Jesse is committed,'' Green said of Gov.-elect  &UR; Jesse
``The
 &UR; Body'' Ventura. ``It shows that the American system works.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vince McMahon, president of the World Wrestling Federation,
says Ventura has his eye on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to talk to my good friend  &UR; Hulk Hogan to see if we
can get him on the ballot down here in four years,'' said
Buccaneers Coach
 &UR; Tony Dungy, a former University of Minnesota player and twice a
Vikings assistant. ``So far, he hasn't called back.'' &QL; 
Oldie but goodie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty months ago,  &UR; Randall Cunningham was playing for the NFC
in a Super Bowl old-timers game. Now, he has helped the Vikings to
an NFC-best 7-1 record and a league-high 114.3 passing rating.
</P>
<P>
   But it's back to bench as soon as starting quarterback  &UR; Brad
Johnson returns in the next couple of weeks from a cracked right
fibula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we could win with Denny Green lined up at
quarterback,'' said Cunningham, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has thrown for 1,718 yards and 16 touchdowns. He has
been intercepted only three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Randall is the MVP of the first half of the season,''
Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham is just glad to be back in the league. Two years ago,
he was out of football, working in Las Vegas for a company that
installs marble and granite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a soothing feeling that the opinions of people have
changed about me,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he can handle his impending demotion. ``Whether
I'm on the bench or off the bench, I'm loving it,'' he said. ``Brad
looks good. I don't get into all that stuff about who's starting
and who's not.'' &QL; 
Small fry &QL; 
Cunningham, 35, and AFC passing leader  &UR; Doug Flutie, 36, have
become two of the biggest stories of the first half. But they are
just among 10 quarterbacks 32 or older who are ranked in the top 13
in the league in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the New York Jets'  &UR; Vinny Testaverde, who at 34 is
5-0 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   None has been as big a surprise as Flutie, who was out of the
NFL for nine years. Now, his cereal, Flutie Flakes, is the
top-selling item in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting until Sunday to eat my Flutie Flakes, '' New York
Jets linebacker  &UR; Pepper Johnson said of today's game against the
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie said: ``I hope he has them for breakfast and not for
lunch or dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is a hero to some of Johnson's shorter teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a normal guy, 5-10, 190,'' Jets wide receiver  &UR; Wayne
Chrebet said. ``Now, Doug's a small guy. I've met Doug, and I
towered over him. I don't know if he's 5-7 or 5-8, but I could see
down on him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills look up to Flutie, who has taken them from an 0-3
start to being tied for the AFC East lead at 5-3. But Flutie was
headed back to the bench until Bills owner  &UR; Ralph Wilson told Coach
 &UR; Wade Phillips not to worry about quarterback  &UR; Rob Johnson's $5
million salary in making a decision on a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips then announced last week that Flutie will start the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, more than anything, it's satisfying to know that the
people of this franchise _ the coaching staff, front office _
believe in you enough to put the team in your hands, to put you in
control, to make that commitment to you,'' Flutie said. &QL; 
Immortality? &QL; 
During a team meeting nearly two weeks ago, Denver Broncos
Coach &UR; Mike Shanahan told his players they had a chance to become
the greatest team in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, the NFL's only unbeaten team, didn't argue with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply didn't surprise me to hear that talk simply because
of our standing,'' Broncos cornerback  &UR; Ray Crockett said. ``When
you look at the teams that we've played and the teams that we have
left on our schedule, they're all winnable games.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you look at it. If you do something to that nature, if you
go 19-0, you have to be the greatest. No one else has done it.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Kansas City Chiefs fans did their own voting on Election Day. More
than 24,000 fans responded to a ``Kansas City Star'' poll on
whether  &UR; Elvis &UR; Grbac or  &UR; Rich Gannon should start at quarterback.
Nearly 18,000 picked the backup, Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas running back  &UR; Emmitt Smith needs 95 yards today against
the New York Giants to pass  &UR; Tony Dorsett (12,036 yards) and become
the team's all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Packers players already are preparing for Coach  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Holmgren to leave after the season, most likely to Seattle. ``If
Sherm is the coach, yeah (the Packers can remain successful),''
safety  &UR; LeRoy
 &UR; Butler said of offensive coordinator  &UR; Sherman Lewis. ``If somebody
esle comes in here trying to change everything, absolutely not.
Mike Holmgren's shoes are so big to fill, they'll be stuffing paper
in them for a long time. But Sherm could because his philosophy
would be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad are things in St. Louis? Rams running backs coach
 &UR; Wilbert Montgomery told a Chicago radio station last week that
several Rams players don't care. ``I gave out reports (last year)
to the players that they were supposed to read, and all four
corners were stapled together. When I got them all back, all four
corners were still stapled together.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings owner  &UR; Red McCombs, who saw his team win its first 11
games _ preseason and regular season _ after buying the club,
missed last week's loss at Tampa because he was ill. He was so
angry watching the game on TV that he ``rearranged'' his furniture.
``I was already sick and then I started answering the phone,
`McCombs Mortuary,' '' he said. &QL;

SKINS MAY BE TURNING CORNER  
 TEAM SHOWED EXPECTED FORM IN 1ST WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They beefed up their defensive line through free agency,
complementing a strong linebacking corps and secondary. They have
big-play weapons offensively, led by one of the most successful
backs in the game. And they play in a lousy division, the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed all that was left to do for the Washington Redskins
was get the convertibles ready for the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they went two months before winning their first game, and
they limp into Sun Devil Stadium this afternoon with a 1-7 mark to
meet the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's stunning decline from favorite to spoiler hasn't
sat well with the D.C. sports crowd, which is calling for Coach
Norv Turner's head.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a 21-14 win last week over the New York Giants _ a team
that pummeled the Cardinals 34-7 at the Meadowlands before the bye
_ might have awakened an underachieving team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long, rough start,'' Turner said. ``It was
important to play a complete game against New York. It was the best
we've played in all three phases of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the kind of news the Cardinals wanted to get this
week as they take their 4-4 midseason record and try to move into
uncharted territory among winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Redskins opened the season with a loss at New York when
they were anticipating big things, and then came home and lost some
close ones,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said. ``Then once you
start losing, it's a hard thng to stop. They changed their
quarterback. They changed the kicker. Those are things you do when
you're not having success. But they're basically the same team they
were at the start of the season when they were predicted to win our
division.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins thought they had taken significant steps toward
improving their defense by adding big-name free-agent tackles Dana
Stubblefield, formerly of San Francisco, and Dan Wilkinson,
formerly of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. The Redskins are giving up 332 yards and 30
points a game. Twice they've been torched for more than 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   Worst, Stubblefield suffered a knee injury three weeks ago and
is out today.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Trent Green finally has settled in at quarterback
ahead of Gus Frerotte. Green got the Redskins into the end zone
three times last week, their best performance since the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington is not expected to have Allen _ who has rushed
for 616 yards with a whopping 4.5-yard average _ because of an
ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's success rushing has been offset by Washington's minus-13
turnover margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the season, the thing that hurt us the
most was turnovers,'' Turner said. ``Then we had two touchdowns
called back because of penalties. We missed four field goals inside
45 yards. We made a lot of errors in our early games that kept us
from having a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   So did an early stretch of games against the Giants, San
Francisco, Seattle, Denver and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play those teams, you have to be playing your best to
come away with a winning record, and we were playing far from our
best,'' Turner said. ``The bye gave us a chance to regroup, and we
came back and played our best game against New York last week.''
</P>
<P>
   After viewing tape of Washington's win over the Giants,
Cardinals running back Adrian Murrell can't understand why its
defense hasn't been more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year when I was with the Jets, they brought in a lot of
free agents, and when you do that, sometimes it takes a while for a
unit to jell,'' Murrell said. ``From the tape I saw, I don't see
where they have a problem. They look like a challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jamir Miller said the Cardinals should know better
than to regard a 1-7 foe as anything but dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out of the playoffs now, so all they have left is to
play the spoiler,'' Miller said. ```The reason I know that is
because we have been there before in that same position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had practice at it. We've had practice at trying to get
over .500 before, too, and we've failed. We want to get over the
hump, and they don't want to let us. That makes them our most
important and our most dangerous opponent.'' &QL;
