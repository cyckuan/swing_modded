   BOSTON _ Confessions of an ESPN ``SportsCentury'' voter:
</P>
<P>
   I did not vote for the horse. Not for a fleeting millisecond did
it occur to me that a vote in the ESPN ``SportsCentury'' poll to
determine the top North American athletes (hence, no Pele or Emil
Zatopek) should go to anything but a human being. I did vote for
Eddie Arcaro (my No. 36), who rode horses with distinction. But I
would no sooner have voted for Secretariat or Citation or Man O'
War than I would have voted for Richard Petty's car, as opposed to
Richard Petty, whom I did not vote for because, with all due
respect, I don't get this vroom-vroom business and never will.
</P>
<P>
   Now my friend Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post _ let's
just say that if ``Seinfeld'' had a resident sportswriter it would
have been Tony Kornheiser _ did vote for Secretariat at No. 8.
Eight! Tony, Tony, Tony!
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a tremendous amount of abuse from my friends,''
Kornheiser concedes. ``I understand if they see me coming, they
will probably walk on the other side of the street, or throw oats
in my path. And I do regret causing them pain from any association
with them. But if you're asking me, on a serious note, if there is
one spot left in the Top 50 for either Bonnie Blair or the horse,
I'm still taking the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   That's my Tony, now and forever a man of conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it gets worse. Roone Arledge, who should need no
introduction, put the horse at No. 4. More and more I believe, like
Mickey Rourke's Boogie in ``Diner,'' that there is a parallel
universe out there with things going on about which I know nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you one person who is very happy about the horse.
That would be Mark Shapiro, the 29-year-old ESPN producer who has
basically given up all semblance of a life for more than 2 1/2
years in order to produce the magnificent pieces on the Top 50,
which will culminate at 5 p.m. Sunday (Channel 5) with the
revelation of Nos. 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that could have happened to us was Secretariat
coming in at No. 35,'' Shapiro reports. ``That got everyone's
attention. What that did was launch the controversy that is the
lifeblood of a series like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll itself was conducted in the fall of 1997. The results
had to be in by the end of that year so Shapiro and his staff could
start work producing the necessary 48 half-hour pieces for Nos. 50
through 3, and the pair of one-hour pieces for Nos. 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever anyone's feelings about the list itself, no one could
reasonably complain about ESPN's sincerity. The pieces have been
uniformly outstanding. They have been far from puff jobs, never
shying away from controversy. Many people were upset, for example,
that so much time in the Larry Bird piece was spent on the sadly
troubled relationship with his daughter from his brief teenage
marriage. When's the last time you heard a criticism like that on
the subject of an athlete's screen bio?
</P>
<P>
   In order to come up with 70 hours of programming, Shapiro and
his ``SportsCentury'' staff interviewed more than 1,600 people,
many of them more than once. They obtained footage from more than
300 sources and secured innumerable private personal items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal from Day 1 was to enhance the understanding of the
impact sport has had on our society and culture, whether it's Jesse
Owens at Berlin, Jackie Robinson breaking the Major League Baseball
color barrier, gambling, Magic Johnson and AIDS, or whatever. And I
think we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   You think voting for this list was easy? I beat myself up for
six weeks and still couldn't arrive at firm conclusions. You had to
evaluate true ``all-around'' athletes with documented prowess in
more than one sports discipline with extraordinary one-sport
achievers. You had to evaluate people who competed before radio
with people who have Web sites. You had to evaluate men vs. women.
</P>
<P>
   We were specifically instructed to ignore social impact and
concentrate exclusively on the actual achievement in the realm of
sport competition. That was, in the end, impossible. Each of my
first three choices happened to have been men whose auras far
transcended sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   The results we've seen thus far are revealing, if only to
demonstrate why a broad-based panel is essential. What seems like
the very definition of logical thought to one person who deeply
loves sport is quite often beyond the grasp of another. Forgetting
the horse for a minute, the single-most incomprehensible rating for
me was Bill Russell coming in at No. 18. My mind cannot grasp the
conceivable thought process of anyone who would leave him out of
any such Top 10. Then again, I wouldn't have voted for Bo Jackson
in my top 200, but Dick Schaap, who, I can assure you, is a
brilliant man, had him at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   I knew from the start that hockey players would be unfairly
treated, just because. Bobby Orr at 31? All I can say is, ``Lord,
forgive them; they know not what they do.'' I suspect I had Orr
higher than any other voter (No. 8), and I likewise suspect no
other voter had as many hockey players (five) among their 50. And
they say I'm a basketball guy only . . .
</P>
<P>
   My own biggest goofs? (1) Jackie Robinson at 26. Dumb! Here I am
always going around pointing out to people that baseball was this
man's fourth-best sport (behind football, track and field, and
basketball), and then I stick him in the 20s? Mea culpa, mea culpa,
mea maxima culpa. (2) I should have had Babe Didrikson,
unquestionably the greatest female athlete of them all, somewhere
between 10 and 15, instead of at No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   My smugly proudest pick? Al Oerter at 49. This amazing man won
consecutive discus gold medals in Melbourne, Rome, Tokyo, and
Mexico City. In none was he the favorite. In each he set a personal
best. He deserves to be commemorated in such a list.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, my final four happen to be the Final Four.
On Friday night we discovered that Jim Brown was No. 4 and Muhammad
Ali was No. 3. Sunday we will learn who is No. 2 and who is No. 1,
between Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan. At this moment, the only two
people in the world who know which is which are Shapiro and ESPN
Magazine editor John Walsh. That's kinda cool.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was The Babe, and it was an easy call. Baseball was
America's sport of choice for more years this century than anything
else, and Babe Ruth was unquestionably the greatest player (Hall of
Fame pitcher turned nonpareil slugger). Plus, he was an outsized
personality whose fame really was worldwide, a much harder
achievement in an era of limited communication than it was for Ali
or Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro might have made a serious career error. ``The fact is I
will never have the opportunity to cover this much ground, in this
much depth, in any project I will ever again be associated with,''
he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Life is tough when you peak at 29. But at least he can go to his
grave knowing that, unlike Kornheiser, he didn't vote for a horse.

DREAM SEASON FOR BEAMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How long ago was it now? Seven seasons? Seems like another
lifetime to Frank Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, no one was talking about Coach of the Year. No one
was mentioning multimillion-dollar contracts with annuities that
could set up his family for life.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Virginia Tech was a little school that couldn't and
most people didn't care. Hot coach? Well, if you consider a 20-40-2
record over six seasons ``hot'' then you probably think the weather
in Fargo in January is mild.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the 2-8-1 mark posted by the Hokies in 1992 after
a 2-1 start, you can see why lots of people wanted to pay for
Beamer's bus ticket out of Blacksburg, Va., rather than do anything
to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer laughs about those days now. Just like Bobby Bowden
laughs about the times he was hanged in effigy when he was a young,
relatively unknown coach at West Virginia 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now Beamer wears the smile of a man who does have a
million-dollar annuity he can collect if he is still the coach at
Tech in 2005, with the security of a coach who will earn a
compensation package worth more than $500,000 this season and
probably more next when Beamer and Tech athletic director Jim
Weaver work out an even more lucrative package.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer can laugh with the confidence of a man whose team is
going to play for the national championship Jan. 4, when the
undefeated and second-ranked Hokies of Virginia Tech clash with
undefeated and No. 1 Florida State in the Sugar Bowl for the Bowl
Championship Series title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an unbelievable year,'' said Beamer last week as he
started preparations for the final phase of Tech's dream season.
``But we have to stay focused. We still have a job to do. We can't
lose sight of that. But it has kind of fallen into place. There
were days when I'm sure a lot of people wondered if this were
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer as much as anyone knows about that. He has been coaching
at his alma mater for 13 seasons. He saw the bad times when he came
home after a stint at Murray State. He knows that it took seven
hard years just to get respectable. He has had to do some tough
things, such as firing half of his coaching staff after the 1992
crash, while wondering if the vote of confidence the administration
and former Tech athletic director Dave Braine gave him was really
backed by conviction.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1992 debacle, Tech started climbing, up the ladder of
the Big East, up the ladder of the national polls. Since 1993, Tech
has gone 64-19. The Sugar Bowl will mark Tech's seventh consecutive
bowl appearance, something only six other schools have achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer had chances to leave. Nine years ago, Boston College made
a hard run at him. Former Eagles athletic director Chet Gladchuk,
looking for a replacement for Jack Bicknell, wanted Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk wined and dined Beamer and his wife, Cheryl.
</P>
<P>
   This was heady stuff for Beamer, who had a modest 12-9-1 record
at Tech at the time. The money was better, the package better, and
BC was in the Big East, which Tech was not at the time. It was the
big time. But Beamer had roots at Tech. In Virginia. He was a
little bit of country, and BC, despite its oasislike setting in
Chestnut Hill, was a lot of city.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you have to understand about Beamer. There's
ambition, but not blinding ambition. He grew up in a place called
Fancy Gap, an hour south of Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was the oldest of Herma and Raymond Beamer's four
children. Even now, after all these years, Frank is still ``Frank''
to the folks back in Fancy Gap. Herma's 82 now, and proud as could
be of her son. ``I just think he has a wonderful group of boys now
and some wonderful coaches,'' Herma told the Richmond
Times-Dispatch. ``He's done well for the state of Virginia and for
Virginia Tech and for Carroll County. I can't go anywhere without
someone talking about Frank and how proud they are of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more so considering that a childhood accident that nearly
killed him has left scars that are noticeable to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1954, when Beamer was 7, he was burning some trash on
the family farm when a push broom he had been using got too close
to a can of gasoline. The smoldering handle ignited the gasoline
and the explosion engulfed Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother pulled Beamer from the flames and rolled him
in the dirt. Beamer had major burns on his upper body and face,
which required 30 operations over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer said he felt sorry for himself at first, but Herma and
Raymond wouldn't allow that to last too long. Other people had it
worse than you, they told him. Feel sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was only 5 foot 9 inches and 170 pounds, Beamer
turned into a pretty fair quarterback at Hillsville High. He came
to Virginia Tech and switched to defense, where he was a three-year
starter as a defensive back. When he returned in 1987 as head
coach, Tech was the school he knew as a player. Small, remote, with
not a lot of big ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It might have stayed that way if the calls to fire Beamer had
been answered in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wanted to fire Frank,'' said Braine, who is
now the athletic director at Georgia Tech. ``But I didn't think
Frank was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some financial problems facing the school, the
administration backed Beamer with more funding.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer also was told to make staff changes, a move that's most
often the final step before a head coach is dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer always has been driven by a sense of loyalty, but his
instinct for survival was greater. To this day, Beamer says those
changes ``were the toughest thing I've done as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Beamer felt the 2-8-1 season could have been
7-3-1, with the Hokies losing the lead and the game in the fourth
quarter of five of those losses.
</P>
<P>
   Changes, karma, coaches, whatever, Tech suddenly jumped to 8-3
in 1993 and went to the Independence Bowl, where it rolled over
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, it has been bowling season. And not just the
minor bowls. The Hokies already have been to the Sugar and Orange
bowls, again a hard-to-fathom occurrence for longtime Tech fans.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the rise was the formation of the Big East football
conference in 1991. As a member, Tech gained credibility and an
eventual spot in a BCS game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, both Clemson and South Carolina made runs at Beamer.
Last month, there was talk that LSU might be interested.
</P>
<P>
   But Beamer is where he wants to be. He feels that Tech, like
Florida State, can compete with anyone. Scheduling has been a
problem because the Hokies have not played the best of the best,
with this year's nonconference games against Alabama-Birmingham and
Division 1-AA James Madison as prime examples.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hokies are slowly changing their image. Beamer says this
is what he envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I was named coach here, I talked about winning a
national championship,'' said Beamer, conceding at the time it was
much more of a dream than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is one game, one victory away.

ROCKER SPITS IN FACE OF GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was only a few weeks ago that I found myself sitting
as a visiting journalist in the office of Atlanta Mayor Bill
Campbell. The subject was ``affirmative action.'' Not once did
anyone mention the name John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   But now we hear it every day, and that is sad. One can pity a
fool who makes a mistake and vows to never do it again. One can
only be angry at a man who spits out offensive comments that come
down on so many that he could apologize until he's blue in the face
and still not come across as someone who understands what the fuss
is all about. Well, maybe he should listen to a few things.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts come not just from a black person associated with
Major League Baseball for more than 40 years. His remarks fly in
the face of a new era of world participation in the Grand Old Game.
A fine would be too little. And players rarely are suspended or
reprimanded by their clubs for making inappropriate comments.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate trade would also be a mistake. In these times,
players who are tarnished yet talented grow in value with every
offense. Like Lawrence Phillips in football, Rocker is worth a lot
of money. I wouldn't give you 2 cents for him. But somebody will.
Rocker had 33 saves last year and was a key for the Braves reaching
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, I hadn't even read the article in Sports
Illustrated in which Rocker becomes the most famous racist from the
state of Georgia since Ty Cobb. There are a lot of John Rockers out
there. Cobb was a beauty, too, and perhaps the comparison fits.
Flying spikes and a razor tongue that didn't hesitate to spit out
the ``N'' word were his specialty. Away from baseball, he was just
another miserable human being who had no idea what it meant for a
man of limited education and no people skills to be part of the
great game of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he's in the baseball Hall of Fame. The world was
different when Cobb played and there was no Jackie Robinson or
Henry Aaron to refute his racist comments. There was no Al Campanis
to publicly remind us of the low esteem in which blacks were held
by the Ol' Guard who ran the game in the 1950s-70s. There weren't
enough men like Wendell Smith or Sam Lacy, both sports editors of
black newspapers of the time. Blacks back then never took Cobb
personally. Rocker might not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   If you run into John Rocker, you are allowed to tell him that
you disagree with his remarks in SI. His hatred for New York fans
and the thought of playing there are not grounds for damnation. Any
Red Sox fan can understand that part of it. But you have to draw
the line when he says he wouldn't play for a New York team because
he didn't want to ride the train to Yankee Stadium and sit next to
some ``queer with AIDS.'' It is a vicious thing to say about people
who, through no fault of their own, have had their lives affected,
no shortened, by a devastating medical problem. Sorry, you're out
of bounds, John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   I can say that with some conviction. I made the same mistake in
my comments about AIDS after Magic Johnson made his announcement. I
wrote that I knew the man personally and was not surprised because
of his lifestyle. That was wrong to say. I had, by inference,
placed AIDS and sexual behavior on the same plane. I should have
written about the courage of a man who, in a simple statement, had
turned his life around and become a leader in a field that
desperately needed one. The people who called me aren't ever going
to forgive me for my insensitivity. They certainly won't think well
of John Shocker. I understand.
</P>
<P>
   And I feel the same way about his remarks bashing immigrants.
``I'm not a fan of foreigners,'' Rocker said after naming a half
dozen of them. ``How the hell did they get into this country?'' He
called a black teammate a ``fat monkey.'' I wonder what boat his
ancestors took across the Atlantic? But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   Knocking blacks, Hispanics, Russians, and Japanese is just
reaffirmation that Rocker has no clue as to the struggles that took
place in baseball and in this country. It is the dollars that they
spend that allow him to have a comfortable lifestyle. I have paid
all my life. I expect the best out of every professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, I went to Comiskey Park and watched the White
Sox from a bleacher section called ``Watermelon Hill.'' In 1970, I
returned to the park after a 20-year absence and sat in the press
box for the first time. John Rocker should know about ``fat
monkeys'' like me. Just before he came to the majors, I saw Hall of
Famer Satchel Paige in the Negro League All-Star Game from the same
seat at Comiskey. I was watching the best pitcher who ever lived.
Nobody is going to ever say that about John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose nobody bothered to tell you about baseball's push for
diversity which, since 1975, has swelled minority participation to
21 percent, according to the commissioner's office. I'm not just
talking about blacks. Yes, they were the ones who saved the game
from extinction after World War II. But there were only 16 teams
then and owners had the reserve clause on their side to control the
ebb and flow of all minorities. Blacks and Hispanics were still not
seen as part of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But they are now in a ``sport'' where the net worth is counted
in billions of dollars. The number of baseball millionaires goes up
each year. The demand for foreign players has skyrocketed steadily,
first from Latin America and now from Japan and Korea. How in the
hell did they get into this country? We begged them to come, that's
how. They're helping us rebuild stadiums and entire communities.
Two years of Pedro Martinez in Boston have done more for relations
between the city and the Dominican Republic than you could buy for
a million dollars. Are you listening, John Rocker?
</P>
<P>
   All of this is to say that baseball has become an international
environment stressing cooperation and team work. It should not
surprise anyone that Rocker is getting no support from the Braves.
There is a war against intolerance going on in Atlanta and those on
the front line can get along very well without the likes of Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   I respect the word of Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. We were
in Japan in 1998 with some touring major league All-Stars. He saw
the wave of international approval from their fans and the effect
it can have on players. If he is not careful, Rocker will lose even
a chance to go there and find out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his teammates might punch him out,'' Mazzone said.
``Something's going to go wrong now with his career. And you watch
it, it'll end up going straight down the tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   No chance, Leo. This is America.

ANDERSON MAKING THOSE AROUND HIM BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ With the first consecutive double doubles
recorded on his 1999-2000 resume last week, Kenny Anderson hopes to
maintain that consistency as the Celtics go west for three games,
starting Sunday afternoon at the Staples Center, home of the Los
Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran point guard clicked for 21 points and 10 assists in
the Celtics' 99-90 loss last Monday against the Lakers and followed
that with 13 points and 10 more assists in Boston's 98-81 blowout
of the Hawks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are making the shots, so they're helping me out, too,''
said Anderson after practice Friday at HealthPoint. ``Guys are
spacing the court out and doing well in transition and we've been
finishing our plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is basically simple. At times, we all as players,
including myself, can make it difficult. If the man is open, hit
him with the pass. If not, take your shot. Part of the definition
of a point guard is to make your teammates around you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players who should be involved in the mix as the road trip
progresses are Danny Fortson and Paul Pierce. It will be part of
Anderson's task to help ease them back into the offense. Fortson
(stress fracture) will likely see action Sunday. Pierce (ankle) is
taking it day to day; there's a possibility he'll be activated
before the West Coast swing comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny has a nice jumper in the lane and he's a big bruiser,
but I don't think he's worried about points,'' said Anderson. ``His
main goal is to play tough defense and rebound and the other parts
of his game will come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has shot at a .515 clip (35 for 68) in his last
five games, said his role as catalyst and playmaker takes
precedence over trying to get 20 or 30 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine (Walker) and Paul (Pierce) are the two guys who put up
the shots,'' Anderson said, ``and if their point guard is putting
up a lot of shots, that just creates too much confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main thing is to get everybody involved and if my shot is
there, take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting out to a big lead against Atlanta _ and keeping it _ was
a step in the right direction for the Celtics, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was definitely an important game, especially before
hitting the road. We need to learn how to maintain second-half
leads, especially on the road,'' he said. ``We need to get tough if
we want to be a playoff team, and to be a playoff team, you need to
win on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hopes the good karma from giving the Lakers a battle to
the end and then dominating the Hawks at home _ plus having Fortson
and Pierce back _ will change the team's fortunes away from the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a win and got off the (losing streak) slide,'' he said.
``But lately, our problem has been that we cannot close the door in
the fourth quarter. These games coming up are definitely winnable.
We just need to show up for all four quarters. The Clippers
(Sunday), Sacramento (Tuesday), and Denver (Thursday) are all
playing well. We are going to need to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino, who will play Pierce sparingly after
he is activated, said Pierce and Fortson should be back in the flow
by Jan. 3. ``They'll get filtered in and get some minutes, but I
expect they'll be into the offense and defense by that date,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he's not counting any W's in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like we did against Atlanta, we can beat anybody,
the way we passed and distributed the ball and played defense,'' he
said. ``The Clippers have a lot of offensive firepower, and
transition defense will be a key for us. When we pass, we can be an
excellent team. We took one bad shot the entire game against
Atlanta and that's almost unheard of. Antoine's passing out of the
post and Kenny's distributing on the perimeter were big factors.''

NO REST FOR CELTICS OUT WEST 
</HEADLINE>

   The Celtics are in Los Angeles Sunday. That means, on the
surface, they have a 50-50 chance of leaving the City of Angels
with a much-needed road win.
</P>
<P>
   They lucked out. They got the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Day-After-Christmas Clipper mashing was a Celtic
staple in the 1980s. They'd get on a plane on Christmas and take
out their fury the next night on the hapless Clips. Clippers owner
Donald Sterling would be watching at courtside with a lovely
companion, remarking how much he admires the Celtics and Red
Auerbach and hopes one day to be like them.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed a bit. The Clippers are still the Clippers,
sort of, but the Celtics are sporting a nine-game road losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game will be the first of three straight Western
Conference roadies for Rick Pitino's boys. They'll also play at
Sacramento Tuesday (on TNT) and then finish in Denver Thursday. If
they haven't gotten a road win by then, well, it won't happen in
Denver. Their best chance will come with Sunday afternoon's game at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino could well have his full roster for the first time. Danny
Fortson has been activated, a little ahead of schedule. Paul Pierce
is sure to follow. All three opponents have been battling injuries.
All in all, it should not be an overly grueling, demanding ordeal.
The Celtics could even win all three. Then again . . .
</P>
<P>
   LA CLIPPERS (Sunday): This game will be worth watching if for no
other reason than to see Lamar Odom, who is the consensus leader in
the Rookie of the Year race. He is making a few teams look dumb in
passing him over _ the Bulls come to mind _ and has done what
hardly anyone has been able to do in quite some time: make the
Clippers viewable. And, the Clippers have won eight games,
including the last two with former Salem State head man Jimmy Todd
at the reins. (Chris Ford is out with back spasms.) On the surface,
it looks like the Celtics should get this one. But they also should
have won in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Houston. And the Clippers
are fresh off a home killing of the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has won five of the last seven meetings between these
titans. But the Clippers of 1999-2000 have a decent front line
(when healthy), and Derek Anderson leads them in scoring. They
won't be pushovers; they've got only three fewer victories than the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO (Tuesday): The Kings are now the darlings of the
networks with Jason Williams and Chris Webber.Too bad they're not
the darlings of the division. They also have slowed down a mite
after a fabulous start, which featured a lot of games in ARCO
Arena. They are tough at home (9-2), and this one will be a
nationally televised affair. The Celtics dropped a close one here
last season and are 0-2 in the California capital in Pitino's
reign. The Celtics have a chance in this one for one simple reason:
The Kings don't defend very well. (Neither do the Celtics, for that
matter.) But Sacramento is one of a handful of teams (eight,
actually) allowing more than 100 points a game, while its shooting
has been awful (43 percent) most of the season. The Kings also have
been in a bit of a rut lately, including Thursday's loss to the
Clippers at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (Thursday): Think the Nuggets will be after a little
payback? Denver easily is the surprise team of the West and already
has won more games than the horrible team of two years ago. They
have victories over the Lakers, Knicks, and, most recently, the
Spurs and Trail Blazers, back to back. (They also lost to Vancouver
on Thursday.) Antonio McDyess is finally getting his health back
(he was bothered by an ankle sprain) and Denver has been tough at
its new home, the Pepsi Center (10-3). They won't have much trouble
remembering the flogging they got in Boston Dec. 8. The final was
115-90 and Ron Mercer, in particular, will be looking for a better
showing. He can't do much worse. He was 1 of 6 and Pierce blocked
his first two shots. This one also will mark Fortson's first game
against his ex-mates. Chauncey Billups, meanwhile, won't play again
this season. He will have surgery Monday to fix his dislocated left
shoulder.

   Six months ago, the president of the Philadelphia 76ers, Pat
Croce, began what was to have been an ocean-to-ocean motorcycle
trip. He never made it out of Philly. While waiting out a
rainstorm, one of the motorcycles in Croce's group skidded into
Croce's left leg and, well, he'll tell the rest. ``I'm in the
middle of the street and I see my boot is off. So I pick it up and
what's inside? My foot. It was hanging there, with only my
Achilles' tendon holding it together.'' He was taken to the
hospital _ ``Thank God it happened where it did,'' he said _ where
he had to sign a release approving the amputation of the foot. It
never came to that. Since that day, Croce has had four operations _
a fifth was postponed at the last moment _ and only recently has he
started taking what he calls ``baby steps'' around his house. He's
still on crutches and there's no timetable on when, or if, he'll
regain the full use of the limb. ``It's in the hands of the Great
Man Upstairs,'' he said. ``But I think he's smiling. I just want to
be able to walk on the beach this summer.'' The word irrepressible
doesn't even begin to describe Croce. ``You realize that life is so
fragile,'' he said. ``In one three-week time frame, I went from
being Jimmy Cagney, on top of the world after we beat Orlando, to
lying down there in that street.'' He's also come to realize how
his indomitable spirit has touched others. When word of his
accident hit the public, the hospital switchboard had to be closed
due to the number of phone calls. Fans and friends dressed up like
doctors to get in to see him. Now, he gets mail from people he
doesn't know who heard about his plight and have a sad tale of
their own. He calls them up out of the blue. ``I even got a call
from a guy in Boston.'' He adds, ``I'm doing great. These last two
weeks are the best I've felt since the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are you wondering, like a lot of us are, why Shaquille O'Neal is
suddenly playing the way he should have been playing all those
years ago? Namely, that he's rebounding. And blocking shots. Well,
Brian Shaw, his former teammate in Orlando and his current teammate
with the Lakers, thinks he has the answer: coaching. ``He has
matured a lot and he has accepted coaching much better,'' Shaw said
of O'Neal. ``Before, he was just so dominant, it didn't matter what
anyone told him. He just went out and did it his way. The respect
factor with Phil (Jackson) has made a big difference. It's easy to
buy into his system when you see all the success he had with it.''
. . . John Calipari is drawing interest from Memphis University
(formerly Memphis State). There is an interim coach there and
apparently contact has been made between Cal and the school. It's
an interesting situation for Calipari. Memphis plays in a
competitive conference (USA) with the likes of Cincinnati and
Louisville. It's literally the only game in town, and the team
plays in a modern, 21,000-seat arena. If he won there, Cal would
own the place. The one drawback could be money. Whatever, Cal plans
to stay alongside Larry Brown in Philly for the year . . . Alert
reader Jim Carvin of North Easton picked up an astonishingly
egregious omission in the Globe's top 100 athlete series: Bill
Sharman. Especially when you consider that Dennis Johnson, Tom
Heinsohn, Reggie Lewis, and KC Jones made it. Sharman not only is a
Hall of Famer, but, unlike DJ, Heinsohn, Jones, he was a member of
both the NBA's 25th and 50th anniversary teams. That's right. He
was named one of the 50 greatest players of all time in the NBA,
yet he didn't crack the Globe's top 100. For some unexplained
reason, Sharman tends to slip through the cracks when the topic
turns to great Celtics. Maybe it's a subconscious thing because he
spent all those years with the Lakers. But there's no way Sharman
shouldn't be in there as no worse than the ninth-best Celtic after
Bill Russell, Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Sam Jones,
Kevin McHale, Dave Cowens, and Robert Parish . . . And while we're
on the topic, where was Richie Hebner?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We've now got six high schoolers who could likely crack the
first round of the 2000 NBA draft if they came out en masse.
(That's a real encouraging thought.) We've already noted three of
them: Eddie Griffin of Philadelphia Roman Catholic (committed to
Seton Hall), Gerald Wallace of Childersburg, Ala. (committed to
Alabama); and Darius Miles of East St. Louis, Ill. (committed to
St. John's). We can now add DeShawn Stevenson of Fresno, Calif.,
Washington Union (committed to Kansas); Jerome ``Buddy'' Harper,
who has bounced around from high school to high school, but who has
signed with Cincinnati; and Alton Ford, a banger from Houston Milby
who has committed to Clyde Drexler's University of Houston Cougars.
No NBA official can comment on the record about these lads, but the
word is that Griffin, Wallace, and Miles all could go in the top 15
if they came out . . . Billups, meanwhile, couldn't have picked a
worse time to have surgery. He has gone downhill in most everyone's
view since being taken No. 3 in the 1997 draft. But he also has
shown there's a place for him in the league. Still, to have
season-ending surgery in your free agent year is not good timing.
``I just wanted to be healthy,'' he said. ``It was a tough
decision. I wanted to tough it out. But at the same time, it gets
looser every time.'' What this means for Billups is no long-term
extension. He'll probably re-up for a couple years until he shows
he can play again . . . Speaking of short-term re-upping, that's
the likely path Tim Duncan will follow if he decides to stay in San
Antonio. He would be foolish to sign a seven-year extension with
the Spurs, because 90 percent of the team will be in rest homes
when that deal expires. Look for him to sign for two or three years
unless he bolts for Orlando. That would enable him to ride into the
South Texas sunset with David Robinson, Avery Johnson, and the
other San Antonio graybeards . . . Allen Iverson and Brown had yet
another dust-up this past week. Here's one of Iverson's comments on
the brouhaha. ``It'll never happen again, man. I owe myself an
apology for putting myself in this situation.'' . . . Miami won a
big game Wednesday night at home over the Jazz, despite not having
either Tim Hardaway or Jamal Mashburn. Hardaway missed his 14th
straight game due to a jammed knee, while Mashburn was out with a
bum ankle . . . Tuesday night's game against Minnesota will be the
Heat's final game in Miami Arena . . . Speaking of the
Timberwolves, they got their first victory ever in Chicago
Wednesday night. They won by 20. ``For all the years that they
freakin' destroyed people, it's payback time,'' said Sam Mitchell.
``If you can't beat 'em by 50, by God, beat 'em by 60. They're
gonna get drilled.'' Everybody is piling on Chicago, which is on a
seven-win pace for the season, or two games behind the all-time
worst NBA team, the 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers from 1972-73.

PIRATES RECLAIM HIDDEN TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAGUE NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Whether it was winning a championship in their initial
season, developing future NHL players, or attracting a dedicated
fan base, the Portland Pirates knew little but success in their
first half-decade in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Until last season. The Pirates skidded to last place in the
Atlantic Division with the AHL's second-worst record and no
postseason berth for the first time since entering the league.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, order has been restored in Maine's largest
city. With more than a third of the AHL season in the books, the
Portland Pirates and their three AHL All-Star selections are the
first-place team in the New England Division.
</P>
<P>
   With players like Byron Dafoe, Olaf Kolzig, Jason Allison,
Sergei Gonchar, Brendan Witt, Anson Carter, and Andrew Brunette at
one time wearing Pirate black and red, it's not surprising that,
along with its Calder Cup victory, Portland went to the finals
another season while leading the AHL in sellouts two years running.
After five straight postseason appearances, a playoff berth had
become a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But last season's 23-48-2-7 disaster and drop in attendance
jolted the Pirates and parent club Washington into revitalizing the
team. But unlike some who turn around their fortunes by adding
fresh talent and a new coach, the Pirates expanded on that formula
by reacquiring former key players they had let slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1 was hiring Glen Hanlon to his first head coaching job
after five seasons as an assistant with the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Then the International Hockey League yielded three key players
from years past. Center Jeff Nelson, a member of the Pirates'
Calder Cup team, and Brown's Ryan Mulhern, who had been a steady
contributor for two seasons, were plucked out of the International
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brochu, who was loaned to the ``I'' last season and wound
up being sidelined by injury, also became a full-time Pirate again.
His presence helped stabilize a shaky goaltending situation, which
allowed the fourth-most goals in the league last year, and he's
also aided in the development of prospect Sebastian Charpentier.
Brochu (14-7-5, 2.18 goals-against average) was named to start for
the Canadian team in next month's AHL All-Star Game in Rochester,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters like left wings Alexandre Volchkov, Washington's No.
1 draft choice in 1996 and an All-Star starter, and Miika Elomo
(another All-Star selection) have blended with veterans such as
high-scoring Glen Metropolit, former Bruins defenseman Jamie
Huscroft, defensemen Steve Poapst and center Kent Hulst, the latter
two joining Nelson as original Pirates. The mix has enabled the
Pirates to go 16-11-7; last season, Portland didn't earn its 16th
win until Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit on a smaller scale, the Pirates are mirroring the
Providence Bruins' record-setting revival of last season. Like
Portland, the Bruins were a last-place team before an infusion of
new talent and a new coach helped them rise to the top of the AHL,
though the Pirates (nor anyone else) will come close to
Providence's record of a year ago (56-16-4-4).
</P>
<P>
   But that won't stop the rest of the New England Division from
trying. Only 13 points separate first from worst _ and only 3
points between first and third _ in by far the league's toughest
and most well-balanced division.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hartford is closest to Portland. The WolfPack's many
minor league veterans, among them goalie Jean-Francois Labbe,
30-year-old left wing Ken Gernander, and right wing Derek
Armstrong, All-Star picks, along with former Bruins draft pick
Daniel Goneau and New Hampshire's Todd Hall, both left wings,
should keep the Pack right in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unrealistic to expect Providence to equal its
supernova of a 1998-99 season, but the days of the Baby B's taking
up the rear of their division are long over.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Providence can thank right wings Chris and Peter
Ferraro and left wing Andre Savage, its All-Star representatives,
in large measure for that. As well, center Tim Lovell, the former
UMass-Amherst center, still is among the team's leading scorers
despite being slowed by a late November shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield and Worcester are likely to be fighting for the last
playoff spot. The Falcons have relied on center Eric Healy of Hull
and Brad Tiley (the AHL's leading scorer from the blue line), their
All-Stars. David Cullen, who played on Maine's NCAA championship
team last season, and Harvard's Sean McCann also have held up their
end defensively. Steven King, a Brown grad who was a key component
of Providence's playoff run last season, has been battling injuries
most of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Among Worcester's top guns are a pair of wings with
Massachusetts ties. Marty Reasoner, Boston College's Hobey Baker
finalist from two years ago, is tied for fourth in the AHL in
scoring (13-20-33) and is an All-Star selection. Worcester native
Jim Campbell remains on loan from St. Louis, while center Ladislav
Nagy, St. Louis's sixth draft choice in 1997 (177th overall), is
the IceCats' other Star. Jamie Thompson, who played collegiately at
Maine, is in his second year with Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not only a geographical curiosity that Lowell is the only
non-Canada-based member of the Atlantic Division, but given that
more Lock Monsters have ties to this area than any New England
Division team, it also is more than a little ironic. More than a
quarter of the Lock Monsters' lineup played college hockey in these
parts, including New Hampshire's Jason Krog, last year's Hobey
Baker winner who was named AHL Rookie of the Month for November on
the strength of 10 points in 11 games and is 4-14-18, fourth on the
team in scoring. The little center also got an NHL call and played
four games with the Islanders, one of Lowell's two parent clubs.
Yale's Ray Giroux, a two-time All-Star selection who also got a
taste of Long Island recently and was named an All-Star for the
second straight season, and Rich Brennan (Boston University) are
two of the team's top defensemen. Up front, left wing Dave Hymovitz
(Boston College) is Lowell's third-leading scorer (9-10-19), and
earlier this month, center Greg Bullock, Hockey East's leading
scorer in 1995, signed with the Lock Monsters after spending a
little over two seasons in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former New England collegians will be sprinkled all over the ice
at the AHL's All-Star Game next month; actually, they're all over
the minors as well. Center Eric Boguniecki, who was Krog's
predecessor as New Hampshire's go-to offensive threat, spent two
seasons predominantly in the IHL and last summer signed with
Florida as a free agent. Originally a sixth-round choice by St.
Louis in 1993 out of Westminster Prep, Boguniecki has developed as
a Top 15 scorer in the AHL (15-14-29) and was selected to start in
the All-Star Game . . . Syracuse's Chris O'Sullivan, ex of BU, was
chosen to start for the second straight year on defense, though
he's currently on recall to Vancouver. Vermont's Martin St. Louis,
who has seen considerable time on left wing in Calgary this season,
nonetheless was chosen to start as a Saint John rep . . . Two more
from BU's seemingly never-empty well, left wing Doug Friedman and
defenseman Jon Coleman, have helped Kentucky to the AHL's best
record (44 points) . . . Rochester (41) isn't far behind, thanks to
leading scorer Jason Cipolla of Yale (10-18-28) . . . Former BC
goalie Scott Lagrand leads the East Coast Hockey League with five
shootout wins for Pensacola . . . Brian Regan, who played four
seasons for UMass-Amherst, leads the United Hockey League in
goals-against average; his 1.89 with the Missouri River Otters is
more than half a goal better than his closest competition . . . It
was a great night for a Gretzky as Brent Gretzky, the Great One's
27-year-old brother, had an 8-point night with Asheville in the UHL
earlier this month. Gretzky has had only two brief stints in the
NHL, none since 1995 . . . Center Mike Omicioli burned up the ECHL
with 21 points in his first dozen games with Hampton Roads,
including a 6-point game, to earn a mid-November recall to
Portland. The rookie out of Providence College is currently on the
injured list . . . The IHL will hold its All-Star Game next month;
the rosters have yet to be announced but the coaches will be Utah's
Bob Bourne and Milwaukee's Al Sims.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concept of road trip was taken to its literal extreme
earlier this month by Providence, which traveled 1,200 miles _ all
via highways and byways _ to play three games in less than 48
hours. The first leg of the long weekend was easy: a trip to
Springfield for a Friday night game. The Baby B's left immediately
afterward on a 234-mile jaunt to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pa., for a
Saturday night game. Then it was off to Hamilton, Ontario, and
another 362 miles on the bus's odometer for a 4 p.m. faceoff the
following day. The longest part of the trip back home, a distance
of 516 miles, was the easiest part to take . . . At least the
Bruins' trip was limited to one weekend. How about Louisville,
which spent a month away from home due to scheduling conflicts at
Freedom Hall? The Panthers played 15 straight games away from home,
and at one point lived in hotels for 20 consecutive days while
logging more than 5,000 travel miles. Remarkably, Louisville went
9-6-0-1 to stay well within range of first place in the
Mid-Atlantic Division . . . Logo of the Week: Despite the Devils'
success, hockey hasn't usually been synonymous with the state of
New Jersey. But if early signs are any indication, the ECHL's
Trenton Titans are helping to change that perception. The Titans
have sold more than 5,000 season tickets and average more than
7,000 fans a game in their new 8,000-seat downtown arena. The
youngsters in the crowd have taken to the team's mascot Clash,
which resembles the figure in the team's logo pictured stepping
over the city's railroad bridge. Given that Trenton was once known
as a center of the steel industry, is it safe to assume that the
opposition will have trouble testing the Titans' mettle?

HEAT IS ON BURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The alarm sounded here early when the Bruins went into
their recent tailspin _ resulting in a grim 2-6-3 after Tuesday's
3-1 loss to the Nashville neophytes _ because that's what we do
here in the shoot-the-messenger business.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not out front, sounding the bell for the disaster in
the making, the boss turns around and asks why you're writing about
Benny Lachanoix's infected bunion when suddenly one day the sky
falls (with a receipt fluttering down from a non-union contractor).
</P>
<P>
   If you are out front, and the thought that, say, the coach could
be fired never comes to fruition, then everyone first enjoys a good
ol' belly laugh at your expense and then accuses you of stirring
the pot just to sell papers (which, if true, would make the
National Enquirer the only paper in the Lower 48).
</P>
<P>
   But believe this: As good a coach as he is, Pat Burns could walk
the plank here in the next few days, no doubt to be replaced by
Providence (AHL) coach Peter Laviolette. That's not to say Burns
will get canned as the Bruins coach. But that's just the way the
business of the Bruins is run. In fact, it's the way virtually
every pro sports franchise is run, with coaches, even proven and
knowledgeable coaches, just part of the hired help _ and often,
just the built-in excuse for myriad bad decisions, be they
financial, personnel, or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to like about Burns as coach, and frankly that's
why he hasn't already been fired. But we remind you: His club
opened with an 0-5-4 record, the Black and Gold's worst start in 35
years. Meld that in with a 2-6-3 stretch, and you have a total of
20 games, a quarter of the season, with a promising club stumbling
along with a .100 winning percentage. A coach without Burns's
proven track record, resume, and guaranteed future earnings (no
small part of the equation) already would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   What's gone wrong here? To a degree, and perhaps most
significantly, it's a coach getting tuned out by his players. If it
can happen to the likes of Al Arbour _ and it did, even after he
won four straight Cups on the Island _ it can happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The players here may be faithful to Burns's words, and repeat
the mantra about ``sticking to the system,'' but there's a huge
difference between reciting the game plan like a bunch of Stepford
Wives and executing the game plan. For much of the last month,
Burns's charges merely have been exercising a walk-through, as if
reading the lines in the school play with opening night three
months down the road. Every coach can expect, even accept, a
handful of nights like those during an 82-game schedule. But the
toll is now up to 20-plus, with not even half the season gone. The
curtain's up, boys, and the audience expects results.
</P>
<P>
   But for a precious few _ the reliable likes of Ray Bourque, Rob
DiMaio, and Don Sweeney _ the Bruins right now are emotionlessly
going through the motions. They don't forecheck. They don't hit.
They manage to move the puck out of their own end _ and that's
become harder than ever _ and chop it through the neutral zone and
usually just fizz out once over the offensive blue line. The team
logo is a 180-foot U-turn. They melt shapelessly into the ice. At
the most rudimentary level, they just don't skate.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's consider the missing pieces from last season when,
admittedly, there were signs of this unfolding when the Bruins were
rubbed out in Round 2 of the playoffs by Buffalo. They dropped
Carolina in Round 1, despite the fact that one of their bona fide
forwards, Dmitri Khristich, pulled the chute well before the finish
of the regular season. It was easily forgotten _ but very telling _
that they won the opener in Round 2 and then barely could get out
of their own way for the remainder of the series, which left club
president/general manager Harry Sinden teeing off on Khristich and
Jason Allison after another failed Cup run.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich is now in Toronto. Tim Taylor is in New York. Grant
Ledyard plays for Ottawa, Dave Ellett for St. Louis, and Ken
Baumgartner is one of Burns's aides de camp. Landon (of the Lost)
Wilson is back in Providence (deservedly so). Ken Belanger can't
stop the buzz in his head (post-concussion syndrome).
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I wouldn't have Khristich, no matter how effective,
on my team. He quit last season. Who needs that? Bring me the heads
of Jay Miller or Bob Sweeney before another Khristich. Heck, give
Anders Brostrom another twirl.
</P>
<P>
   The big losses above are Taylor, Wilson (who floored me with his
postseason performance), and Belanger _ a bona fide tough guy, with
a good shot, decent wheels, and some, shall we say, gumption. Of
the bunch, Taylor was the single biggest loss. He didn't put up
points, but he played with nerve, took two or three shots to numb
various pains before each Buffalo game, and was a reliable faceoff
guy. The front office's indifference toward signing him _ remember,
he got no offer _ sent a disturbing message to the dressing room.
To wit: virtually all of you are interchangeable widgets. But
Taylor was more, much more, and nothing bums out a room full of
widgets than realizing that they are a room full of widgets.
Widgets thrive when they're made to feel important. Taylor's outing
delivered half the room to the doorstep of Lilliput and their games
have shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this is the greatest ongoing rub of all, the fact
that Providence won the Calder Cup, giving Mssrs. Sinden and Mike
O'Connell the confidence to can Taylor, Ellett, Ledyard et al, but
precious few of the proud Baby B's have surfaced in the Hub.
According to the front-office game plan, two or three or four of
those kids should be here now and contributing. But the promise of
youth has turned into the ugly reality of rent-a-wrecks Marty
McSorley and Joe Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Burns's game plan isn't working, and that's truly the players'
fault.
</P>
<P>
   The front-office game plan isn't working, and ultimately that
will be Burns's fault. Count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Burns could be right, and maybe none of these kids can play. But
he might as well be wrong, because Sinden and O'Connell aren't
going to say their game plan failed. If so, they'd be the first two
front-office employees in pro sports ever to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, kids come and go from Providence, but no one sticks,
beyond the bit roles played by Joe Hulbig and Joel Prpic. Cameron
Mann looked like he was turning into something last season; today,
he's agate type in the Hockey News. Burns doesn't believe many of
them can play here and be true contributors. Some he's found to be
OK _ Brandon Smith, Jeff Zehr, to a certain extent Jay Henderson _
only to be miffed when management shovels them back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   If the product stays flat, Sinden and O'Connell will can Burns
and say that they expected better play and better results from the
coach and his team, that they believe the kids in the pipeline can
play big-league hockey, and out with the old and in with the new.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the chance that these kids can cut it here, but
that would be left to Laviolette to prove.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just to provide his players with a refresher course in reality,
Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff ordered the team bus to detour through
Harlem during the Sabres' visit to the Manhattan last week. The
next night, they showed some spark in a 3-1 victory over the
Blueshirts. Keep in mind: The average per annum on any given NHL
bus is about $1.4 million per man . . . Dallas owner Tom Hicks
spent about $1 million for the 175 Stanley Cup rings that were
delivered earlier this month. Not everyone received the the most
expensive copies (est. value: $20,000), which have four Australian
green diamonds, in the shape of a star, as the centerpiece . . .
Ex-Bruins winger Andy Brickley, last seen as Channel 38's colorman
alongside Dave Shea, has partnered twice this season with Fred
Cusick for telecasts of Lowell Lock Monsters (AHL) games. ``I've
enjoyed doing it again,'' said Brickley, who stopped by the Vault
Tuesday morning to take in the Bruins' day-of-game skate. ``In all
modesty, it reminded me that's what I should be doing again, in
some capacity.'' . . . The deal that brought ex-Panther Kirk Muller
back to the game (Dallas) was for a pro-rated $300,000 _ about
$190,000, or less than 10 cents on the dollar compared to the $2
million he made last year. The fact that so many old guys have come
in for relatively short money no doubt will influence what owners
will pay restricted (Group 2) free agents in July. Muller also gets
about $3,500 for any game in which he plays more than 10 minutes .
. . Edmonton recently hired former slick forward Anders Hedberg as
its European pro scout. Hedberg was jockeying for position to
become the Leafs' GM last year, alongside Mike Smith, but
ultimately it was head coach Pat Quinn who added the GM duties.
Smith is now running the Blackhawk makeover . . . The NHL contends
that, league-wide, it is spending 133 percent of its gate receipts
to cover player payroll. That means the cash taken in for every
seat in every building for every game goes directly to the players'
pockets, and then the owners have to cull one-third more from other
revenue streams just to pay the help. If true, this is a league
that needs: (1) a field trip to the Money Store; (2) 29 copies of
``Mathematics for Dummies,'' or (3) some of that creative Bruce
McNall bookkeeping . . . Ex-Bruin Jozef Stumpel, sidelined since
undergoing Nov. 8 hernia surgery, returned to the LA lineup
Wednesday night . . . Bostonian Larry Holden will handle the Uwe
Krupp-Detroit Red Wings arbitration case (no date set yet). Krupp,
signed to a four-year, $16.4 million free agent deal in the summer
of '98, has played only 22 games for the Wings, claiming his back
is too bad to get back on the ice. The Wings turned indignant _ and
then refused to pay _ when Krupp was spotted mushing his huskies,
his long-time passion. Word around the Winged Wheels is that Krupp
finally has provided the Wings with his medical records, what had
been a lingering and contentious issue. The bet here: the Wings, at
best, buy Krupp out at two-thirds the remaining value of the
contract (around $8 million-plus) or Krupp settles for slightly
less rather than risk having Holden void the pact.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word around the rink has it that Ray Bourque could be getting
into the rink-ownership business, just north of the Hub, possibly
in a partnership with the MDC. Steve Freyer, Bourque's longtime
agent and friend, said last week, ``I don't think it's prudent for
me or Ray to be commenting about what his business plans could be.
A key to his success has always been his focus, and right now _
just as he has been for 21 years _ he's focused on making the
Bruins a better team this season.'' . . . Mark Messier will slap
his name on a hockey invention, to be marketed as ``Joe Player.''
The device, which will anchor on the ice or driveway, will collect
a puck or a tennis ball and then pass it back from the direction it
came. Sure beats the days of banging it off the garage door . . .
As many predicted, Dominik Hasek last week began to hint that,
well, you know, he might not retire following this season, after
all. Recovering from a severe groin tear (he is at least two months
from playing), Hasek said a season lost to injury might not be the
footnote on which he wants to end his career. Of course, he did
sign a three-year deal with Louisville before this season began,
and his standing deal in Buffalo would bring him at least $7.5
million for next season and maybe $9 million for 2001-02 . . . The
surprise last week wasn't that the Canucks landed Felix Potvin as
their No. 1 goalie, but rather that they gave up Kevin Weekes as
part of the package to get him. Weekes, once considered the goalie
of Florida's future, came to Vancouver in the Pavel Bure exchange
last season and was touted as Vancouver's goalie of the future. Now
he's Roberto Luongo's understudy/partner on Long Island. The
Canucks also parted with two young forwards, Dave Scratchard and
Bill Muckalt, but they're banking on bringing in Swedish twins
Henrik and Daniel Sedin next season to fill those spots . . . Just
when you'd think the Panthers should be packing the place _ if not
with Bure, then when? _ Wayne Huizenga's sons of Sunrise have seen
attendance drop some 15 percent this season, a dropoff of about
42,000 tickets . . . Last week we told you about the great promise
of Bruins goalie prospect Don Choukalos, the 179th pick in last
June's draft. Wait, there's another promising puckstopper in the
pipeline. Andrew Raycroft, Boston's fourth pick (135th overall) is
having a sensational year for Kingston in the Ontario Hockey
League. He was the league's goalie of the month in November and
posted a 3-0-0 mark for recent player of the week honors. As of the
middle of last week, he led the OHL in save percentage (.930) and
was second in wins (19) . . . Ex-Bruin Willie O'Ree, the first
black to play in the NHL, visited the Vault last week, here for a
taping session with Boston forward Anson Carter. Carter is one of
the black athletes who is the focal point of an upcoming ABC
special featuring black athletes performing in non-traditional
sports _ such as Tiger Woods (golf) and sisters Venus and Serena
Williams (tennis) . . . Boston's second pick in last June's draft,
6-foot-4-inch pivot Matt Zultek, recently underwent knee surgery,
repairing troubles dating back to before his game-winning goal in
last season's Memorial Cup. Bruins scout Bob Tindall reports Zultek
should resume skating soon and will play the remainder of the
season as an over-age (21 years old in March) junior with the
Ottawa 67s . . . Speedskating legend Eric Heiden _ five gold medals
in at the '80 Games _ is now Dr. Heiden and will be the Team USA
physician at the upcoming World Junior championships in Sweden . .
. With a huge assist to good freind Jack Falla, formerly with
Sports Illustrated and now teaching at Boston University, your
faithful correspondent constructed his first backyard rink,
complete with sideboards (no advertising, yet). I don't expect my
son to grow up to be the next Gretzky, and he is only 2 1/2 years
old. But before he disappeared into the neighbor's house for the
duration of the entire construction process, I thought, you know,
he'd look around, take a deep breath, and dwell on what was a
postcard New England moment. Next year, he buys into it or I cut
his ice time. Hey, what else has a coach got? Happy holidays and
skate your lane.

COWHER'S JOB HAS BECOME THE PITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If Pete Carroll feels like a man under
siege, who could blame him?
</P>
<P>
   If he feels ill-treated by some and misunderstood by others,
that is an understandable response to the predicament he finds
himself in this morning, with two games remaining and nothing to
play for but pride and perhaps his job. But before he wastes much
time feeling blue, Carroll should pick up his phone and call Bill
Cowher down in Pittsburgh. There's a man under siege.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Cowher has been the subject of public ridicule for
the nonperformance of his team, which comes with the territory and
the $2 million-a-year salary he receives. But he's also faced
things Carroll is not, including a rumor campaign against him and
not-so-private whispers about the real reason for his allegedly
impending departure from the Steelers' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher's work habits have been questioned. Fine, part of the
deal. His response to the new contract he landed a couple of
seasons ago has been questioned. Fine, comes with the money,
especially if losing follows it. He has been alleged to be taking
over the North Carolina State program, where he and his wife met
and were varsity athletes. OK, those kind of rumors are part of the
deal if you coach for a living and things turn sour where you are.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Carroll, Cowher also has been dealt a hand from the
bottom of the deck. A dirty little hand whether any of it is true
or not. It's the kind of hand no coach _ good or bad _ and no
coach's family _ sundered or secure _ deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Things became so bad in Pittsburgh recently that some
extraordinary measures have been taken by Cowher and his family to
try to quell a flame of unsubstantiated rumor that seemed about to
consume him, despite his having led the Steelers to the playoffs
six times in the past eight years, including two trips to the AFC
championship game and one to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the streets of Pittsburgh, which is still a small
town in many ways, rumors have run rampant that Cowher was leaving
at the behest of his wife after committing an act of infidelity.
The charges have appeared on the Internet and been well discussed
on the corners, in the steel mills, and at the bars that are
staples of life in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   With three daughters (age 13, 12, and 8) and a wife of 16 years
who once was a professional basketball player but now works with
fourth-graders as a volunteer basketball coach, it was the kind of
charge that spreads like wildfire and hurts like tacks in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough the whispers were in print and on the lips of
Steeler fans, some in less than flattering ways. As the Steelers
continued to lose, the whispers only grew louder until Kaye Cowher
finally took the extraordinary step of denying them last Sunday in
the pages of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband being attacked for calling the wrong plays goes
with the territory, but it has crossed the line,'' she said, while
saying there was ``absolutely no truth'' to the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kaye Cowher is Tammy Wynette standing by her man or
whether the father of her three daughters has been falsely accused
is irrelevant. What is relevant is that this should not be
happening to Cowher or anybody else and that it should give all of
us in the sports journalism business reason to pause.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher went well beyond what seems necessary to stall these
rumors when he reportedly told a member of the Pittsburgh media
that he could not have fathered a child out of wedlock, as some
were whispering, because he underwent a vasectomy. What on Earth
does that have to do with the problems of the Steelers' offense?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, if Cowher were an adulterer whose team was going to the
Super Bowl, it wouldn't even be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is Cowher's Steelers are not going to the playoffs for
the second straight year. They have a major problem at quarterback,
where millions are tied up in Kordell Stewart at a time when he's
doing more for the team by catching the ball than throwing it. They
have won only five games and for the first time in 50 years have
not placed a single player on the Pro Bowl team _ unless you
include the five ex-Steelers who are there.
</P>
<P>
   So there might be ample reason to speculate about the future of
Cowher and no shortage of things to criticize him about in
Pittsburgh, but one of them is not what he may or may not be doing
in his free time unless the cops or the courts are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are and yet last week both he and his wife found
themselves denying rumors about the most private part of their
lives on the most public of stages. That Cowher's future in
Pittsburgh has been questioned by some is understandable because
his team is near the end of its second straight losing season and
has lost six in a row after a 5-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   On that score it is no different than Carroll's situation,
although his team is 7-7 and a juggernaut by comparison after
making the playoffs the first two years he was in charge before
stumbling this season. Yet Carroll has faced nothing but doubts
about his ability to be a head coach, which is a legitimate area of
debate when things don't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   What is not is the debate Bill and Kaye Cowher have found
themselves the subject of the past few weeks. Monday, Cowher again
tried to defuse the matter by announcing at a press conference that
he was not going to North Carolina State and never was, a statement
he made only after his wife and the team's communications director
told him he had not clarified the growing rumors of his departure
when asked about them at an earlier press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to call an impromptu press briefing 30 minutes after
his first one ended and apologized for being vague in the past and
reiterating that he was staying in the town of his birth to coach
the team he once rooted for. He promised to stay through the end of
his contract, which runs out in 2002, and said he hoped to bring
the Steelers back to playoff prominence.
</P>
<P>
   After what he and his wife have been through, it would be great
if he did. And frankly, after what Carroll's been through in New
England, he should thank his lucky stars the only ghost chasing him
has been Bill Parcells.
</P>

   Willie McGinest read teammates the riot act after last Sunday's
loss in Philadelphia. In an expletive-laced tirade, McGinest
accused many of his younger teammates of being ``party animals''
who didn't understand what it takes to win in the NFL. Clearly
distraught after the 24-9 debacle against the lowly Eagles,
McGinest lingered a long time alone on the visitors' bench before
he finally walked back to the locker room at Veterans Stadium.
After he got in there, McGinest went wild, aiming a goodly portion
of his high-decibel criticism at the receiving corps, many of whom
who were out at a local nightclub the night before the trip to
Philadelphia. No one rose to dispute him. By the time the press was
admitted, all was quiet and McGinest would only say, ``I'm tired of
(expletive) losing,'' when asked about his emotions . . . Things
went from bad to worse with the Saints this week after All-Draft
pick Ricky Williams was late for Sunday's game in Baltimore after
missing both team buses and then failed to show for practice
Tuesday. Williams rode to last Sunday's game in a police squad car
sent to the team hotel to fetch him by the Saints. After not
playing for the fourth straight week because of a turf toe problem,
he spent more than 20 minutes curled on the floor of his locker in
street clothes after the 31-8 loss. Tuesday Williams missed
practice, but showed up later at the team's facility and met with
Mike Ditka, who was less than understanding privately. Williams's
response to this latest pickle was to announce Wednesday that he
would no longer talk to the media the rest of the year, forgetting
that not a one of them has tackled him this season. On his weekly
radio show Tuesday, Ditka chastised Williams's mental and physical
conditioning and even criticized the rookie's odd habit of
conducting all press interviews while wearing his helmet . . . One
thing Williams might be mad about is the incentive-laden contract
he signed. While he's failed to hit any of his incentives, Edgerrin
James has made millions in Indianapolis with his startling rookie
season. James was the surprise pick ahead of Williams as the first
back taken in April. After reaching the 1,400-yard rushing plateau
last Sunday, he reached each of his three-tiered bonus. That
brought James's earnings to $14.8 million this season (including
his signing bonus), the most by a rookie. Williams, meanwhile, got
an $8.1 million signing bonus, but he ended up playing for the
minimum salary because he had to rush for 1,600 yards for his
incentives to kick in . . . Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman gave his
11 linemen gas grills, a box of steaks, and a champagne basket for
Christmas. Wonder what Drew Bledsoe gave his? Voodoo dolls? . . .
Perhaps trying to fire a pre-empetive salvo, 49ers general manager
Bill Walsh publicly said this week he intended to be back running
the beleaguered franchise next year. Walsh's public remarks came on
the heels of growing speculation about a power struggle between
Walsh and head coach Steve Mariucci that Walsh was losing. Walsh
denied that but acknowledged he has a meeting scheduled Monday with
club vice president John York to discuss the future. Two weeks ago
there was public speculation that Mariucci was urging the hiring of
Fox Sports analyst Matt Millen, who is a friend, as the club's
general manager. Last year, Lions owner Bill Ford nearly brought
him in to serve as Detroit's general manager, but head coach Bobby
Ross threatened to quit if the move was made. Walsh's wife, Geri,
has had health problems this year, and that could become an excuse
for Walsh's early departure if things do not work out as he hopes.

   Cincinnati owner Mike Brown doesn't often make sense these days
when it comes to how pro football should run, except when the
question is about profit margin, but he made some sense this week.
Brown is a member of the league's competition committee and he had
a perfect solution to avoid a repeat of the eye injury from a
thrown official's flag that led Cleveland tackle Orlando Brown to
charge referee Jeff Triplette and push him to the ground last
Sunday: Don't throw the flag at the players. ``That's obvious,
isn't it?'' Brown said. Well, yeah. What will be more interesting
though is what the league has to say to the Bengals' owner about
his further remarks: ``In our league, the officials may be blind,
but they're also sacrosanct and you can't just stand by and allow
what amounted to an assault.'' What do you think the league would
have done if a player had said that? . . . Speaking of Orlando
Brown, it's all well and good to find and suspend him well into
next season. Certainly no player can be allowed to charge an
official and knock him flat, as the 350-pound tackle did. But
please, let's keep his actions in perspective. There's no
comparison between Brown's fit of pique and some of the true
criminal acts committed by NFL players lately. This was not an
assault, it was a guy getting pretty angry at someone throwing a
bag of BBs into his eye . . . How's this for a conflict of
interest: Agent Tom Condon represents both Brown, who hinted about
suing someone after he was suspended, and the referees association,
who had insisted on the suspension? . . . Dolphins kicker Orlindo
Mare needs one more field goal to break the single-season record of
37. Last weekend, when he booted four field goals in a 12-9 victory
over San Diego, he tied the record set by John Kasay of the
Carolina Panthers in 1996 . . . The sale last week of 49 percent of
the Baltimore Ravens to Stephen Bisciotti is expected to easily win
the approval of the league's finance committee chaired by Bob Kraft
and by the full membership. Under the terms, owner Art Modell
receives $275 million now for minority interest and another $325
million in four years for the remaining 51 percent. With the way
Modell goes through money, he'll need that extra $325 million by
the time he gets it. No league owner had yet met Bisciotti when
Modell announced the deal, but Kraft, and other members of the
finance committee, are already on record supporting the sale in
part because they've all grown weary of Modell's seemingly endless
financial crisis . . . The $600 million price tag is third in NFL
history, behind the $800 million Daniel Snyder paid for the
Redskins and their stadium and the $700 million Houston businessman
Bob McNair forked over to get an expansion franchise. But it's a
big enough number to help bolster the sale price of the New York
Jets. That deal was originally expected to close before the New
Year, but now has been delayed . . . To put into perspective what
the value of an NFL franchise can mean, Modell paid $3.93 million
for the Cleveland Browns in 1961 and Bob Tisch paid $75 million for
50 percent of the New York Giants as recently as 1991. You think
Kraft made a good investment in the Patriots despite their present
on-field problems?

   The story of ex-Bengals running back James Brooks is a sad one
for himself and his university. Brooks spent six years at Auburn,
yet left in 1983 still illiterate. After a successful career in the
NFL, Brooks found himself all but unemployable and ultimately was
jailed recently for nonpayment of child support. He says it's
because his inability to read made it impossible to keep a decent
paying job. Brooks has been put on probation and ordered into a
reading program in Ohio that Auburn says it will pay for. Kind of
late, isn't it? . . . Now that he's a Pro Bowl quarterback, Kurt
Warner says he has no intention of going back to the St. Louis
bench next season when Trent Green returns. Green was signed as a
free agent last offseason for $16.5 million, while Warner was left
unprotected on the expansion list. But after Green went down with a
season-ending knee injury in training camp, Warner got his chance.
Now he's the quarterback without question, but he acknowledged this
week, ``I think it would be an injustice to make one of us go back
and sit on the bench.'' So what does he have in mind, both of them
playing? Word out of St. Louis is the job is now Warner's but the
Rams will retain Green for at least one more season for cap
reasons, if nothing else, before trying to move him if Warner
continues to star . . . Az-Zahir Hakim is a tiny wide receiver Rams
college personnel director Charley Armey coveted in the NFL draft
two years ago. This season he has shown why. Despite playing
sparingly, The Wizard of Az is among the league's touchdown
leaders, averaging a score every four receptions. He has nine on
the season and they tend to come in bunches _ four vs. Cincinnati,
two against Carolina, and two more against the New York Giants. You
may remember Hakim because he scored his only touchdown of the
season a year ago against the Patriots. By way of comparison with a
local contemporary, Armey took Hakim with the 96th pick in the 1998
draft out of San Diego State while Bobby Grier took Tony Simmons
with the 52d pick. Hakim was drafted nearly twice as late as
Simmons, but has scored twice as many career touchdowns (10-5).

   Dick Vermeil, the Rams' emotional coach, blames himself for the
poor performances of wide receiver Isaac Bruce in Vermeil's first
two years in St. Louis. Bruce, who chafed under Vermeil's hard-line
approach, is back to his old Pro Bowl form after missing 15 games
the previous two years in part because Vermeil has cooled his jets.
After missing 15 games the previous two years, Bruce has 73 catches
this season for 1,120 yards, 11 touchdowns, and now an apology of
sorts from his boss . . . If the Rams score 6 points Sunday, they
will set a franchise scoring record. The old mark is 466 points set
in 1950. The Rams are not just about offense, however. They have
made 29 sacks on the road, which is as many as the 49ers have in
all their games and exceeds the totals of the Packers (27), Browns
(25), and Jets (25) . . . In case you missed it, ex-Patriots Sam
Gash and Tom Tupa made the Pro Bowl. Gash has been the AFC's Pro
Bowl fullback the past two seasons, or ever since he was run out of
New England labeled as damaged goods. The only thing damaged about
Gash has been the guys he's drilled with his blocks. His loss
remains a big one for the Patriots . . . The Colts need one more
regular-season victory to complete the greatest single-season
turnaround in NFL history. Their 10-win improvement ties them with
the 1963 Raiders (who were coached by Al Davis) and the 1929 New
York Giants . . . Peyton Manning became the fourth-youngest
quarterback to be named to the Pro Bowl. The only ones with more
peach fuzz were Dan Marino, Drew Bledsoe, and Brett Favre . . .
Before the season began, if someone told you Warner, Steve
Beuerlein, and Brad Johnson would be the NFC Pro Bowl quarterbacks,
what would your reaction have been? . . . Old friend Curtis
Martin's 6,320 career rushing yards are the eighth-highest total
for a fifth-year back in NFL history. He could pass Jim Brown
(6,463) into seventh place with reasonable performances in his last
two games. Martin plans to call Brown, whom he knows well, and rub
it in if he makes it . . . Chargers linebacker Junior Seau was
irate when he learned Wednesday that he had not been voted to the
AFC Pro Bowl team for the first time in nine years. ``This started
a war,'' Seau said after he learned five linebackers had been
picked ahead of him. ``It's a battle now. I look forward to the
next millennium because there are going to be fireworks. I don't
take things like this lightly.'' Chargers coach Mike Riley called
Seau's exclusion ``a travesty'' and insisted he was the best
linebacker in football. The Chargers did not have a single player
named to the team. That had not happened in San Diego since 1973 .
. . Here's an assessment of Tennessee's phenomenal rookie pass
rusher Jevon Kearse by someone who knows him well. ``This guy is
going to be the first player to get a $100 million contract in the
NFL,'' said Mike Frederick, who like most players measures value in
dollars and cents. Frederick is Kearse's backup.

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If the Patriots feel like laying down and
not playing out, starting with Sunday's game against the Buffalo
Bills, many more players other than Drew Bledsoe should apologize
to owner Robert Kraft for the mediocre season they handed the
owner, who paid some serious money expecting a much better product.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures obtained through the National Football
League Players' Association, Kraft spent $75.2 million in salaries
and bonuses in 1999, third in the league behind Green Bay ($76.0
million) and Cleveland ($76.6 million) and more than $10 million
above the league average. The Patriots had the second-highest
difference between the league-wide cap ($57.29 million) and the
actual amount of money the team paid out ($19.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   The payout also was $10.8 million more than last year's $64.4
million in salaries. Since 1994, the Patriots have had the highest
difference between salary cap and actual payout ($53.1 million).
Second are the Detroit Lions ($48.2 million).
</P>
<P>
   According to the September issue of Forbes, the Patriots'
estimated value was $460 million. Only Dallas ($663 million),
Washington ($607 million), and Tampa Bay ($502 million) had higher
values, but the Patriots are about two seasons away from a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tied the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, and
Minnesota Vikings with the most millionaire players (21).
</P>
<P>
   The following numbers are what players were _ and still are _
paid in actual dollars for 1999, including salary and bonuses. (Not
all players are included.)
</P>
<P>
   COST OF DOING BUSINESS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   --Ty Law, CB ($14.6 million) _ Law was left off the Pro Bowl
team after making it in 1998, which earned him a seven-year, $50
million deal. He had a solid year, but not of the caliber of '98
and will likely miss the rest of the season with a broken right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   --Ted Johnson, MLB ($5.48 million) _ Tore his left biceps tendon
in an Aug. 7 intrasquad game and was out of action until Dec. 5. A
top run-stopper, he was missed for his guts and determination
through most of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   --Drew Bledsoe, QB ($5.27 million) _ Considering his experience
and status in the league, Bledsoe had the worst year of his career,
throwing 20 interceptions, 16 of them in his last six games when
the Patriots went 1-5 and fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   --Damien Woody, C ($4.08 million) _ A very good rookie season.
Woody had to fill the shoes of savvy veteran Dave Wohlabaugh.
Though still not as polished as Wohlabaugh, his upside is higher
with tremendously quick feet for a man his size. He had problems on
snaps to the quarterback and picking up the many zone blitzes teams
threw his way.
</P>
<P>
   --Henry Thomas, DT ($3.7 million) _ A decent year, but a decline
from last season. Thomas was plagued with nagging injuries
throughout the season and at times had to be moved off his ``3''
technique spot to the nose where he was, at times, more effective.
</P>
<P>
   --Bruce Armstrong, LT ($3.5 million) _ Got himself into great
shape and was having a very good season until knee problems slowed
him down. Armstrong still has a lot left when he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   --Willie McGinest, DE ($3.06 million) _ McGinest will tell you
he could have gotten to the quarterback more, but he has eight
sacks and has been among the top two or three in quarterback
knockdowns.
</P>
<P>
   --Terry Glenn, WR ($2.66 million) _ He has caught 69 balls for
1,147 yards, stayed healthy all season, and has taken part in every
team practice (late for one team meeting). Other than some
off-field things, Glenn earned the money.
</P>
<P>
   --Andy Katzenmoyer, LB ($2.56 million) _ Gets great grades for
effort in replacing Johnson in the middle for most of the year.
Should be an excellent player on the outside in the future, but had
a lot of rookie issues on the field.
</P>
<P>
   --Ben Coates, TE ($2.1 million) _ Phased out of the offense in
what was his least productive year since Bledsoe joined the team in
'93 with 28 catches, two TDs, and a boatload of frustration. In a
different offensive system, Coates could still be effective. The
Patriots will be tempted to cut corners here, but that would be a
difficult move considering the difficulty of replacing him.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Slade, LB ($1.95 million) _ Not the most visible player
on defense, but that's because he was in so many coverage
situations. He had 3.5 sacks, which is a down number for Slade.
</P>
<P>
   --Shawn Jefferson, WR ($1.3 million) _ Thirty-nine receptions
and six TDs, maximum effort and a great character guy in the locker
room. An unrestricted free agent, Jefferson will be in demand in
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   --Max Lane, OL ($1.3 million) _ One of the offensive linemen who
came under fire, but Lane was the most versatile and played well
when he had a chance to play one position for a while.
</P>
<P>
   --Adam Vinatieri, K ($1.28 million) _ Hit on 22 of 26 field-goal
attempts, but the miss in Kansas City will haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   --Kevin Faulk, RB ($1.28 million) _ Proved to be an effective
returner and third-down back who can catch the ball, but was not
able to replace Robert Edwards as the No. 1 back.
</P>
<P>
   --Todd Rucci, RG ($1.2 million) _ He was left unprotected in the
expansion draft; started all year and was average.
</P>
<P>
   --Vincent Brisby, WR ($1.16 million) _ Still a lot of money for
a receiver who caught 12 passes, but that's not all Brisby's fault.
He was the fifth receiver and the ``emergency'' guy in case one of
the others went down. He will likely have a similar role next
season.
</P>
<P>
   --Zefross Moss, RT ($1.15 million) _ With one year remaining on
his contract, it would appear Moss will be a top candidate to be
cut in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   --Lee Johnson, P ($1.1 million) _ Adequately replaced Tom Tupa
at less money.
</P>
<P>
   --Larry Whigham, SS ($1.06 million) _ Can make mistakes, but he
still makes plays.
</P>
<P>
   --John Friesz, QB ($1 million) _ Bledsoe's backup. Has thrown no
passes.
</P>
<P>
   --Terry Allen, RB ($500,000) _ He'll be the 22d millionaire
before it's over as he reaches incentives.
</P>
<P>
   TRUE VALUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   --Lawyer Milloy, SS ($492,000) _ Two-time Pro Bowler, he may be
the best value in the league.
</P>
<P>
   --Troy Brown, WR, PR ($446,000) _ What can you say? Maybe the
best player on the team and one of the lowest paid. He'll make his
money in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   --Tedy Bruschi, LB ($934,000) _ Proved to be an every-down
player. Will make a good score in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   --Heath Irwin, LG ($435,000) _ Maybe the best of the
run-blockers. Also an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Israel, CB ($902,000) _ A solid year and an unrestricted
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   --Ferric Collons, DE ($400,000) _ Good play for a
minimum-salaried veteran.
</P>
<P>
   --Chad Eaton, DT ($881,000) _ A down year compared to last, but
plays better with Ted Johnson in the game.
</P>
<P>
   VALUE IN EYES OF BEHOLDER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   --Marty Moore, LB ($450,000) _ Always room for Marty.
</P>
<P>
   --Lamont Warren, RB ($704,000) _ Decent role player.
</P>
<P>
   --Brandon Mitchell, DE ($331,000) _ Flashes, but no consistency.
</P>
<P>
   --Tebucky Jones, CB ($465,000) _ Good special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   --Tony George, SS ($515,000) _ Saw too little time for a
third-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   --Rod Rutledge, TE ($295,000) _ Good blocker.
</P>
<P>
   --Tony Carter, FB ($656,000) _ Decent player, but no Sam Gash.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Floyd, FB ($276,000) _ Potential, but always hurt.
</P>
<P>
   --Tony Simmons, WR ($311,000) _ The Patriots expected more than
19 catches.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Sullivan, DT ($934,000) _ Played better late in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Carter, FS ($331,000) _ Tough year as a first-year
starter.
</P>
<P>
   NO VALUE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   --Willie Clay, FS ($401,900) _ Amount that counted against the
cap when he was cut.
</P>
<P>
   --Brian Stablein, WR ($333,300) _ Amount counted against cap
after he was cut two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Canty, CB ($300,000) _ Amount against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   --J'Juan Cherry, CB ($410,000) _ Supplemental draft pick who
went on IR and never played for Pats. He'll return next season.
</P>
<P>
   --Derrick Cullors, KR, RB (366,100) _ The kick returner went on
IR in exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   --Bob Kuberski, DT ($375,000) _ Spent most of the year inactive.
</P>
<P>
   --Derrick Fletcher, OT ($269,000) _ Fifth-round pick inactive
all year.
</P>
<P>
   --Michael Bishop, QB ($201,000) _ Seventh-round pick never
played.
</P>
<P>
   --Sean Morey, WR ($200,000) _ Seventh-round pick activated this
week for the first time.

<P>
   BOSTON _ 'Tis the season to be jolly, which is never easy in
boxing unless you're Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in an effort to spread some Christmas cheer and avoid
being a humbug (that's the rating organizations' job), we have
drawn up a wish list for some of boxing's big names, small names,
and a few names in between.
</P>
<P>
   For John Ruiz: A shot at Michael Grant's chin. Failing that, a
shot at Evander Holyfield's legs. Failing that, a shot at Lennox
Lewis's heavyweight title belt.
</P>
<P>
   For Dana Rosenblatt: Another shot at Vinny Pazienza so he can at
least beat him once.
</P>
<P>
   For Vinny Pazienza: Another shot at Rosenblatt so he can at
least get paid once more.
</P>
<P>
   For Mickey Ward: Someone around him who knows what a title shot
is worth.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Valenti and Goodwin A.C.: A knockout of Bob Arum.

<P>
   For Cedric Kushner: A good alibi and a better heavyweight.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   For the WBC: A death notice.
</P>
<P>
   For the WBA: Likewise.
</P>
<P>
   For the IBA, IBC, WBA, WBO, WBF and any other IB-anythings or
WB-whatevers: The cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   For Teddy Atlas: A fighter who really wants to learn how to win,
has the skill, and will do it inside the ring and out. Failing
that, a bigger TV microphone.
</P>
<P>
   For Eddie Futch: A comeback, because boxing needs him.
</P>
<P>
   For Riddick Bowe: No comeback, because he doesn't need boxing.
</P>

count.
</P>
<P>
   For Bob Arum: Patience and aspirin _ he'll need 'em with
Mayweather around.

<P>
   For Mike Tyson: A year's supply of Zoloft.

</P>
<P>
   For Paul Ingle: A rematch with Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   For Erik Morales: A stiff chin, because he'll soon need it.
</P>
<P>
   For Marco Antonio Barrera: A stiffer chin to stand up to
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnny Tapia: A rematch with Paulie Ayala.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Junior Jones will finally get a chance to square off with Hamed
March 11, probably in London. On the same card, Ingle is lined up
to fight Kevin Kelley if Kelley survives a fight next month in
England. The Kelley-Ingle winner, in theory, gets the Hamed-Jones
winner later in the year. Jones can still punch and if he lands,
Hamed will go down because he's as balanced as a three-legged
chair. The fight is still being shopped in the United States, but
Hamed's wife is due to have a baby 10 days after the bout and the
WBO-WBC featherweight champion is reluctant to leave. Good for him
. . . Pity poor Bernard Hopkins (36-2-1). The best middleweight in
the world just earned a paltry $100,000 beating Antwun Echols with
his 11th defense of the IBF title while Coley will earn $1.1
million to be cold-cocked by De La Hoya Feb. 26 at Madison Square
Garden. Nothing against Coley, but when does the 35-year-old
Hopkins get paid? ``I don't think you can find one person, even
among my enemies, who would say I'm not worthy of a million-dollar
payday,'' Hopkins said, and he's quite right. He may have to go
down to 154 pounds and fight Vargas or Reid to finally get paid . .
. Here's De La Hoya's take on Trinidad's insistence on flipping
their contracts from the first fight to make a rematch. ``They made
a wrong move by thinking they had all the power because they won
the title,'' De La Hoya said. ``They think I need Trinidad. I don't
need Trinidad.'' Not as long as he doesn't care what boxing fans
think of him he doesn't . . . After taking a short break from
training, Tyson will return to Las Vegas this week to continue his
preparations for a Jan. 29 bout with British and Commonwealth
champion Julius Francis (21-7) at MET Arena in Manchester, England.
Tyson will travel to London to train for the bout in early January.
He will stay in London until early in fight week and then take a
train up to Manchester . . . The world's fascination with Tyson
persists. He sold out the MET Arena's 21,000 seats in two days,
said British promoter Frank Warren. ``We had in excess of 40,000
requests for tickets,'' he said. ``Within two days, all the tickets
had been sold and Tyson's opponent hadn't even been confirmed
yet.'' Francis is an ex-kickboxer and a former soccer hooligan who
did time 10 years ago for causing what the British press called
``grievous bodily harm'' to someone. Sounds like the perfect rival
for Tyson . . . Lewis's manager, Frank Maloney, also manages
Francis and didn't exactly flood him with praise when he said,
``Tyson could fight Mickey Mouse in Manchester and the people would
show up.'' . . . Do you think it's an accident unranked Francis
suddenly showed up at No. 12 this month on the WBC list? . . .
Shannon Briggs is claiming he's already signed to fight Tyson at
the end of March in New York. Maybe he has, but it doesn't mean a
thing until Tyson's name is on a contract. Which it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   How's this for replacement work? Isidro Garcia won the WBO
flyweight title last Saturday night on two hour's notice,
outpointing champion Jose Lopez. Promoters of the fight in Indio,
Calif., were ready to cancel the bout after Alejandro Montiel
pulled out four hours before the fight. But Garcia walked into the
Fantasy Springs Casino and was asked to fight. He did _ with a
borrowed mouthpiece, a borrowed protector, borrowed trunks, and now
a borrowed title belt from Lopez. On the same card, the California
Athletic Commission canceled a fight between former world champion
Barrera and Cesar Najera when it was learned Najera was Barrera's
sparring partner and had only five known pro fights. The match was
ultimately put on as an exhibition . . . Here's three-time world
champion Tapia's explanation for why he's coming back Jan. 8 at the
Pit in Albuquerque to face WBO bantamweight champion Jorge Julio:
``The main thing is to show that I have what it takes to be a world
champion again,'' Tapia said. ``Mostly, I have to prove to myself
that it's not against who, or not against what, but what I do. I
don't like being called the challenger after so many years of being
a champion. I want to be in this game as a champion. I want to go
out as a champion. I want to get that feeling back that I had when
I was a champion. That's what I plan to do.'' . . . Pity France's
Bruno Girard. He recently fought more than well enough to win the
WBA super middleweight title from hard-punching Byron Mitchell only
to lose a controversial split decision draw in Tunica, Miss. ``It's
a scandal,'' Girard said. ``I'm a French fighter. I came to the
United States without fear.'' What was he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how boxing's inner workings go: When Ruiz's manager and
lawyer, Stone and Anthony Cardinale, showed up in Mexico last week
to plead for a boxoff with No. 2 contender Grant, they had to
listen to a letter read into the record by WBC president Jose
Sulaiman from King calling for Holyfield to be named the No. 1
contender over Ruiz. King just happens to be Ruiz's promoter. He's
also Holyfield's, but he's supposed to be looking out for all his
fighters. Later, after the WBC ordered a Ruiz-Grant boxoff be
negotiated by Dec. 28 or it would order a Jan. 4 purse bid, King
called Stone to tell him he was only fooling about Holyfield. Sure
he was . . . If Grant signs to fight Lewis, by the way, Ruiz would
get the same deal against Holyfield, who is now rated No. 3 by the
WBC. But don't count on seeing Grant-Lewis. Lewis's people are
asking for too many options on Grant's future fights to make the
deal, insiders say, while offering barely half the money Grant's
people are demanding . . . Former world champion Arturo Gatti will
meet former world champion Joey Gamache, the pride of Maine,
underneath De La Hoya Feb. 26. That fight will be a war and don't
bet against Gamache because Gatti is ready to go and doesn't know
it . . . Here's how Gamache got the fight: He showed up in
DiBella's office at HBO Sports and tried to convince the senior
vice president for programming. Then he sent him tapes of some
recent fights. Then he called back. ``Joey did a great job of
selling himself. And when we made the deal, he promised me we were
getting more than we expected,'' DiBella said. ``I don't doubt
it.''

VETERAN BADGERS LEAVE COLD BEHIND

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wisconsin linebacker Donnel Thompson, a veteran of
last year's Rose Bowl victory over UCLA, couldn't wait to drop his
luggage off and sneak in a Christmas dinner before bed as the team
arrived at its Century City hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a little kid again,'' Thompson said. ``As soon as
I got off the plane I said, `Wow, here we are back in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we're finally at the hotel getting settled. It
was about 10 degrees when we left (Madison), so this warmer weather
is a whole lot nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third trip since 1993 for the Badgers _ but with
Heisman Trophy winner Rod Dayne and the No. 4 ranking in the
country, the expectations are much different.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin won its past two Rose Bowls as underdogs, but this
time the Big 10 champions meet No. 22 Stanford as 11-point
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really good football team,'' Thompson said of
Stanford. ``If you go in there overconfident, you'll come out with
a loss. We have to go in there focused and ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great offense, and with me being on defense, we
have to go in there and stop them to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Outland Trophy candidate Chris McIntosh said focusing on the
game is much easier this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any trip you go to is the same deal,'' the senior linebacker
said. ``You take in the sights, but you're focused on the game. And
being a veteran team and having done this before, it can only help.
``But by no means are we overlooking Stanford. We were underdogs
last year and know what they're going through. They have plenty of
motivation and are hoping to represent the Pac-10 well.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Barry Alvarez limped into the hotel, still recovering
from knee replacement surgery Nov. 16. He said arriving Christmas
night didn't spoil anyone's holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very cold and snowy when we left and there were a lot
of Christmas lights and that Christmas feeling,'' said Alvarez.
``We had our Christmas, but Christmas Day to us was going to a bowl
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said his players won't be distracted because they're the
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't make much difference, players don't pay much
attention to that,'' Alvarez said. ``It's about playing the game
and seeing who performs that day. You go about your business and
prepare to play as well as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two Rose Bowls against the Bruins, the Badgers had
more fans even though UCLA plays its home games at the Rose Bowl.
Alvarez is hoping for a similar following against the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a home game for us the last two Rose Bowls,''
Alvarez said. ``We had a number of people that requested tickets
and didn't get them. Hopefully, they can find them someplace and we
can have the same type of ratio we have had the last two Rose Bowls
where we have had a home field advantage.''

STEWART'S COACH FACES HOLIDAY WITHOUT FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He greeted the holidays that have become so much a part
of our culture, though you will excuse Chuck Cook if he did so
without the traditional spirit. The void in his life is still
fresh, the pain he feels very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all miss him,'' said Cook from his home in San Antonio.
``We all do. He left a big hole in our lives that we won't fill.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking, of course, about Payne Stewart, his longtime
friend who was one of six people killed in that eerie Learjet
accident just two months ago. For years, Cook stood on practice
ranges and watched Stewart hit shot after shot, bucket after
bucket, until he was probably too tired to watch and Stewart was
too tired to swing. Like all teacher-student relationships, there
were good times and bad times. As Cook tries to go about his
routine back home in Texas, he draws strength from the fact that
Stewart achieved so much in 1999 _ a second US Open championship
and a coveted spot on the Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as happy as he ever was,'' said Cook. ``If I go, I sure
hope I go as happy as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, but Cook keeps in touch with Tracey Stewart and the
children, Chelsea and Aaron, though he knows Christmas was even
rougher for them. ``The community really responded and she got help
from a lot of friends. The response has been overwhelming, but I
think they sort of ignored Christmas (this year).''
</P>
<P>
   Cook delivered a eulogy at Stewart's memorial service and began
that day by asking: ``How do you celebrate the life of the greatest
celebrator of life that you know?'' It's a question he's still
asking himself.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways he had intended to celebrate in 2000 was to
accompany Stewart to Pebble Beach for the US Open in June, where
his student would be defending a championship he had earned with
arguably the most dramatic putt in major golf history. Cook will
probably still make the trip, only it will be to symbolically
return the championship trophy to the USGA. Just another step in a
life that must go on.
</P>
<P>
   As the new year approaches, Cook takes some pleasure out of a
pairing that seems appropriate. Another of his splendid students,
Bob Estes, has asked Stewart's longtime caddie, Mike Hicks, to
carry for him in 2000. Hicks was by Stewart's side in tournaments
for 12 years and they were close friends (Stewart celebrated his US
Open triumph at Pinehurst last June by riding in Hicks's truck to
the caddie's home in North Carolina), but again, life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hicks will be real good for (Estes),'' said Cook. ``The things
Bob lacks Hicks can give him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has the makings of another great team, for Estes is a golfer
just waiting to break out. In 1999, Estes missed the cut just one
time in 28 starts, chalking up nine Top 10s and 15 Top 25 finishes.
``A money-making machine,'' said Cook of the 33-year-old Estes, who
was just a few shots away from making the US Ryder Cup team when he
closed with a 69 at the PGA Championship in August.
</P>
<P>
   Estes has won just once on tour, the 1994 Texas Open, but after
losing his playing privileges with a dismal 1996 season, Estes has
come back strong _ 69th on the money list to 28th to 25th this past
season with $1,359,724 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't surprise many people, most of all Cook, if Estes
broke through with a big season in 2000. Cook is certainly looking
forward to the new year, if only to put the old one behind him.
``I'm glad to see it come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was in constant pain and unable to even think
about playing golf. Today, Jack Nicklaus is preparing for a 2000
season in which he plans to play in perhaps 20 tournaments _
including all four majors. ``I don't know how successful I'm going
to be, but you never know unless you try,'' Nicklaus told
reporters. ``I think I may fool some people. I think I may even
fool myself.'' Hard to imagine being fooled again by a man who at
age 46 won the 1986 Masters, or at 58 closed with a 68 and finished
in a tie for sixth at Augusta, particularly with so many variables
fueling his enthusiasm. There is the hip replacement surgery
performed by Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum in Boston last January which has
him pain-free; the arrival of his youngest son, Gary, as a
card-carrying member of the PGA Tour; venues for the majors are
courses on which he has won (Augusta National, Pebble Beach, St.
Andrews) or designed (Valhalla); and a nice stretch of success,
albeit team-oriented, during golf's ``Silly Season'' (Nicklaus was
on the winning team in the Three-Tour Challenge, the Father-Son
Challenge with Gary, and the Diner's Club Matches). Nicklaus, who
will turn 60 Jan. 21, will be paired with Gary at the AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am (Feb. 3-6). The son just this week accepted a
sponsor's exemption into the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic (Jan. 19-23)
. . . J.L. Lewis, a four-year veteran of the PGA Tour who won this
past summer's John Deere Classic, is helping to raise money for the
First Tee through a raffle available at www.wwathlete.com/jl. The
winner will receive a golf outing for four with Lewis at any TPC
course of their choice, with green fees, one night's lodging, and
meals included. Raffle tickets are $295; check the Web site for
information . . . As Casey Martin's debut as a member of the PGA
Tour approaches (Jan. 19 at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic), take
note that a similar controversy is brewing in Australia. Nigel
Lane, who suffers from an arthritic condition that makes walking
painful, is going ahead with a lawsuit against the Australian Golf
Union, which has denied him access to a cart during competition.
Lane, 31, said he has been taking the same medication that
reportedly helped Jose Maria Olazabal recover from his foot woes .
. . Last spring at the Bay Hill Invitational, Ian Woosnam was asked
about his chances of making the 1999 European Ryder Cup team. He
said it wasn't in his plans, that he was ``sick of the Ryder Cup''
and all the hoopla. But with his friend, Sam Torrance, named
captain for the 2001 contest at The Belfry, Woosnam has a different
view. ``The way I am playing now, I fancy my chances of making the
team in 2001,'' he told Alister Nicol of golf.com. That assumes
that the spirited Welshman conquers putting woes that have kept him
winless for two years. ``Every day I go out and I think about
quitting the game altogether. Every single day,'' said Woosnam, the
1991 Masters champ who has authored 43 worldwide victories. He had
No. 44 in his grasp a few weeks ago at the Argentine Open, but with
that choppy, uncertain putting stroke letting him down, it slipped
away . . . Renee Powell has been awarded the 1999 Budget Service
Award for her tireless work in bringing the game of golf to juniors
who would otherwise be unable to enjoy its benefits. Recently,
Powell was named head of development and programming for the First
Tee Program by the PGA Tour. One of three African-Americans who has
played on the LPGA Tour, Powell is head professional at Clearview
GC in East Canton, Ohio . . . With its first tournament of the new
year scheduled for Jan. 13, the LPGA will kick off its yearlong
50th anniversary celebration with a gala event a few nights earlier
at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla. Vince Gill will host and
the evening will pay tribute to the LPGA's founding members and
those women who helped build the tour through the 1950s and '60s .
. . No argument that Karrie Webb and Juli Inkster were the premier
players on the LPGA Tour in 1999, but here is further
head-scratching material for those who can't believe Lorie Kane is
still winless: 71 times in 1999 she shot a sub-par round,
establishing a tour record.

(RESCUED CRASH VICTIM IN STABLE CONDITION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Adds first name and title in sixth graf and fixes graf nine.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Orith Goldberg  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For two days, Jolene Rae Donohue lay on the
driver's seat of her car with its roof smashed against her body,
until her rescue that many called a Christmas Eve miracle.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Donohue was listed in serious but stable condition
at Holy Cross Medical Center in suburban Los Angeles, where instead
of focusing on her injuries, she wished others a happy holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Donohue told a friend. ``Have a Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, her car had rolled down a 70-foot embankment
south of the eastbound 210 Freeway, near the Golden State Freeway
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The injured 52-year old Santa Clarita woman went undetected as
thousands of people drove by.
</P>
<P>
   ``(She was) on the outskirts of this giant city and no one saw
her,'' said Los Angeles County Fire Captain Dave Leary. ``That, to
me, is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Friday, a passing motorist stopped near the
embankment and discovered the trapped woman when he briefly walked
away from the road, said Leary.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers had to work about 20 minutes to free Donohue, who
complained of neck pain and being cold, Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was doing really well,'' Leary said. ``All of her vital
signs were really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was last seen a party Wednesday night in La Crescenta.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, her son David, of Sun Valley, filed a missing
person report with the Santa Clarita Sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (missing party) was supposed to return home, but has not
shown up, ``The (reporting party) has contacted any relatives she
may have gone to, but nobody has seen or heard from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was headed to her Santa Clarita home on the westbound
210 freeway, when the green 1998 Mazda 626 she was driving at an
estimated speed of 65 mph crossed the dirt divider for unknown
reasons and traveled the wrong way across the eastbound lanes of
the 210 Freeway, California Highway Patrol officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The car continued into a dirt embankment south of the eastbound
lanes, east of the Golden State Freeway, flipping over and landing
upright about 70 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until passing motorist John Teslich of Stockton
stopped on the freeway about 12:10 p.m. Friday that Donohue was
discovered. Teslich apparently flagged down a UPS driver for help.
</P>
<P>
   Leary was already in the area because there had been some
traffic collisions and stopped when he saw a motorist wave him
down.
</P>
<P>
   Leary said the man he spoke with at the location said he made
contact with Donohue and called her son, who had said his mother
had been missing for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue seemed quite coherent, Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had told me she had been there for two days,'' Leary said.
``I looked at the blood on her face and it was dried and I noticed
the car's engine was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing she didn't know was where she was and what day
it was, ``She just woke up and there she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Leary and other firefighters quickly went into action,
requesting aid from both Los Angeles County and Los Angeles city
fire departments. About 25 firefighters from both agencies came to
help.
</P>
<P>
   They cut the roof off the car and gently removed Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all worked out...'' Leary said.

Slocum sees Paterno as ideal college coach
<TEXT>
<P>
   By NEIL HOHLFELD
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Before being promoted to head coach, he spent 16
years as an assistant, growing to learn and love the football
traditions of the university in the rural setting.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over as the top man, he stressed defense and
discipline. Nothing fancy here, just an honest approach to
team-oriented football that has remained constant through the
years.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 11 seasons, he won 102 games, went to eight bowls
and 10 times had a team in the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   That description could be of Joe Paterno, the coaching icon at
Penn State, but it is of Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, who would
like nothing more than to have the Aggies program mentioned in the
same breath as Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno is in his 50th season at Penn State _ 34 as head coach
after serving 16 years as an assistant. After learning his craft as
an assistant from 1950-65, he took over as head coach in 1966. In
his first 11 seasons as head coach, Paterno was 101-23-1 and 5-3-1
in bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum was an assistant at Texas A&AMP;M from 1972-80 and again from
1982-88 after spending a season as defensive coordinator at
Southern Cal in 1981. Slocum took over as head coach in 1989,
meaning he's spent 26 of the last 27 seasons in College Station, a
record for stability that's also worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum will face Paterno as a head coach for the first time
Tuesday night at the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. The similarities in
the programs are a source of pride for Slocum, who considers
Paterno a model for all coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an outsider looked at us and compared our program to Penn
State's, that would be a heck of a compliment,'' Slocum said.
``Other than the fact that I wouldn't want people to think that
both teams have old coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, 55, was kidding, of course. During a news conference
before the bowl, Slocum found it amusing to be called a ``kid'' by
Paterno, who celebrated his 73rd birthday last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking and he made some reference to me as `kid,'''
Slocum said. ``That feels pretty good. To be able to go to a bowl
game and spend a week with a guy you respect and admire as much as
Joe Paterno is a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back over the last 30 years and ask which are the
top three, four, five programs, Penn State is one of them. In the
last 30 years, if you ask who are the top two or three coaches, Joe
is one of them. He's a guy who has gone through a generation or two
of coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno's stability is remarkable. He has 317 wins, third among
Division I-A coaches and should pass Bear Bryant's 323 wins next
season. Since he turned 66 _ one year past the retirement age for
most people _ Paterno is 69-16.
</P>
<P>
   Success on the field aside, Slocum probably admires more the way
Paterno has handled himself and built the Penn State program.
Slocum would like nothing more than to build something approaching
Paterno's longevity and his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd ask me which team I could pattern my team after,
which would one fit Texas A&AMP;M best, I'd say that the image people
have of Penn State is the image that would be most fitting for
Texas A&AMP;M,'' Slocum said. ``There are some other programs around,
you'd look at them and say, that's not A&AMP;M. If you were to have a
program like that, it would be the total opposite of what Texas A&AMP;M
is all about. It wouldn't fit. But Penn State's program does fit
what we're about. The way they've done it, you don't hear a lot of
negatives coming out of that program. When you see their players,
they usually handle themselves well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is a straightforward guy, very principled person. I've
always admired the way they run their program. A lot of other
programs have come with some flash, and then they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Nittany Lions were in the running for the
national championship after winning their first nine games. In
early November, they were upset by Minnesota, starting a
three-game, season-ending slide that kept them out of a New Year's
Day bowl for the first time in nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There was early speculation Penn State might decide to skip the
postseason, so deep was the disappointment in Happy Valley.
Instead, the Nittany Lions will try to lick their wounds against
the Aggies, who enter the game with a two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the initial reaction was disappointing,'' Paterno said
of his team's Alamo Bowl bid. ``They (the Lions) seemed to think
they could still get into a New Year's Day bowl. That feeling has
passed. They feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum says he believes Paterno will have his team ready to play
Tuesday. Paterno's record of 19-9-1 in bowls is an indication he
knows what to do this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Joe's record in bowl games, it's one of the
best records of anybody,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one area in which the Aggies have not succeeded
under Slocum it has been in the bowls. Slocum's record is 2-6 in
bowls _ losing to the likes of Ohio State, Florida State, Notre
Dame and UCLA. Playing Penn State is another test against a
nationally renown program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played traditional bowl teams, for the most part,''
Slocum said. ``The next step is for us to get better in the bowls.
We're close, but it goes down as a `W' or an `L.' I think we'll
play well. Our guys are in a good frame of mind. We're here with
every intent to win the game, and we'll give it our best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the result, Slocum will get a look at the man who runs
the program he would most like to emulate. With that in mind, this
week should be a kick for Slocum and the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big part of me that's still a little kid,'' Slocum
said. ``I can remember seeing Joe Paterno on TV when I was in
college and just starting out as an assistant. It's always a thrill
when you get a chance to coach against someone like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever dreamed I'd grow up to know a guy like Joe
Paterno when I was a kid. I still am into that hero stuff. I love
the guy. To be around the guy and be friends with him, it's
something special to me.''

POSTAL WORKER GETS INTO SANTA'S SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dominic Berbeo  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Barbara Lawrence got a boost of Christmas spirit
Saturday when Santa Claus himself paid her a visit.
</P>
<P>
   In his red-and-white suit he carried yuletide gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But not a reindeer in sight would give him a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he drove his own sleigh: a postal truck in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked on doors, not chimneys, catching folks by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For the second Christmas in a row, postal workers at the
Glendale post office, nine miles north of downtown Los Angeles,
dressed up as Old St. Nick to deliver last-minute gifts via
next-day express mail.
</P>
<P>
   And the packages arrived just in the nick of time, said
Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really pleasant surprise,'' she said. ``I'm glad the
package got here today; it made it worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The package was a last-minute gift for her daughter-in-law, she
said. She took a chance and ordered merchandise over the Internet
because it seemed the only guaranteed way she could have the gift
delivered by Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fun the mailman got dressed as Santa,'' she said.
``I've never seen them do it before, but it's a lot of fun and it's
a good way to make the best out of his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Pellegrin, a second-year mail carrier at the Glendale post
office, said he got a kick out of wearing the costume and seeing
the reaction from residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind wearing the suit all year round,'' he said.
``People were really friendly with me and I enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   He volunteered to wear the suit after finding out that he would
be delivering express mail packages on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to deliver packages on Christmas, they're
probably gifts, so you might as well have fun and give people a
little something special with their gifts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrin himself got a pleasant surprise when he delivered an
overnight envelope to Glendale resident Walter Calmette.
</P>
<P>
   Calmette was so pleased to receive his Christmas bonus check on
time from his East Coast employer, that he presented Santa with a
little stuffed Felix the Cat doll.

   ``This is terrific,'' Calmette said. ``It really is in the
Christmas spirit. My grandchildren were here last night, and I wish
they were here this morning because I know they would get a big
thrill to see Santa.''
</P>
<P>
   Calmette wasn't the only one who enjoyed seeing Santa.

   As Pellegrin drove his postal truck along the route, surprised
pedestrians and drivers were quick to wave at him.
</P>
<P>
   And while Pellegrin, 46, said he had never dressed up as Santa
Claus before, the experience was so satisfying that he might
consider doing it again if the opportunity were to arise.

Fading stars give rise to a new one
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   While Jake Delhomme waited for his phone to ring, he stayed busy
shoveling manure in the barn of his father, a horse trainer in
Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   You are reminded it isn't easy giving up show business, but when
the Saints called, Jake returned to pro football. Friday, they hung
a star on his door, one that had belonged to the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme, the latest graduate of Quarterbacks Anonymous,
outgunned Troy Aikman, a three-time Super Bowl winner, to guide the
Saints to one of the season's wildest upsets. The Saints led by 10,
then had to rally twice to gain their third win 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   A former Ragin' Cajun, who set records at Southwestern
Louisiana, in his hometown, Jake did more than end the suffering of
the Saints, for at least a week. He brought back the fans. Some
47,000 attended Christmas Eve services at the Superdome, and a
majority of them were cheering heartily for the Cowboys at the
start of the game. By the end of the first quarter, they were
celebrating a Saints revival. In the second half, the Cowboys were
having trouble hearing Aikman's snap count.
</P>
<P>
   All through the day, Delhomme moved into uncharted territory:
his first NFL game, his first start, first interception, first
completion, first touchdown pass, first touchdown run. He tied the
game at 24 with a picture-perfect quarterback draw from the
four-yard line, breaking the huddle quickly because the coaches
were thinking about changing the play _ and he liked that one.
</P>
<P>
   This footnote tells you a lot about the kid, who did everything
but carry babies out of a burning building. But his performance
also creates a minor problem for the New Orleans coaching staff. If
he doesn't turn out to be a one-game fluke, you have to ask, what
took them so long to give him the ball? And did they really think
they had three quarterbacks who were better?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make me look very smart,'' Mike Ditka said, getting
into an area where most coaches won't go, ``but I thought Jake was
pretty special. His mind is in the game. It was wonderful to see
that. I never played quarterback, but I know I was a lot more
excited than Jake was in my first professional game. He seemed
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in two preseason games, and had three days of
practice with the starters. In short, he rolled out of bed and
completed 16 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns. He threw a
pair of 50-yarders to Eddie Kennison and Keith Poole that were
right on the money.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme took the scenic route from Lafayette to New Orleans,
stopping off in Amsterdam in 1998 to battle Kurt Warner for the
starting job with the Admirals. He says Warner, now the hot new
discovery in St. Louis, got the nod three hours before the season
opener. Jake moved on to Frankfurt, in the spring of '99, and took
it to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   If these miracle workers keep popping out of NFL Europe, the
owners might have to rethink the way they invest their millions.
They might soon be scouting elves in Santa's workshop. Hey, Buffalo
is plenty happy with Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   The win really won't salvage the season for the Saints _ ``it's
still dreary,'' Ditka said. But they have a chance to go into the
new year with renewed hope, as opposed to the Cowboys, whose sights
were set so much higher.
</P>
<P>
   A not very subtle passage is taking place at Valley Ranch. The
Cowboys have lost seven in a row on the road, since opening the
season with a win at Washington. They have lost their last two
games to teams they were heavily favored to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tortured scenario in which the Cowboys can still make
the playoffs, if they beat the Giants and just about everybody else
loses their remaining games. But coach Chan Gailey says he doesn't
know why his team, now 7-8, can't find a way to win, why it blows
leads in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Losing teams rarely know why they lose. The Cowboys are
overrated and uninspired, an awful combination, and they face the
task of rebuilding. The question is how major an overhaul is needed
and whether it starts with Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was picked off twice, Fred Weary's theft setting up the
first Saints touchdown and the second, by Mark Fields in the end
zone after a tip, foiling the Cowboys after they had reached the
six-yard line and seemed certain to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith rushed for over 100 yards, but his fumble after a
pass reception was returned 58 yards by Weary for the winning
score.
</P>
<P>
   The standout for Dallas was Jason Tucker, the TCU ex who had a
monster game, catching seven passes for 128 yards and returning six
kickoffs for 203 yards. He had a 97-yarder rubbed out by a penalty.
And, yes, he prepped in the European league, with the Rhein Fire.

LAKERS BEAT SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cross another item off the Los Angeles Lakers'
``naughty'' list from last season and add one more item under
``nice'' in the Phil Jackson era. The latest sparkling addition: a
hard-fought victory over the defending champion San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   A December win isn't going to erase the playoffs sweep of seven
months ago, but the Lakers' 99-93 decision Saturday night at
Staples Center provided enough yuletime cheer to last at least a
few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not sweet yet. We just beat them today,'' said Glen Rice,
who finished with 25 points in the Lakers' season-high
eighth-straight win. ``We've got a long ways to go. When you
realize that a team did sweep you the way they swept us last year
you come into it with a little more incentive. And we were
embarrassed last year, so we're definitely not trying to get
embarrassed this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs endured most of the shame this night. Tim Duncan went
8 for 23 from the field and struggled to a 28-point performance
before fouling out late in the game. His teammates were equally
disjointed, and San Antonio made just 37.6 percent of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   To the Spurs, it was clear they weren't playing the same team
they rolled over en route to last season's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers are new, they're playing defense now,'' Spurs coach
Greg Popovich said. ``The difference is they play `D' and you know
that is important to win games for you. And they play it like they
are believing it now. So that is a credit to the coach and staff
and to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough went wrong for Jackson to criticize his team's offensive
precision _ the Lakers blew a couple of double-digit leads _ but he
also had plenty to smile about: Rice's first-half heroics, Robert
Horry's 12 points off the bench, Kobe Bryant's 18 points after a
shaky start. And most of all, Shaquille O'Neal's game-high 32
points and tough defense of Duncan despite constant foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a beautiful game, I'll just say that,'' Jackson
said, ``but it was a wonderful win for us _ from one standpoint,
from the confidence that we can beat this team, a team that was
difficult last year for this team to play. And another standpoint
that Kobe had a very difficult game tonight and we were able to
fight through it and win the game, and played with Shaq in foul
trouble ... and still found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal capped off the evening in fine fashion _ getting Duncan
to foul out, then making both free throws to push the Lakers' lead
to a comfortable eight-point margin with two minutes left. He added
11 rebounds and four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just another win against a great team,'' O'Neal said.
``They are the champions, and they do have a fabulous team. We just
did what we're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's last five points were his most spectacular. After
several unsuccessful forays into the paint against Duncan and
Robinson, he finally found the rim on a fast-break dunk over Jaren
Jackson, then completed the 3-point play to make it 85-77 with 5:11
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he faced Jackson, crossed over three times,
then zipped to his right and hit an off-balance, 13-foot fadeaway
to make it 93-83 with 1:11 left.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was 4 for 13 through three quarters but made up for it
with the late surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a talented player that he's going to find a way to
contribute at some level during the night,'' Jackson said. ``He
played in jeopardy with fouls early in the game. I think that put
him in a place where he was a little bit anxious when he went back
in to get back in the flow quickly, let the game come to him. I
don't think it's an unusual reaction for a player like that, at his
age (21), to play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs had their own first-half difficulties. Duncan and
Robinson combined to shoot 2 for 16 from the field as the Lakers
took a 50-42 halftime lead. The margin could have been much larger,
but the Spurs got an 11-point boost from Avery Johnson, slashing
through the Laker defense for a series of layups and high shots off
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal in foul trouble and Bryant missing shots, Rice
carried the Lakers with a team-high 16 in the half, making 6 of 9
field-goal attempts.

A GIANT STEP FORWARD FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>

By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Christmas Day found Shaquille O'Neal standing with
his nose pressed against a store window, admiring the only thing he
really, really wants.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't under his tree Saturday because it's something not
even $120 million can buy. The only way to acquire it is through a
layaway plan.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, O'Neal has been chipping away at his balance.
He's not one to admit it but the truth is he's starting to feel the
pinch. After all, that shiny NBA championship ring won't be there
for his taking forever.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has only so long to square his account, cinch his legacy.
That's why the Los Angeles Lakers' game against San Antonio _ a
present from the NBA schedule makers _ was the next-best thing to
unwrapping a ring for the 7-foot-1 center.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio embarrassed the Lakers last May on its way to the
NBA title. When the Spurs swept O'Neal and Company out of the
playoffs in the Western Conference semifinals, there was cause to
wonder whether O'Neal would ever win an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't seem at all serious about earning it, collecting just
two assists in the series, converting only 47.5 percent of his free
throws and playing defense like a blind man.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led the Lakers in scoring but wasn't close to the best
7-footer on the floor. Tim Duncan conducted a clinic, turning
O'Neal into the world's tallest pylon.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last O'Neal saw of Duncan and David Robinson _
except in his nightmares _ until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This season had started off like a dream. In the Lakers' first
27 games, O'Neal lived up to his Superman tattoo, averaging 26.9
points, 14.4 rebounds and three blocked shots a game.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers, while gaudy as any department store Christmas
display in New York City, would look like so much window dressing
if O'Neal didn't show more maturity against the Spurs than he had
the last time these teams had met.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for O'Neal to show the Lakers are for real.
</P>
<P>
   That he did. Playing like a man on borrowed time, O'Neal
mustered 32 points, 11 rebounds and five blocked shots to star in
the Lakers' 99-93 win.
</P>
<P>
   The dexterity he showed in the paint, spinning away from
Robinson for easy points and pirouetting around Duncan for rebounds
and kicking the ball out when prudent, was impressive. So was his
nimbleness in deflecting questions about the significance of his
performance in light of what happened in May.
</P>
<P>
   In acting like it was just another game, O'Neal showed why he
shouldn't quit his day job for the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't convince anybody, least of all Lakers point guard
Derek Fisher, who said, ``Shaq wants an NBA championship ring more
than he wants his next paycheck. He'd give you all his paychecks
for one, I assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   What can it mean, a piece of jewelry, to a man who has hundreds
of millions of dollars, mansions, a music career and a spot on the
list of the all-time 50 greatest NBA players?
</P>
<P>
   Everything, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be financially secure and have all these wonderful
things going on and still seek validation,'' Fisher said. ``You
know how male egos flare. You want people to understand you want to
be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In case the Spurs didn't get the message, O'Neal drove the point
home, rejecting a couple of Duncan's shots and forcing him to the
bench with six fouls and slowing the foul-plagued Robinson before
he could work up much momentum.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the most dominant big man in the game was the
most dominant big man on the floor. That ring O'Neal covets must
have looked close enough to touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille was great out there tonight,'' Duncan acknowledged.
``He made a lot of big plays for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about time. O'Neal knows that. Lakers coach Phil Jackson
was merely stating the obvious when he said, ``Obviously the
window's starting to look smaller and smaller as far as (O'Neal's)
opportunity to be a champion. And the fact he could end up being a
30-year-old guy in this league and not have a championship ring is
something I'm sure is a concern to him. Because he knows in his
heart that he's the most dominant big guy in this game and his
effectiveness is going to be measured by how many championships he
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   It's much too early to measure O'Neal for that championship ring
he covets. Let's just say the balance he has remaining on it looks
significantly smaller today than it did in May.
</P>

CARDINAL EXHORTS CATHOLICS TO BE FREE FROM FEAR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Delivering his last Christmas Mass of the
century, Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony told Roman Catholic
worshippers to be free from fear in their daily lives because God
and Jesus are guiding and watching over us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can face death in our own lives without being afraid
because Jesus is on the other side of death,'' Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony presided over Christmas Mass at Incarnation Church in
Glendale, nine miles north of downtown Los Angeles, before more
than 600 worshippers. Earlier Saturday he celebrated Mass for
inmates at the Los Angeles County Men's Jail.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles said he is
optimistic about the state of the world as it enters the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it always be better? Obviously yes,'' Mahony said in an
interview following the mass. ``Still, great progress has been made
and there's great faith in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hopeful that mankind would continue to make
strides in fighting disease and illness and avoiding major
conflicts in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Incarnation Church's Father Paul Hruby said he was delighted
that Mahony chose to honor the church with his presence for the
last mass of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Hruby said he too was optimistic about the state of the world
nearly 2,000 years after Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's like it was when he came,'' Hruby said. ``There's
a lot of darkness still out there, but still people who can find
faith spread his message to others. I see a lot of good.''

 &HT;    Interest groups hammer McCain's reform bill
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A conservative group has spent $100,000 to attack
Republican presidential candidate John McCain in New Hampshire over
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Tax Reform, renewing a long-running fight with the
Arizona senator, has a new television ad that claims McCain's
campaign finance reform legislation would be a boon to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ad levels a blunt attack on McCain that appears to be aimed
at traditional Republican voters. ``He's the only candidate
approved by the liberal New York Times. Bill Clinton, Al Gore and
Big Labor all endorse his top legislative priority,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   While it strikes a similar theme to criticism made by Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the commercial is an ``issue advocacy'' ad that is
not tied to any campaign and does not urge a vote for or against
any candidate. Instead, it ends by urging viewers to ``call John
McCain and tell him to leave the Republican Party alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the group's chairman, denied that the ad is
intended to affect votes in the Feb. 1 primary in New Hampshire. He
said its purpose is ``to get his attention and get him to withdraw
support for the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly likely since McCain has ridden the call for
reform to a slim lead over Bush in New Hampshire. He is especially
popular among independent voters, who like the message of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign issued a blistering response to the ad,
which it said was inspired by a desire to keep soft money flowing
to Americans for Tax Reform. The group received $4.5 million from
the Republican National Committee to help counter Democratic
attacks on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, who is paying for these ads?'' said
Peter Spaulding, chairman of McCain's campaign in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist said his organization has 90,000 members whose
contributions helped pay for the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Some McCain supporters welcome Norquist's involvement because
they think his tactics are ham-handed and will backfire in
reform-minded New Hampshire. ``You can judge a man not only by his
friends, but also by his enemies,'' Spaulding said.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist has been working against McCain's presidential campaign
since September, when, joined by leaders of other conservative
groups, he traveled to New Hampshire and South Carolina to denounce
the Arizonan. Both states hold crucial early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been campaigning to end the unregulated, unlimited
donations to political parties known as ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those contributions have no direct effect on groups like
Norquist's, although as a lobbyist, he represents several
organizations that make soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republicans fear that ending soft money would benefit
Democrats because labor unions could still use a portion of member
dues to make political contributions. But unions also would be
barred from giving soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Tax Reform, the National Rifle Association, the
Christian Coalition and other groups also object to another idea
pushed by McCain and his co-sponsor, Democratic Sen. Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold want to ban issue advocacy ads in the last
60 days of a campaign because, they argue, the ads are little more
than thinly veiled attacks on a candidate that serve no purpose
other than to influence voters when they are aired so close to an
election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dropped that provision from his latest Senate bill but
still likes the idea.

 &HT;    U.S. should be ready to strike back in case of New Year's
attacks
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Happy New Year. Toot. Cheer. Hug. Boom.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans are harmed celebrating the millennial holidays that
mark the birth of the Christian savior, the United States should
treat the crime as an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should not live in fear that they will be bombed,
poisoned, gassed or kidnapped by anti-American terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   That's what terrorists want.
</P>
<P>
   They want to bring down the mighty. They want to see Americans
cower in fear. They should never get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has warned Americans to watch out for
terrorism over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays are a time for giving and love for all. It is a
time for celebrating new beginnings in the shared happiness of
friends and friendly crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays are not supposed to be a time to stay on the alert
for slimeballs who want to kill you and destroy your way of life.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest government warning, ``The U.S.
government believes that terrorists may be planning to conduct
attacks, including against official and non-official Americans, in
and around the New Year period, from now through mid-January
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the warnings by Clinton and other high-ranking
government officials in charge of national security are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials don't want to panic Americans. But they
would be ducking their responsibilities if they failed to give
adequate warnings of actual threats.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago in Jordan, an anti-American terrorist cell of
Islamic extremists was arrested in time to prevent a plan to kill
Americans and Israelis during celebrations on the eve of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The group supposedly was under the control of exiled Saudi
billionaire Osama bin Laden, the committed anti-American terrorist
indicted for the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency speculates that bin Laden and
his associates could be planning 15 other similar attacks
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   United States border crossings now are on high alert after U.S.
Customs officers in Port Angeles, Wash., arrested Ahmed Ressam, a
32-year-old Algerian-born man with ties to bin Laden and the
Algerian extremist organization, Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was smuggling sophisticated and powerful bomb-making
material into the United States from Canada in his rented car.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam is not talking, but it is apparent that he was just
dropping off the nitroglycerin, timing devices and other materials
to terrorists already in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is making himself comfortable in Afghanistan, a county
now run by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   Many of bin Laden's ``associates'' were armed and assisted by
the CIA during the war that eventually drove the Soviet Union out
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden and his associates now have declared a holy war on the
United States and Americans anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Two can play that game.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's bin Laden or any other terrorist group, domestic or
foreign, the United States should never allow terrorists to force
Americans to live in fear. When that happens, the terrorists have
won.
</P>
<P>
   It must be remembered that the greatest act of terrorism on
American soil was the homegrown terrorist bombing of the federal
building in Oklahoma City in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   America has its own share of terrorist hate groups and dangerous
loners.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should continue with the holiday plans aware, but
unafraid, of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   However, if terrorists harm Americans during the holidays, the
United States should take off the gloves and treat the outrage as
an act of war.

 &HT;    Hotel accommodates New Year's staff and eases holiday worries
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rosalyn McCrary had a touch of the millennium jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ringing in the New Year with her 9-year-old son,
Brandon, she was to be on the job as a banquet server at the J.W.
Marriott Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Atlanta employees who have to work that night,
McCrary was worried about how her family would fare without her.
Would the lights go out? Would her son be left without telephone
service?
</P>
<P>
   So, McCrary went to her boss. Now, she doesn't have to worry
about her son. He will be at work with her.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials are making sure that employees' minds will stay
on their jobs and not on the welfare of their families.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the hotel stopped taking reservations from the
public. Instead, about 50 rooms will be reserved for employees and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Meals and lodging will be provided free to those who have to
work New Year's Eve _ from executives to bellhops. There will also
be a party for the families and baby-sitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more reassured,'' said McCrary. ``At least now I
will be with my child in the same vicinity.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Peter Kacheris, who plans to bring his family to
the 371-room hotel, said the rooms usually fetch more than $200 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   That's a small price for the hotel to pay for employees' peace
of mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many employees said they don't mind working, but they really
wanted their families close to them,'' he said. ``This is the
appropriate thing to do. We're trying to make the best of a strange
situation. I guess during the next millennium, we'll do it again.''

 &HT;    CNN logo charms tourists
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It may not offer the grandeur of Stone Mountain, the
pizzazz of Underground Atlanta or the myth of Tara. It may seem
like just another gaudy corporate logo. It may serve no civic
purpose other than to give pigeons a place to squat.
</P>
<P>
   But tourists, especially those from overseas, love the
16-by-24-foot CNN logo erected in mid-September at the Techwood
Drive entrance to CNN Center. Many tourists take pictures of what
is quickly becoming the latest Atlanta landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing as going to the Tour Eiffel in Paris or
the Twin Towers in New York City or the Statue of Liberty,'' says
Redgie Blanco, a young Venezuelan. ``It is one of the main things
here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists hail from locales as far away as Munich, Germany;
Berlin, Manila, Philippines; Seoul, South Korea; Islamabad,
Pakistan; Taipei, Taiwan; and Alpharetta, Ga. They caress the
aluminum letters, climb inside the C, pose proudly for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy and pleased with the response,'' says
Phillip Evans, senior publicist for Turner Broadcasting Co. The
logo's installation was part of the center's massive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   It's significance goes far beyond a photo op for many visitors.
In many countries with government-controlled media, CNN offers a
largely unvarnished spin on the news. Oliver Lee, a Filipino by way
of Philadelphia, says he'll send a photo to CNN-loving relatives in
the Philippines who remember fondly the journalistic role the cable
network played during the 1986 ``people's power'' revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hsieh, a precocious 12-year-old from Sunnyvale, Calif.,
says about the logo: ``It's like the symbol of freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Schulz from Munich is less effusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This image is recognized worldwide, so I guess it's cool,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her brother-in-law provided the most accurate global
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typically touristy thing to do,'' Oliver Schulz said.

 &HT;    Returns from Web purchases not always welcome at stores
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com may have one-click ordering, but finding
out how to return the gifts is a little more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   More shoppers than ever took to the Web to do their holiday
shopping this season. Expansive ad campaigns promised consumers the
experience would be quick, easy and a huge time-saver.
</P>
<P>
   But online merchants weren't ready for the crush of
cybershoppers, which resulted in out of stock items only days after
Thanksgiving, orders that couldn't be fulfilled or delivered by
Christmastime and a litany of other problems. Many shoppers, unsure
if they would ever see their online purchases, wound up doing the
one thing they dearly hoped to avoid _ heading to the mall just
days before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the buying frenzy is over, the second phase of the
online shopping experience _ returning unwanted items _ is
underway.
</P>
<P>
   David Schatsky, principal analyst with Jupiter Communications,
saw the e-commerce sky falling in November, and unfortunately for
everyone involved, his predictions of unfulfilled orders and return
hassles have turned out to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet selling chain is not a smoothly integrated
chain,'' he said. ``Many sites report they don't have integration
between their Web site and their inventory management. Even if the
Web site is running smoothly, there could be problems down the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Few online shoppers bothered to familiarize themselves with the
return process and few Web sites make their return policies readily
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, returning online purchases isn't quick, easy or time
saving.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even the savviest online shopper will have trouble
finding Amazon's return policy, which is hidden under the ``help''
section.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought you were going to save yourself some hassles by
shopping online at Barnesandnoble.com, figuring you could just
bring returns back to your local superstore, think again. The
Barnes and Noble online return policy (also under the ``help''
section) states that the ``bricks and mortar'' retail stores will
not accept online returns.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to return an online purchase, you'll probably have
to send it back the way it came _ via UPS or regular mail, at your
own expense. If you didn't save the packing materials, you'll have
to check the Web site's help section to find the address and
directions for returns. Amazon, for example, requires returns in 30
days in the original packing. Software, music and videos must be in
original, unopened and pristine condition. Other Web sites have
different rules for returns, but for the most part, few will pay
postage. If you don't like it, you'll have to pay to send it back.
</P>
<P>
   The same retailers who excitedly trumped their online stores
this holiday season are now busy refitting their sites with easy to
find buttons to help users track their orders and send e-mail to
customer service departments.
</P>
<P>
   The beautifully designed Williams-Sonoma Web site has
anticipated or perhaps already experienced the wrath of angry
shoppers and has a link called ``Where is my order?'' on its start
page. The link takes users to a page where they can track missing
packages along with phone and fax numbers, and a form for customer
inquiries. However, the company's return policy is in small print
under the ``frequently asked questions'' icon and doesn't say if
the retail stores will accept online returns or not.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com has a Web site that appears to be the cyberspace
version of a lump of coal. Ironically, it's actually easier to
return toys than to order them.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, Toysrus.com said it could no longer guarantee
Christmas delivery. Even though the company worked hard to get its
site ready for Christmas, it underestimated the holiday demand. If
you did get the toys on time but the recipient didn't like them,
you can take them back to the nearest Toys 'R Us store for a
refund. The Gap stores also will accept online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone will be so accommodating, says Forrester
Research analyst Seema Williams. ``Internet holiday newbies like
Crate &AMP; Barrel and Nieman Marcus will face a rude awakening when
disgruntled online buyers turn to brick-and-mortar store managers
to solve Internet problems. Offline merchants must prepare store
managers to provide customer service for online shoppers and inform
all sales staff about Web prices, products, and return policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you head off to the mall with your online purchases, call
the store first or check the Web site to make sure you will get a
warm and courteous welcome. Not every store or sales associate will
know what to do with your dot-com returns or exchanges.

 &HT;    Bush, McCain at odds over soft money
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a downtown civic center on a chilly Des
Moines night, Arizona Sen. John McCain worked to heat up the chase
for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With a quiet fervor, McCain talked about his plan to overhaul
the way America finances politics by killing off the unlimited
``soft money'' that makes a mockery of contribution limits. For
McCain, it is the be-all issue, the necessary first step in dealing
with just about every major topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without reining in soft money and reducing the role of money
in politics, we will never have a government that works as hard for
the average American as it does for the special interests,'' McCain
says.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan for soft money is simple: End it. Under his
vision, all political contributions would be subject to the limits
and scrutiny required under federal law for donations to individual
candidates. Currently, that includes a $1,000 cap on individual
donations and a $5,000 limit on donations from political action
committees. McCain favors increasing those limits.
</P>
<P>
   Though Texas Gov. George W. Bush and McCain generally agree on
the issue, it's become a flashpoint between them. Bush, in what the
McCain campaign insists is an effort to mislead voters, charges
that McCain's plan would be tough on soft money from business
interests that generally back Republicans but light on soft money
from labor groups that lean heavily Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, whose fund-raising prowess forces him to defend
against charges of being the big-monied candidate of special
interests, campaign-finance reform is a potentially tricky issue.
It's hard to challenge something that sounds so wholesome, though
the GOP majority in the Senate manages to kill it off every year.
At the same time, however, Bush campaign strategists don't believe
campaign finance reform is a burning issue with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ranks somewhere lower on the scale than education and
defense and taxes and welfare,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's top
strategist, after the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush believes he has found a hole in McCain's top
issue, as well as an enemy _ big labor _ to drag into the fray.
``Unilateral disarmament,'' Bush says, over and over again of any
plan that would not address the labor union issue.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law that says union members' dues money cannot be given
to candidates. Labor's direct support of candidates must come from
separate funds stocked with money voluntarily given for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Federal Election Commission notes in its guidelines,
``there are many ways in which a corporation or union may legally
participate in federal election activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common route is soft money. Union members' dues can
wind up as soft money, spent at will by labor leaders. Critics,
like Bush, say that means union members' dues wind up supporting
candidates and causes the members might not like.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of laboring people who are Republicans and
conservatives,'' Bush told McCain during the recent debate. ``And
yet, under the vision you've got ... it's OK that (labor leaders)
take their money and spend it the way they want to spend it. I
don't think it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to cut labor's political spending by pushing so-called
``paycheck protection,'' a concept that says union members' dues
should not be spent on politics without the members' OK. It's a
change that would restrict union officials' use of soft money funds
stocked with members' dues. McCain supports the concept, but it was
not included in the version of his campaign finance reform that bit
the dust in the Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is for it, why did he not include it in the plan he put
before the Senate?'' asked Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, says McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives, is tactics. The
bill was stripped to a bare-minimum version to get it to the Senate
floor, according to Ives. McCain's plan was to then add amendments,
including one to make sure labor money would be subject to the same
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate killed the bill before the amending began.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain seem to agree on what to do about soft
money from business and labor, they may not agree on what to do
about soft money from individuals. McCain wants to ban such
contributions. Bush has not weighed in on that issue, allowing
McCain to attack him for supporting ``a loophole large enough to
drive a Chinese tank through,'' a not-so-subtle reference to
political donations from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush stands as guardian of special interest control of
political process,'' the McCain campaign said in a release this
month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's dream, rejected annually by his GOP colleagues in the
Senate, is a political system unfettered by soft money. He feels so
strongly about it that he teamed up with Democratic presidential
contender Bill Bradley in a pledge to reject soft money if each
becomes his party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to indirect support of candidates, soft money does
things like help pay for national political conventions.
Restricting it could force a major re-tooling of how politics is
financed. Though McCain favors raising the caps on donations,
there's little chance they would be raised to anywhere near the
levels of soft money now given.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be answered is how the system would function on less
cash. For example, the major parties count heavily on soft money to
pay for their national conventions. Organizers of next summer's GOP
convention in Philadelphia are now trying to line up $100,000
donations toward the $35 million cost of the event. Organizers of
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles also are luring
high-dollar support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes full, prompt disclosure is the best campaign
finance reform. To that end, his campaign uses its Web site to list
contributions shortly after they are received. McCain has posted
his donor lists, but only after they are filed with the Federal
Election Commission to meet its quarterly reporting deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the nonprofit, independent Center for Responsive
Politics shows union money becomes Democratic money in overwhelming
proportions. In the 1998 election cycle, labor spent $60.8 million
on politics. Ninety-two percent of it went to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbers, Texas AFL-CIO spokesman Ed Sills says Bush
is distorting the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal for paycheck protection assumes that there would
be an imbalance if you take away (corporate) soft money,'' Sills
said. ``Historically, that's never been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 election cycle, business interests kicked $667
million into the system, about 10 times more than labor ponied up,
with about 60 percent of the business money going to Republicans,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sills also questions Bush's allegations about how labor's
political money is spent. Unions are democracies, Sills said, and
members are free to vote their leaders out of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are democratic with a small `d','' said Sills. ``I know
people sometimes accuse us of being Democratic with a large `D.' If
that's the case, it's because a majority of our membership points
in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other organization that is being asked to
disregard its majority viewpoint for the sake of its minority,'' he
said.

shopping this season. Now that the buying frenzy is over, the
second phase of the online shopping experience _ returning unwanted
items _ is underway. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   NEWYEAR _ ATLANTA _ Rosalyn McCrary had a touch of the
millennium jitters. Instead of ringing in the New Year with her
9-year-old son, Brandon, she was to be on the job as a banquet
server at the J.W. Marriott Hotel. So, McCrary went to her boss.
Now, she doesn't have to worry about her son. He will be at work
with her. (Poole, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   &UR; FOR MONDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Monday, Dec. 27:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Russian forces pushed deep into
Grozny on the second day of an operation aimed at gaining control
of the Chechen capital. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FALUN-GONG (Beijing) _ In the most significant
prosecutions yet in the government's campaign against the Falun
Gong spiritual movement, three men and one woman accused of being
top leaders were handed prison sentences Sunday ranging up to 18
years. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-STORM (Paris) _ A fierce winter storm swept through
Europe, killing at least 20 people in France, uprooting some 4,000
trees and leaving 2 million homes without power. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   IVORYCOAST-COUP (Paris) _ The ousted president of Ivory Coast
left for exile, under French protection, leaving the country under
the control of its military leaders. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BURUNDI-RELOCATION (Bujumbura, Burundi) _ It would be hard to
name a place in the world where the forced relocation of a third of
a million people would not spark major international protest. But
this has not been so for Burundi, where in the last three months
the government has herded 350,000 people from their homes into
grubby camps. The government calls the camps a last resort to end a
series of guerrilla attacks. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-TV-SHEEPDOG (London) _ If the BBC has its way, millions
of Britons will spend Monday evening watching a special edition of
``One Man And His Dog,'' a program in which a sheep running in the
wrong direction qualifies as high drama. Monday's episode is a
crucial test for ``One Man and His Dog,'' which was threatened with
cancellation last winter. But the threat caused such an uproar that
the BBC finally agreed to broadcast a special over Christmas. By
Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PSYCHIATRIC-HOSPITALS (Pembroke Pines, Fla.) _ South Florida
State Psychiatric Hospital is at the heart of a cutting-edge
experiment, the first state mental hospital in the nation to be
completely turned over to a private company that hopes to operate
it at a profit. In 1997, legislators in Florida, which faced a
court order to improve conditions here, voted to contract out the
operation. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-UNIVERSITIES (Washington) _ When the nation's Roman
Catholic bishops voted in November to tie Catholic universities
more closely to the church, they left institutions like Georgetown
University with a lingering question. What will it mean for
Catholic theologians, teaching in Catholic universities, to have to
apply to their local bishop for a certification that they are
teaching ``authentic'' doctrine, a requirement laid out in the
document the bishops approved? By Gustav Niebuhr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-SURPLUS (Washington) _ Thanks to projections of a large
and growing federal budget surplus, the current presidential
candidates are the first in decades who can credibly propose
expensive tax and spending programs, and they are doing so in ways
that reveal clear differences within and between the parties. By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ Just 15 months ago, former
Senator Bill Bradley was not a candidate and Vice President Al Gore
was the party's presumptive nominee. Today, he has matched Gore in
fund-raising, built a national organization and given himself a
shot, though perhaps a long one perhaps, at upsetting the vice
president. But the coming weeks will provide a critical test of
Bradley's staying power.By James Dao. (This is the first of 5
articles on the state of the individual presidential campaigns as
the primary season begins.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-ORGANIZER-PROFILE (Washington) _ George Stevens is
co-producing his biggest outdoor extravaganza ever, the New Year's
Eve celebration, ``America's Millennium,'' on the Mall in
Washington. By John M. Broder. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-MUSIC-PICKS (New York) _ Having built his career on
his passion for an unusually wide range of musical styles and an
uncanny sense of how to combine them in entertaining and
illuminating ways, Peter Schickele, host and creator of the PDQ
Bach program, was invited to discuss some of the recordings that he
considered the best of the century _ or, why not?, the millennium.
By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   SPALDING-GRAY-DOMESTICITY (Sag Harbor, N.Y.) _ At home with
Spalding Gray, a question is asked of this monologist who has long
used his life experiences as dramatic material: Now that he has
preserved all his peak paternal experiences to date and presented
them to the public, will this chapter continue to hold his
interest? Will whatever consumes him next diminish his newly
discovered commitment to home? By Robin Pogrebin.
</P>
<P>
   BAROQUE-BRAZIL (Paris) _ A beautifully designed exhibition is
now giving Parisians a chance to discover not only some two dozen
works by the sculptor Aleijadinho, but also other treasures from
the Baroque movement that shaped Brazilian art and architecture
from the early 17th century to the early 19th. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   RIGOLETTO-OPERA-REVIEW (New York) _ Real opera fans relish
nothing more than a nice, contentious debate about a singer, and
Paolo Gavanelli is going to provoke one for sure. The Italian
baritone sang the title role in Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' at the
Metropolitan Opera on Friday night, the first performance this
season of the 1989 Otto Schenk production. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   SITWELL-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ There have been individual
biographies of Edith and Sacheverell and at least two major studies
of the Sitwells as a group and cultural phenomenon. Up to now there
had been no biography of Sir Osbert Sitwell, and Philip Ziegler,
best known for his life of Lord Mountbatten, has written one:
``Osbert Sitwell'' (Knopf). By Richard Eder.

profits and near brushes with bankruptcy, Dictaphone is now nearly
in the black. By Claudia H. Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-NEWS (Undated) _ As they move from a cyberchildhood of
experimentation and starry-eyed possibilities into a sometimes
awkward adolescence on the Web, the nation's largest news
organizations are getting more sure-footed. And as the news site
with largest audience, MSNBC.com is emerging as an exemplar of the
new medium's new self-assurance. By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Madison Avenue has embraced
millennial marketing with the fervor of a zealot _ albeit one who
has banished apocalyptic intimations in favor of the world view
articulated by Mad magazine's Alfred E. Neuman: ``What, me worry?''
By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY-STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Why has Merrill
largely missed out on technology bankers' big bull market? To hear
Merrill Lynch explain it, the firm has not missed out at all; it
simply got a late start. By Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURATE-TIME (Undated) _ Uptight New Year's Eve celebrators
intent on uncorking the Champagne at precisely the right
millisecond of midnight may find themselves in a quandary. Which
clock on Earth offers the most accurate accounting of time? In
fact, there is no single answer. By Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   WARRANTIES-ONLINE (Undated) _ Until recently, online buyers were
spared the experience of a hard sell for extended service
warranties, as most World Wide Web merchants had neglected to offer
extended service plans. Now, however, retailers are looking more
closely at warranty options, for several reasons. By Bob Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL-EAST-TIMOR (Singapore) _ While aid workers help East
Timor's people build an economy and government from ruins, the U.N.
Development Program this month dispatched an official to bring the
World Wide Web to the capital, Dili, and to begin drafting
blueprints for the kind of national data network that is fast
becoming vital to participation in the new information economy. By
Wayne Arnold.

<HEADLINE>
LED BY MSNBC.COM, A NEW JOURNALISTIC FORM DEVELOPS ON THE
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minutes after The Seattle Times disclosed on Dec. 17 that a man
with the makings of a fertilizer bomb in his car trunk had been
arrested in Port Angeles, Wash., news sites across the World Wide
Web were sprinting to deliver details. But no other site gave the
Port Angeles arrest a showcase to match MSNBC.com, the news Web
site that for the last year has consistently commanded the largest
audience.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the Seattle space needle dominated the home page,
overlaid with the headline ``Y2K Plot?'' In slightly smaller type
were the words ``NBC News: Officials fear suspect was part of plan
to bomb Seattle.'' A report by NBC correspondents popped up with
links to the Web site of NBC's Seattle affiliate, KING-TV. Another
link took the reader to a video report by an NBC correspondent.
Another led to a map showing where, according to law-enforcement
authorities, the suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been
active.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC.com report was an archetype of a new journalistic form
and of the emerging values of general news sites as run by major
news organizations. These include speedy, professional crafting of
original material, multimedia options, clean packaging and lots of
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   As they move from a cyberchildhood of experimentation and
starry-eyed possibilities into a sometimes awkward adolescence on
the Web, the nation's largest news organizations are getting more
sure-footed. And as the news site with the largest audience,
MSNBC.com, a partnership of General Electric's NBC and Microsoft,
is emerging as an exemplar of the new medium's new self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The site is also in sync with those who believe that the verb
``to brand'' is not a neologism but an imperative; MSNBC.com puts
the logo of one of its parents, NBC, on everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile its other parent, Microsoft, puts links on its Web
sites to let some of the biggest audiences anywhere on the Web know
that MSNBC.com is the place to go for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSNBC is heavily branded,'' said Tim McGuire, who, as the
senior vice president for new media at The Minneapolis
Star-Tribune, is a professional connoisseur of online news
packaging and a student of what does and does not work in news
delivery on the Web. ``When we come out the other side of this tube
we're in, the big brands will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the site does not ride just on NBC's name or Microsoft's
muscle. ``One of the keys to this whole thing,'' McGuire said, is
``using the information that plays to the medium's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done some interesting things and are creating a new
medium,'' he said. Of course, as he and other newspaper journalists
say, broadcasters are more used to supplying continuous news
updates.
</P>
<P>
   Among MSNBC.com's innovations, according to its editor, Merrill
Brown, are things like short news clips on breaking developments,
taped in the site's offices in Secaucus, N.J., and a navigation
scheme that creates direct paths among scores of pages on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Like CNN Interactive's sites, which MSNBC.com dethroned as the
Web's most-visited news organization earlier this year, it is also
quick to provide supplemental interactive graphic material. A
recent example was an elegant montage that showed how genetic
researchers deconstructed the DNA on chromosome 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal from the beginning has been to package the
experience, instead of giving people endless lists of things _
which for many other news sites is the norm,'' said Brown, who has
been editor in chief of the site since its start in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But MSNBC.com does not live by content alone. The site's ties to
the behemoth sites of Microsoft, which funnel news-hungry audiences
its way, are the envy of its rivals. According to MSNBC.com's
statistics, about one-third of the site's traffic comes from the
pages of MSN.com, the Web site of Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   In October, according to Media Metrix, the Web-audience
measurement firm, MSNBC.com had more than 7 million ``unique''
visitors _ a measure of how many different computer users visited
the site, regardless of how many times each may have returned. The
October figure topped a previous high for news sites that MSNBC.com
reached in July, the month that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s sudden death
drew a record news audience on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The October figure outstripped its rival CNN.com by about 1
million unique visitors _ although Scott Woelfel, the general
manager of CNN Interactive, says that CNN.com's visitors typically
look at more pages a visit than MSNBC.com's audience does.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC.com, with a staff of about 185, has achieved its No. 1
rank chiefly by making deals with an array of partners. The list
includes The Washington Post and Newsweek, the crime reporting site
APBnews.com, the technology news provider ZDNet and a site
specializing in cancer news called oncology.com.
</P>
<P>
   For partners like The Washington Post, MSNBC.com has an enviable
heft. Chris Ma, the senior vice president of
Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, said, ``We felt that we very
much needed a partner who lived in this world to help shepherd our
brand and our product into a multimedia realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers with national reach, like The New York Times and
Gannett's USA Today _ which has the biggest audience of any
newspaper, both in its print and online forms _ find their sites
evolving with ambitions similar to those of the successful
broadcast organizations' sites, like MSNBC.com, cnn.com and
abcnews.com. They want to provide quality information and video
across subjects that include financial news and science and sports,
and they are trying to decide how best to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, both The New York Times and The
Washington Post have moved into the 24-hour news cycle,
establishing links with newsroom editors who channel dispatches to
the sites during the day. The Times on the Web also has updated
financial reports filed by a small financial news staff, operated
by Thestreet.com, a Web operation in which New York Times Co. has a
6.3 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coll, the managing editor of The Washington Post, said in
a recent interview, ``We see the Web as another edition of the
newspaper.'' But, he added, ``it is incumbent on us to make sure
that as we add editions, we maintain a commitment to the same
quality of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Meislin, the editor in chief of the Times' unit Times
Co. Digital, said: ``Our gut instinct is going to be that people
come to The New York Times for news that is the quality of The New

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
announced upbeat earnings news last week, a cheer could be heard in
Silicon Valley. There, both Wall Street investment banks have
flourished, riding the wave of dot-com companies that have enriched
themselves by offering shares to a rapacious public or selling out
to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, another big Wall Street name has been
conspicuously scarce in the Silicon Valley gold rush: Merrill
Lynch. The firm's sideline status has been puzzling, given that as
much as one-quarter of the revenue generated by investment banking
departments these days comes from advising technology companies on
mergers and public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   So why has Merrill largely missed out on technology bankers' big
bull market?
</P>
<P>
   To hear Merrill Lynch explain it, the firm has not missed out at
all; it simply got a late start. Tom Davis, executive vice
president of Merrill's corporate and institutional client group,
said the company was only three years into a multiyear effort to
expand its technology presence worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of what is a long secular shift in the
economy,'' Davis said. Of Merrill's strategy, in particular, he
said, ``I think we are at the early stage of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technology executives have heard that before. When
Merrill set up an office in Palo Alto in 1996, it was the third
attempt to crack Silicon Valley's clubby community, after abortive
efforts in the 1980s and early '90s. Davis said the company had
been too busy expanding other departments to focus much on
technology in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Given its relatively late start, Merrill has made a respectable
showing this year. According to Thomson Financial/Securities Data,
Merrill ranked fourth in taking new technology companies public in
1999, as measured by the amount of money raised. That is a far cry
from 1997, when it did not even rank among the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's total of $2.2 billion in technology underwriting this
year, as calculated by Thomson, gave the firm a market share of 7.8
percent through Dec. 22. Those numbers do not tell the full story,
though. That is still only about half the market share of more
influential rivals like Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston
and Goldman Sachs _ which rank first, second and third,
respectively, in Thomson's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And with the exception of the Internet Capital Group, a Merrill
fan that invests in Internet concerns and which Merrill took public
in August, Merrill has yet to attract the roster of superstar
companies that their larger competitors have.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Goldman and Morgan have been handsomely rewarded
this year, in part, because of their prowess in the technology
sector. Goldman's share price is up 53 percent since the firm went
public in May; Morgan's is up 85 percent for the year. Merrill's
share price, though, is up only 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear to me that they are going to make strides
quickly enough,'' Steven Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., said of Merrill. The concern, Galbraith said, is
that by the time Merrill might catch up in technology, the market
will have moved on to the next hot sector.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that when merger talks between Merrill
and the technology investment boutique Hambrecht &AMP; Quist broke down
two years ago, Merrill missed a ripe opportunity to increase its
presence in technology underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill suffered blows, too, with the loss of high-profile
executives like its president, Herbert M. Allison Jr., a favorite
in Silicon Valley who left the firm earlier this year and joined
the ranks of political fund-raisers, and, more recently, Scott
Ryles, head of technology investment banking, who had helped build
that practice. Ryles left last month to become chief executive of a
new online investment bank backed by Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Merrill has not been a believer in the ``star
system,'' Galbraith said. Having a name-brand stock picker, like
Mary Meeker, the celebrated Morgan Stanley analyst who helped put
that Internet practice on the map, is essential, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   On that count, though, Merrill may now be trying to cultivate a
rising star. In February, it hired a 33-year-old CIBC Oppenheimer
analyst, Henry Blodget, who went way out on a limb last year by
predicting that Amazon.com would hit $400 a share _ a target the
stock not only reached but surpassed. Hiring Blodget, who has
quickly gained a Silicon Valley following, is simply one indication
of the way Merrill Lynch has expanded its technology research
effort, said Steve Milunovich, the firm's global team coordinator
for technology research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer that changing perception is hard,''
Milunovich said. ``Our perception is probably better outside the
valley than in the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Merrill's perception problem was not helped by
comments one of its top executives made about the Internet last
year. A Merrill vice chairman, John Steffens, was criticized after
newspapers quoted him as saying that online trading was akin to
gambling and a ``serious threat to Americans' financial lives.''
Some in Silicon Valley took umbrage, suggesting that if Merrill did
not understand the impact of the Internet on its own business, how
could it understand theirs?
</P>
<P>
   When Steffens, who is known as Launny, subsequently began
extolling the Internet, the perception that he was scrambling to
recover from a faux pas only seemed to make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that Merrill had not lost a piece of business because
of Steffen's comments. But others at the firm wonder how much
potential business landed elsewhere. ``We got tarred for that,''
Milunovich said. ``There's no question that Launny's comments
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of Merrill's best technology credentials has been serving as
a mergers-and-acquisitions banker to the networking giant Cisco
Systems. Merrill got the job because it is one of Cisco's largest
equipment customers. Cisco has an in-house team that does most of
the heavy lifting on its transactions, but Merrill has retained the
client on merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a nice job and we've been pleased with the level of
service,'' said Mike Volpi, Cisco's senior vice president for
business development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Merrill's career as a merger adviser has hit some snags.
Merrill had a very close relationship with the At Home Corp., a
provider of high-speed Internet service for cable television
subscribers. Merrill had helped take At Home public and arranged
for subsequent financings. So it was not surprising the firm was
tapped to advise At Home on its $6.7 billion stock-swap merger in
January with Excite Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the night before the Excite(AT)Home merger was to be
announced, executives at Excite noticed a problem: The total that
At Home would pay in stock was lower than the agreed-to price. In
effect, a miscalculation had been made in the documents, and At
Home's board of directors had to be reconvened to vote again on the
correct amount, according to George Bell, president of
Excite(AT)Home and the former chief executive of Excite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up until 4:30 a.m., they fixed it, and we announced
that morning,'' Bell said. ``Because it wasn't our company, I can't
say it was the bankers' fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever was to blame, industry executives say such last-minute
mishaps are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jermoluk, who had been At Home's chief executive, could
not be reached for comment. But people involved in those talks say
he and executives from the AT&AMP;T Corp., which owned a large stake of
At Home, were enraged at the time. And when the merged
Excite(AT)Home, led by Jermoluk, announced its acquisition of
BlueMountain.com recently, it was not Merrill that was hired to
advise on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shafir, who is in charge of Merrill's technology merger
department in San Francisco, was hard pressed to comment on the
mixup with Excite and At Home except to say the terms were
``discussed and vetted'' with executives and their lawyers.
``Unfortunately, there must have been some misunderstanding,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology boom continues, as many analysts expect,
Merrill may now bear watching. Executives there say that the firm's
technology effort for the first time has the full backing of
Merrill's management. And if the company can transform indeed
itself into the stock-offering powerhouse that it is in other
industries, the next few years could improve Merrill's standing in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perception,'' Davis said, ``lags reality.''

ADVERTISING: MADISON AVENUE PLAYS MILLENNIUM FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also Y2K-TRADEMARKS, Y2K-CONSULTANTS, PATENTS) 
(mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second millennium is ending not with a bang or a whimper but
with a sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has embraced millennial marketing with the fervor
of a zealot _ albeit one who has banished apocalyptic intimations
in favor of the world view articulated by Mad magazine's Alfred E.
Neuman: ``What, me worry?''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about what the year 2000 might bring, particularly in
terms of potential problems with computers, are being played down,
or played for laughs, in almost every advertising campaign centered
on the millennium. It is as if marketers and agencies have
determined that while fear may help peddle mouthwash, life
insurance and antiperspirant, it is not as effective in affiliating
a product with the next thousand years of human history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is being put in a positive light,'' said Marian
Salzman, worldwide director of Brand Futures Group, a unit of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York that specializes in forecasting trends
in consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be perceived as Dr. Doom if everything goes
OK,'' she added, ``so the story has to have a happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Those preparing for the worst on New Year's Day are deemed,
well, a couple of zeroes shy of a millennial milestone. A
commercial for McDonald's, for instance, shows a man eagerly
stockpiling supplies in his storm cellar _ not water and canned
goods, but french fries and ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be fun to poke fun at a guy who's a little
too into the whole thing,'' said Bob Scarpelli, vice chairman and
chief creative officer at the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, the
Omnicom Group unit that produced the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Why make light of year 2000 concerns? ``Most people believe it's
overblown,'' Scarpelli asserted. ``They think: `If something bad
does happen, it happens. We'll deal with it and we'll be fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most surveys of consumers indicate little, if any,
anxiety about the arrival of 2000. A DDB Chicago study last month
found only 11 percent of respondents describing themselves as
worried about the potential aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, those worriers tended to stew as a way of life,
according to the study, expressing concern about everything from
the effects of pollution to becoming a crime victim. They also
tended to be less well educated and less affluent than those who
were not worried about the millennium's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the pessimists are a generally less desirable
consumer market than the optimists. And because Madison Avenue
tends to be populated with perennial optimists, the accentuation of
the positive seems to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   So a commercial for Nike by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore.,
depicts a runner doggedly following his daily routine early on Jan.
1 despite extraordinary disruptions: missiles wobbling across the
sky, tanks rumbling down the street, even a giraffe strolling by,
munching leaves off a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life as we know it, including your morning run, hopefully will
not come to an end,'' said Mike Wilskey, vice president for Nike
U.S. marketing, based in Beaverton, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The spot ``represents who we are,'' he added, ``a company that
does not take itself so damn seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we can make that point, with fun and a sense of
humor, the more people trust us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That upbeat spirit pervades many campaigns. Time Warner's Warner
Brothers Consumer Products unit is sponsoring a daffy promotional
blitz dubbed the ``Mil-Looney-Um,'' after its frenetic Looney Tunes
cartoons, with partners that include the Subway Restaurants chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels like exactly the right move for us,'' said Chris
Carroll, marketing director for Subway Advertising Fund Trust in
Milford, Conn., which oversees the chain's ad spending, because
``it says if you're going to have a party, we've got the perfect
products for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback on the creative has been really strong,'' he
added, referring to animated commercials by the Chicago office of
Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney, part of Publicis SA, ``and it's the first
positive feedback we've had in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, an ad for Evite.com, a World Wide Web site offering
invitations via e-mail, declares, ``This New Year's Eve, make sure
you invite some friends over to clutch in terror when the world
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   A humorous commercial suggests that blackouts and other
disturbances will not faze owners of Toyota Corollas. And
SmithKline Beecham Consumer Health Care is sponsoring a promotion
for Contac cold capsules called the Millennium Bug Contest; prizes
include a New Beetle (a k a the Volkswagen Bug) and a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Armageddon is at hand,'' said Paul Sklar,
brand manager for Contac at SmithKline in Pittsburgh. ``This is a
way to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our alternative?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Are we
going to say, `Don't buy any cold medicine because the world's
going to end and you won't need it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The intensive preparations to prevent computers from
misinterpreting ``2000'' as ``1900'' are spoofed everywhere. The
most common targets are bankers fearful of equipment malfunctions;
several commercials feature automated teller machines that spit out
currency like slot machines paying off jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   Myriad ads mock the phrase ``Y2K compliant.'' Meant originally
as a sort of Good Housekeeping seal of reassurance, it is now
dismissed as words for worrywarts who wear belts with suspenders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Krug Champagne runs ads carrying the headline
``Y2Krug,'' which proclaim the brand is ``fully compliant with the
highest entertaining standards.'' Cows are deemed ``Y2K ready'' in
a silly spot for milk. The new blue credit card from American
Express proclaims itself to be ``Y3K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zabar's, the retailer on the Upper West Side of Manhattan,
advertises knives, coffee makers and water filters with the theme
``Z2K,'' symbolizing ``kitchen preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most prosaic of products, duct tape, is declared ``Y2K
compliant,'' according to billboards by DDB Chicago for Duck brand
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to stay away from being alarmist, from saying, `When
all the lights go out, make sure you have Duck tape on hand,'''
said Gary Medalis, vice president for advertising and
communications at Manco Inc. in Avon, Ohio, the unit of the Henkel
Group that markets Duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says the same thing,'' he added, ``but in a humorous way
that gives it more legs.''
</P>
<P>
   That tongue-in-cheek tone goes back to the first large-scale
campaign using the year 2000 as a theme, which began running in
early 1998. The ads, for the M&AMP;M's brand sold by a unit of Mars
Inc., parodied whatever millennial fever was to come by pretending
to designate M&AMP;M's as the ``official candy of the new millennium''
because M and M, in Roman numerals, equal 2,000, and by setting up
a ``Center for Millennial Hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking it seriously would have been incongruous with the
lighthearted personality of M&AMP;M's,'' said Bill Katz, president of
the brand's agency, BBDO New York, part of BBDO Worldwide division
of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our idea was to make fun of it,'' he added, and do so
``before everyone else gets out there, before the Y2K worriers and
serious millennial marketers come out. And it turned out to be a
very successful promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is playing around with the Big Two-Oh-Oh-Oh.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Anheuser-Busch is selling Budweiser beer in special
packages that include a 46-ounce ``magnum'' bottle sealed with a
cork and labels reading ``Budweiser Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at some humorous approaches to Y2K,'' said Dan
Hoffmann, director for Budweiser marketing at Anheuser-Busch in St.
Louis. ``But we wanted to take a different approach.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the diamond marketer, is urging consumers to celebrate
too. But its campaign, by the New York office of J. Walter Thompson
USA, part of WPP Group, is less reverential than Budweiser's.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads and posters peddle diamond purchases with wry slogans
like ``Every thousand years or so, it's nice to get her something
really special,'' ``Live each millennium as if it's your last,''
``Make this New Year's Eve live up to all the hype'' and ``What are
you waiting for, the year 3000?''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``a lot of people consider it a special year and will
want to give a special gift,'' said Chris D'Rozario, group creative
director at Thompson New York, ``it just makes them receive the
message better if you do it with a smile instead of force-feeding
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people are optimistic about Y2K,'' he added. ``But we
were kind of hoping those who aren't would want to stockpile
diamonds instead of water.''

<P>
   In a rush to capitalize on millenniummania, year 2000 trademark
applications have been tumbling into the Patent and Trademark
Office at a terrific rate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Alan Davidson, executive vice president for
trademarks at MicroPatent, a patent and trademark research company
based in East Haven, Conn., more than 4,400 trademarks now have the
number 2000 in them.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is that handy shorthand ``Y2K.'' ``Before 1995,
there was not a single registration that used `Y2K,''' Davidson
said. ``Now, in one form or another there are currently 400 of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``Y2K''varieties: Y2K Bras; Y2K Beer; PraY2k; OKinY2K;
Y2K Happens; IMY2KRU?; Y2KOK, and Y2Kool.
</P>
<P>
   And Davidson's personal favorite: Y2K Complacent.
</P>
<P>
   As for the word ``millennium,'' it appears in more than 2,200
marks (including all the trademarks that misspell ``millennium'').
More than 200 of them are for the ``official'' this or that of the
millennium. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   The Official Multiple Vitamin of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Mattress of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Donut of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Canned Beef of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Flea Market of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Work Boot of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Condom of the New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So which city had enough hubris to dub itself the ``Official
City of the Millennium''? Paris? Tokyo? New York?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Davidson. San Jose, Calif.

<P>
   Inside ABC News, staff members viewed last week's dismissal of
William Kristol, the conservative commentator, as perhaps only an
initial move in what most conclude is a long overdue reshaping of
the network's faltering Sunday morning discussion program, ``This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If David Westin thinks this is the answer to the show's
problems, he has no idea what's wrong with that show,'' said one
longtime ABC News producer.
</P>
<P>
   But Westin, president of ABC News, gave no indication that he
believed removing Kristol would turn around what has become almost
a ratings freefall for ``This Week.'' And Eileen Murphy, an ABC
News spokeswoman, said that the ouster was only a ``step along the
way'' to addressing the program's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dominant network Sunday talk show, ``This Week'' is now
at best a distant second behind NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' and
lately has often finished an embarrassing third behind CBS's ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin began making moves when he removed the show's longtime
executive producer, Dorrance Smith, in September.
</P>
<P>
   One specific complaint Westin had about the show under Smith was
in its coverage of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which he called
``tedious'' because the voices on the show were all saying mainly
the same critical things about President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The show has declined even further since Smith's departure. He
was replaced by Virginia Mosely, who had been senior producer. No
senior producer has yet been named to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   In its days of glory, ``This Week'' had a single anchor, David
Brinkley. Since he retired, the program has used Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts as dual anchors. Several staff members at ABC News, a
unit of the Walt Disney Co., said the program could not hope to
recover until it focuses on a single anchor.
</P>
<P>
   But Westin ``is not planning any other imminent changes of
personnel,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``Cokie and Sam will remain the
co-anchors.''

   Star Thriller Writer Opts for a New Tack
</P>
<P>
   For readers of airport literature and fans of popular cinema,
the name John Grisham elicits three words: blockbuster legal
thriller. But Grisham is revealing a new side of himself, while
indulging in what some might call vanity publishing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he will publish a semi-autobiographical
literary novel. Thed book, ``A Painted House,'' will be published
over the next year in serial form in The Oxford American, a
bimonthly review of Southern literature of which Grisham has been
co-owner and publisher since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The first 32-page installment appears in the magazine's
January-February 2000 issue, which is on newsstands a month before
Grisham's next legal thriller, ``The Brethren,'' is to be published
by Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Smirnoff, the editor of The Oxford American, said that
Grisham was eager to explore new formats. ``This allows him to try
something new and not interfere with his annual thrillers,''
Smirnoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Painted House'' takes place in the Arkansas delta in the
early 1950s, centers on a family of Arkansas cotton farmers, David
Gernert, Grisham's editor and agent, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a portrait of life in a certain part of the South in a
certain time,'' Gernert said. ``It was so unlike his major books
that we thought we should do something different with it.'' Gernert
said that Doubleday, which has published most of Grisham's legal
novels, would most likely publish this book when it was completed
at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like all things Grisham related, word of the serialization has
caused a frenzy in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually print about 50,000 copies,'' Smirnoff said. ``And
the distributors wanted 400,000 this time.'' The magazine managed
to print 260,000 copies. And Smirnoff said that the magazine had
sent out 1 million direct-mail pieces, exhorting readers to
subscribe for the Grisham-serialization year.
</P>
<P>
   Readers received the solicitation in December, when consumers
tend to be at their most distracted, and were asked to prepay. Both
tactics are considered no-no's in the psychologically delicate
chess game of direct-mail marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to take a lot of his fans by surprise,''
Smirnoff said. ``And if it succeeds, it will be something pretty
new for the industry. If it flops, I am going to have to drag
myself out to a pasture somewhere and do something drastic.''

   Benetton Ads Offer Tour of Death Row
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the Benetton Group S.p.A. became notorious for
politically provocative advertising. The tactic even gained a name,
shockvertising, to describe the Italian company's use of
contentious images to sell its United Colors of Benetton apparel
around the world: an AIDS patient on his deathbed, two horses
procreating, an actor and an actress dressed as a priest and a nun
kissing, victims of genocide and Mafia vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   For the new decade, Benetton is at it again. Oliviero Toscani,
Benetton's creative director and editorial director of Colors, the
Benetton magazine, is producing a 96-page brochure of photographs
of inmates on death row in prisons in seven states. The images are
accompanied by interviews conducted by Ken Shulman, a journalist
based in Cambridge, Mass.; the inmates are identified by name and
the dates they have been sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, we hate the death penalty,'' Toscani said. ``I'm
pretty sure that one day it won't exist any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The brochure is to be distributed in 13 languages in 60
countries, making its first appearance in the United States in the
form of consecutive advertising pages in the February issue of Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intensely controversial subject, a thought-provoking
campaign that's perfect for us,'' said Ronald A. Galotti, president
and publisher of Talk magazine in New York. The magazine is a joint
venture of the Hearst Corp. and the Miramax Film Corp., part of the
Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Talk is running the ads, because
Toscani, in addition to his duties at Benetton and Colors, has been
hired by Talk as creative director to retool the magazine's look.
</P>
<P>
   There was no quid pro quo, Galotti said, adding that ``his
people back in Italy made the decision'' to spend the amount in
``seven figures'' to buy the advertising space.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were only that easy'' to sell ad pages, Galotti said,
laughing. ``Anybody who could come with 100 ad pages, we'd hire.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John H. Duerden well remembers his surprise four years ago when
Stonington Partners, the buyout firm that had just bought the
Dictaphone Corp., asked him to be Dictaphone's new chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, my God, Dictaphone, are they still in business?''
Duerden recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was yes _ but not so that anyone would notice.
Dictaphone, which was founded in 1888 by Alexander Graham Bell and
was once synonymous with business dictating equipment, had pretty
much faded from public view.
</P>
<P>
   The company was profitable, but not astoundingly so. It was
growing, but only at 3 percent a year. Though it had developed new
products in the 16 years that it had been part of Pitney Bowes
before Stonington bought Dictaphone, even the newest of them was
getting gray. And though the days of executives dictating letters
were on the wane, Dictaphone _ despite its competence in recording
voices _ had never capitalized on the boom in voice mail, cellular
telephones and the like.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stonington call came, Duerden, a former Xerox
executive, had just resigned from the top sales job at Reebok
International. Although he was en route to an executive slot at
Nike, he was tempted by the ``fantastic offer in money and stock''
that Dictaphone's owner dangled. But what hooked him, he said, was
reading the prospectus and recognizing a vast potential in using
voice as a tool for communicating over computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Duerden, 59, had lived through Xerox's first encounters with
digital document processing technologies. So he was attuned to the
transitional possibilities at Dictaphone. ``For too long,
Dictaphone thought of its core competency as word processing,'' he
said. ``It's not. It's recording, storing and retrieving data that
happens to enter the system as voice.''
</P>
<P>
   That became his strategy for the company. And after a sometimes
stumbling overhaul that involved several years of depressed sales,
declining profits and near brushes with bankruptcy, Dictaphone is
now nearly in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Duerden knew worldwide sales and marketing from Reebok,
he had a grasp of technology and office equipment from Xerox, and
we figured he could take Dictaphone to a higher level,'' said Trey
Fitzgibbons, a partner at Stonington, which plans a public offering
of Dictaphone stock sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone does have a few products that use IBM technology to
convert dictated files into text, but voice recognition is not a
major component in Dictaphone's product lines as yet. The company
does plan to introduce products for medical applications next year
that will utilize speech recognition software. While such products
might wreak havoc on the job market for human transcribers, they
could be a major boon to Dictaphone's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Dictaphone, based in Stratford, Conn., still derives
most of its sales from office dictating equipment _ albeit newer
digital models that allow executives to download the dictation onto
a computer network that can be retrieved by human transcribers. But
the company's future, as Duerden sees it, lies with medical
records-keeping, as well as systems to log, monitor and trace
telephone calls to customer help desks, financial trading floors
and 911 emergency lines.
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone's older products had long been used in those markets.
But most of them required scrolling through lengthy tapes to find a
particular call, and they needed to be manually transcribed to be
entered into a computer system as text files.
</P>
<P>
   Duerden figured Dictaphone had to offer a medical product that
would enable doctors to get accurate transcriptions of patient
information with minimum delay, and enable hospitals to
automatically use that information to update patient records as
well as send bills out more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For help desks and other call-center customers, he decided the
company had to provide systems that not only retrieved archived
calls more easily, but that tracked those calls if the customer had
been handed off to several agents.
</P>
<P>
   The company needed products, in other words, that would help
Dictaphone clients provide better service to their own customers.
Dictaphone now contends that it has such products. In June, the
company introduced Da Vinci, a Windows-based system for recording
and monitoring calls at large call centers. A product that can cost
as much as $400,000 to buy and install, Da Vinci already counts
America Online, First Union National Bank and Wal-Mart Stores among
its customers. In October, Dictaphone followed with Freedom, a
smaller version that sells for as little as $6,000 for a setup that
can handle four workers. Capital Blue Cross and several small
police departments have already ordered Freedom systems.
</P>
<P>
   On the medical front, Dictaphone is developing an Internet-based
system in which Dictaphone will accept dictated files from doctors
and return partly-edited transcripts. Another offering, Enterprise
Express, which can convert a doctor's dictation to an e-mail voice
attachment, already is selling well to hospitals, despite price
tags that range from $200,000 to $3 million. The product,
introduced in 1997, has already captured 55 percent of the health
care market and ``is turning into one of Dictaphone's most
important product lines,'' said John J. Helms, a high-yield bond
analyst at the APS Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Initial users seem pleased. Doctors affiliated with the Covenant
Health System, a network of four hospitals in Lubbock, Texas, can
examine patients in their offices, send a patient to the hospital,
then phone in relevant information that is recorded as a digitized
voice file. A central computer logs in the file and automatically
assigns it to the next available human transcriber. Often, the
voice file is already logged in and partly transcribed by the time
the patient reaches the hospital, according to Lyn Moore,
Covenant's director of health information management.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Radiologists, cardiologists and pathologists who are conducting
medical tests on the hospital premises use some 20 Enterprise
Express phone stations scattered around the hospital to dictate
test results that will be added to patient records.
</P>
<P>
   The system can handle simultaneous dictation by 112 physicians,
more than 10 percent of the hospital's physician team. And Ms.
Moore called the voice quality superb. ``The transcriptionists tell
me it's as though the dictator was in the room,'' she said.
``That's cut errors and transcriber turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone, as it lays plans for a stock offering, is getting an
ever-warmer reception on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd talked about going IPO nine months ago, everyone
would have laughed,'' said George Edwards, a portfolio manager at
Prudential Investments whose holdings include Dictaphone's
high-yield bonds. ``But the numbers are stronger, and there are
visible new products.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is still laboring under a heavy debt load from
Stonington's $462 million buyout in 1995. And its revenue was up
only 4 percent in the first nine months of 1999, to $264 million.
But Duerden said that sales were up 12 percent in the third
quarter, compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And the company cut its losses to $4.6 million during the last
nine months, compared with a loss of $26.9 million for the first
nine months of 1998. Moreover, Dictaphone's nine-month operating
profit _ a number that does not include interest payments _ was
$27.5 million, compared with just $2.2 million for the first nine
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dictaphone's path has been strewn with boulder-size
obstacles. When Duerden took over the company, it had 550 sales
people and 700 service people, few of whom had the expertise to
sell digital products to doctors or police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone let many of these employees go, figuring that
independent dealers could sell their low-end products. But dealers
have been lukewarm to the products, particularly overseas, and
Dictaphone's office-equipment revenue has declined. And the
sales-force reduction did little to trim Dictaphone's costs, since
the cuts were largely offset by the cadre of programmers and
digitally savvy sales people who were needed for its new products.
</P>
<P>
   Duerden also has made some expensive mistakes. He made a
last-ditch attempt to introduce a voice mail product, but found
that Lucent Technologies and other well-heeled competitors had the
market locked up. And he licensed a product from an Australian
company that was meant to replace court stenographers with
recording and transcription devices. But the system was expensive
and complicated to use, and judges were skeptical. Unable to
finance a marketing blitz to win them over, Dictaphone pulled the
plug last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spread our net too widely,'' Duerden said, ``and we brought
Da Vinci and Freedom to market a year later than we would have
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay has hurt the company, which is playing technological
catch-up with competitors like Lanier Worldwide in the medical
market, and Nice Systems Ltd. of Israel in the call-center world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dictaphone has a shot at a reasonable market share, but they
are too late to ever be leaders,'' said Victor Halpert, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the contrast to Nice is sobering. Nice's sales
skyrocketed to $120 million this year from just $5 million in 1994,
when it first branched out from military intelligence systems to
systems for recording and tracking call-center communications.
Benny Levin, Nice's chairman, predicts sales will hit $500 million
in five years, as he uses the company's publicly traded stock and
$110 million in cash on hand to acquire other companies. ``We won't
let what happened to Dictaphone happen to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duerden readily acknowledges the implied criticism. ``Benny
jumped our technology by three years, forcing us to reconfigure Da
Vinci before we could even introduce it,'' he said. ``You can't
discount these kinds of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a miserable 1998 _ a year in which Dictaphone
consistently lost money _ Dictaphone is finally back on its fiscal
feet. The digital products are easier and cheaper to make than
their tape-based predecessors, which bodes well for Dictaphone's
profit margins. It is using some of its excess manufacturing
capacity to make facsimile machines for Pitney Bowes and to
assemble circuit boards for Monarch Electronics, another former
Pitney Bowes subsidiary. The manufacturing business is bringing in
about $50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone has also revved up overseas sales to call-center
customers, and now counts the London offices of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and the Bank of Nova Scotia among its users in Britain and
Canada, and is signing up distributors in the Far East. And it is
talking to Siemens and other computer companies about including
Dictaphone recording and tracking systems in some of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stonington, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, financed the
Dictaphone purchase with high-yield bonds, and from the first
Dictaphone was saddled with $40 million annual interest on a $350
million debt. For a company whose sales barely hit that level, it
was an onerous load.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generated $64 million from operations, and immediately had
to funnel $40 million toward interest,'' recalled Joseph
Skrzypczak, a former Pitney Bowes executive who is now Dictaphone's
chief financial officer. ``Take another $12 million or so out for
maintaining computers and other capital investments, and you don't
have a lot left for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Dictaphone's income from operations was down to
$31 million, not enough to service debt, let alone develop products
and upgrade computer systems. Stonington made up the shortfall,
though. And, analysts estimate that Dictaphone's operating income
is back near $60 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching the time when we're ready for the public
markets, and we're happy we own Dictaphone now,'' Fitzgibbons said.
``But there were certainly times we wondered if we hadn't overpaid
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone still labors under $345 million in debt, and
Skrzypczak concedes that its interest payments and modernization
expenses leave it little breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference, though, is that in 1995 all we had was debt
and old products,'' he said. ``This time we've replenished our
product line.''

PATENTS: REVOKING RIGHTS FOR YEAR 2000 SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (See also MILLENNIUM-AD-COLUMN, Y2K-TRADEMARKS, Y2K-CONSULTANTS) 
(lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies that are dreading possible year 2000 computer problems
may have one less thing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the U.S. patents commissioner took a first step
toward revoking a controversial patent, which some fear would
entitle its inventor to millions, perhaps billions, of dollars in
royalties on a technology that underlies many Y2K computer fixes.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for a patents commissioner to order the
re-examination of a patent, but such an action usually results in
the patent being revoked.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the patents commissioner, Todd Dickinson, was widely
praised. ``Commissioner Dickinson has made a courageous decision
here,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The patent under re-examination covers ``windowing,'' a popular
quick-fix technique that can help software to make an educated
guess about whether a two-digit date is meant to indicate the 20th
century or the 21st century. The approach may enable a computer to
avert the so-called millennium bug, in which computers that have
not been fixed may read the year ``00'' as 1900 or not recognize it
at all, resulting in potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor, Bruce Dickens, of Irvine, Calif., bought the
rights to patent 5,806,063 for $10,000 in April from his employer
McDonnell Douglas, now owned by Boeing. The patent had been granted
in 1998, but the company had never made wide use of Dickens'
technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Dickens is a malicious individual trying to pull
a fast one _ he probably thinks this is an original idea,'' Miller
said. ``But every indication is that windowing has been around for
years and maybe decades. We find the idea of patenting it
laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickens' newly formed company, Dickens2000, has sent out
hundreds of letters to large companies seeking first-year royalty
payments of $25,000 for every $1 billion in a company's annual
revenue. For companies that did not sign up until after Jan. 1, the
rate would go up 100-fold _ to $2.5 million for every $1 billion in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   William Cray, Dickens' attorney, said that his client had signed
up some licensees, which he declined to name. Dickens ``welcomes
the opportunity to have the Patent Office reconsider the patent,''
Cray said. ``He believes it's distinguishable from other prior art
and feels this will enable him to clarify his patent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Aharonian, who publishes a patent news service on the
Internet and is a frequent critic of the Patent Office, said the
Dickens patent was just one of many software patents that are
dubious because they do not cite ``prior art'' _ inventions that
are similar in nature to the one claimed in a patent application.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the PTO has done an atrocious job searching out
the prior art for the dozens of Y2K patents that have issued,''
Aharonian wrote in one of his Internet Patent News dispatches last
week. ``Frankly, if it is going to re-examine the Dickens patent,
it might as well re-examine all the Y2K patents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Merges, a professor of law at the University of
California in Berkeley, was encouraged by what has happened in the
case of Dickens' Y2K patent. In recent years, he said, there has
been much debate about whether software should be patentable at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that software is, beyond all doubt, patentable, we need to
start weeding out the good inventions from the bad ones,'' Merges
said.
</P>
<P>
   And an efficient way to do that is through the Internet, he
said. Dickens' patent generated a good deal of discussion on the
Web, with several sites (among them, Miller's association at
www.itaa.org) posting numerous examples of pertinent prior art.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The far-flung contributors to this discussion have a great
deal of collective power,'' Merges said. ``By pulling together what
might have been isolated references _ a trade journal story here, a
technical paper there, an old software program sold on the market
years ago, even unpublished university or corporate research _ they
can assemble formidable collections of prior art.''
</P>
<P>
   This prior art, in turn, can be used to invalidate bad software
patents, and thereby prevent holders of dubious patents from
shaking down companies for undeserved royalties, Merges said.
</P>
<P>
   But what if this type of prior-art policing does not work and
technological innovation starts sinking in a quicksand of patent
litigation?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that some kind of
prescriptive legislation might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one of the most vexing issues facing
Congress this year and in the next few years,'' Schumer said. ``As
a country we value intellectual property rights. But the recent
expansion of what is patentable could have a detrimental effect on
the technological expansion of our economy.''

   Inside ABC News, staff members viewed last week's dismissal of
William Kristol, the conservative commentator, as perhaps only an
initial move in what most conclude is a long overdue reshaping of
the network's faltering Sunday morning discussion program, ``This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If David Westin thinks this is the answer to the show's
problems, he has no idea what's wrong with that show,'' said one
longtime ABC News producer.
</P>
<P>
   But Westin, president of ABC News, gave no indication that he
believed removing Kristol would turn around what has become almost
a ratings freefall for ``This Week.'' And Eileen Murphy, an ABC
News spokeswoman, said that the ouster was only a ``step along the
way'' to addressing the program's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dominant network Sunday talk show, ``This Week'' is now
at best a distant second behind NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' and
lately has often finished an embarrassing third behind CBS's ``Face
the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin began making moves when he removed the show's longtime
executive producer, Dorrance Smith, in September.
</P>
<P>
   One specific complaint Westin had about the show under Smith was
in its coverage of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which he called
``tedious'' because the voices on the show were all saying mainly
the same critical things about President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The show has declined even further since Smith's departure. He
was replaced by Virginia Mosely, who had been senior producer. No
senior producer has yet been named to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   In its days of glory, ``This Week'' had a single anchor, David
Brinkley. Since he retired, the program has used Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts as dual anchors. Several staff members at ABC News, a
unit of the Walt Disney Co., said the program could not hope to
recover until it focuses on a single anchor.
</P>
<P>
   But Westin ``is not planning any other imminent changes of
personnel,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``Cokie and Sam will remain the
co-anchors.''

   Star Thriller Writer Opts for a New Tack
</P>
<P>
   For readers of airport literature and fans of popular cinema,
the name John Grisham elicits three words: blockbuster legal
thriller. But Grisham is revealing a new side of himself, while
indulging in what some might call vanity publishing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he will publish a semi-autobiographical
literary novel. Thed book, ``A Painted House,'' will be published
over the next year in serial form in The Oxford American, a
bimonthly review of Southern literature of which Grisham has been
co-owner and publisher since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The first 32-page installment appears in the magazine's
January-February 2000 issue, which is on newsstands a month before
Grisham's next legal thriller, ``The Brethren,'' is to be published
by Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Smirnoff, the editor of The Oxford American, said that
Grisham was eager to explore new formats. ``This allows him to try
something new and not interfere with his annual thrillers,''
Smirnoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Painted House'' takes place in the Arkansas delta in the
early 1950s, centers on a family of Arkansas cotton farmers, David
Gernert, Grisham's editor and agent, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a portrait of life in a certain part of the South in a
certain time,'' Gernert said. ``It was so unlike his major books
that we thought we should do something different with it.'' Gernert
said that Doubleday, which has published most of Grisham's legal
novels, would most likely publish this book when it was completed
at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like all things Grisham related, word of the serialization has
caused a frenzy in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually print about 50,000 copies,'' Smirnoff said. ``And
the distributors wanted 400,000 this time.'' The magazine managed
to print 260,000 copies. And Smirnoff said that the magazine had
sent out 1 million direct-mail pieces, exhorting readers to
subscribe for the Grisham-serialization year.
</P>
<P>
   Readers received the solicitation in December, when consumers
tend to be at their most distracted, and were asked to prepay. Both
tactics are considered no-no's in the psychologically delicate
chess game of direct-mail marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to take a lot of his fans by surprise,''
Smirnoff said. ``And if it succeeds, it will be something pretty
new for the industry. If it flops, I am going to have to drag
myself out to a pasture somewhere and do something drastic.''
</P>

   Benetton Ads Offer Tour of Death Row
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the Benetton Group S.p.A. became notorious for
politically provocative advertising. The tactic even gained a name,
shockvertising, to describe the Italian company's use of
contentious images to sell its United Colors of Benetton apparel
around the world: an AIDS patient on his deathbed, two horses
procreating, an actor and an actress dressed as a priest and a nun
kissing, victims of genocide and Mafia vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   For the new decade, Benetton is at it again. Oliviero Toscani,
Benetton's creative director and editorial director of Colors, the
Benetton magazine, is producing a 96-page brochure of photographs
of inmates on death row in prisons in seven states. The images are
accompanied by interviews conducted by Ken Shulman, a journalist
based in Cambridge, Mass.; the inmates are identified by name and
the dates they have been sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, we hate the death penalty,'' Toscani said. ``I'm
pretty sure that one day it won't exist any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The brochure is to be distributed in 13 languages in 60
countries, making its first appearance in the United States in the
form of consecutive advertising pages in the February issue of Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intensely controversial subject, a thought-provoking
campaign that's perfect for us,'' said Ronald A. Galotti, president
and publisher of Talk magazine in New York. The magazine is a joint
venture of the Hearst Corp. and the Miramax Film Corp., part of the
Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Talk is running the ads, because
Toscani, in addition to his duties at Benetton and Colors, has been
hired by Talk as creative director to retool the magazine's look.
</P>
<P>
   There was no quid pro quo, Galotti said, adding that ``his
people back in Italy made the decision'' to spend the amount in
``seven figures'' to buy the advertising space.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were only that easy'' to sell ad pages, Galotti said,
laughing. ``Anybody who could come with 100 ad pages, we'd hire.''

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second millennium is ending not with a bang or a whimper but
with a sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has embraced millennial marketing with the fervor
of a zealot _ albeit one who has banished apocalyptic intimations
in favor of the world view articulated by Mad magazine's Alfred E.
Neuman: ``What, me worry?''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about what the year 2000 might bring, particularly in
terms of potential problems with computers, are being played down,
or played for laughs, in almost every advertising campaign centered
on the millennium. It is as if marketers and agencies have
determined that while fear may help peddle mouthwash, life
insurance and antiperspirant, it is not as effective in affiliating
a product with the next thousand years of human history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is being put in a positive light,'' said Marian
Salzman, worldwide director of Brand Futures Group, a unit of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York that specializes in forecasting trends
in consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be perceived as Dr. Doom if everything goes
OK,'' she added, ``so the story has to have a happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Those preparing for the worst on New Year's Day are deemed,
well, a couple of zeroes shy of a millennial milestone. A
commercial for McDonald's, for instance, shows a man eagerly
stockpiling supplies in his storm cellar _ not water and canned
goods, but french fries and ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be fun to poke fun at a guy who's a little
too into the whole thing,'' said Bob Scarpelli, vice chairman and
chief creative officer at the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, the
Omnicom Group unit that produced the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Why make light of year 2000 concerns? ``Most people believe it's
overblown,'' Scarpelli asserted. ``They think: `If something bad
does happen, it happens. We'll deal with it and we'll be fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most surveys of consumers indicate little, if any,
anxiety about the arrival of 2000. A DDB Chicago study last month
found only 11 percent of respondents describing themselves as
worried about the potential aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, those worriers tended to stew as a way of life,
according to the study, expressing concern about everything from
the effects of pollution to becoming a crime victim. They also
tended to be less well educated and less affluent than those who
were not worried about the millennium's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the pessimists are a generally less desirable
consumer market than the optimists. And because Madison Avenue
tends to be populated with perennial optimists, the accentuation of
the positive seems to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   So a commercial for Nike by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore.,
depicts a runner doggedly following his daily routine early on Jan.
1 despite extraordinary disruptions: missiles wobbling across the
sky, tanks rumbling down the street, even a giraffe strolling by,
munching leaves off a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life as we know it, including your morning run, hopefully will
not come to an end,'' said Mike Wilskey, vice president for Nike
U.S. marketing, based in Beaverton, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The spot ``represents who we are,'' he added, ``a company that
does not take itself so damn seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we can make that point, with fun and a sense of
humor, the more people trust us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That upbeat spirit pervades many campaigns. Time Warner's Warner
Brothers Consumer Products unit is sponsoring a daffy promotional
blitz dubbed the ``Mil-Looney-Um,'' after its frenetic Looney Tunes
cartoons, with partners that include the Subway Restaurants chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels like exactly the right move for us,'' said Chris
Carroll, marketing director for Subway Advertising Fund Trust in
Milford, Conn., which oversees the chain's ad spending, because
``it says if you're going to have a party, we've got the perfect
products for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback on the creative has been really strong,'' he
added, referring to animated commercials by the Chicago office of
Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney, part of Publicis SA, ``and it's the first
positive feedback we've had in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, an ad for Evite.com, a World Wide Web site offering
invitations via e-mail, declares, ``This New Year's Eve, make sure
you invite some friends over to clutch in terror when the world
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   A humorous commercial suggests that blackouts and other
disturbances will not faze owners of Toyota Corollas. And
SmithKline Beecham Consumer Health Care is sponsoring a promotion
for Contac cold capsules called the Millennium Bug Contest; prizes
include a New Beetle (a k a the Volkswagen Bug) and a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Armageddon is at hand,'' said Paul Sklar,
brand manager for Contac at SmithKline in Pittsburgh. ``This is a
way to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our alternative?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Are we
going to say, `Don't buy any cold medicine because the world's
going to end and you won't need it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The intensive preparations to prevent computers from
misinterpreting ``2000'' as ``1900'' are spoofed everywhere. The
most common targets are bankers fearful of equipment malfunctions;
several commercials feature automated teller machines that spit out
currency like slot machines paying off jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   Myriad ads mock the phrase ``Y2K compliant.'' Meant originally
as a sort of Good Housekeeping seal of reassurance, it is now
dismissed as words for worrywarts who wear belts with suspenders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Krug Champagne runs ads carrying the headline
``Y2Krug,'' which proclaim the brand is ``fully compliant with the
highest entertaining standards.'' Cows are deemed ``Y2K ready'' in
a silly spot for milk. The new blue credit card from American
Express proclaims itself to be ``Y3K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zabar's, the retailer on the Upper West Side of Manhattan,
advertises knives, coffee makers and water filters with the theme
``Z2K,'' symbolizing ``kitchen preparedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most prosaic of products, duct tape, is declared ``Y2K
compliant,'' according to billboards by DDB Chicago for Duck brand
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to stay away from being alarmist, from saying, `When
all the lights go out, make sure you have Duck tape on hand,'''
said Gary Medalis, vice president for advertising and
communications at Manco Inc. in Avon, Ohio, the unit of the Henkel
Group that markets Duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says the same thing,'' he added, ``but in a humorous way
that gives it more legs.''
</P>
<P>
   That tongue-in-cheek tone goes back to the first large-scale
campaign using the year 2000 as a theme, which began running in
early 1998. The ads, for the M&AMP;M's brand sold by a unit of Mars
Inc., parodied whatever millennial fever was to come by pretending
to designate M&AMP;M's as the ``official candy of the new millennium''
because M and M, in Roman numerals, equal 2,000, and by setting up
a ``Center for Millennial Hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking it seriously would have been incongruous with the
lighthearted personality of M&AMP;M's,'' said Bill Katz, president of
the brand's agency, BBDO New York, part of BBDO Worldwide division
of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our idea was to make fun of it,'' he added, and do so
``before everyone else gets out there, before the Y2K worriers and
serious millennial marketers come out. And it turned out to be a
very successful promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is playing around with the Big Two-Oh-Oh-Oh.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Anheuser-Busch is selling Budweiser beer in special
packages that include a 46-ounce ``magnum'' bottle sealed with a
cork and labels reading ``Budweiser Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at some humorous approaches to Y2K,'' said Dan
Hoffmann, director for Budweiser marketing at Anheuser-Busch in St.
Louis. ``But we wanted to take a different approach.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the diamond marketer, is urging consumers to celebrate
too. But its campaign, by the New York office of J. Walter Thompson
USA, part of WPP Group, is less reverential than Budweiser's.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads and posters peddle diamond purchases with wry slogans
like ``Every thousand years or so, it's nice to get her something
really special,'' ``Live each millennium as if it's your last,''
``Make this New Year's Eve live up to all the hype'' and ``What are
you waiting for, the year 3000?''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``a lot of people consider it a special year and will
want to give a special gift,'' said Chris D'Rozario, group creative
director at Thompson New York, ``it just makes them receive the
message better if you do it with a smile instead of force-feeding
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people are optimistic about Y2K,'' he added. ``But we
were kind of hoping those who aren't would want to stockpile
diamonds instead of water.''

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minutes after The Seattle Times disclosed on Dec. 17 that a man
with the makings of a fertilizer bomb in his car trunk had been
arrested in Port Angeles, Wash., news sites across the World Wide
Web were sprinting to deliver details. But no other site gave the
Port Angeles arrest a showcase to match MSNBC.com, the news Web
site that for the last year has consistently commanded the largest
audience.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the Seattle space needle dominated the home page,
overlaid with the headline ``Y2K Plot?'' In slightly smaller type
were the words ``NBC News: Officials fear suspect was part of plan
to bomb Seattle.'' A report by NBC correspondents popped up with
links to the Web site of NBC's Seattle affiliate, KING-TV. Another
link took the reader to a video report by an NBC correspondent.
Another led to a map showing where, according to law-enforcement
authorities, the suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been
active.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC.com report was an archetype of a new journalistic form
and of the emerging values of general news sites as run by major
news organizations. These include speedy, professional crafting of
original material, multimedia options, clean packaging and lots of
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   As they move from a cyberchildhood of experimentation and
starry-eyed possibilities into a sometimes awkward adolescence on
the Web, the nation's largest news organizations are getting more
sure-footed. And as the news site with the largest audience,
MSNBC.com, a partnership of General Electric's NBC and Microsoft,
is emerging as an exemplar of the new medium's new self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The site is also in sync with those who believe that the verb
``to brand'' is not a neologism but an imperative; MSNBC.com puts
the logo of one of its parents, NBC, on everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile its other parent, Microsoft, puts links on its Web
sites to let some of the biggest audiences anywhere on the Web know
that MSNBC.com is the place to go for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSNBC is heavily branded,'' said Tim McGuire, who, as the
senior vice president for new media at The Minneapolis
Star-Tribune, is a professional connoisseur of online news
packaging and a student of what does and does not work in news
delivery on the Web. ``When we come out the other side of this tube
we're in, the big brands will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the site does not ride just on NBC's name or Microsoft's
muscle. ``One of the keys to this whole thing,'' McGuire said, is
``using the information that plays to the medium's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done some interesting things and are creating a new
medium,'' he said. Of course, as he and other newspaper journalists
say, broadcasters are more used to supplying continuous news
updates.
</P>
<P>
   Among MSNBC.com's innovations, according to its editor, Merrill
Brown, are things like short news clips on breaking developments,
taped in the site's offices in Secaucus, N.J., and a navigation
scheme that creates direct paths among scores of pages on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Like CNN Interactive's sites, which MSNBC.com dethroned as the
Web's most-visited news organization earlier this year, it is also
quick to provide supplemental interactive graphic material. A
recent example was an elegant montage that showed how genetic
researchers deconstructed the DNA on chromosome 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal from the beginning has been to package the
experience, instead of giving people endless lists of things _
which for many other news sites is the norm,'' said Brown, who has
been editor in chief of the site since its start in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But MSNBC.com does not live by content alone. The site's ties to
the behemoth sites of Microsoft, which funnel news-hungry audiences
its way, are the envy of its rivals. According to MSNBC.com's
statistics, about one-third of the site's traffic comes from the
pages of MSN.com, the Web site of Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   In October, according to Media Metrix, the Web-audience
measurement firm, MSNBC.com had more than 7 million ``unique''
visitors _ a measure of how many different computer users visited
the site, regardless of how many times each may have returned. The
October figure topped a previous high for news sites that MSNBC.com
reached in July, the month that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s sudden death
drew a record news audience on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The October figure outstripped its rival CNN.com by about 1
million unique visitors _ although Scott Woelfel, the general
manager of CNN Interactive, says that CNN.com's visitors typically
look at more pages a visit than MSNBC.com's audience does.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC.com, with a staff of about 185, has achieved its No. 1
rank chiefly by making deals with an array of partners. The list
includes The Washington Post and Newsweek, the crime reporting site
APBnews.com, the technology news provider ZDNet and a site
specializing in cancer news called oncology.com.
</P>
<P>
   For partners like The Washington Post, MSNBC.com has an enviable
heft. Chris Ma, the senior vice president of
Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive, said, ``We felt that we very
much needed a partner who lived in this world to help shepherd our
brand and our product into a multimedia realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers with national reach, like The New York Times and
Gannett's USA Today _ which has the biggest audience of any
newspaper, both in its print and online forms _ find their sites
evolving with ambitions similar to those of the successful
broadcast organizations' sites, like MSNBC.com, cnn.com and
abcnews.com. They want to provide quality information and video
across subjects that include financial news and science and sports,
and they are trying to decide how best to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, both The New York Times and The
Washington Post have moved into the 24-hour news cycle,
establishing links with newsroom editors who channel dispatches to
the sites during the day. The Times on the Web also has updated
financial reports filed by a small financial news staff, operated
by Thestreet.com, a Web operation in which New York Times Co. has a
6.3 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coll, the managing editor of The Washington Post, said in
a recent interview, ``We see the Web as another edition of the
newspaper.'' But, he added, ``it is incumbent on us to make sure
that as we add editions, we maintain a commitment to the same
quality of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Meislin, the editor in chief of the Times' unit Times
Co. Digital, said: ``Our gut instinct is going to be that people
come to The New York Times for news that is the quality of The New
York Times newspaper and they would like to have that throughout
the day.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a cold front that crossed the Northeast, readings
will average 10 degrees colder on Monday afternoon than they were
Sunday. Very strong, gusty winds from the northwest will add to the
numbing chill. On the southern and eastern shores of the Great
Lakes, snow showers and squalls will produce measurable snowfalls
in the traditional lake effect snow regions. Meanwhile, east of the
Appalachians, clouds will break and mix with sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, high and middle clouds will streak across the
Gulf Coast into the panhandle of Florida. To the north, skies will
be partly cloudy with an isolated flurry in southern Missouri as a
jet stream disturbance crosses the region. Meanwhile, clouds and
drizzle will continue to plague the Rio Grande Valley and spread
into much of south Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It will remain chilly in the northern Great Lakes, where
readings will stay in the teens throughout the day. However, warmer
weather will approach from the west as mild Pacific air moves
inland. Some locations in the western Dakotas and eastern Montana
will see readings more typical of early November as winds from the
west descend the Rockies and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of dense fog will persist in the interior of Washington
as burly high pressure overhead prevents moisture near the surface
from mixing into the drier upper levels of the atmosphere. Farther
south, much of California will remain mild and sunny, although a
few patches of high clouds will drift across the central sections.
It will be sunny and seasonable in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Melting the Icebox
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, International Falls, Minn., recorded their
highest temperature for the date with a reading of 45 degrees.
Meanwhile, Atlanta only had a high of 41 degrees on Christmas. This
unusual occurrence was the result of a large dip in the jet stream
bringing chilly air far into the Southeast. At the same time,
strong surface winds from the southwest in International Falls
pushed the mercury upward. Despite cooling off Sunday behind a cold
front, milder Pacific air will again move into the northern Plains
later this week, bringing unseasonably high readings to the
region. &QL;

 &HT;    Attempts to change calendar strong, but largely unsuccessful
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Alan Dechert was once a fringe
presidential candidate whose anti-nuke message faded before the
1988 Iowa caucuses. But he didn't really learn about longshot
campaigns until he tried to change the way the world reckons time.
</P>
<P>
   With 1999 in its waning days and sales of his ``Year Zero
Calendar'' languishing at a few hundred, Dechert concedes there's
no global groundswell to scrap centuries of religious, cultural and
business tradition and recognize 2000 as the year 0 instead.
</P>
<P>
   But the California computer programmer isn't giving up his
lonely pursuit of calendar reform. Nor is Randy Bruner, a
Cincinnati psychic who believes 2000 will bring a ``mind shift''
and widespread acceptance of his New Age adaptation of the ancient
Mayan calendar. And International World Calendar Association leader
Norman Lindhjem of Bend, Ore., keeps plodding on even though he's
the reform group's only member.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a long and futile tradition. French
Revolutionists, Kodak founder George Eastman, United Nations
functionaries and other pamphleteers and proselytizers have all
tried and failed to dislodge the inelegant Gregorian calendar and
its politically incorrect cousin, the Anno Domini scheme of
numbering years.
</P>
<P>
   Some have wanted to redefine history. Others have simply been
bugged by the calendar's uneven months and the fact that dates
never fall on the same day of the week from one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The scattered tribes of modern reformism would seem to have to
have a wider audience as 2000 approaches. Calendrical curiosity is
soaring. There's been revived interest, for example, in Dionysius
Exiguus, the sixth-century monk who came up with the current system
of numbering years from the birth of Jesus Christ. A computer
search for published references to the B.C. and A.D. impresario
shows more than 200 mentions this year, compared to only 74 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But such interest hasn't spilled over to calendar reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium fatigue,'' suggests a disappointed Rick McCarty, a
philosophy professor at East Carolina University in Greenville,
N.C., who maintains a calendar reform Web site and pitches a reform
idea of his own called the ``Long-Sabbath Perennial Calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting about 10,000 visits to his site in 1998, McCarty
thought the run-up to 2000 would bring more Internet traffic this
year. It hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   So the reform-minded continue in relative obscurity. Dechert and
a few others harbor real hopes of change. Most are mere hobbyists
who post their ideas on the Internet. There's a metric calendar
with 10-day weeks. There's a 13-month ``Tranquility Calendar'' that
counts years from the 1969 moon landing and includes an ``Aldrin
Day'' on leap years. There are several perennial calendars, in
which days and dates are the same from one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, calendar reformers are those like McCarty who
would alter the 12 uneven months of the calendar Pope Gregory XIII
instituted in 1582. Dechert and those who focus on the numbering of
years are ``chronologists.''
</P>
<P>
   The twain seldom meet.
</P>
<P>
   Chronologists are usually trying to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a different world, and a change of year-numbering
acknowledges that,'' says Dechert, who mentions the threat of
nuclear war and overpopulation as evidence that ``things have
drastically changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Calendar reformers, on the other hand, tend to fixate on the
tricky mathematics of organizing 365.242199 days (the time it takes
the earth to revolve around the sun) into a harmonious set of weeks
and months. It's that portion of a day to the right of the decimal
point that has vexed calendar makers for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman calendar reform under Julius Caesar in approximately
45 B.C. was based on a 365.25-day year, so years were 365 days with
an extra day every fourth year. Sounds close enough, but that extra
0.007801 of a day per year adds up over the centuries. By 1582, the
calendar was 10 days out of whack with the true solar year, causing
problems for the scheduling of farming and religious rites.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Gregory XIII hacked 10 days from October 1582 to realign
the calendar with the sun. And, importantly, the length of a year
was figured to be 365.2422 days. The slight modification meant
there would still be a leap year with an extra day every four
years, except in years that end with 00 and are not divisible by
400. So 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years, but 2000 will be.
</P>
<P>
   (That's the source of one potential Y2K problem. If computers
think 2000 is 1900, they won't be able to deal with Feb. 29.)
</P>
<P>
   The Gregorian solution was so close to accuracy that the
calendar will not be an entire day out of sync with the true solar
year until 4909.
</P>
<P>
   Today's calendar reformers aren't satisfied, though. Using a
traditional 7-day week, a nonleap year divides into 52 weeks plus
one day. That means dates never fall on the same weekday from one
year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are untroubled by this.
</P>
<P>
   But many reformers say it's inefficient for businesses,
governments, schools and other institutions to have to use a new
calendar each year.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's Eastman was particularly animated on the subject. In the
1920s, he railed against the months of unequal lengths, some with
four paydays and some with five, because they made it impossible to
produce uniform financial reports and comparisons from one month to
the next. He disliked the fact that holidays occurred on different
days of the week from one year to the next. ``Wandering Easter''
was especially vexing, Eastman said, because years with an early
Easter hurt retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   His solution: dividing the year into 13 months of 28-days
apiece, with each month beginning on a Sunday. That accounts for
364 days, so the 365th day of the year would be called ``Year Day''
and inserted between Saturday, Dec. 28 and Sunday, Jan. 1. For leap
years, an extra ``Year Day'' would be inserted midyear.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner, the Cincinnati psychic, also advocates a 13-month
calendar with a ``day out of time'' at year's end. He's less
concerned with business efficiency than with putting people in
touch with a Mayan-inspired biorhythmic ``natural cycle'' of 28-day
months.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gregorian calendar, Bruner says, ``you're completely
out of touch with yourself and your body and nature. That's where
separation begins. Separation is the beginning of the fear
paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   He said advocates of his ``Dreamspell'' calendar have lobbied
the United Nations and the Vatican and heard ``nothing particularly
positive.'' No matter. The ``mind shift'' he expects in 2000 will
create ``a grass-roots movement where people will wake up and say
something isn't right'' with the Gregorian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Bruner isn't the first to look to the U.N. for calendar reform.
In the 1950s, a U.N. committee entertained the idea of a ``World
Calendar'' that always begins on a Sunday and has a blank day at
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. squelched the idea. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the U.S.
representative to the U.N. at the time, said the blank day would
``conflict with the principles of important religious faiths'' by
throwing off the cycle of six days and a sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The main proponent of the World Calendar, a rubber heiress and
prolific calendrical author named Elisabeth Achelis, pressed on.
Her idea received the ``guarded support'' of House Minority Leader
Gerald Ford, according to a 1966 New York Times article, but
eventually got lost in the political and historical shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Achelis' calendar is still advocated today by Lindhjem's
International World Calendar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one,'' says Lindhjem when asked about the group's
membership. Lindhjem doesn't care too much about the approach of
2000. He's a calendarist, not a chronologist. He's focused on 2006
_ the next time New Year's Day falls on a Sunday and the ideal
time, he says, to switch to the World Calendar. If not 2006, then
2012 or 2017.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time,'' Lindhjem says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Gregorian calendar was the product of about 300
years of reform efforts. And Dionysius Exiguus' year-numbering plan
took centuries to win widespread acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Dechert, too, says it might take years for his Year Zero
proposal to catch on, in which case 2000 would be recognized as 0
after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   He began promoting the Year Zero idea in 1996, sending letters
and e-mails to the White House and other world leaders as well as
to local governments in hopes that a city council somewhere would
endorse his proposal and gin up some publicity.
</P>
<P>
   He's offered his self-published calendar for sale at a few
bookstores and through Amazon.com on the Internet, but hasn't had
much response. Another setback came this year when the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office turned down Dechert's request to register
``Year Zero Calendar'' as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   He's undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any movement that changes things starts with a few people,''
Dechert says.

   SOFT-MONEY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Though Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain generally agree on the issue of soft
money, it's become a flashpoint between them. Bush, in what the
McCain campaign insists is an effort to mislead voters, charges
that McCain's plan would be tough on soft money from business
interests that generally back Republicans but light on soft money
from labor groups that lean heavily Democratic. For Bush, whose
fund-raising prowess forces him to defend against charges of being
the big-monied candidate of special interests, campaign-finance
reform is a potentially tricky issue. (Herman, Austin

`OSBERT SITWELL': HE WROTE NOT WISELY NOR WELL, BUT WHAT DINNERS! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The glittery Sitwell siblings were Edith, the most original and
frail; Sir Osbert, alternately lodged on Parnassus and in
Derbyshire (where he oversaw the family property); and Sacheverell,
who might have preferred a quiet life but was not allowed one. They
dispensed entertainment, excellent dinners (Osbert, mainly, as
titled heir and money man) and a reassuring artistic buffoonery to
England's interwar literary generation, shattered and needing
reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   We can dress up and play at art, was the Sitwell message, though
as members of what the Spanish would call the rancid aristocracy
they were lordly serious about it. It was a message in which the
real artists in their fizzy crowd _ Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell
_ and such vastly talented writers as Cyril Connolly found a kind
of nursery solace.
</P>
<P>
   Other eminences were skeptical. T.S. Eliot, always polite to the
hierarchy of the literary-social set he had entered as an
anglicized immigrant, was privately condescending.
</P>
<P>
   ``All foliage and no filberts,'' Virginia Woolf observed of
Osbert's elaborately posturing and quite vacuous poems. ``The
rhododendrons grow to such a height,'' she remarked of his prose.
She confessed to liking him, though, in part because there was
charm beneath his comic arrogance and even a kind of innocence. One
thinks of Alice's pugnaciously rattly White Knight who keeps
toppling from his horse.
</P>
<P>
   It amused Woolf to be amusing about the Sitwells. This may be
the key to their 40-year-reign as London literary celebrities. Art
is dangerous when it gets to bedrock; doubly dangerous when the
rock shifts _ as it did from the 1920s through the '50s _ and
triply dangerous when a collar is forced around the shifting.
</P>
<P>
   The class illusions and constrictions of England were just such
a collar; and it was the genuine artists who were simultaneously
held rigid and torn. What a relief to frolic with the Sitwells'
mock feuds and posturing, sturmlets and dranglets _ all conducted
with utmost seriousness _ and neo-Swinburnian artistic effulgence.
Ruins are comforting; the English used to be good at them; and
Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell were toy Tintern Abbeys.
</P>
<P>
   There have been individual biographies of Edith and Sacheverell
and at least two major studies of the Sitwells as a group and
cultural phenomenon. Up to now there had been no biography of
Osbert, and Philip Ziegler, best known for his life of Lord
Mountbatten, has written one.
</P>
<P>
   He makes no great claims about meeting a need or filling a hole,
or about giving us the person who wielded a notable pen. He asserts
only the smallest virtues for Osbert's poetry and fiction _ the
forthcoming edition of the ``Oxford Book of English Poetry'' has
nothing by any Sitwell _ a bit more for his travel writing, and
about his journalism the main point is that it was copious and
fluent.
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring work, he tells us, is the five-volume
autobiography that Osbert turned out in the 1940s. Perhaps it is
the best work _ Ziegler valiantly bears out the modesty of his
claims for Osbert's other writing by quoting some fairly horrible
stuff _ but ``enduring'' is questionable. A fine five-volume
autobiography? It is like praising the fine curve of a 5-foot nose.
</P>
<P>
   Of the author's two reasons for writing and for being read, one
of them seems doubtful. The history of English letters would have
been different without the Sitwells, Ziegler tells us. Technically
this may be true, but the history they play a significant role in
is not of literature but of literary life.
</P>
<P>
   There are many amusing details about the London social and
literary scene as the author portrays the character and
year-by-year history of his subject. What is lacking is a framework
that would place the details in a larger context. Late chapters
titled ``Parkinson's'' and ``A Good Deal of Time in Bed'' set out
the minutiae of the illness of a figure whose health has never been
made very significant. Can you have ``Taps'' without ``Reveille''?
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler's more winning reason is that he enjoyed bringing to
life the man and the crowd Osbert moved among. Enjoyment is an
excellent thing, assuming that it is communicated.
</P>
<P>
   The author communicates quite a lot. There is a poignant and
sometimes funny account of the lifelong quarrel between Osbert and
his father: partly over money, which the old baronet both begrudged
and lavished on his high-living son, but mostly as the blind
shovings of two eccentric solipsists bent upon establishing each
other's nonexistence.
</P>
<P>
   There is Osbert languidly (though briefly) enjoying the easy
life of a peacetime Guards officer. At one point, while marching
his men through London on a hot day, he commandeered a city bus at
sword's point so they could all ride.
</P>
<P>
   There are his literary efforts, the catered scandals, and the
enjoyably showy feuds with Noel Coward, Cecil Beaton, Wyndham Lewis
and a dozen others. Many of these were conducted in mutually
promoting partnership with Edith. (Sacheverell tagged along.) The
critic F.R. Leavis made the famously sour remark that the Sitwells
belonged to the history of publicity, not literature.
</P>
<P>
   There are clever things said, though they tend to come from
Osbert's friends and enemies. Many of his own sallies sag before
they have sallied far enough to make it. Perhaps like Falstaff he
was not so much witty in himself as a cause of wit in others. The
bons mots that Ziegler collects have something of a
you-had-to-be-there quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the loveliest is the most devastating and, considering
its source, the most unexpected. On good terms with the royal
family, Osbert would send his books to the duchess of York, future
queen and now the queen mother. Once, very kindly, she wrote back:
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of words you know, pleasant-sounding words strung
pleasantly together and entrancing to read or listen to. I wish
that I knew more.'' Put not your trust in kings. They may tell you
the truth.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAG HARBOR, N.Y. _ In the green clapboard Victorian house,
everything is much as Spalding Gray describes it in his latest
monologue: the pine plank floors and angled doorways, the view of
the old Whalers' church from the window, the books with ``death''
in the title lining the library walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene is not quite the idyllic vision of firelit family
togetherness that Gray depicts in his latest work about one day in
his household, ``Morning, Noon and Night,'' which he is performing
on Sunday and Monday evenings at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at
Lincoln Center through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   It is an average winter weekday, after all. The light is less
golden than gray. The children are scattered in different
directions _ his stepdaughter, Marissa, 13, is still at school;
Forrest, 7, at a drum lesson; Theo, almost 3, in front of an
``Austin Powers'' video. There are beds to be made upstairs, piles
of laundry in the basement, dentist appointments to keep and dinner
parties to attend.
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, raises a question for this accomplished
monologist, who has long used his life experiences as dramatic
material: Now that Gray, 58, has written his opus on fatherhood,
now that he has preserved all his peak paternal experiences to date
and presented them to the public, now that the day-to-day details
of getting his children out the door, picking them up from school
and putting them to sleep are no longer essential to his work, will
this chapter continue to hold his interest? Will whatever consumes
him next diminish his newly discovered commitment to home?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting back in one of the Colonial wing chairs that flank the
fireplace, comfortable in blue corduroys, blue turtleneck sweater
and black shoes, Gray readily concedes that is exactly what he
cannot know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life has always let me down,'' he said. ``That's why I do
the monologues. I have always said I'd rather tell a life than live
a life. But I have to live a life in order to tell one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray also said there might not even be another monologue.
(Though he also said he says that after every monologue.) ``It's
been 20 years, and this is a full circle,'' he said. ```Morning,
Noon and Night' feels like I've landed. I've played it all. There's
nothing I'm conscious of that I've not spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Domesticity and life outside the city have clearly had something
of a calming effect on Gray, who left a SoHo loft and a racier life
three and a half years ago for this home on the east end of Long
Island. In his latest performance he talks about appreciating the
open space that surrounds him now, the sight of the water, the
slower rhythm of rural existence. In an interview he said that he
was glad to be away from the ``erotic energy'' of the city and that
having children had muted his ``promiscuous drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel somewhat reformed,'' Gray said. ``Like an A.A.
person, I'm taking it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been weighing other ways of earning money and
spending his time: voice-overs, a soap opera (his agent advised
against it), volunteering at a hospice. Gray said he planned to
teach autobiographical storytelling one day a week next fall at
Southampton College. He has been active in protesting a nuclear
reactor in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine Gray without a new piece to write and
perform. His theatrical work seems to organize his life, to ground
him and connect him to a cultural, urban world he is far from ready
to abandon. He said he liked taking the bus into New York City
every Sunday evening to perform, buying a green health drink on his
way to theater, soaking up the vitality of streets.
</P>
<P>
   And what else would Gray do with his journals, composition books
he fills with his scrawled script every morning at the dining room
table with some words capitalized, like VULNERABLE and THUNDER?
</P>
<P>
   That is why he recently returned to therapy for the first time
in three years. ``I was going into a new turbulent, chaotic place
because I wasn't focused on something, another monologue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the monologue, Gray describes his first son as open and
inquisitive, but Forrest was 5 at the time he wrote it. Now Forrest
is 7 and pulling away. Instead of their easy conversations
exploring Forrest's countless questions _ What is behind the stars?
Why don't we feel the world spinning? _ he now often walks paces in
front of his father to assert his independence and withholds
certain things to claim some privacy. Gray said this stung in
unexpected ways, that he was experiencing a kind of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the birth of Forrest, Gray said, that lifted him from a
self-destructive spiral that left him fearing he would go the way
of his mother, who committed suicide when he was 26.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, perhaps, Gray had tried to persuade his
companion, Kathie Russo, 39, not to have the baby. He had been
having an affair with Ms. Russo during his marriage to Renee
Shafransky, who figured prominently in his previous monologues. Ms.
Russo, a talent agent, represents other solo performers like Eric
Bogosian and Danny Hoch, and works from home.
</P>
<P>
   In the monologue, Gray describes how he told Ms. Russo that he
didn't want their next baby, who turned out to be Theo. But he also
describes how he changed his mind and now cherishes the little boy
as ``my outdoor bliss kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Russo wants to adopt a child, Gray said he was
finished having children. ``I'm glad the house is the size it is
because that limits it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the monologue what is not said but comes across clearly is
that Ms. Russo is carrying most of the load. ``Where is Theo?'' you
find yourself wondering as Gray describes stretching out on the
living room rug for his yoga exercises or whizzing past the duck
pond on his daily bike ride or toying with the possibility of a
quick sail in his beetle boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russo said, ``He really pitches in,'' but added that while
she put off having her breakfast and reading the newspaper until
the children were off to school, Gray was able to settle down to
eat and read while the chaos still swirled around him. ``How can
you do that?'' she said she sometimes asked him. One also suspects
Gray is a better talker than a listener. Ms. Russo's view: ``He's a
better talker.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gray described his latest monologue as ``a watershed piece for
me.'' Every other monologue has been about trying to conquer
something. ``Terrors of Pleasure'' in 1986 was about renting his
first summer house in the Catskills; ``Swimming to Cambodia'' in
1990 was about making his first film; ``Monster in the Box'' in
1992 was about trying to finish his first novel. ``Morning, Noon
and Night'' is just about family, Gray said, ``this nest, this
choice of this town, this stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the play in The New York Times, Peter Marks
wrote that Gray's current subject matter seemed to have pulled him
outside himself for the first time. ``Mr. Gray may have gained
renown for his obsessive contemplation of his own navel,'' Marks
said. ``But during 95 lovestruck minutes at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater he begins to shed his myriad neuroses as if they were the
strands of a suffocating chrysalis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, at this point in his life Gray seems as close to
normal as he has ever come. He has a back yard, eats leftovers for
lunch, rents a house on Martha's Vineyard every summer, drives a
Volvo. ``He's more content,'' Ms. Russo said. ``He used to be the
party guy: `Let's go! Where's the next big event?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his creative consultant, Paul Spencer, had
suggested that he needed more conflict in ``Morning, Noon and
Night.'' But Gray disagreed. ``I'm not there anymore,'' Gray said.
``What is the shadow? It's the dealing with the ruminations on
death.''
</P>
<P>
   In his monologue Gray talks about lying in the dark, thinking
about all the things that could go wrong, realizing in a reverie
about Forrest how painful it would be to die and never be able to
``kiss, touch or hug this sweet child again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the existentialists have always been my heroes,''
Gray said in the interview. ``In the face of the absurd, one makes
a choice, a positive choice, to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Gray seems less transformed by fatherhood than
tempered by it. He guards his independence, noting that he likes
walking outside to his work studio adjacent to the house, and
wishes it were even farther away.
</P>
<P>
   He still clearly harbors a stormy, complicated soul and seems
stirred by it. One senses that he needs some angst in his life,
that it gives him something to wrestle with and mull over and makes
him feel alive. ``If anything starts good, it's bound to get
worse,'' Gray said. ``It can't get better. That's transcendence.
That's entropy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after performing ``It's a Slippery Slope,'' his
monologue about learning how to ski, Gray said he suspected he
would lose interest in the sport. But he has surprised himself by
staying with it. ``I hope the same will hold true for family,'' he
said. ``After the monologue ends.''

`RIGOLETTO': FANS HAVE A SINGER TO ARGUE ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Real opera fans relish nothing more than a nice
contentious debate about a singer, and Paolo Gavanelli is going to
provoke one for sure. This Italian baritone sang the title role in
Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday night,
the first performance this season of the 1989 Otto Schenk
production. By the first intermission audience members in the lobby
were heatedly exchanging assessments of Gavanelli's singing.
</P>
<P>
   Since his Met debut in 1990 as Count di Luna in Verdi's
``Trovatore,'' Gavanelli has sung periodically with the company,
including some performances earlier this season as Alfio in
``Cavalleria Rusticana.'' But Alfio is a relatively short role. No
one can perform Rigoletto, a touchstone of the baritone repertory,
without revealing the full range of his vocal and dramatic
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Gavanelli's singing is not conventionally beautiful. His tone is
somewhat thin, and he uses vibrato sparingly. His voice is not
especially large: He can summon robust sound in his chesty low
range, but his top notes lack power. His middle-range lyrical
singing is, depending on one's view, either the hallmark of his
artistry or his major shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   He shapes Verdi's long-spun melodic lines with suppleness and
poignancy, singing with focused tone, confident breath control and
restrained emotionalism. Some opera buffs will consider this
approach as true to the Italian operatic style that values melodic
continuity and vocal evenness. Other vocal devotees will simply
find his singing thin-toned, insufficiently supported and croony.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can overlook his vocal idiosyncrasies and listen for
style and interpretive richness will find things to admire in
Gavanelli's work. He is also a vivid actor. As played here, this
hunchbacked jester at the court of the rapacious Duke of Mantua
commands the stage, entertaining the courtiers with his barbed
jokes and mocking imitations of the Duke's wronged accusers.
</P>
<P>
   Conveying Rigoletto's bodily deformity, Gavanelli shuffles from
side to side as he walks. At the palace he is light on his feet and
full of swagger. But later on, alone, sunk by the reality that he
must make a fool of himself to amuse men he despises, that same
unsteady step turns heavy, halting and pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke was sung by the tenor Marcelo Alvarez, who made his Met
debut last season in the new production of Verdi's ``Traviata,''
and Alvarez is also likely to divide opinion. He emerged from
Argentina atop a wave of publicity promoting him as the dashing
young tenor hope for the future. Though he is looking a little
huskier these days, he certainly has a burnished, sizable voice.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion he seemed to cover over some vocal rough
spots with tenorial bluster and emotive huffing. Perhaps because
``La Donna e mobile'' is such an iconic aria, he was wary of
fussing around with it: this was his most straightforward and
impressive singing of the night. But in general his blatant
approach was in stark contrast to Gavanelli's subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano Sumi Jo was excellent as Gilda, Rigoletto's
tragically overprotected daughter. When she made her Met debut 10
years ago (in this role) Ms. Jo was already a technically exquisite
and stylistically informed singer. Her artistry has only deepened
over the years, and her voice today is more richly colored than
ever. Ms. Jo's soft, sustained upper-range-lying singing was
especially beautiful. Though not a highly skilled actress, she was
always a winning stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   The fine German bass Franz Hawlata was chillingly good as the
hired assassin Sparafucile, and the mezzo-soprano Victoria
Livengood was a naturally seductive and vocally alluring Maddalena,
Sparafucile's sister and accomplice in crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell after just one performance, but Vladimir
Jurowski, a 27-year-old Russian-born conductor who made his Met
debut, could become valuable to the company. He has already
conducted a wide range of repertory in opera houses around the
world, and he brought a precise technique, abundant energy and
excellent musical instincts to his work.
</P>
<P>
   The playing of the orchestra was crisp and resonant. He was
admirably sensitive to the singers, allowing them plenty of
breathing room without losing the thread of musical continuity.
Gavanelli, who sings with great expressive freedom, was lucky to
have Jurowski in the pit.

<P>
   SINGAPORE _ With a legacy of violence and a quarter-century of
repressive Indonesian rule, East Timor lacks almost all the
essentials: adequate drinking water, health care, a working
educational system.
</P>
<P>
   To that litany of need, add a contemporary essential: Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   So while aid workers help East Timor's people build an economy
and government from the ruins of the province, the United Nations
Development Program this month dispatched an official from Malaysia
to bring the World Wide Web to the capital, Dili, and to begin
drafting blueprints for the kind of national data network that is
fast becoming vital to participation in the new information
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network is the key,'' said Gabriel Accascina, manager of
the United Nations Development Program's Asia-Pacific Development
Information Program, who visited East Timor this month. ``It's the
one enabling factor today that is basically changing the way people
think, changing the way governments operate and giving
opportunities that weren't there before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Timorese, the information superhighway so often cited in
technologically advanced places was a distant bit of geography
early in September, when pro-Indonesian militias responded to an
Aug. 30 vote for independence by laying waste to the territory.
Now, everything _ the buildings, the port, the civil administration
and the schools _ must be rebuilt, a task being overseen by the
U.N. transitional administration in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The process could take take two or three years. While it is
going on, a nation is to be created using the Internet as one of
its building blocks _ something of a first.
</P>
<P>
   Accascina said the initial step was to establish an Internet
connection from Dili via satellite to Singapore, giving the U.N.
staff reliable access to e-mail service. The next task, he said,
would be to import the computer equipment needed to develop the
first Web site operating from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations created the Asia-Pacific Development
Information Program in 1997 to foster the use of information
technology for social and economic development. From its
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, the program tries to help Asian
governments and community groups develop their own information
structures and adopt the policies and legislation for entering the
electronic marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of work to do. Though Tokyo, Singapore and Hong
Kong compete with each other as centers of Internet innovation,
most of Asia still lacks either the telephone lines or the
computers needed to get online. Only eight of every 1,000 Asians
outside Japan use the Internet, according to estimates by the
International Data Corp., compared with 320 of every 1,000
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries like India and China, people can't afford to go
online, and the geography makes laying down the infrastructure a
pain,'' said Pete Hitchen, an International Data analyst in
Singapore. Other obstacles abound. ``There's regulation, there's
infrastructure, there's language, there's a cultural thing as
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giving destitute countries the ability to tap into the
Internet's largely American-style ferment may seem of dubious
benefit. But Accascina says that Net access is an urgent priority
in a continent that is home to nearly three quarters of the world's
poor. Not only does the Internet create the potential for
long-distance education and medicinal help, it enables producers in
remote areas to offer goods and services on the global market,
providing them a louder voice.
</P>
<P>
   Accascina, a 46-year-old Sicilian, followed a zigzag path to his
role as the U.N. Development Program's high-technology missionary.
The son of an engineer and a lawyer, and a certified pilot,
Accascina worked for the World Health Organization in India in the
late 1970s. In the mid-1980s, he went to California. He worked
briefly for Microsoft, set up his own computer consulting firm and
developed an interest in digital video. A software project for
Unicef turned into a full-time job shooting a documentary in
Albania, and in 1994 a stint in Fiji. In 1996, he joined the U.N.
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   The world organization, he said, hopes to eventually hand over
to an East Timor government a fiber optic digital network that
merges voice telephone calls with data transmissions. ``This will
be a great opportunity to leapfrog technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although East Timor's homes and buildings were largely
destroyed, Accascina said the militias left a surprising degree of
infrastructure intact. Dili's power plant was torched, but
electricity has been restored, he said. The cellular phone network
seems to be operating. Attempts to burn down Dili's technical
institute also failed, Accascina said, leaving behind laboratories
and classrooms that he hopes will soon house an academy to train
networking engineers _ part of a program that the Asia-Pacific
Development Information Program began in August with Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The East Timor project is one of several by the agency that have
started to bring the computer age to remote populations. In
October, it helped set up the first Internet connection on Tuvalu,
a self-governing atoll in the South Pacific. In June, workers from
the U.N. Development Program helped establish the first Internet
service in Bhutan, just as the Himalayan nation got its first
television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a landlocked country, information is a good commodity,''
said Henrik Holde at the development program's office in the
capital, Thimphu, where efforts are under way to set up an Internet
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   With per-capita incomes in the $400 range, few Bhutanese can
afford Internet access, much less a personal computer. But by using
microwave signals to carry the Internet to community centers in
villages separated by mountains, Holde says health workers can take
advantage of information on disease, and rice farmers can get
better information on prices in India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mongolia's people are spread over a largely flat
area almost as big as Alaska, and most Mongolians live as nomadic
herders. But thanks to heavy subsidies from the old Soviet Union,
more than four of five Mongolians can read; periodically horsemen
ride into a town to sell their meat and read newspapers flown in
from the capital, says Atsushi Yamanaka, information and
communications technology officer at the U.N. Development Program
in Ulan Bator. The flights ended with the fall of Communism, so the
United Nations has helped establish community e-mail centers for
the newspapers to be downloaded and printed out.
</P>
<P>
   Borderless communications is already paying off in India, with
an increasing number of Western companies moving some back-office
and data-processing functions there to cut costs or offer
round-the-clock services, said Mark Leigh, president of business
communications systems at Lucent Technologies in Singapore. GE
Capital International Services, for example, performs some
transaction processing outside New Delhi and Swissair, British
Airways and Lufthansa have moved some data processing to Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those who doubt whether access to the global
network will really benefit people who have yet to own a telephone
and whose craftsmanship, however considerable, has not prepared
them for the vexations of troubleshooting the personal computer.
Realities like these have stymied past efforts in Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Internet advocates reply that failure to set up networks for the
poorest countries only keeps them poor. ``You can't exclude these
countries just because they're backwaters,'' Hitchen of the
International Data Corp. said. ``The Internet is becoming so
important on a basic economic level you have to start looking at
Internet adoption as a measure of development like you would
televisions and telephones.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet continues to change the face of the conventional
media.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Toronto television market, where for the last 18 months
viewers have been able to catch up on the news by turning to a
24-hour cable television station that looks more like a World Wide
Web page than a traditional video screen.
</P>
<P>
   The cable station is Cable Pulse 24, or CP24, a subsidiary of
Chum Limited, a Canadian broadcasting company. Its news screen has
seven different fields of information, including stock prices,
weather updates, headline news and a rotating selection of shots of
area roads so that people can check local traffic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Rocky Mountain Media Watch, a media watchdog
group that is often critical of local news coverage, praised CP24
for offering ``without doubt, the most information-packed newscast
in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   The screen's resemblance to a Web page is not coincidental,
Stephen Hurlbut, the station's vice president and general manager,
said. ``We want to blur the line between the news channel and the
Web site,'' he said. The station plans to start a Web site in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give people information quickly. ``It's designed
for people who have busy lives,'' Hurlbut said. ``They turn it on
and get their 15-minute hit and they go off to work. This is
utility TV for people in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the format seems to be successful in attracting viewers.
A year and a half ago, CP24 started with about 800,000 people a
week watching it. It now has a weekly audience of 2.2 million,
making it the leading news channel in its market, Hurlbut said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings have not yet translated to profits, though. The
significant capital investment needed to start the station and the
additional personnel needed to run it have kept CP24 in the red.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Rubinstein, a senior vice president at Chum Television
Channels, said that the new format offered the best possibilities
for future business growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping we can turn this into a model of how television
and the Web can be packaged and sold,'' Rubinstein said. ``Our
expectation is that new media and business opportunities will
outstrip the traditional revenue channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McKean, associate professor of broadcast journalism at the
University of Missouri, sees CP24 as a trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you start to see media converge and stations begin
broadcasting digitally, you'll see more stations with that sort of
information on the screen,'' he said. ``People will have the option
of turning those types of things off, especially as it becomes more
interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he conjectures that older viewers may be more
resistant to such approaches, he says that the television medium
must adapt to the times. ``There are many ways for the general
audience to get information now, often more tailored to their
needs,'' McKean said. ``Television has got to figure out a way to
present information in an appealing way.''

   Not everyone agrees that television will be able to match the
Web. Edward Tufte, author of three books on information design and
professor emeritus at Yale University, says that dividing the
screen is helpful, but multiple fields of information on a TV
screen cannot compete with the interactive features of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really good channels on the Web just far outperform nearly
any kind of television way of conveying information _ except moving
information,'' Tufte said. ``For data, the Web has been so much
more effective.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Until he was in his late 30s, Antonio Francisco Lisboa
was a successful architect and sculptor who enjoyed the good times
accompanying the 18th-century gold boom in Minas Gerais, a state in
east central Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Then around 1777 he contracted a mysterious disease that forced
the amputation of his lower legs and fingers. His infirmity earned
him the nickname of Aleijadinho, or Little Crippled, but he carried
on working, using instruments tied to his wrist, until a few years
before his death in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is as Aleijadinho (pronounced a-ley-zha-DJEE-nyo) that
Lisboa is celebrated as one of the most important sculptors to come
out of the New World, his wooden and stone statues of religious
figures representing the high point of baroque art in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is not widely recognized outside Brazil, it is partly
because most of his work is to be found in the churches of Ouro
Preto, Congonhas do Campo, Sao Joao del Rei and other colonial
cities of Minas Gerais. Even the art movement to which he belonged
is little known outside Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baroque Brazil: Between Heaven and Earth,'' a beautifully
designed exhibition at the Petit Palais through Feb. 6, is now
giving Parisians a chance to discover not only some two dozen works
by Aleijadinho, but also other treasures from the baroque movement
that shaped Brazilian art and architecture from the early 17th
century to the early 19th.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Union Latine, a Paris-based association of
countries speaking Romance languages, along with the Petit Palais
and Brazil's Culture Ministry, the show offers an overview that
even Brazilians have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the coincidence of millennium celebrations and
next year's 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil. But there
is a special reason for the show to be held in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 Germain Bazin, a curator of paintings at the Louvre,
traveled to Rio de Janeiro, where he discovered Brazilian baroque.
He was so inspired that he became an expert in the genre,
publishing several works on baroque art and architecture that
became reference books for Brazilians. So the exhibition is also a
homage to Bazin, who died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not surprising that European and American art
historians should be unfamiliar with the baroque movement that
swept not only Brazil but also Mexico, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Spain and Portugal, themselves weighed down by religious art,
showed little interest in the art of their Latin American colonies;
the Protestants of northern Europe and the United States were not
drawn by Catholic iconography. Thus, at best the movement was
considered an imitation of what already existed in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Latin American baroque was different. It appeared first in
Mexico, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, not only because Spain found
gold and silver to finance construction of churches, but also
because the pre-Columbian peoples of these countries were already
experienced masons and sculptors. (Witness the great Aztec, Maya,
Inca and other temples that survive.)
</P>
<P>
   While providing the manpower, Indian craftsmen brought their own
vision to their work, giving a syncretic quality to the new
baroque.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, in contrast, the Indians were largely nomadic. As a
result, unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not immediately
found major cities. It was not until the beginning of the 17th
century that sugar plantations worked by African slaves spawned the
wealth that brought the first baroque churches to Salvador, Recife,
Olinda and other northeastern cities.
</P>
<P>
   But in time the African slaves and their descendants _
Aleijadinho himself had a Portuguese father and a slave mother _
proved to be skilled sculptors and, as such, also created their
version of baroque.
</P>
<P>
   The show in the Petit Palais sets the stage with 16th-century
maps and Indian feathered headdresses as well as landscape
paintings by the 17th-century Dutch artist Frans Post and a rare
cartoonlike series of watercolors illustrating a meeting between
Portuguese soldiers and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   It then introduces the first religious polychrome and
terra-cotta statues dating back to 17th-century Salvador. In most
cases, the artists are anonymous, but works by two friars,
Agostinho da Piedade and Agostinho de Jesus, stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the great cathedrals and churches of Spanish
America, the early Brazilian churches had relatively simple
exteriors, with simple whitewashed plaster walls decorated only
with elaborate stone door and window frames.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, until gold was found in Minas Gerais in 1698, the
ornateness of their interiors was provided by carved wooden altars
and statues. The discovery of gold, however, turned Minas Gerais
into the Florence of Brazilian baroque.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition uses huge photographs to show some of the dozens
of churches that sprang up in new towns across the state.
Aleijadinho's greatest work, unable to travel, is also seen only in
photographs: the 12 stone statues of Old Testament prophets that
stand outside the church at Congonhas do Campo along with the 64
life-size polychrome wood statues portraying the passion of Jesus
that stand in six chapels beside the church. All these were done
between 1796 and 1806, when the artist was already disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In uniting more than 300 religious works from across Brazil, the
show has been able to pull together the most comprehensive display
of Brazilian baroque to date. Along with wooden, terra-cotta and
stone statues, delicately carved wooden retables and oratories and
silver crosses and candelabra, it even presents small statues made
of ivory brought to Brazil from Portugal's colony of Goa on the
Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it is Aleijadinho who has pride of place. The show includes
some of his architectural drawings of church facades, but his
talent is most evident in his sculptures, not only in the way he
carved the folds of garments and captured the movement of figures,
but also in the powerful and always different emotions conveyed by
the faces of his statues.
</P>
<P>
   Aleijadinho, it seems, did not see himself as creating merely
symbols, but rather living people caught up in a transcendental
drama.
</P>
<P>
   With Aleijadinho's death in the early 19th century, less than a
decade before Brazil's independence from Portugal, the baroque
movement lost its dynamism. Brazil's intellectuals now turned to
Europe, above all to France, for modern ideas that in turn brought
new tastes in art and architecture to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Today the baroque is again recognized as part of Brazil's
heritage, but in a country obsessed by the future, it is perhaps
most appreciated by the droves of foreign tourists who trek to the
great colonial cities of Minas Gerais. It is appropriate, then,
that ``Baroque Brazil'' should be held, and warmly applauded, in
Paris: many of its rococo works of art look more at home in the
ornate Petit Palais than they might in modern Sao Paulo or Rio de
Janeiro.

E-COMMERCE: WEB MERCHANTS WAKE UP TO EXTENDED WARRANTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   For many consumers, there is nothing to love about buying
extended service warranties. First comes the hard sell at the cash
register, typically punctuated with a horror story about someone
who was ``saved by the warranty.'' If customers reject the
warranty, the horror story lingers. If they accept, they contend
with the aftertaste of a $200 high-pressure purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, online buyers were spared that experience, as
most World Wide Web merchants had neglected to offer extended
service plans. Now, however, retailers are looking more closely at
warranty options, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can extended warranties generate more profit than the
products they cover, but they give online merchants the chance to
bolster what has generally been an anemic record of post-sale
support. And if one believes the rhetoric of e-commerce sites
offering extended service plans, the Internet may even make the
buying process palatable for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no salesman in a plaid suit saying, `Hey, buy this
warranty,''' said Rich Pournelle, vice president for marketing at
WarrantyNow, which offers extended warranties in partnership with
e-commerce sites. ``The customer is much more in control.''
</P>
<P>
   WarrantyNow and RevBox are among the first companies to offer
warranties online, and though their businesses differ in
significant ways, the basic approach is the same. Both companies
provide Web retailers with the technology to sell extended
warranties and to offer consumers a secure site where they can keep
track of the warranties and get help with service.
</P>
<P>
   Through WarrantyNow, for instance, Wristwatch.com customers can
buy a two-year, $70 extended warranty on a $1,500 Breitling 867
watch, covering theft or breakage due to ``normal use.'' When
buyers choose the coverage, they can record their warranty on
WarrantyNow's Web site, where they can also process a repair claim
or find local repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ron Goedendorp, WarrantyNow's chief executive, the
company offers broader support for more complex products, like
computers or consumer electronics. In those categories, customers
can call a toll-free number or send an e-mail message to get
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   Goedendorp said that the company, which began operations in
July, had signed up 13 merchants _ including Onvia.com,
Wristwatch.com and Miadora _ and 60,000 repair companies in the
United States. That network, he said, covers 97 percent of the ZIP
codes in the country, and spans an array of product categories,
including lawn equipment, fitness equipment and personal
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   RevBox, WarrantyNow's chief competitor, began operations last
month, and so far has signed up two merchants, according to James
Wu, the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, covers a wide range of product categories, and it has
33,000 repair shops within its network. Wu said that RevBox also
offered warranties on products not sold at merchant partners, as
long as those products were still covered by the manufacturer's
warranty when the extended service plan was purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said that the company would stress two features as it vied
for consumers and merchant partners. First, he said, the site and
its merchant partners would compete aggressively on price. Second,
it would offer extensive additional information about product
warranties and user manuals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and executives said that retailers typically earn
profit margins of 30 percent to 75 percent on extended warranties.
Wu declined to say what margin RevBox would seek, but he said that
the company's merchant partners would charge significantly less
than other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company recently offered a two-year extended
warranty on a Compaq Presario 1685 notebook computer for $80, while
CompUSA and WarrantyNow charged $199 for a similar plan. ``We're an
Internet company,'' Wu said. ``We're funded to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   RevBox will also try to differentiate itself by offering more
information on its Web site. Customers are automatically registered
on the RevBox site when they purchase an extended warranty from a
merchant partner, but they can also register other purchases at the
site, regardless of where or when they bought the product or
whether they bought a warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have registered the model numbers of various products
on a personalized Web page, customers can then avail themselves of
warranty information on 55,000 products, as well as 10,000 user
manuals from more than 5,000 manufacturers. ``It's taken a lot of
work to develop that,'' Wu said. ``I suspect it'll take a long time
for any competitor to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Notably, RevBox also plans to chronicle the breakdown history of
those products, and offer that data to customers as a way to
research future purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Both RevBox and WarrantyNow are selling what amount to wholesale
insurance and service plans. When WarrantyNow users make a claim on
a damaged product, for instance, they are actually relying on one
of several ``third-party administrators,'' which for years have
offered post-purchase support services to offline retailers. The
warranties of those third-party administrators are themselves
underwritten, typically by large insurers.
</P>
<P>
   RevBox, on the other hand, resells the warranty and service
offering of one company, Federal Warranty, a unit of Fortis Group.
The extended warranties offered offline by retailers like Macy's,
Tandy and CompUSA often originate with Federal Warranty, Wu said.
Since RevBox plans to sell warranties at prices below Federal's
other partners, he said, ``it's a bit of a delicate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the prices and the approach of online warranty sites could
change the way consumers approach extended service plans, said
Robert Brown, the chief marketing officer for Techsumer, a company
selling consumer electronics and computers online at
www.techsumer.com, and selling extended warranties through RevBox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be real honest,'' Brown said. ``Everybody knows that not
all warranties will be redeemed, so we recognize there's the
opportunity for profit here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the lower prices from RevBox will not necessarily translate
to lower revenue for retailers who sell the warranties, he said,
because lower prices should translate to higher sales volume. Brown
cited other factors that he said boded well for higher online
sales. Not only would consumers be more informed about warranties
when they buy, for example, but the online services of sites like
RevBox mean that consumers would be less likely to lose track of
warranty slips, and more likely to stay informed of the warranty's
benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might get more people opting in to these warranties, so
even if there's a higher redemption rate, our net revenue could be
higher as a result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Brown said, is the fact that extended warranties
allow Web sites to offer ``better customer service, by educating
them about what the products do, and giving them options for
additional support if they have an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chris Martins, an analyst with Aberdeen Group, this
realization in itself is a big step forward for Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the original focus in e-commerce was up to the sale.
After that, the attitude was, `It'll get handled,''' Martins said.
``This allows retailers to provide a more complete sales
experience, as well as give themselves a revenue opportunity _
which they could use.''

DOES ANYBODY REALLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

<P>
   Uptight New Year's Eve celebrators intent on uncorking the
Champagne at precisely the right millisecond of midnight may find
themselves in a quandary. Which clock on Earth offers the most
accurate accounting of time?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the answer is no mere matter of academics or party
etiquette, given the increasing significance that time plays in the
high-technology age.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is no single answer. The Coordinated Universal
Time, which is kept by the Paris-based International Bureau of
Weights and Measures, derives the official time from taking the
average reading at any given moment from 210 organizations
worldwide that keep time using sophisticated atomic clocks.
</P>
<P>
   And even among those 210 organizations, some have clocks that
are more accurate than others. Almost 80 percent of those
organizations use cesium clocks made by Agilent Technologies of
Palo Alto, Calif., a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard. On their face _
so to speak _ these clocks seem pretty accurate. They lose or gain
a mere second every 162,000 years. That is not bad for a VCR-sized
timepiece that sells for $65,000, but it is downright unreliable,
compared with a handful of clocks like the NIST 7.
</P>
<P>
   Housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Boulder, Colo., the $2.5 million NIST 7 measures the vibrations of
cesium atoms, which jiggle 9.2 billion times a second. But this
cesium clock, the experts promise, will neither gain nor lose a
second in 6 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Punctual New Year's Eve celebrants can check www.time.gov for
the precise countdown from the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Party-going aside, time is truly of the essence in the digital
age. Consider the growing number of technical tasks that require
exceedingly accurate time, like the satellite-aided global
positioning systems used in the military and space industries and,
increasingly, by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With global positioning, ``a foot equals a billionth of a
second,'' said Jack Kusters, manager of precise time and frequency
for Agilent. ``So if you're off by a second, you're off by a
billion feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Much too far away, in other words, to see the ball drop in Times
Square.

IN A BAFFLING BOX OFFICE WEEKEND, TWO WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ One movie opened on Tuesday, several on Wednesday,
several more on Saturday and none at all on the normal opening day,
Friday, which also happened to be Christmas Eve, traditionally one
of the worst moviegoing days of the year. And, as usual for the
holiday season, some of the movies opened last week in thousands of
theaters, others in just a handful, so they could beat the Dec. 31
deadline for Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
   It is always tricky figuring out from the skewed perspective of
the Christmas weekend which movies will be the enduring hits of the
season, always a matter of comparing apples and oranges. But this
year some bananas and kumquats were thrown in as well, and the
result was a particularly strange fruit salad. There were two clear
winners, though, and perhaps a few more will emerge as the picture
clarifies after the New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone had the biggest opening of his career with ``Any
Given Sunday,'' a loud, rambunctious, star-studded football movie
that earned an estimated $22.3 million since opening on Wednesday
and $14.2 million in the three-day span that began on Friday. This
director's most successful opening before this was $11 million for
``Natural Born Killers'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Ripley,'' a stylish but decidedly dark drama
about a young impostor (Matt Damon) who bludgeons his way to the
life he desires, earned $13.8 million since its opening on
Saturday. The film is the director Anthony Minghella's eagerly
awaited follow-up to the Oscar-winning ``English Patient'' from
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion
Picture Group, said the studio was encouraged that audiences turned
out in such numbers for such a film. ``It's the Academy season, and
I think people do expect to see movies that make you think,''
Friedman said. ``And I think we were successful in the way we
alerted the public as to the movie's content. We have not hidden
the fact that it is not your average holiday fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Paramount and Warner Bros., which released Stone's film,
were able to claim a share of victory for the weekend. For the
Friday-to-Sunday period that constitutes a normal box office
weekend, ``Any Given Sunday'' was in first place, but ``Ripley''
was not playing on all three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Ripley' was a three-day run, it would have been in first
place,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations,
a company that monitors box office performance. Dan Fellman,
Warner's president for distribution, preferred the hard figures to
speculation. ``We always go by the three-day numbers,'' he said.
``Everybody I talked to is focusing on the three-day weekend, and
they all have us as No. 1. So there you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of weekend. Which figures should people focus
on? The five-day figure, since many of the films opened on
Wednesday? Only the two days (Saturday and Sunday) that all of the
movies have been open? Or the traditional three-day weekend, even
though not a single film opened on Friday? Better yet, why focus on
any of them?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood executives, not to mention directors and actors,
routinely bemoan the industry's _ and the entertainment media's _
fascination with opening weekend performance. But a weekend like
this makes the whole exercise seem even more absurd than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a time of the year when to freeze at any one
moment in time to look at the box office is sort of misleading,
because some days favor the kids, some days favor the young adults,
some days favor the women,'' said Jeff Blake, president for
distribution at Columbia Pictures. ``I mean, you had 17 movies
opening in the last couple of weeks. The real answer is, Who's got
what on Jan. 3? And I think the winners will be pretty clear at
that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Focusing solely on the three-day weekend, ``Any Given Sunday''
and ``The Talented Ripley'' were followed at the box office by a
pair of films aimed primarily at young audiences, ``Toy Story 2,''
which opened the day before Thanksgiving, and ``Stuart Little,''
both of which claimed $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said that Columbia was particularly buoyed with the
performance of ``Stuart Little'' in its second week. The film, he
said, is expected to earn $5 million a day during the coming week _
the prime holiday period for family moviegoing, when the gifts have
all been opened but the children are still out of school _ and
should top $70 million in earnings by the end of next weekend,
putting it on track to pass the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're clearly one of the winners of the period,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile,'' a supernatural prison drama starring Tom
Hanks that has been open since Dec. 10, was in fifth place with
$9.04 million, just in front of the $9 million claimed by Universal
Pictures for ``Man on the Moon,'' which opened Wednesday and
features Jim Carrey as the comedian Andy Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Carrey is a big draw, but the subject matter skewed a
little bit older,'' said Dergarabedian, trying to explain why a
movie with such a big star opened so low.
</P>
<P>
   The only other major wide release of the weekend, Tim Allen and
Sigourney Weaver in ``Galaxy Quest,'' a comedy about actors in a
sci-fi television show mistaken by aliens for real space rangers,
landed in a disappointing eighth place with $8.1 million in two
days of distribution, just behind the second week of Robin Williams
in ``Bicentennial Man'' ($8.3 million) and just ahead of the third
week of ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' ($6.2 million).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 figures, of course, do not include films that opened
in limited release this week: ``Girl, Interrupted'' on Tuesday;
``Snow Falling on Cedars'' on Wednesday; ``Titus,'' ``Angela's
Ashes'' and ``Play It to the Bone'' on Saturday. By opening before
the end of the year, even in just a few theaters, these films
become eligible for the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them _ except perhaps ``Play It to the Bone,'' a boxing
comedy with Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas that made only
$3,660 on one screen in Los Angeles _ can claim strong per-screen
numbers. But again, what that means is unclear. An Oscar-yearning
film might fill up three or four theaters in New York and Los
Angeles, but the real test will come in January when these movies
go into wider release.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the holiday weekend figures were down from recent
years, though Hollywood is still clearly on its way to breaking
last year's record annual total of $6.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly, this is because Christmas Eve fell on a Friday,''
Dergarabedian said. ``And while the films out there appealed to
diverse audiences, a lot of them were more adult oriented than in
previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's holiday weekend, for instance, saw such mass-appeal
hits as ``Patch Adams,'' ``Stepmom'' and ``You've Got Mail.'' This
year, Dergarabedian said, the most mainstream-oriented of the
movies was Stone's, and many of the others were decidedly more
sophisticated or aimed at smaller audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make an apt comparison here,'' Dergarabedian
said. ``However, if you look, these are more niche-oriented films,
so it's not surprising that some of the grosses are down a bit.''

<P>
   He added, ``I think, if anything, it shows a continuing strength
at the box office that, with this kind of week, with movies opening
on Saturday and with this mix of movies, you still have pretty good
box office.''

INDUSTRY VIEW: WHY THE BLIND FAITH IN MEDIA CONVERGENCE?

   In the 1970s, the Popeil Pocket Fisherman spawned numerous
mocking parodies as the ultimate all-in-one device. It not only
caught fish but through the miracle of its many hidden compartments
it could also gut, clean and even weigh your catch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the hype surrounding the convergence of PCs,
television and the Web continues to dominate headlines, the
familiar ``but that's not all!'' nature of the convergent device
begs a question. Is convergence really a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the facts. The Pocket Fisherman aside, Americans have
traditionally shunned devices that combined too many functions or
inappropriately matched them in one unit.
</P>
<P>
   The radio made a brief appearance in the early television set,
but aside from hotel chains looking to hold down costs, few people
found listening to the radio through a tinny monaural television
speaker an enjoyable activity. The radio did manage to combine
successfully with the clock, but only in the case of a bedside
unit; clocks in the rest of a typical home do not contain a radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the more complex world of high-technology devices, combining
a host of technical features into a single unit is almost always a
theoretical possibility. But there is seldom evidence of actual
customer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Television tuner cards in PCs, for example, never took off in
the early 1990s. PC users at work typically had no justifiable
reason to request such a setup, and at home a television in the PC
offered little benefit over the television set that was a room _ or
even a few feet _ away.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo
Park, Calif., said that people who espouse convergence are looking
at the puzzle backward. Instead of searching for one big high-tech
device that combines the functions of a cell phone, television set
and Web-enabled PC, he said, manufacturers should take advantage of
the fact that the chips inside each of these units are now largely
the same.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, ``Convergence does occur at the very technical or
chip level, but it results in a divergence at the product level,''
Saffo said. ``Big devices have exploded outwards into little
devices,'' he said. ``It's as if the PC on our desk exploded into
laptops and cell phones and PDAs.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been especially notable this holiday season, as
consumers were snapping up record numbers of specialized electronic
devices _ whether they were the latest digital cameras and
video-game consoles or even more business-minded fare like cell
phones, pagers, digital tape recorders and electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   If the chips are largely the same, the key to successful device
design seems to lie not in grouping all potential features together
simply because the manufacturers can. Instead, the idea seems to be
finding an attractive second feature, as with the venerable bedside
clock radio. Today, the hot second feature making its way into an
array of gadgets is Web connectivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web connectivity will be a secondary feature found on
successful connected appliances,'' predicted Seamus McAteer,
director of Web technology strategies for Jupiter Communications,
the new-media research firm. ``Stand-alone appliances that tout
connectivity as a primary feature will fail to penetrate the mass
market.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, McAteer cited the cable television industry's
efforts to introduce high-capacity digital set-top boxes that would
include Web access. ``Consumers will want interactive cable set
tops so that they can receive an extra 100 channels of video and
more ESPN,'' he said. ``The addition of Web connectivity to these
devices will be an additional feature, and services must be
congruent with the setting to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the hybrid approach has usually failed to produce
a device that works as well as a specialized product, said Jack
Trout, president of Trout &AMP; Partners, a marketing strategy firm
based in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a specific device to function brilliantly _ they
want best of breed, not a hybrid,'' Trout said. ``Remember the boat
car? It was a lousy boat, and it was a lousy car. That's what you
get with convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   When people watch television, for example, they want ``the best
TV experience,'' Trout said. ``Ironically, while everyone has been
trying to build these new complicated Web TVs, the hot market this
year has been the big-screen television.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Hawkins, inventor of the Palm Pilot organizer, and now
the co-founder and chairman of Handspring, which makes the Visor
organizer, sees the issue in less absolute terms. ``I find the
terms `convergence' and `divergence' too simplistic,'' Hawkins said
in an e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Successful execution, according to Hawkins, is the true secret
to a good product, not whether it converges or diverges. ``The Palm
Pilot was arguably a successful case of divergence,'' he wrote.
``Do less and do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he continued, ``I believe you can add a large amount of
functionality to a hand-held computer and keep it low cost and easy
to use. For example adding cell phone radios to hand-held computers
is a case of convergence. Done right it will be successful.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Admittedly, it is not likely to make anyone's blood
surge wildly with excitement. But the BBC is waiting to see whether
millions of Britons will spend Monday evening watching a special
edition of ``One Man And His Dog,'' a sports show in which a bunch
of sheep running in the wrong direction qualifies as high drama.
</P>
<P>
   And why, exactly, would anybody want to watch this program?
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely, it's not boring,'' said Paul Latham, spokesman for
the Countryside Alliance, speaking fondly of a show in which
spectacularly taciturn shepherds compete to see whose dog can most
neatly herd some sheep into a pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite an interesting contest to watch, the man
working with an animal to persuade other animals that they want to
go in a certain direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's episode is a crucial test for ``One Man and His Dog,''
which was threatened with cancellation last winter when the BBC
decided that the 23-year-old show's quaint old pace does not mesh
with the racier new image it wants to project. But the threat
caused such an uproar, with celebrities, politicians and The Daily
Telegraph joining a ``One Man'' campaign, that the BBC finally
agreed to broadcast a special over Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other protests when British stations tried to
drop much-loved programs, including ``Shipping Forecast,'' a radio
program in which the announcer read a long list of marine-related
place names, followed by bits of weather.
</P>
<P>
   If the ratings for the special ``One Man and His Dog'' are good,
then the BBC has promised to bring it back, at least from time to
time. In its glory days in the 1980s, the program could draw an
audience of 8 million people, in a country of about 55 million. It
was down to 1.6 million when the BBC decided to cut it, but fans
said it was because it was being shown in a bad time slot.
Meanwhile, the BBC has high hopes for the Christmas program, which
has been scheduled to air in the time of year when Britons most
love to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed witless with turkey redux, rendered nearly catatonic by
too much confinement with too many relatives, and not anxious to go
outside because it is raining and the stores are closed, millions
of Britons traditionally spend the better part of the Christmas
season in their living rooms, their eyes fixed like lasers on the
television. Television is such a big deal that in 1994, ``Auntie's
New Bloomers 2,'' a compendium of television gaffes,'' drew 17.9
million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without TV this Christmas, we may have to talk to each
other,'' said The London Observer in its special Christmas
television section last week. In the Christmas-day episode of ``The
Royle Family,'' the working-class family featured in the program
gathers in front of the television after Christmas dinner and
proceeds to criticize the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a preview of Monday's special, it is not impossible to
understand why some people in the BBC thought it was time to say
good-bye to ``One Man And His Dog.'' Even with the show's latest
innovation _ wiring the sheep with microphones so you can hear the
faintest ``Baa'' _ it is often hard to follow the action, or even
the inaction.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with a shot of some sheep scurrying across a
field, a dog close behind. Then the contestants are introduced.
They are people of such retiring natures that when one admits to
being ``quietly confident'' about the competition, he comes across
as the Donald Trump of the sheep-dog world. They stand around,
whistling and shouting virtually incomprehensible commands to their
dogs, who then herd groups of random sheep around the field and
through various obstacles before depositing them in a pen.
</P>
<P>
   There are standards to meet. The sheep are supposed to run
smoothly and in a straight line, for instance, with no zigzagging,
and the shepherds are not allowed to touch the sheep themselves.
And there are pitfalls to overcome. The sheep can be too fast, too
willful, too nervous and too thick to do as they're directed.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the program, a sheep makes a bid for freedom by
leaping over a dog. One contestant stands by helplessly while his
sheep repeatedly refuse to go into the pen, scattering as
mindlessly as confetti in the wind. Inexplicably spooked, one of
the dogs lies down at his master's feet and refuses to budge.
</P>
<P>
   But the X-factor in the contest, it seems, is the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the best dog in the world, if you've got bad sheep _
if you have sheep who challenge the dog or who run off in a mad
panic _ you're going to be struggling,'' said Gus Dermody, one of
the show's hosts. ``You have to alter your tactics according to the
sheep you have.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is its very lack of conventional charms that can make
``One Man And His Dog'' so exciting, its admirers say. ``It doesn't
kowtow to the idea that people can only concentrate for 30 seconds,
and I love the idea that it sometimes takes place in the rain,''
actor Stephen Fry said last year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hall, who along with his wife is co-editor of Working
Sheepdog News, a six-times-a-year magazine based in York, said that
in a time when the rural way of life is fast being forgotten by a
Britain that is increasingly city-dominated, ``One Man And His
Dog'' helps Britons reach back to their country roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television is so full of glitz and glamour that it's nice
to see something that's a bit different,'' Hall said. ``It's like
soothing music with Pan pipes. There's a real beauty in a really
good dog moving sheep very gently. There's a beauty all its own.''

GORY DAYS: COWBOYS HAVE GONE DOGMEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Somebody do something, quick. End this
playoff-formula silliness, here and now. Put the Cowboys out of
their misery by allowing their season to do what it's already done.
Die.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing except NFL mathematical mumbo-jumbo separates the
Cowboys from an off-season of hell-and-heads-rolling. If Chan
Gailey survives with his job intact, then yes, there is a Santa
Claus, and his name is Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for Gailey, he was at the mercy yesterday,
like he has been all year, of high-dollar has-beens who no longer
play the game as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until this visit to a half-empty Superdome, being bad hadn't
been properly defined. Losing to the gawd-awful Saints, 31-24,
meant the absolute worst had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   This is the NFL equivalent of December without Christmas. And on
the eve of Christmas, the dawn of franchise disaster arrived,
putting to rest the Jerry Jones ownership formula of reviving the
glory days.
</P>
<P>
   These, friends, are the gory days. And don't expect that to
change anytime soon. Even after yesterday, the NFL math declares
the 7-8 Cowboys as a playoff possibility, depending on what happens
around the NFC on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's over. It's been over. And let it get over. The big
question is where it goes from here, meaning the off-season and
beyond. Even a larger question? Can Jones handle such a
responsibility as the self-appointed general manager at Valley
Ranch?
</P>
<P>
   What Jerry should do first is cancel some of those
million-dollar paychecks due Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and
Nine-Toed Deion at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, it was an angry Jones who admitted in a postgame
steam, ``I feel a little foolish and stupid for doing and making
some of the commitments I did, and ending up 7-and-9.''
</P>
<P>
   He should.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall against the Saints, who had only lost 12 of 14
coming in, was a direct result of those three future Hall of Famers
becoming crunch-time patsies.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 90 seconds, with the Cowboys needing a touchdown to
tie, Aikman attempted to force an end-zone pass to tight end David
LaFleur. A deflection, then an interception, and that was that. The
upset had been sealed for the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   But how did it come to that? The Cowboys at the New Orleans
6-yard line, needing seven points to get to overtime against
probably the worst team in the league?
</P>
<P>
   An Emmitt fumble was returned 58 yards for a touchdown with 10
minutes remaining, giving the Saints the 31-24 lead. The amazing
part was New Orleans being in a position to take the lead after the
Cowboys had seemingly taken over the game offensively in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dallas-gone-dogmeat while falling behind, 10-0, in the
first half, but then there were leads of 17-10 and 24-17 after
intermission. Both times, however, the Saints roared back behind
the Christmas spirit of Jake ``The Cajun Snake'' Delhomme, who was
not only making his first NFL start, but also taking his first
snap.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme was more than terrific, and more than ``pretty cool''
as Saints coach Mike Ditka said afterward. He was an inspiration to
his team with Mr. Clutch accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys rookie cornerback Duane Hawthorne was beaten on a
51-yard TD throw for the 17-17 tie.
</P>
<P>
   And then Mr. Wonderful, Deion himself, got smoked on a 50-yard
pass play to set up the TD for the 24-24 deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive week, the Cowboys' defense fell into
a state of collapse. It unraveled while facing a Ray Lucas of the
Jets and yesterday while facing a Jake Delhomme.
Un-bleeping-believable.
</P>
<P>
   But for those comments all season about defensive coordinator
Dave Campo doing it with smoke and mirrors ... the last two weeks
Campo &AMP; Co. have been reduced to a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive game plan was to curtail Ricky Williams. Done.
Ricky managed 61 yards on 23 carries. But ``The Cajun Snake,'' with
receivers running wide open all day, and with very little pressure
from the Cowboys' front seven, did a 278-yard passing number
against the secondary. He threw for two TDs and ran for another on
a sharp third-down quarterback draw.
</P>
<P>
   So what the Cowboys had yesterday was superstars choking _
Deion, Aikman and Emmitt _ plus a clueless defense, plus ...
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you guessed it. The rain of senseless yellow flags was on
display, meaning nothing changed the entire season. Eleven
penalties for 86 yards padded the Cowboys' league-leading total.
</P>
<P>
   One of those flags erased a 98-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown by Jason Tucker, who had a standout game as a receiver
and return man.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys proved weeks ago they aren't a serious playoff team.
Even a semi-serious one. But in losing to the Saints, they defined
both the season and the future. And that definition is not for
print in this family publication.

SAINTS' DELHOMME MADE MOST OF CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Quarterback Jake Delhomme, a veteran of NFL Europe
and the Saints' fourth-team signal-caller, spent most of this
season cleaning stalls for his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shoveling manure and having fun doing it,'' Delhomme
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers would consider that an apt description of
yesterday's events at the Louisiana Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme buried the Cowboys (7-8) and perhaps their playoff
hopes in the first start of his NFL career. The wide-eyed,
24-year-old completed 16 of 27 passes for 278 yards and two
touchdowns and rushed for another in the Saints' 31-24 upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make me look very smart, but I thought Jake was
pretty special,'' said coach Mike Ditka, who appointed Delhomme as
the starter for the final two regular-season games with Billy Joe
Tolliver injured. ``He's a special kid, and hopefully he never
changes one bit because he is so down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mind was on the football game, and it was wonderful to see
that today. I thought he did a marvelous job in every aspect of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints released Delhomme late in training camp, but numerous
injuries forced the organization to re-sign the former
Louisiana-Lafayette player Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the way it was in college,'' Delhomme said. ``This
was the way it was when I was in \RNFL Europe\S and was `The Man.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme's first touchdown pass materialized on a bootleg after
a fake to tailback Ricky Williams. Delhomme passed to wide receiver
Keith Poole in the back corner of the end zone for an 8-yard
touchdown that gave the Saints a 10-0 lead with 1:38 remaining in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The second touchdown pass went to wide receiver Eddie Kennison,
who beat cornerback Duane Hawthorne, and covered 51 yards for a
third-quarter score that tied the game 17-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure made some plays,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
``He threw it up and gave his receivers a chance to make a play for
him. He got out of some tight spots. You've got to give the guy
credit for the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme also scored a game-tying, fourth-quarter touchdown on a
draw play that covered 4 yards against the blitzing Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've quit being amazed by guys' performances who get
an opportunity in this world,'' Gailey said. ``That's what this
nation is made up of _ people who just want an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme received his, and his performance did not surprise
Saints tackle Kyle Turley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake Delhomme is a great quarterback,'' Turley said. ``Someone
just needed to give him a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Delhomme did not set out to be the conquering hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't plan on coming out here and doing anything special,''
he said. ``I think maybe the biggest thing that I might have done
was stay calm and relaxed all week. I think the players felt that.
We were 2-12. We had nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It crystallized as the lowly Saints' feel-good Christmas story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say I hope it's the start of a nice dream,''
Delhomme said.

COWBOYS HO-HO-HORRIBLE AGAINST SAINTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Cowboys not only lost a game they couldn't
afford to lose yesterday, but they left their owner feeling ``a
little foolish and stupid'' for putting his effort and money into a
team that seems to have become a 7-8 embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys _ 31-24 losers to the 3-12 New Orleans Saints before
a more than half-empty Superdome on Christmas Eve] yesterday _ are
still alive (but apparently not well) in their bid for a playoff
berth after losing their second game in a span of six days to an
underdog already eliminated from playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   Jones wouldn't reveal what he has in mind concerning the future
of the Cowboys, only that he does have something in mind.
</P>
<P>
   He said his intent won't be meant to be ``punitive,'' but that
he will change the direction of this Cowboys team after a season
of:
</P>
<P>
   Losing seven consecutive road games after opening Sept. 12 with
an overtime victory at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to win back-to-back games since beginning the season
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to beat a nondivisional opponent on the road (0-11)
since the 1997 season opener at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has been outspoken in his support of Gailey as
recently as this past week, would only say yesterday that he
``continues'' that way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about fixing this thing without Chan as
the head coach,'' Jones said. ``With the exception of Jimmy
\RJohnson\S, I never have been a proponent of changing the man out
as much as changing the man \Rinto\S changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was hired 22 months ago to bring an offense to the
Cowboys and restore their prominence in the NFC. Neither one has
happened. The Cowboys brought the NFL's 25th-ranked passing game
into the Superdome ... and left with one of seven sub-.500 records
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have ever spent any more time and worked
harder at giving us an edge as I have this past year,'' Jones said.
``I feel a little foolish and stupid for doing and making some of
the commitments I did and ending up 7-8.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also admitted that he was ``very angry'' after the
Cowboys' 22-21 home loss to the New York Jets last week and that
yesterday's defeat has ushered reality into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   His latest mood is, as he put it, ``OK, let's get with it. Let's
fix this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was most upset by first-half penalties (eight for 61
yards) and that the Cowboys again failed to find a way to win close
games. They are 0-6 in games this season decided by seven points or
fewer, including four times in the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game today,'' Jones said, ``would mirror what our season
has been. When given an opportunity, we come up short.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the feeling among the Cowboys, who cornerback
Deion Sanders said can be considered underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only this year, but last year and the year before and the
year before,'' Sanders said. ``You tried to place everything on
Barry \RSwitzer\S. Now you want to blame Chan. Sooner or later you
have to point the arrow where it should fall, with the players.
Start with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints rallied from second-half deficits of 17-10 and 24-17
behind a former NFL Europe quarterback, Jake ``The Cajun Snake''
Delhomme, who was playing in his first NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   The record will show that the Cowboys lost this game on a
58-yard return of an Emmitt Smith fumble for a touchdown with just
under 10 minutes remaining in the game, breaking a 24-24 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey knows better. This game was lost by the Cowboys over
a period of 3 hours, 8 minutes, mostly above the shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys played hard,'' Gailey said. ``But I don't
think we played very smart. Our record right now says we're below
.500 \Rand\S that's not a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``I've seen very smart people do dumb things. I
think we have players who can play smart enough to go to the Super
Bowl. We need to not only look at how our players are approaching
it, but we need to look at what we're asking them to do. We will
look at all of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can get any clearer message than winning one
game on the road all season and ending up here \Rin New Orleans\S
at 7-8.''
</P>
<P>
   As team owner, he called it a ``clear mandate'' that changes
need to be made, and that it is up to him to make them. When asked
about what changes, he wouldn't be specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see where \Rwe've\S got to do different,'' Jones said. ``In
my life, I have a lot of hard decisions that are difficult \Rto
make\S ... but this isn't even hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense allowed its first first-quarter touchdown
of the season. Worse, it allowed a first-time NFL starter who never
before yesterday had thrown an NFL pass to throw for two touchdowns
and score a game-tying touchdown on a quarterback draw early in the
fourth quarter. It was only the fifth rushing touchdown the Cowboys
have allowed this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Cowboys, as they have done so well and so often
this season, took aim at their foot ... and squeezed the trigger.
Some of the mishaps inlcuded:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tucker had what would have been a 97-yard kickoff return
for a first-quarter touchdown nullified by a holding penalty on
Lemanski Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith had a third-and-one carry for 1 yard and apparently
a first down at the Saints' 32 snuffed out by a holding penalty on
Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a third-quarter run of 20 yards to inside the Saints'
5 called back by a holding penalty on All-Pro Larry Allen, who was
playing in his first game in six weeks. Four plays later, the
Cowboys had to settle for a 33-yard Eddie Murray field goal. Two
plays after that, the Saints tied the score, 17-17.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It should.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it was enough to make the owner realize that it's
broken, and it needs to be fixed.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ There will be no need to review the game film on
this one.
</P>
<P>
   No need to break down where and why execution failed. To review
the numerous penalties and blunders coming from a veteran team in a
now-or-never game would overstate what the players already know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to concentration,'' said linebacker Dexter
Coakley of the Cowboys' 31-24 defeat to the New Orleans Saints
yesterday. ``Obviously we're not focused enough. Penalties are
caused by not being focused. It's not so much what they did. We're
beating ourselves. That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even coach Chan Gailey, can answer how or why the
Cowboys could commit 11 penalties and three turnovers in the 15th
game of the season with the playoffs on the line and playing
against one of the worst teams in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even answer that,'' offensive tackle Erik Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very surprising, especially when so much is on the line,
so much is at stake,'' linebacker Randall Godfrey said. ``Everybody
has to step up and play and be committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were penalized eight times in the first half. They
lost more yards in the first half to penalties (61) than they
gained rushing (45). It resulted in a 10-7 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard, but we didn't play smart, and that costs
you,'' Gailey said. ``It's frustrating. Look around that locker
room. We're accountable to each other on the field. You have to
play smart to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of dumbfounding play was evident throughout, especially
in the first half when:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tucker's 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown was
brought back on a holding penalty against Lemanski Hall.
</P>
<P>
   An offside penalty on Leon Lett provided the Saints with
first-and-five in Cowboys territory.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman threw behind Chris Brazzell, and Fred Weary made the
interception and returned it to the Cowboys 23, leading to a
touchdown and a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Flozell Adams was called for holding on
third-and-one to create a third-and-11 pass play. The pass fell
incomplete and led to a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Larry Allen jumped offside on second-and-seven
at the Cowboys' 27 to push the offense back into second-and-12 from
the 22, again forcing a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman jumped offside on
third-and-five to give the Saints a first down at their own 42.
</P>
<P>
   All that proceeded unusual fourth-quarter follies by Cowboys
veterans. In the waning moments, Aikman tried to thread a pass to
David LaFleur in the end zone through triple coverage, resulting in
an interception to seal the Saints' victory. Emmitt Smith fumbled,
and Weary returned it 58 yards for the game-winning touchdown.
Deion Sanders was beaten for a 50-yard gain that set up the Saints'
game-tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen, sometimes even to the best of them,'' Smith
said. ``The thing you try to do is keep them to a minimum and not
let them occur at a critical moment. Mine occurred at a critical
moment.'' \Ntagtop:Jeff Caplan, (817) 390-7971

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now and then in television's endless race for ratings, poetic
justice or even just journalistic justice seems to prevail. It's
probably wishful thinking, but the free fall in the fortunes of
``This Week,'' ABC's Sunday morning political-interview program,
may just be a belated reaction to its descent into celebrity
mongering.
</P>
<P>
   The program skated along in first place among the Sunday morning
competitors for many seasons, trading on what must have been the
appeal of made-for-the-tube personalities, including the bombastic
Sam Donaldson as well as Cokie Roberts, practitioner of the ``I'm
just one of the girls'' television style. Increasing amounts of
time have been given to their companions, George Will, George
Stephanopoulos and William Kristol, a clubby band who chuckle at
one another's quips and trade opinions on this and that. They are
reasonably engaging performers, but the format puts them under no
great pressure to come up with anything that might strike viewers
as uncomfortably close to journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the program has been demolished in the ratings
by NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' where Tim Russert can generally be
counted on to come through with tough, probing interviews that
leave the ABC chatterers in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Sunday, for example, Ms. Roberts blathered along at
what seemed to be a tea party with the Mrs. Bushes, senior and
junior, all being as vacuous as the occasion required. Russert, by
contrast, was giving a vigorous workout to Al Gore and Bill
Bradley, managing to pin down differences of policy and
personality. Some weeks before, he had delivered the first longish
interview with George W. Bush, perhaps not the most fascinating
figure around but probably more interesting to most people than his
wife. Even ``Face the Nation,'' the half-hour CBS entry led by the
workmanlike Bob Schieffer, has been catching up to ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday all the talk shows were occupied with the millennium, a
subject that invites hot air, but ``This Week'' again took the
garland for tedium, interviewing officials who had been rounded up
to assure viewers about safety arrangements on the ground, in the
air and in the nation's hospitals. It must have been excruciating
for Will to dutifully keep asking questions whose answers he could
easily have predicted and did not care much about in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it turned out that for once it was safer to be anywhere
other than in the ``This Week'' world, at least for one
participant. The first casualty of the panic at ABC was signaled a
few days ago when the network announced that it would not offer
Kristol, son of Irving and employee of Rupert Murdoch, a long-term
contract. The genial conservative issued a statement that he had no
regrets; he had worked hard, he said, and made a contribution. The
job of sitting around opining on this and that may not strike many
viewers as hard work, but pretending to take Donaldson seriously
week after week may have been a strain.
</P>
<P>
   The official ABC News communicator assured reporters that this
``was not a decision to fix the show.'' She wanted it known that
nobody thought Kristol was ``the problem with the show.''

   The comment was more than a courtesy. Of course Kristol, who
works for The Weekly Standard magazine, which is owned by Murdoch,
was not the problem; as a smart fellow and with his connections
among Republicans, he lent some weight to a determinedly
lightweight operation. But when things go bad in big-money
television journalism, you have to get rid of somebody. One must
hope that the show-fixers don't decide, to borrow a morning-show
image, that the way to strengthen the brew is to increase the
froth.
</P>
<P>
   Since imitation is not unknown on television, how about picking
up from the lessons being delivered by NBC and CBS? Instead of a
kaffeeklatsch for a few members of the Beltway gang, amply
available all over the cable channels, how about cutting back on
the chatter and using one or two interviewers to dig into the
issues? The program doesn't have to have bonhomie, just informed
reporters, thanks, if possible without high-coiffeur images.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The room in Peter Schickele's Upper West Side
apartment where he composes and listens to music is in considerable
disarray. LPs and CDs are stacked atop and beneath the Yamaha grand
that takes up much of the space. Tapes, scores and more CDs cover
his desk, and a handful of Grammy Awards for his P.D.Q. Bach albums
are stashed haphazardly on a bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Schickele had an excuse. Having built his career on his passion
for an unusually wide range of musical styles and an uncanny sense
of how to combine them in entertaining and illuminating ways, he
had been invited to discuss some of the recordings that he
considered the best of the century, or _ why not? _ the millennium.
And he had been doing some preparatory rummaging, pulling albums
from floor-to-ceiling shelves holding perhaps 4,000 discs, CDs
making up the top two-thirds, LPs at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he protested, ``I'd prefer to say they were my
favorites, rather than `the best.' I don't believe in absolute
values of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not surprising that unruliness appears to be the
room's natural state: Schickele's most famous creation _ P.D.Q.,
the fictional ``last and least'' of J.S. Bach's musical offspring _
is a study in chaos, meant to tweak the classical music world's
pretensions with a balance of slapstick and sophisticated
musicological parody. The stage persona that he adopts for his
P.D.Q. Bach shows (his latest can be seen Sunday night and
Wednesday at Carnegie Hall) is that of a studiedly disheveled
academic, devoted to the study of P.D.Q.'s life and work.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unreasonable to expect anyone as busy as Schickele,
64, to also keep a tidy work room. Besides writing works for his
P.D.Q. Bach shows (this year's premiere is a string quartet called
``The Moose,'' S.Y2K), he is a prolific composer of symphonic,
chamber and vocal music. His recent works include a symphony, which
the New York Philharmonic played last season; a set of chamber
works that the Lark Quartet recorded, and a film score for Maurice
Sendak's ``Where the Wild Things Are.''
</P>
<P>
   The omnivorous eclecticism that keeps the P.D.Q. shows lively
informs these compositions as well. And that same spirit runs
through ``Schickele Mix,'' his radio show. Since 1992 he has
recorded about 170 installments for Public Radio International. (In
New York it runs on WNYC-FM, 93.9, on Saturdays at 4 p.m.) Each has
a theme, usually an exploration of a musical form (sonatas, fugues,
variations and marches, for example) or a technical aspect of
composition, like rhythm, meter or how transitions work.
</P>
<P>
   A dry music-appreciation lecture is not Schickele's way. Taking
the view that ``if it sounds good, it is good'' _ a notion he
attributes to Duke Ellington _ he illustrates his points with
suites in which he is likely to juxtapose a Mozart symphony
movement, a Beatles song, a jazz piece by Gerry Mulligan, a
17th-century dance by Praetorius and an obscure cowboy ballad.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of playlist that makes a listener wonder what the
host's record collection is like, and when asked for an annotated
tour, with his favorite discs singled out, Schickele readily
agreed. He also assembled a list of more than 60 favorites, adding
several more during a conversation that was periodically
interrupted for a sampling of the more obscure entries. Several
choices have not yet been transferred to CD, but the assiduous disc
hunter might find them in collectors' shops.
</P>
<P>
   One such rarity, the officiously titled ``Music of Africa
Series, No. 11: Best Recordings of 1953, Part 2,'' is at the top of
Schickele's list. A 10-inch LP on the British Decca label, it
includes field recordings of traditional tribal chants and
ceremonial music. Schickele received the disc as a gift in the
mid-1950s, when ethnomusicologists were the principal audience for
such recordings. Today it might be a hot item in a world-music
catalog were it not long out of print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a lot of the things on this album, but there is one
track that has been terribly important to me,'' he said, singling
out ``Auou Mungoya,'' a four-minute recording of the Bantu Gogo
tribe. The piece begins as a chant and expands into a harmonization
that, to Western ears, sounds like the mildly dissonant dominant
seventh chord. But while in Western music the dominant seventh is
usually followed by a chord in which the tension of the dissonance
is resolved, the Gogo tribesmen maintain the harmonization as the
melody continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used this harmonic system in quite a few of my classical
pieces,'' Schickele said. ``There's a section of my symphony that's
directly inspired by it.''
</P>
<P>
   More recent world music recordings made it to his list as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the music that Bartok got it from,'' he said, handing
over his copy of ``Balkanology,'' a recording by Ivo Papasov, a
Bulgarian clarinetist, and his orchestra (Hannibal, on CD), and
referring to folk music currents in some of Bartok's works. ``This
is a modern guy who has a band and actually plays weddings,
although weddings are a little different there than they are here.
They go on for four days. And he's one of the world's great
virtuoso instrumentalists. What gets me is that the tunes are
played at an incredibly fast tempo, yet they have all these little
turns and embellishments.''
</P>
<P>
   This music, too, left its mark on a section of Schickele's
Symphony. When the work was performed by the National Symphony in
Washington, Schickele recommended the recording to a
contrabassoonist who was having trouble with some of the passage
work. ``When I saw him later,'' Schickele said, ``he told me, `It's
so much easier to play that lick in your symphony now that I've
listened to Papasov.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schickele has always been drawn to American folk music as well.
``Swarthmore College, which I attended from 1952 to 1957, was one
of the first colleges to present a folk music festival,'' Schickele
said as he cued up Jean Ritchie's a cappella recording of ``Guide
Me O Thou Great Jehovah'' from her album ``Saturday Night and
Sunday Too'' (Riverside, on LP). ``When Jean Ritchie sang this, it
was the only time in my life I remember calling friends at
intermission and saying, `You've got to get down here.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard anything like this in American music,'' he
continued. ``The vocal embellishments sounded almost Eastern to me.
When I was growing up, folk music was Burl Ives, whom I still love
_ he's a charming presence _ but I had never heard the
down-and-dirty stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered Earl Taylor's ``Folk Songs From the Blue Grass''
(United Artists, LP) in 1960, when he was living in Los Angeles and
had a foundation grant to compose music for high schools. ``This is
one of my all-time favorite albums,'' he said. ``I love the energy
of this band. I also love harmony singing, and this has a lot of
it. My producer on `Schickele Mix' kids me that by the time the
series ends, people will have heard the whole album because I use
different songs to illustrate different things.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true of several rock albums as well. The Beatles
seem to turn up on every other show; pressed to select one album,
he chose ``Rubber Soul'' (Capitol). ``I like the simplicity of the
arrangements, and the quiet swing. It really rocks without being
frantic.'' Among the other rock discs he pulled from the shelves
were the Rolling Stones' ``Beggar's Banquet'' (Decca), Elvis
Presley's ``Golden Records'' (RCA), Fairport Convention's ``Full
House'' (Hannibal), the Beach Boys' ``Smiley Smile'' (Capitol) and
Bob Dylan's ``John Wesley Harding'' (Columbia), all reissued on CD.
</P>
<P>
   The last two were quirky choices, not the discs typically cited
as the artists' best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said, ``most people would choose `Pet Sounds' for
the Beach Boys, and I love that, too. But there's something about
the feeling of `Smiley Smile.' It has `Good Vibrations,' for one
thing. There are also early explorations of Minimalist techniques,
in the way they repeat certain things without changing, as well as
songs like `Wind Chimes,' where the changes are so unusual that you
have no idea where they're going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of affinities, there are people who react to words
and people who react to music. I'm definitely a music kind of guy,
and it took me a while to come to Dylan. And while `John Wesley
Harding' is perhaps not as universally well regarded as `Bringing
It All Back Home' and some of those earlier ones, I like its
spareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Dear Landlord,' for example, you have just guitar, bass,
drums and piano. Simple, direct. And songs like `All Along the
Watchtower' are so powerful, even if I don't know what they're
about, exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching into his jazz section, Schickele fished out a pair of
Miles Davis classics, ``Kind of Blue'' and ``Porgy and Bess''
(Columbia); Ornette Coleman's ``Shape of Jazz to Come'' (Atlantic)
and the Oscar Peterson Trio's ``At the Stratford Shakespearean
Festival'' (Verve). (All are available on CD.) But the discs he
seemed fondest of were ``Gerry Mulligan Quartet'' (Pacific Jazz,
reissued on a Mosaic CD), the group's first album, and Lennie
Tristano's ``Jazz Record Series'' (Atlantic, reissued on a Rhino
CD).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you know these,'' he said, putting the
Mulligan disc on the turntable, ``but this quartet was baritone
sax, bass, trumpet and drums: no piano, nothing to fill in the
chords. It makes for a fantastically clear three-part counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennie Tristano does this hard bop style of playing that's
unlike a lot of other pianists. A lot of it is in the middle of the
piano, in the tenor range rather than up high. And he doesn't fill
in the chords a lot. Another thing I picked up from him was the
idea that the deaccentuation of notes can be as important as their
accentuation. One note will suddenly drop way down in the volume.
It's a great effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Schickele's classical tastes, too, are
idiosyncratic. Among Mozart symphonies, for example, he chose the
earliest ones, in 1950s recordings by Erich Leinsdorf (Westminster;
a CD reissue is out of print), rather than the 40th, or the 41st,
the ``Jupiter.'' Among his favorites are Stravinsky's recordings of
his Symphony in Three Movements and Symphony of Psalms (Sony
Classical, CD) and a disc by the pianist Maurizio Pollini with the
Boulez Sonata No. 2 and works by Webern, Prokofiev and Stravinsky
(Deutsche Grammophon, CD).
</P>
<P>
   Although Schickele said he enjoyed current period-instrument
groups, many of his choices in pre-Romantic music reflected styles
that prevailed in the 1950s and '60s or earlier. One favorite, for
example, is a 1962 collection of dances by Praetorius, Widmann and
Schein, performed by the Collegium Terpsichore (Archiv, reissued on
CD by Boston Skyline).
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge this was the first of what you might call the
Renaissance big band recordings,'' he said. ``The players added
percussion, even though those parts weren't written in those days.
But the performances are so lively and peppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Schickele's choice of Bach ``Brandenburgs'' is similarly
nostalgic: a long out-of-print traversal conducted by Fritz Reiner
(Columbia, LP).
</P>
<P>
   ``These would be completely inauthentic now,'' he conceded.
``But, boy, the sense of rhythm and momentum still sounds good to
me. And in terms of the musicianship involved, these are among my
favorite Bach recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, a visitor looking through Schickele's shelves found
P.D.Q. Bach filed under Bach, with the real members of the Bach
family, rather than with the Monty Python and Spike Jones discs on
the comedy shelf, or with the other works by their composer,
Schickele.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, of course he is,'' Schickele said with a rolling laugh.
``What did you think?''

   Frazier recalls the sound of people cursing at pay phones, and
the noise of the fan in the phone booth, ``the essence of romantic

FOUR MEMBERS OF BANNED CHINESE SECT SENTENCED TO PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Three men and a woman accused of being top leaders of
the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement were given prison
sentences Sunday ranging up to 18 years, including the two harshest
terms for Chinese political dissidents in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The severe sentences, issued by a Beijing court after a one-day
trial, and their prominent announcement on national television were
clearly intended to show the authorities' determination to crush
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has gained millions of enthusiastic followers in
recent years. It was officially condemned and outlawed as an ``evil
cult'' in July after it held unauthorized demonstrations, including
one by 10,000 people who surrounded the Communist leaders' compound
in Beijing in April.
</P>
<P>
   That silent demonstration, and the evident appeal of Falun Gong
across society and even among members of the Communist Party, seems
to have touched a raw nerve in the secretive leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All four of those sentenced Sunday were party members, with the
most severe term, 18 years, reserved for Li Chang, 59, an official
in the Police Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Zhiwen, 50, an engineer in a company of the Railways
Ministry, was sentenced to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The convictions, said an announcement Sunday night by the New
China News Agency, involved charges of ``organizing and using the
cult organization to undermine the implementation of laws, causing
human deaths by organizing and using the cult organization, and
illegally obtaining state secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   A dynamic offshoot of Chinese qigong, which is said to harness
invisible forces to promote health and well-being, Falun Gong had
been popular among retirees and middle-aged women, who gathered in
urban parks to practice its slow, meditative exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the membership of officials and party members was a sign of
the broad appeal that so frightened the national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The others convicted Sunday are Ji Liewu, 36, a manager of a
Hong Kong subsidiary of a government metals company, who was
sentenced to 12 years in prison, and Yao Jie, 40, leader of the
Communist Party committee of a large real estate company in
Beijing, sentenced to 7 years.
</P>
<P>
   The television news Sunday night said Ms. Yao had received a
lighter sentence because she had only been an accessory to the
``principal culprits'' and had expressed ``sincere remorse.'' It
said Li had also been repentant and that his 18-year sentence was
lighter than it might otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
   Previous accounts in the official press said that all four had
been accused of being key organizers of the surprise demonstration
last April 25 by more than 10,000 members around the leadership
compound in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who was a deputy director in the computer bureau of the
Ministry of Public Security, or police, and Wang are said to have
played especially important roles, plotting with the group's
founder, Li Hongzhi. The founder lives in exile in New York but has
admitted he visited Beijing quietly just before the April protest.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful but brazen gathering in April was a protest against
what followers believed was the growing persecution of their group.
But it also revealed the group's capacity to mobilize people from
various provinces, right under the noses of the police. That
shocked Chinese leaders, who were already worried about threats to
social stability from unemployed workers and angry farmers.
</P>
<P>
   That demonstration and other smaller ones in various cities led
the government to outlaw Falun Gong on July 22 as, in the words of
one editorial, ``a cancer on the society and a scourge of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was soon accused of causing the deaths of more than
1,400 followers by persuading them to reject modern medicine. Its
founder was said to harbor plans to undermine the state and the
Communist Party, which he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that more than 150 Falun Gong members have been
formally charged with crimes, but only a few have gone to trial and
Sunday's prosecutions are likely to be among the most important.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown hundreds of followers have been sent without trial to
labor camps for ``re-education'' while thousands, including many
who converged on Beijing this fall to protest the banning of the
group, were temporarily detained or harassed.
</P>
<P>
   A warrant is out for the arrest of Li Hongzhi, the former
government clerk who founded Falun Gong in 1992, offering a new
blend of qigong, Buddhism, Taoism and his own theories for
harnessing cosmic powers. Since he moved to New York in 1998, he
has communicated with his growing global movement through Internet
sites as well as networks of personal contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Li's writings say that his movement offers the best path to a
healthy body as well as personal salvation, and suggests that
practitioners may attain supernatural powers. He condemns drinking,
smoking, homosexuality and the corruption of modern society.
</P>
<P>
   His theories gained a quick following, especially among insecure
laid-off workers and retirees in Chinese cities, who are often
obsessed with their health.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the founder in New York said Sunday that he was
unavailable for comment. But the spokesmen, Gail Rachlin and Erping
Zhang, issued a statement condemning Sunday's proceeding as a
``show-trial'' that was reminiscent of ``the grim time of the
Cultural Revolution'' and showed ``the Chinese government's
unwillingness to respect its own Constitution and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   They repeated Li Hongzhi's calls for dialogue with the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese, including relatives of people who became
preoccupied with Falun Gong, have expressed reservations about the
group and the devotion to Li Hongzhi shown by some fervent
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people here have been puzzled by the ferocity of the
government's campaign to crush the group, involving such methods as
televised recantations by former members and relentless, escalating
official vilification.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities seem to have been surprised and angered
that, despite the banning of the group and intense propaganda
describing it as dishonest and dangerous, thousands of devoted
followers have remained defiant. Risking their homes and jobs, many
sneaked into Beijing this fall and tried to mount protests in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, though it has loosened control over many
aspects of personal life, guards a monopoly on politics and does
not allow independent social organizations. Political experts say
that leaders may feel they have no choice but to crush a looming
movement like Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, security was tight around Tiananmen Square, where dozens
of Falun Gong followers were detained in the course of the day but
no large demonstrations were successfully mounted. Police also
cordoned off the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in the
western part of the city, where the brief trial was held.
</P>
<P>
   Each defendant had an attorney, but convictions are certain in
such politically charged trials here.
</P>
<P>
   Only one relative of each defendant was allowed in the
courtroom, and they were warned not to speak with the press. The
daughter of Wang Zhiwen, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison,
spoke by telephone Sunday from San Antonio, Texas, where she moved
two years ago with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really shocked,'' said the daughter, a student who
said she has practiced Falun Gong since she was 12. ``How can this
kind of thing happen to the people around you? The Chinese
government just did this to warn everyone how tough it can be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Court investigations, according to a report Sunday night by the
New China News Agency, found that the four defendants had colluded
with Li Hongzhi to organize Falun Gong across China, establishing
``39 Falun Gong subheadquarters, 1,900 teaching posts and over
28,000 practicing posts across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter two categories apparently refer to the spots in parks
where groups of practitioners put up signs to attract new followers
for the daily exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that before and after the April 25 protest in
Beijing, the accused had helped to organize 78 illegal
demonstrations involving 300 people or more, which ``seriously
disrupted public order.''
</P>
<P>
   The conviction of the four for leaking state secrets involved
the apparent acquisition by Falun Gong leaders of government plans
for the crackdown against the group, and their publication in open
letters to members and the government. The court Sunday said it
found ``37 separate items of secret state information'' had been
retrieved from the homes of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The court reportedly also found that the group earned $5.4
million in ``illegal profit'' from the sale of the founder's books.
But past charges in the press of large-scale fraud and profiteering
have not been substantiated.

FREAK STORM BLITZES EUROPE, KILLING SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A fierce storm with hurricane force winds barreled
across northern France and parts of Switzerland and Germany on
Sunday, injuring hundreds and killing as many as 62 people,
including one victim who was crushed in a falling ski gondola in
the Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The freak gales, which reached 95 mph in the heart of Paris,
left broken branches and uprooted trees along the Champs-Elysee,
smashed windows at Versailles and littered this city with twisted
awnings, smashed roof tiles and Christmas trees ripped from their
planters.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of once neatly parked motorcycles lay in helter-skelter
piles in the streets. Huge sheets of roofing and television dishes
rested in the gutters, and many of Paris' tourist destinations
closed for fear of further falling debris. One of them was
Disneyland Paris, where six people visiting the Davy Crockett Ranch
were seriously injured by falling branches.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the need to clean up, most of Paris' gardens and
public spaces will be closed until late Monday, the authorities
said. Mayor Jean Tiberi called for the city to be declared a
disaster area and asked for state funds to help with repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day the city's train stations and airports were
filled with holiday travelers, most of them glum and angry as
services were widely disrupted. The airports closed for two hours,
but delays and cancellations continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also shut seven of the city's 14 subway lines as
well as nearly all commuter train services to and from the suburbs.
Paris, which has for days been full to bursting with tourists, was
eerily quiet, and the streets were virtually empty.
</P>
<P>
   The Champs-Elysee, a favorite place to stroll _ which is to be
the focus of this city's millennium celebrations and is already
home to 12 specially erected Ferris wheels _ was shut completely.
The authorities feared that pedestrians might be hit by flying roof
debris.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also helped push hundreds of tons of viscous fuel oil
onto the beaches along France's Atlantic coast, where bad weather
has hindered efforts to contain the damage caused two weeks ago
when a tanker broke up in stormy seas.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the area, France's minister of environment,
Dominique Voynet, said the situation had become very grave. ``What
is really striking,'' she said, ``is the fact that the elements are
against us. You can't take the boats out and do the things you
would like to do to battle this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 tons of the tar-like oil are believed to have
escaped from the tanker, but so far, pumping vessels have mopped up
only about 1,000 tons. On the beaches Sunday, hundreds of
volunteers used shovels to pick up globs of the smelly, black oil,
but rough seas just kept delivering more of it.
</P>
<P>
   While stormy weather had been predicted, the force of the winds
took meteorologists by surprise. In Paris, such winds have never
been recorded before, officials said. Nor did they loose strength
as they moved rapidly eastward. The storm, which gathered force
over the Atlantic, apparently hit the Brittany coast at about 4
a.m. Sunday and had crossed France by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   While a storm this strong is ``very unusual,'' it is not
unprecedented, said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania
State University. This one, he said, ``just happened to have all of
the ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a storm system characterized by unusually low
atmospheric pressure, to an extent normally associated with a
hurricane, moved off the Atlantic into Europe, Warner said. Low
pressure is a measure of the intensity of a storm; the lower the
pressure, the worse the storm.
</P>
<P>
   French officials estimated that nearly 2 million households lost
electricity at some point and that nearly half that many would
probably go the night without power.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those hurt or killed were hit by falling debris. In
Paris, one person was gravely injured on the Avenue du Maine when a
piece of a chimney broke off. On Rue de Pergolese two passers-by
were hurt when a building facade collapsed. On the outskirts of
Paris in Versailles, one man was killed when a tree fell on his
car. In Argenteuil, a couple died when the roof of their apartment
building caved in.
</P>
<P>
   And one woman, apparently walking her dog, drowned when she was
swept into a river near Strasbourg. Another woman was apparently
blown into Le Havre harbor.
</P>
<P>
   News broadcasts showed helicopter views of devastation across
the country, where roads were blocked by fallen trees, cars were
crushed under piles of debris, roofs had been ripped off and small
planes had been dragged across runways and tipped upside down.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac expressed his sympathies for the
families who had been hurt in the storm and issued a statement
praising rescue workers. Paris firefighters said they had received
10,000 inquiries and responded to 1,600 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The gale-force winds also swept through parts of Switzerland
reaching 120 mph at some points.
</P>
<P>
   In the ski resort of Crans Montana, one skier was killed and
four injured, two seriously, when an uprooted tree crashed into the
cable of a ski lift, sending the gondola they were in crashing to
the ground. Other deaths included an elderly man blown off his roof
near Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   In southwestern Germany, six people died, most of them in road
accidents caused by fallen trees, including three occupants of a
car hit by a tree near Ettlingen.
</P>
<P>
   France's national weather service said rain and strong winds
would continue through Monday but would not reach the levels seen
earlier Sunday.

   Many Year 2000 Worriers Starting to Close Up Shop
</P>
<P>
   After devoting months and sometimes years to raising
consciousness about potential year 2000 disruptions, many prominent
worriers are folding up their tents. For example, Peter de Jager,
the Canadian programmer who became a year 2000 Paul Revere in 1993,
has put Year2000.com, the popular Internet site he created, up for
sale at eBay.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crusade part of this is just about over,'' said Edward
Yardeni, a Wall Street economist who still thinks there is a 70
percent chance that year 2000 breakdowns will usher in a worldwide
recession. ``Now it's just a matter of what happens. There's no
point in being alarmist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   More Moves Seen for `This Week'
</P>
<P>
   Inside ABC News, staff members viewed last week's dismissal of
William Kristol, the conservative commentator, as perhaps only an
initial move in what most conclude is a long overdue reshaping of
the network's faltering Sunday morning discussion program, ``This
Week.'' David Westin, the president of ABC News, removed the show's
longtime executive producer in September. But ratings have
continued to decline, and many producers and correspondents at the
network think the main problem is the absence of a single anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Web Retailers Discover Warranties
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, online buyers were spared the hard sell for
extended service warranties. Now, retailers are looking more
closely at warranty options. Not only can extended warranties
generate more profit than the products they cover, but they give
online merchants the chance to bolster what has generally been an
anemic record of post-sale support.

   U.N. Helps to Wire East Timor

   While aid workers help East Timor's people build an economy and

Program sent an official to bring the World Wide Web to the capital
and to begin designing the kind of national data network that is
fast becoming vital to participation in the new information
economy.

   TV Station Adopts Web Format
</P>
<P>
   A cable television channel in Canada is trying to blur the lines
between TV and the Internet. Its news screen has seven different
fields of information, including stock prices, weather updates,
headline news and a rotating selection of shots of area roads so
that people can check traffic conditions. The idea is to provide
information quickly, and so far the format seems to be successful
in attracting viewers.

   Publisher in Israel Is Indicted

   Dream of Convergence Dies Hard
</P>
<P>
   Americans have traditionally shunned devices that combined too
many functions or inappropriately matched them into one unit. That
has been especially notable this holiday season as consumers
snapped up record numbers of specialized electronic devices, from
digital cameras to electronic organizers. But that has not stymied
the idea of converging personal computers, television and the Web.

observance of Christmas, will reopen Monday. Some foreign markets

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thanks to projections of a large and growing
federal budget surplus, the presidential candidates are proposing
ambitious initiatives that reveal clear differences within and
between the parties over taxes, spending programs and Social
Security's long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the candidates this time around
are not constrained by the need to deal with big budget deficits.
Indeed, it is likely that the current forecast of a $3 trillion
surplus over the next decade _ of which $2 trillion would come from
excess Social Security revenues _ will be revised upward in the
next several months, putting even more money on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidates in both parties have already set out
plans to use all or most of the surplus, and are vigorously
debating the relative merits of tax cuts, plans to reduce the
national debt and ambitious efforts to address issues like health
care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are edging into a debate over how they would use the
bounty of the nation's current prosperity to address the
politically explosive problems facing the two most sacrosanct of
government programs, Social Security and Medicare. Without any
changes, both programs could run short of money in the next few
decades as the vast baby boom generation ages.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore would divide the surplus among a variety
of purposes, including reducing the national debt, a strategy he
said would be a first step towards fixing Social Security. Gore
would also provide money to shore up Medicare and increase spending
on education, health care and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, would use most
of the non-Social Security surplus on his proposal to expand access
to health care, while reserving the Social Security surplus to deal
with the retirement system's problems in ways that he has yet to
describe.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans, Sen. John McCain of Arizona is drawing a
distinction between his emphasis on using most of the surplus to
deal with Social Security and the big tax cut proposed by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. Both Bush and McCain support increased
spending for the military and reining in spending on many domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the fiscal plans set up a traditional choice
between Republican tax-cutting and Democratic spending. But they
also provide the framework for an emerging debate over how to
prepare for the aging of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither has yet laid out a detailed plan, their aides
said Bush and McCain both favored using the Social Security surplus
to finance the creation of a new system of private investment
accounts within the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   In allocating money to set up the accounts, McCain would go
further than Bush, dedicating not just the Social Security surplus
but a majority of the non-Social Security surplus as well.
</P>
<P>
   Private accounts have been vigorously debated in Congress for
the last two years, with proponents saying that they would allow
the country to tap into the power of the financial markets to
ensure the retirement security of the baby boomers and their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates, by contrast, oppose creating private
accounts within Social Security, saying such a step would introduce
too much risk into a program intended to be a safety net for
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so far had little to say on the subject. But Gore
strongly backs a plan developed by the Clinton administration to
dedicate the Social Security surplus to debt reduction, and his
advisers say they are eager to begin a debate with the Republicans
on the issue, which they predict will take center stage in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use the Social Security surplus to pay down the $3.5
trillion portion of the national debt held by the public in the
form of Treasury bonds. The vice president says debt reduction
would yield lower interest rates and higher rates of economic
growth, leaving the government with a stronger balance sheet and
the ability to direct the interest savings into paying Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dedicating the nearly $2 trillion in Social
Security surpluses to debt reduction over the next decade, he has
earmarked $374 billion of the $1 billion non-Social Security
surplus for Medicare. He would also provide $146 billion for his
health care program, $115 billion for education, $127 billion for
the military and $190 billion for other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say the vice president's strategy is to seek the
middle of the road, resisting both the big spending programs
advocated by Bradley and the sweeping tax cuts proposed by Bush and
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he looks around, he sees on the one side this reckless tax
cut mentality, and on the other side he sees this reckless spending
mentality,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a policy adviser to Gore. ``Both
of those are things that the last seven years of Democratic
leadership have taught us to stay away from.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has regularly suggested that Bradley is open to
further raising the retirement age _ an assertion Bradley says is
wrong _ no candidates in either party has emphasized the likelihood
that using the surplus will not be enough to solve Social
Security's problems, which by current estimates could leave the
retirement program short of money starting in 2033. And they have
repeatedly dodged questions about which of several painful options,
including reducing guaranteed benefits and raising taxes, they
might support to put the system on sound footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a leader who's going to be able to convene a
bipartisan approach to this problem to consider all the
possibilities,'' Bradley said in his Dec. 19 debate with Gore, on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fiscal plan is built around his proposal to improve
access to health care, which he estimates would cost as much as $65
billion a year, to be paid for out of the surplus. He would spend
another $10 billion a year on child poverty reduction, $2.6 billion
on programs to help working families and $1.3 billion on farm aid.
If fully enacted immediately, his plans would cost as much as $80
billion a year by his own reckoning, or $800 billion over 10 years
out of a non-Social Security surplus of $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a moment now when we have an opportunity to solve
some big problems we haven't been able to address before,'' said
Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman. ``We should fix the roof while
the sun is shining.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls suggesting that tax cuts do not rank high as a
priority for most voters, Bush, the Republican front-runner, has
made his tax cut, which he values at $483 billion over five years,
the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says his tax plan, which would likely use up nearly all of
the non-Social Security surplus over 10 years, or perhaps even
more, would provide benefits to workers across the income spectrum.
Moreover, he said, by putting money back in the hands of taxpayers
it would keep Washington from spending it on ever-larger government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get rid of the so-called surpluses in the
short term is to put Al Gore or Bill Bradley as president of the
United States, and they'll spend it all,'' Bush said at the most
recent Republican debate, earlier this month in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they had not decided whether to put out a
detailed plan for Social Security. But they said that Bush
generally favored creating individual Social Security investment
accounts, financed by perhaps 2 or 3 percentage points of the 12.4
percent payroll tax that supports the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   To create private accounts on that scale while still having
enough revenue to pay current Social Security beneficiaries would
probably require using the entire $2 trillion in Social Security
surpluses over the next decade, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach would leave Bush vulnerable to attack from
Democrats that he is forgoing an opportunity to reduce or even pay
off the national debt held by the public. But Bush's advisers said
that creating private accounts would help reduce the national debt
by another definition _ the government's deferred obligations to
pay Social Security benefits down the road for which no money has
been put aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, fixing Social Security is as effective
at improving the balance sheet of the United States as a direct
debt paydown,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republican candidates have Social Security plans of
their own. And now McCain is starting to question whether Bush is
too focused on tax cuts at the expense of ensuring Social
Security's survival.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush would reserve the $2 trillion Social Security surplus
for the retirement system, McCain proposes using the $2 trillion
plus 62 percent of the non-Social Security surplus _ roughly
another $620 billion over 10 years _ to pay for a revamped system
including personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   That approach leaves McCain with relatively little money out of
the surplus for tax cuts. But his emerging fiscal strategy is that
shoring up Social Security will trump Bush's tax plan even among
the Republican faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until his campaign offers a fuller explanation of his plan,
it's difficult to see how Governor Bush's tax proposal leaves
enough money for Social Security,'' said Dan Schnur, a spokesman
for McCain.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a child, George Stevens Jr. loved to hang around
the movie sets where his father, the celebrated director, was
working.
</P>
<P>
   George Sr., director of such classics as ``Woman of the Year,''
``A Place in the Sun'' and ``Shane,'' was often asked if young
George would follow him into the business.
</P>
<P>
   George Sr. would laugh and say, ``Oh, I think he may go
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course he did not. George Jr. worked with his father on
``The Diary of Anne Frank'' and ``Giant'' and, by the time he was
28, had directed episodes of the television series ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents'' and ``Peter Gunn.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gone on to a career producing and directing hundreds of
films for the federal government, numerous documentaries and dozens
of television specials, including the annual ``Kennedy Center
Honors.'' He was executive producer of the 1998 film ``The Thin Red
Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, George Stevens is co-producing his biggest outdoor
extravaganza, the New Year's Eve celebration of ``America's
Millennium,'' on the Mall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is 67 but looks a decade younger. He wears a perpetual
smile and has a glimmer in his eye as if a key light were following
him, as he conducts a tour of the giant stage he has built on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   It is from here that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton will welcome the new century, but they are bit players in
the $10 million production that Stevens and Quincy Jones are
concocting.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to speak a few minutes before
midnight on New Year's Eve, after a 19-minute Steven Spielberg
paean to America called ``The Unfinished Journey'' accompanied by
an original score by John Williams. In keeping with the patriotic
theme, the host will be Will Smith, the actor who saved America
from aliens bent on annihilation in ``Independence Day,'' backed up
by 30 dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle, the opera divas, will be
there to raise the brow of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who commutes between Washington and Los Angeles and who
has long been active in Democratic politics, said that he was
recruited by Mrs. Clinton three years ago to help design the
celebration. He said the Clintons had also sounded out Jones and
Spielberg about what might be an ``appropriate manifestation'' of
the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is busy on several other film projects, said he had
decided to take on the millennium celebration ``because it is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity _ you might even say an honor _ to be
able to conceive this with Quincy,'' Stevens said. The result was a
gigantic undertaking encompassing hundreds of workers, tons of
sound, lighting and video equipment trucked in from California and
New York, and complex security considerations involving the local
police, the Park Police and the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has mixed government service with filmmaking for much of
his career. He served in the Kennedy administration as director of
movie and television services for the U.S. Information Agency,
working under Edward R. Murrow. Among his projects were
documentaries on the Little Rock school desegregation battle and
the death of President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson named Stevens founding director of the
American Film Institute, which is dedicated to preserving archival
films and supporting aspiring filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and his wife, Liz, are active in the Washington social
scene, frequently entertaining the city's media and political elite
at their Georgetown home. They are die-hard Democrats, but
latecomers to the Clinton bandwagon, preferring the more
old-fashioned Democratic politics of Robert F. Kennedy and his
ideological heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton saw valuable allies in the Stevenses and
cultivated them for their ties to the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   That, in part, accounts for Stevens' selection as co-producer of
the millennium show, which is being staged in close consultation
with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities expect a crowd of 100,000 to gather on Friday
evening at the base of the Lincoln Memorial, with tens of thousands
more on the grounds of the Washington Monument and along the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   While the producers have devoted thousands of hours to planning
the entertainment and the speeches, the event may be remembered
most for the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   A half-minute before midnight, a burning fuse will travel the
length of the reflecting pool, ending at the base of the Washington
Monument. As the final seconds of the century tick away, the
monument will be transformed into a giant Roman candle, sheathed in
cascading pyrotechnic light. At the stroke of midnight, the sky
behind the obelisk will turn golden with fireworks, symbolizing,
Stevens said, ``something about aspiration and the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the whole program, Stevens said, is to celebrate the
American experiment in popular government _ and to have a little
fun along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the persiflage and hype and expense,'' he said,
``our hope is to somehow capture a little of the wonder of
democracy on the swamp that George Washington chose as our capital
and designed into a city, between the monuments to Lincoln and
Washington with the Capitol in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this cynical age,'' he concluded, ``it makes your heart
beat a little faster.''

 CARTOON-THEMED SLOT MACHINES OUTRAGE GAMBLING CRITICS  (jw) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Instead of lemons, cherries and black bars, a new
slot machine sports characters from the popular television show
``South Park.'' Another shows clips of ``The Three Stooges'' and
lures gamblers with the sound of Curly's trademark ``Nyuk, nyuk,
nyuk.'' Other machines feature Betty Boop, the Addams Family, the
Pink Panther and the Munsters.
</P>
<P>
   Slot machine makers are turning to popular themes to make
betting more entertaining and appealing for those who are not
dedicated gamblers. The trend worries regulators and critics, who
say that these new machines could appeal to children, worsening the
national problem of underage gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Gaming Control Board is drafting rules that would ban
cartoon, comic book other themes based on material ``primarily''
intended for children. What happens in Nevada is expected to
influence other states, like New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a myriad of themes that these games can be based on
other than Saturday morning cartoon characters,'' said Steve
DuCharme, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Technology, said this month that the panel
would investigate the issue. He wrote a letter to the Federal Trade
Commission asking for its assistance in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling industry executives say the new machines are intended
to appeal not to children but to nostalgic adults. And in any case,
they add, children are not allowed to use slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   But in Nevada, slot machines are allowed at airports,
supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants, and critics say
that children can be exposed to them there, as well as when they
walk through casinos with adults. In addition, a Supreme Court
decision this year lifted a ban on gambling advertisements on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Using its existing power, the Nevada agency has already
informally rejected the South Park slot machine and a proposed one
based on Spider-Man, DuCharme said. The commission also blocked a
game called Easy Street that features a display that looks like the
board game ``Candyland.'' The manufacturer, Casino Data Systems,
says any similarity was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents draw parallels between the ``slots for tots''
controversy and the battle over ``Joe Camel,'' the cartoon
character dropped by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in 1997 after
criticism that it was luring children to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of gambling opponents sent a letter last month to
the House and Senate commerce committees, warning, ``These
child-enticing slot machines are the latest innovation in a broader
advertising and marketing campaign by casinos and the gambling
industry to promote a `family friendly' image and, apparently, to
bring children to the casinos and thereby shape the next generation
of gambling addicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay James, chairwoman of the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission, and three other members were among the signers.
Chartered by Congress to study the social and economic effects of
gambling, the commission concluded in June that as many as 1.1
million adolescents ages 12 to 18 are pathological gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the business say that these concerns are overblown and
that there is no evidence the new machines are attracting children.
``The presence of a slot machine that has a cartoon character on it
is not the reason someone under 21 is trying to get into a
casino,'' said Philip Satre, chairman of Harrah's Entertainment, a
major casino chain. Peer pressure is the main factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Machine manufacturers say that unlike cigarettes, slot machines
are rarely advertised outside casinos. Moreover, since children are
not allowed to gamble, there is no point developing machines for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we invest a million dollars in a game that has no
return?'' said Ed Rogich, vice president for marketing at
International Game Technology, which developed the South Park
machine and several others at issue. ``We're not looking at a
five-year plan,'' he added. ``The game lives or dies in the first
two weeks it's on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Slot machine manufacturers say that children can be exposed to
gambling in many other ways. Toys R Us advertises a toy slot
machine on its Web site for children 6 and older. And the
commission report indicates that much of underage gambling consists
of card games, lotteries and sports betting, not casino play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, casino executives are worried that the controversy
provides an easy target for opponents of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a Joe Camel,'' said Mike Sloan, a vice president
of the Mandalay Resort Group. Station Casinos Inc. last month
removed Shuffle Master Inc.'s Three Stooges and Alliance Gaming
Corp.'s Betty Boop machines from its properties because of the
controversy and because they were not attracting enough business.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is sensitive for casinos because many of them _
especially in Las Vegas _ are trying to change from betting parlors
into full-fledged resorts. That has meant providing restaurants,
shopping and entertainment for the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, regulators say, the casinos here do prevent those
younger than 21 from gambling, although there have been lapses. The
Las Vegas Hilton was fined $350,000 last year because children
waiting in line for its ``Star Trek'' ride were found in the casino
and some were seen gambling. In Atlantic City, N.J., 36,441 minors
were escorted out of casinos last year, though fewer than 400 were
actually caught gambling, according to the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 190,000 slot machines in Nevada and
nearly 450,000 in the United States, according to Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co. The machines now account for about three-quarters of casino
gambling revenue, having largely displaced table games.

</P>
<P>
   Efforts of casinos to attract a broader audience have put
pressure on slot machine makers to produce machines that are more
entertaining, with familiar characters and high-quality sound and
images. ``These products are more and more becoming
amusement-like'' said Kevin Verner, chief operating officer of WMS
Industries, a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of themed slot machines began with the Wheel of Fortune
machine introduced in 1993 by International Game Technology and
Anchor Gaming. WMS has done very well with a machine based on the
game Monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology has transformed slot machines into video
games with images of spinning reels rather than mechanical ones.
This allows a cherry to turn into a smiling face or the reels to
fade out altogether and as a new image is shown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying out when the proper symbols appear on a single
line, the latest video machines reward players when the proper
combination appears on any of nine lines, some of them zigzag.
Players ``win'' on as many as half their spins, though in many
cases the winnings are less than the number of coins bet. The
casino ultimately holds on to the same percentage of the money bet
as with older machines, but people tend to play longer in the
belief that they are winning, Verner said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason slot machine manufacturers strive for hits is that it
gives them more leverage to demand a share of the winnings, rather
than just selling the machine outright. This raises profits for the
machine manufacturers at the expense of the casinos, which tried
unsuccessfully this year to get the Nevada legislature to outlaw
such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   When they share in the winnings, slot machine manufacturers have
an incentive to advertise their machines to the public.
International Game Technology, for instance, has advertised its
Wheel of Fortune game on Nevada television.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming Control Board members say they want a regulation in part
so that companies will not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
developing a game only to see it rejected. And the industry, while
at first reluctant, is warming up to state regulation in part to
stave off any federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But this is uncharted territory for the regulators. ``What we've
always looked at historically are the guts of the device and how it
functions,'' said Dennis Neilander, a member of the three-person
board. ``We've never really been faced with a question of a theme
and whether it's appropriate or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing distinctions between Monopoly and the Three Stooges,
between the Pink Panther and a generic pink elephant may be
difficult. The rules also must not infringe on rights of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest draft of the regulations, decisions would be
based on the rating of the television show, movie or game upon
which a machine is based. The South Park slot machine might be
acceptable because the television show is rated for mature
audiences. The latest draft would also allow themes from shows that
are more than 21 years old, like the Pink Panther and the Addams
Family. However, regulators could still ban any of these machines
if they decided the machine was based on a product that ``currently
and primarily intended, marketed and used'' by people under 21. The
board hopes to complete the regulation in January.

<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi _ In the last three months, Burundi's
government has herded 350,000 people, mostly poor farmers, from
their homes into grubby new villages atop the hills that encircle
this city, the country's capital. The camps are supposed to be
temporary, but a permanence is settling in. On a recent day, two
parishioners pounded nails into eucalyptus poles, attempting to
build a house of worship, the Church of the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brought here by force,'' a choir member, Sampson
Bizimana, 32, complained. ``We are cold. There is disease. We don't
have food.''
</P>
<P>
   The camps, which number nearly 60, are the latest turn in the
ethnic struggle between the elite Tutsi, who rule Burundi, and the
majority Hutu, who do not.
</P>
<P>
   The government calls them a last resort to end a series of
guerrilla attacks on Bujumbura since this summer. By forcing people
into the camps, officials say, they can deprive the Hutu rebels of
their main source of food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   That may be, even if diplomats worry that the camps may
eventually worsen the situation in Burundi, which is afflicted with
a similar ethnic dynamic as its northern neighbor, Rwanda, where at
least half a million people were killed in massacres in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the camps are an unquestionable human disaster. Crowded into
huts made of mud, metal sheeting and palm leaves, several dozen
people have died of cholera and dysentery. There are reports of a
fire in one camp that spread to 50 huts. A drunken soldier
reportedly opened fire on a crowd last month, killing five
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odious because it's a policy that is presented as if it
were for the security of the people,'' said Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya, a Hutu and the president of Burundi from 1994 to
1996. ``In fact, the reality is that the people die in these
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to name any other place in the world where the
forced relocation of a third of a million people would not touch
off major international protest. Yet the opposition has been
relatively muted. Foreign governments say they are horrified but
worry that too much protest might hurt peace negotiations between
the government and the rebels, which won a needed injection of hope
this month when Nelson Mandela was appointed as mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The need to close the camps, one diplomat said on the condition
of anonymity, is one reason for the peace process to continue.
``And that's why Mandela has to keep the momentum going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has also created a major dilemma for aid
organizations, which are on the defensive these days for
unintentionally doing harm in places like Somalia or Congo. In
Burundi, aid officials are engaged in a heated debate about whether
they are actually encouraging the camps by providing food, blankets
and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of limiting a large population to one area and
not allowing them free access to their homes and land is a human
rights violation which we could never support,'' said Michele
Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, which
has supplied most of the food to the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, what you can't do either, as an aid agency,
is stand by and watch these people who are suffering from the
decision of the government waste away.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month the medical group Doctors Without Borders said it was
leaving the camps, because it felt it was helping the government
sustain the camps more than it was helping sick people. Other aid
groups criticized that decision as an abandonment of the camps'
victims and have stayed on, though without an entirely clear
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program has also pulled out of the camps but for
safety's sake: On Oct. 12, two U.N. workers, one with the World
Food Program and the other with UNICEF, were executed in
southeastern Burundi. The government named several rebels as the
killers, although many aid officials suspect the army itself.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the United Nations has put Burundi on its
second-highest security alert, meaning that its staff cannot leave
the capital. Now other aid groups are distributing the U.N. food in
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of widespread violence is common these days in Burundi,
where there have been periodic explosions: In 1972 Tutsi extremists
exterminated virtually a generation of educated Hutu. In 1993 Hutu
slaughtered Tutsi in retaliation for the assassination of the
nation's first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye,
a Hutu. That killing started a civil war in which an estimated
200,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
   Hutu make up nearly 85 percent of the population, though Tutsi
control the army, the government and business. The current
government, headed by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi soldier, has been
engaged in talks with the opposition and rebels for over a year,
with little concrete progress toward elections and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Hutu rebels stepped up their attacks on Bujumbura _
where most Hutu have been killed or driven out _ and in September
hit a rich Tutsi neighborhood. Cows began disappearing, possibly
being killed by rebels for food. The attacks unsettled Buyoya's
supporters, who demanded action.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19, soldiers began ousting Hutu from their homes in the
area around Bujumbura and put them into camps on the top of hills,
so the army could more easily patrol the roads and valleys for
rebels who might attack the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was much, much fear in the capital and in those
neighborhoods that are particularly targeted,'' said Albert
Nitunga, a driver who is Tutsi and who lives in a mixed
neighborhood that the rebels have attacked several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the regroupment camps have been created, we sleep
soundly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Longin Minani, a spokesman for the army, noted that the
government created camps in rural areas in 1996 and 1997, cutting
down rebel attacks. Like the earlier camps _ which were in place a
year and a half _ these camps will be broken up, he said, when the
area becomes safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security-wise, I think it has proved to be efficient,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting criticism from the United States and others, Minani
recalled the camps set up by the United States to intern
Japanese-Americans in World War II and Vietnamese civilians during
the Vietnam war. Others have noted a similar policy, though with
much more planning and better services, in Rwanda, an ally of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want us to do what you did,'' Minani said. He added,
``The people are happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not appear to be case among Hutu interviewed last week
in three camps outside Bujumbura. The camps themselves, unfenced
but heavily guarded by armed soldiers, had been slapped together
hastily from whatever materials were available.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are allowed to leave the camps a few times a week to
farm their land, but even then government soldiers stand over them
in the fields, purportedly to protect against rebel attacks.
Nonetheless, people complained about shortages of food, water and
medicine, and said that both the rebels and the army were stealing
their crops and pieces of the homes they left behind.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to be pleased about,'' said Michel
Baranyibikiye, a 57-year-old farmer who had just received a blanket
from Catholic Relief Services, which has provided aid to some
200,000 people. ``The soldiers and rebels rob whatever they can
find.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rainy season and, in another camp, Ruziba, on Lake
Tanganyika, a 53-year-old woman named Regine Raranyedetse took a
visitor inside the tiny hut where she, her husband and seven
children live. In all, 18,000 people live at the camp. Thirty have
died of cholera. Mrs. Raranyedetse's hut is made of sticks
interwoven with straw and dried banana leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we get wet,'' she said. ``The rain comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics of the policy say that any reduction in violence is
temporary. The U.S. statement expressed concern that the camps
would become ``breeding grounds not only for disease and death but
also for forces of resistance and opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis-Marie Nindorera, executive secretary of the Burundian
human rights group Iteka, echoed the comments of many critics when
he said he believed that the army controlled only the roads and the
camps, not the rest of the countryside where the people once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have a very big area which is quite empty,'' he said.
``Now the rebels are living and moving into this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that if there are attacks on Bujumbura, and
Tutsi militias, among the most extreme forces in Burundi, look for
revenge, they will find a huge number of Hutu grouped close
together in camps. One massacre may lead to another, some fear,
setting off another spiral of mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   Some people see signs of hope: Two political movements have
formed recently that mix Hutu and Tutsi, even if the alliances
agree mostly on their support or dislike for Buyoya. Some people
say Burundians are growing so weary of war that reprisal killings
were kept to a minimum after the rebel attacks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel that Mandela, the retired South African president, is
the person best able to bring about a peace accord, if Burundi is
really ready for peace. Many people here say they are not so sure
it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe God will heal,'' said one Burundian aid worker who said
he was afraid to give his name, ``but not Mandela.''

<P>
   PARIS _ The ousted president of Ivory Coast left the country in
a French aircraft Sunday, landed in nearby Togo and may seek asylum
in France, the government here said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days of rioting seemed to be coming to an end Sunday as
the army established control over the West African country, which
until last week was considered one of the most stable, prosperous
and democratic on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Abidjan, the main city, who were unable to finish
their Christmas shopping when looting and car hijackings began on
Thursday, as soldiers held a protest, were back in stores, guarded
by soldiers. There were military checkpoints on the thoroughfares,
but buses, the main means of transportation for the city's 3
million people, began running again at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a nightly curfew and patrols by soldiers and police
officers empowered to shoot anyone on the street after 6 p.m. will
continue for the moment, security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being run by a nine-man military junta calling
itself the National Public Salvation Committee, and the commanders
of police, marines, paratroops, and armored and infantry units took
oaths to it on television Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the real power seems to be Gen. Robert Guei, 58, a former
armed forces chief. He said Sunday that he would create a
government that would include civilians, but did not say when.
Saturday, he invited political parties to discuss a unified
government.
</P>
<P>
   France and the United States condemned the overthrow of
President Henri Konan Bedie, 65, as did Nigeria and South Africa,
the two most powerful countries in sub-Saharan Africa. A panel of
foreign ministers from the Economic Community of West African
States said it would meet soon to discuss the crisis. Ivory Coast
is a member of the group, which has intervened militarily in civil
wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first coup in Ivory Coast, which is the world's
largest producer of cocoa, exports palm oil, bananas and other
tropical products. The country had a history of stable government.
It was ruled by Felix Houphouet-Boigny from its independence in
1960 until his death in 1993. Bedie, of Houphouet-Boigny's
Democratic Party, succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   Guei said Sunday that mutineers had overthrown the government
because it was taking political prisoners and showing ethnic
intolerance uncharacteristic of Ivorian traditions. But several
forces seemed to be at work.
</P>
<P>
   Guei, a French-trained career officer with a relatively low
profile, was himself dismissed as armed forces chief by Bedie in
1995 after rumors of a potential coup were circulated. The general
has said he was not involved in plotting a coup and was working on
his farm when the mutineers asked him to be their spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The young soldiers who participated with hooligans in the
looting that began on Thursday complained about their low pay and
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The government has recently been showing virulent nationalism
and a xenophobic attitude toward migrant workers; a third of the 19
million population is from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the governing Democratic Party, dominated by
members of Bedie's Baoule tribe, had tried to prevent Alassane
Ouattara, an International Monetary Fund official who was
Houphouet-Boigny's prime minister, from becoming a candidate in
next October's presidential elections. Bedie contends that Ouattara
is really a citizen of Burkina Faso and is thus ineligible to run.
</P>
<P>
   The government also jailed leaders of his Rally for the
Republicans party, who were freed by the mutineers.
</P>
<P>
   The coup junta has some apparent links to Ouattara's party. Gen.
Lassana Palenfo, another prominent member of the junta, was once
Ouattara's security minister. The soldiers made their initial
statements from Radio Nostalgie, whose owner is reported to be
close to Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   The junta expressed satisfaction with the departure of Bedie
under what the French Foreign Ministry described as ``safe and
dignified circumstances.'' Bedie had spent two days hiding inside a
French military base near the Abidjan airport under the protection
of 550 French marines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Guei had suggested that Bedie leave the country quickly because
his life was in danger from mutinous young officers. Bedie had
sought to take his prime minister, Daniel Kablan Duncan, and
defense minister, Vincent Bandama N'Gatta, but the new government
compelled the French, who have them in custody, to keep them in
Ivory Coast, Reuters news service reported. Some other cabinet
ministers were being held by the junta, which said it was for their
own protection. At least two appeared on television endorsing the
coup, one of them surrounded by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie's wife and children were among the entourage of about 12
people who were allowed to leave with him. He was greeted at the
airport in Lome, Togo's capital, by the Togolese president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Agence France-Presse whether Bedie could end up in
France, a foreign ministry spokeswoman replied that she did not
know whether he wanted to come here but, ``if he wishes to, he has
the option of doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, France reinforced its garrison with 40 troops from
Gabon and positioned 300 more in Senegal to aid in any possible
evacuation of the 20,000 or more French citizens in Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But Guei refused permission for any more French troops to enter
and personally guaranteed the safety of French citizens and
property. He said an increase in troop strength could lead to a
bloodbath but also seemed to fear that France might try to restore
Bedie to power.

COMING WEEKS PRESENT BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR BRADLEY CAMPAIGN

campaigns of the top contenders for the Democratic and Republican
presidential nominations as they enter the primary season. The next
article will spotlight Vice President Al Gore's campaign. (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his professorial style, former Sen. Bill Bradley
reminds some people of Adlai Stevenson. Others hear the liberal
idealism of Robert Kennedy in his speeches, or find his distaste
for hardball politics reminiscent of Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate that Bradley invokes most often in his
insurgent campaign for president is not a liberal or even a
Democrat. It is former President Reagan, in whose political
playbook he and his advisers have found much to admire, and perhaps
emulate, as they battle Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, Bradley has sought to project a sunny optimism,
calling for a ``world of new possibilities'' that echoes Reagan's
``morning in America.'' Like Reagan, he has focused on a few
issues, hoping that expanding health care and reducing poverty will
grab voters' imagination the way shrinking government and fighting
communism did for Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   And like Reagan, a former actor, Bradley, a former basketball
star, is running as a celebrity outsider, trying to build an
anti-Washington rebellion against a White House scarred by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired the focus that he had when he ran,'' Bradley said of
Reagan in an interview. ``He told people what he wanted to do. And
when people voted for him in sizable majorities, it gave him a
mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a game plan that has helped Bradley mount a surprisingly
potent challenge to Gore. Just 15 months ago, he was not a
candidate and Gore was a shoo-in for the party's nomination. Today,
he has matched Gore in fund raising, pulled even with him in polls
in New Hampshire, built a national organization and given himself a
shot, though still a long one, at upsetting the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But the coming weeks will provide a critical test of Bradley's
staying power. First up are the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 and the
New Hampshire primary a week later. Then come five weeks of
coast-to-coast campaigning for what Bradley calls the national
primary of March 7: New York, California, Ohio and several other
major states. If either candidate stumbles badly, the race could be
over by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   And with that daunting schedule, many analysts have begun
questioning whether Bradley's campaign is up to the task. Did he
fail to take advantage of a wave of positive news coverage in the
early fall? Is he winning attention mainly because of his
basketball celebrity? Is he in a seemingly strong position now
simply because he is the only challenger to an opponent who seems
to be constantly trying to reinvent himself so that he can somehow
connect with voters?
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have also begun sensing vulnerabilities in his
Reaganesque strategy. They say that Bradley seems to be trying too
hard to stay above the fray. And some assert that in focusing on
just a few issues _ health care, poverty, campaign finance and race
relations _ he has failed to address problems people care about as
much or more, like education and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, a large number of analysts argue, Bradley
has yet to demonstrate that he has built the kind of national
movement needed to upset a vice president who dominates the party's
organization and has spent seven years recruiting endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must throw Gore into disarray to have a shot in
California,'' said Fred Siegel, a history professor at the Cooper
Union for Arts and Sciences in New York. ``He needs to win
decisively in New Hampshire and New York, and I don't know if all
those things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel and other experts point to Reagan's first presidential
campaign _ his failed primary challenge of President Ford in 1976 _
as evidence of just how difficult Bradley's task is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan ran an extraordinary campaign in 1976, but it still
wasn't enough to overcome Mr. Ford's institutional advantage,''
said Siegel. ``Sure, Gore has made plenty of miscues. But I'm not
sure it's enough to knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, Reagan had an important advantage that Bradley does
not: He was viewed as the leader of the Republican's conservative
wing, a group disaffected with Ford. Bradley cannot claim any such
base and, in fact, is widely viewed within the party as centrist,
on the same ideological plane as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has tried to outflank the vice president among the
party's liberal base, which includes blacks, women, labor unions
and environmentalists. In every stump speech, he talks about
improving race relations, protecting the environment and reducing
poverty. And he has proposed increasing the minimum wage
automatically when inflation rises.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bradley has made inroads on the left, the Gore
campaign still holds more cards. The AFL-CIO has endorsed the vice
president and polls show that black voters and women remain very
supportive of the administration and, by extension, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With those obstacles in mind, Bradley has also mapped out a
strategy to ``expand the electorate'' by energizing first-time
voters and people who have become apathetic or disgusted with
politics. His pledges to reduce the influence of money in politics
and to speak from his heart are aimed directly at disaffected
independents and Democrats angry with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem an impossible task to build a national movement in
just a few months. But Bradley has actually been laying the
groundwork for a national campaign for more than a decade. And by
the time he announced in late 1998, he had a group of devoted
longtime advisers and a network of fund-raisers in place _ much
like Reagan in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By October this year, he had raised nearly $20 million, and his
frugal spending had left him more cash on hand than Gore. Bradley
also won much national attention by unveiling a plan to subsidize
health insurance for 95 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns these days, Bradley often tells audiences that
he decided to release a detailed health plan partly because he
thought the strategy had worked for Reagan in 1980. By being
specific, Bradley argues, Reagan could claim a mandate for his
budget-and-tax-cutting policies when he won, helping to soften
opposition in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the specificity that Bradley considers a strength is a
tempting target for Gore. For two months now, the Gore camp has
picked apart the Bradley health plan. Since then, Gore and his
supporters have broadened their criticisms to include Bradley's
record on education, campaign finance and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say they think their combative approach has tied
the Bradley campaign in knots. ``It's a conundrum for them,'' said
one aide. ``If they engage us, it's a mistake, because his strength
is being a philosopher-king. If you stay out there and don't do
anything, you get defined negatively.'' Either way, the aide said,
the Gore campaign has managed to muddle Bradley's message and knock
him off stride.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bradley has become somewhat more forceful in
his responses. During a testy debate with Gore on ``Meet the
Press,'' Bradley repeatedly shouted ``That's not true!'' when Gore
criticized his health plan. And when Gore offered a handshake deal
to eschew television commercials, Bradley sarcastically rejected
it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said that Bradley should have delivered a
more forceful blow directly at what they consider Gore's Achilles'
heel: the much-criticized fund-raising practices of the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hit at some of those problems when he staged an event
recently with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Republican
presidential candidate, where both pledged to forsake so-called
soft money if they are nominated. Then McCain took some potshots at
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that Bradley himself may need to take those
shots. ``Sooner or later he's going to have to engage Gore in
hand-to-hand combat,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of New York
University's urban research center.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley says his greatest challenge will be to
amplify his message above the noise of Gore's attacks. So far, he
has had some success with that in Iowa and New Hampshire, where
small-group campaigning dominates and his folksy style seems most
effective. The fight for March 7, however, will be played out
mostly on television, which has not always been kind to Bradley,
who can come across on camera as sleepy-eyed or stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has worked hard, with some success, at appearing
comfortable on television. And his campaign is preparing
commercials that will try to evoke his plain-spoken, earnest style,
probably by relying on shots of him speaking into the camera or to
groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional answer is you hire political consulting firms
and they turn you into a cookie-cutter production,'' Bradley said.
``And what I decided was, no, I wanted to convey who I am and what
I believe and where I want to take the country to the widest
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``we are going to test whether I am able to
do that.''

MARINO DAUNTING TO JETS, ONE MORE TIME
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ Jason Ferguson almost whispered it, lest Dan Marino
hear. ``I got a sack against him,'' Ferguson, the Jets' nose
tackle, said. ``But I don't want that to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is 38, this could be the final home game of his Hall of
Fame career, and there are historic overtones in the Jets' Monday
night meeting with Marino's Dolphins. For it is also the final
Monday night game of the century, a fitting denouement since the
Jets were in the debut game in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jets have only a .500 record to shoot for as they bring
in a 6-8 mark against the Dolphins (9-5), a team in the middle of
the playoff race. But the Jets play their division rival and the
man who has thrown 69 touchdown passes against them, more than any
other quarterback in history has thrown against another team. John
Elway threw 44 in his career against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder these Jets still speak of Marino as if contemplating a
legend. Indeed, some of them seem miffed that this hoary warrior,
whose career began in 1983, has lost respect in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   But not with the Jets, who have a three-game winning streak
against him. Not even considering that the Jets have sent him to
three of his poorer efforts in those games _ including his worst
sack performance against them when he was dumped five times last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many of these same players who were not even there
remember the famous faked spike against the Jets in 1994. Perhaps
they know of his 521-yard game against them as well, or his 60
passes in one contest, or his six-touchdown game.
</P>
<P>
   His 17-12 record against the Jets helps put him one game away
from tying Elway for the most winning performances ever. This could
be the first of Marino's two final shots at breaking it. Elway has
148 career victories and Marino has 147. Fran Tarkenton is third
with 125.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his season shortened by five games because of a pinched
nerve in his neck, Marino will try to undo the second-game jinx
that has bothered all the other top quarterbacks from the American
Football Conference East when they faced the Jets this season. They
played badly. The Jets halted Doug Flutie and Drew Bledsoe, and
narrowly lost to the Colts and Peyton Manning, holding him to his
least productive game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year is different,'' Jets Coach Bill Parcells said in
reflecting on Marino's season.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is far down in the passer rating, thanks to 13
interceptions and only nine touchdowns. Two weeks ago, the Jets
picked him off twice, kept him from throwing a touchdown and made
him miss more than half his passing attempts. His gifted receiver
O.J. McDuffie has been battling a hamstring injury. His running
backs have been battered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Dan was playing with Duper and Clayton,''
Parcells said of the dangerous receivers known as the Marks
Brothers. ``The whole deal is different now. Dan always had a
third-down receiving back when Don Shula was there. Also, the
offense is different now with a different coordinator. They have
kept some of the play-action he's been doing for years and years.
But on third downs, they used to have four receivers, two on each
side. Now they go to three. He could blister you. Now there's
blitzing zones, and they have to protect him more.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this lessened danger in the clutch, Parcells said: ``I
still feel threatened by the guy. I like him. I think winning means
something to him. I would have loved to have coached him. I think
we would have butted heads once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Glenn and Marino butted heads figuratively. The faked
spike that symbolized Marino's superiority and the Jets'
inferiority came in 1994 when Glenn was a rookie. He bit when
Marino pretended to spike the ball, thinking the quarterback would
down the ball to stop the clock. Instead, Marino tossed a touchdown
that kept the Jets from tying the Dolphins for first place in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best memory?'' Glenn said. ``My interception.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened two years after the spike. He stepped in front of
a Marino fourth-down pass at the goal line and returned it 100
yards for a club-record return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to Glenn, Marino remains dangerous, especially on third
down. ``You know what he's going to do,'' Glenn said, ``but he does
it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Mickens was transfixed when he saw what Marino did to Glenn,
who is Mickens' former Texas A&AMP;M teammate. Mickens was still in
college at the time, and saw the game on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time that ever happened,'' Mickens, a
defensive back, said. ``I said to myself, `I guess I better watch
for it.' Now, every time there's a clock play, I think he might be
faking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickens also has to look at the ball differently when Marino is
winging it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some quarterbacks, like Mark Brunell and Drew Bledsoe, throw
an accurate ball with air under it,'' Mickens said. ``It sails into
the receiver's hands. But Marino, it's a frozen rope. If you don't
get your head around, the pass is complete. I'm not used to being
15, 20 yards downfield and seeing a ball come in at eye level. The
first time I faced him, I had to adjust to that. He's got the
quickest release I ever saw. You're wasting your time even trying
to blitz him.''
</P>
<P>
   The arm is still there, and the quick release, say Jets
defenders. And so is the personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always grumping at the officials,'' Mickens said. ``I
guess when you've done as much as he has, you figure you might get
a break by always complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Parcells think about this possibly being Marino's
final home game?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had the hearses out for this guy before,'' the coach
said. ``But he's sent a lot of defensive backs to the bus
station.'' &QL;

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The Rockets saw the familiar, smiling faces
lining the court. There were banners and cheers for the visiting
team, loads of spirit of the season and good, warm feelings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets, polite guests of honor, were not about to put their
feet on the furniture. They were not the sorts to hog the eggnog or
double-dip the chips. They were perfect gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did not quite gift-wrap a 103-92 win for the Wizards
on Sunday at the MCI Center. But they did little to interfere with
the hosts' party plans, allowing the Wizards' offense, usually
among the NBA's worst, to run easily and score inside consistently.
The Rockets accepted only a courteous share of free throws, making
barely half of their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very loose, Merry Christmas environment,'' Rockets
forward Carlos Rogers said. ``I know we didn't come out like `Let's
play basketball.' We came out like Christmas was yesterday. And we
just went through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   With guard Steve Francis, forward Walt Williams and injured
forward Tony Massenburg back in their hometown, and a holiday
hangover throughout the quiet arena, the Rockets never could
maintain the intensity or execution of their 16-point win over the
Wizards on Thursday at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments. Francis had the most breathtaking one with a
spectacular leap over the reach of Wizards center Jahidi White to a
powerful dunk the crowd celebrated nearly as much as Reebok
marketers will when they put together Francis' inevitable shoe
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 21 points, seven assists and a season-best six
steals. But he never could control the game as he did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Steve Francis welcome-home party,'' said Wizards
guard Laron Profit, Francis' Maryland teammate. ``We got what we
wanted. He got to play in front of his family and friends, which is
what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had played just one minute in the previous two
games, had a season-high 20 points in 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the game rarely generated any sense of urgency to maintain
momentum from Francis' playmaking or Williams' shooting. And when
the Rockets did make a run, the Wizards had little trouble beating
them down the floor to fast-break points, or driving the lane to
layups.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards scored 54 points in the paint, the most any team has
scored inside against the Rockets since the Kings had 56 on Nov.
21. The Wizards scored 25 fast-break points, the most by a Rockets
opponent since the Kings' 27.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wizards are not normally the high-scoring, high-speed
Kings. The Kings lead the NBA with an average of 102.3 points per
game. The Wizards' average of 92.3 points ranks 25th in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were horrible on the fast break,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``That's just horrible when you give up that many
fast-break points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were just as charitable on the other end. They made
just 35 of 89 shots (39.3 percent), their worst shooting
performance since the Dec. 8 loss in Philadelphia when Charles
Barkley's career ended with a ruptured quadriceps tendon.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Matt Bullard's 1-for-7, the bulk of
Sunday's misses were on drives through the lane. There were more
missed opportunities on passes mishandled in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Steve created a lot of situations,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``We just didn't catch the ball. We had a lot of those. And
then if we did, we didn't finish the layup.''
</P>
<P>
   To those problems, the Rockets added a 16-of-28 (57.1 percent)
shooting performance from the foul line, including nine missed free
throws in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't shoot the ball well at all from the field or the
free-throw line,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's frustrating when you
get a team to foul you and you don't cash in. It changes the whole
tension for the other team if we kept it closer. They were
free-stroking at the end with a nice cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards did shoot well, particularly guard Mitch Richmond,
who had 27 points to go with seven assists and six rebounds, but
the Rockets blamed their own generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we lost the game ourselves with missed layups and
free throws and the little intangible stuff,'' Francis said. ``We
came out flat. Probably the holiday season, everybody was just
happy they went home for Christmas, I guess. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The noon start also might have contributed to an atmosphere more
suited for a Sunday pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to make excuses,'' Rogers said. ``But this early
start _ I was trying to do everything today to get ready. I even
drank a cup of coffee. I never, ever drink coffee. I was just
trying to get going. I'm not used to such an early game.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the slow start and the quiet atmosphere, the Rockets
had a lead and an opportunity to build momentum with Francis' dunk.
He had given the Rockets a 41-39 lead 4:20 before halftime and left
the crowd buzzing and calling for a scoreboard replay that never
game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets did little to build on that play. They missed
their next five shots and three of four free throws and committed
four turnovers in four minutes, as the Wizards finished the half
with a 10-1 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets began the second half just as poorly, missing their
first four shots while the Wizards pushed the lead to 16. After
scoring two points in the first half, White had 13 points in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the jam over me,'' White said of Francis' dunk. ``He
really jumped high. He got me. I just had to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us to come out after the half ready to
play. We needed to start the third quarter with some power and
intensity. I knew if we did that, we'd win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did that, they would be the only team with power and
intensity. But at least no one could accuse the Rockets of being
impolite party guests.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Two months after taking office, Indonesia's
new president, Abdurrahman Wahid, seems to be having a
disconcertingly good time.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed, joking, spinning off ideas as if he were a quirky
commentator rather than the president, proposing solutions and then
changing his mind, he has brought a new, light touch to the often
grim job of leading the world's fourth-most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of harsh control under President Suharto,
Wahid's wide-open, come-one-come-all style has begun to make his
countrymen nervous. Is he really in charge? Does he grasp the
urgency of his nation's crisis? Does he have a plan?
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia ends a tumultuous year of tension, violence and
democratic transition and launches into a heady but chaotic period
of self-redefinition, Wahid seems to be playing a risky game of
free-rein leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say he is offering his fragmented and fractious
nation more freedom than it can handle _ something his defense
minister, Juwono Sudarsono, calls ``overdemocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very confusing,'' said Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's
most prominent novelist, who is a friend of the president. ``He
doesn't seem to have a sense of priorities. There is unrest
throughout the country, yet he travels abroad. It's very odd. When
I try to follow what he is doing, I can't keep it straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Wahid, who was elected Oct. 20, say he is a true
democrat, committed to _ and reveling in _ the messy clamor of
public debate. They say his open, inclusive, experimental approach
to leadership, guided by his keen political instincts, could just
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not only a liberal democrat but a man of intrinsic
tolerance,'' said a foreign official who visited him recently. ``My
worry is that even with the best intentions, he could be presiding
over a highly unstable government in which his own ideas are
difficult to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble right now is that many of Indonesia's more than 200
million people seem confused over just what those ideas are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is part of his strategy, to be unpredictable,''
said Sri Purwati, a local journalist. ``But it is hard to put
yourself in the hands of someone without knowing what is going to
happen next. People know that he likes to joke around, and
sometimes we are not sure if he is joking.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his more surprising actions, Wahid spent 17 of his
first 50 days in office abroad on a series of off-the-cuff trips at
a time when some people fear that his nation is in danger of
breaking apart.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he has taken few decisive steps apart from shutting
down two marginal ministries and opening another ministry, on
maritime affairs. One of his first acts was to raise the
possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel _
something of a personal hobbyhorse, but tricky for the world's most
populous Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, his critics say, does much to address Indonesia's
crises of separatist insurgencies, military restiveness, economic
collapse and a desperate need for wide-ranging political reforms
and government restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unpredictable, always very quick off the mark, not
terribly structured, not much of a manager, always full of ideas,''
said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, who was a close aide to the previous
president, B.J. Habibie. ``There still seems to be a lot of trial
and error in the things he does.''
</P>
<P>
   These are things that some people have always known about Wahid,
who for decades headed Indonesia's largest Muslim organization and
has been known as a brilliant eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Wahid as president, Ms. Anwar said, ``my concern is
that he tends to take things too lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern was echoed in an interview by Juwono, who, as the
first civilian defense minister in 40 years, faces the crucial task
of beginning to de-politicize the military.
</P>
<P>
   When he talks to the president, Juwono said, ``I feel a strong
sense of responsibility to try and instill a sense of crisis and
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems, he said, are compounded by Wahid's near-blindness,
which limits his sources of information. At Cabinet meetings, for
instance, he is unable to take notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all his intelligence, I don't think he can really absorb
the extent and importance of the points of, say, seven ministers
reporting,'' Juwono said. ``The most he can remember is probably
three or four points. So I try to limit my presentations to three
minutes or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders reply that Wahid's light touch is his
special genius. His country's problems defy quick or forceful
solutions, they say, and his tactic is to restore a sense of
humanity and calm to public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   His strength is as a conciliator and consensus builder; he is a
hard man not to like. He is committed to the country's clumsier new
structure of checks and balances, with its newly empowered
Parliament and aggressive public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has his own way,'' said Nurcholis Madjid, a Muslim scholar
who is an unofficial adviser to the president. ``People accuse him
of nonaction, but it seems to me he is relying on the psychology
that time will soften things.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, some experts say, the new president's more relaxed
style is the right one for the moment, allowing the newly emerging
social and political forces to begin to reshape the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur is not only decent but a liberal with a genuine
commitment to free speech, to disagreement,'' said Donald K.
Emmerson, an expert on Indonesia at Stanford University, using the
president's nickname. ``He's a teacher at heart. He's full of
ideas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So, with its president as a sort of creative scholar in chief,
Indonesia has plunged into a ferment of change. The roster of
urgent problems seems overwhelming: a new role for the politicized
and often brutal military; a better balance between the central
government and its restive provinces and between the executive and
the legislature; a rebuilt economy free from the distortions of
corruption and monopolies; effective political parties; a fair and
professional judiciary; an efficient and honest bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Work has already begun in some areas, most dangerously in
beginning to hold the military to account for past and current
abuses of human rights. In particular, Indonesian investigators
have begun summoning generals to answer for the bloodshed and
destruction that followed East Timor's vote for independence at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other separatist movements in Aceh province
and elsewhere are putting military and civilian leaders _ Wahid in
particular _ to their toughest test.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia took on much of its momentum for change during the
17-month presidency of Habibie, who began dismantling the legacy of
his predecessor and mentor, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The reform movement that has set the national agenda comes from
pent-up social forces that burst free when Suharto was forced to
step down in May 1998, after 32 years in power. Wahid, who has
spoken of wanting to unleash his nation's creative forces, may see
his role as conductor of a grand national orchestra of reform.
</P>
<P>
   But as Juwono suggested, there may be a risk here of too much
unstructured freedom, too quickly, in a country where limits have
for decades been set only by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of enforcement dissipated after the fall of
Suharto,'' Juwono said. ``For the first time in modern history the
gravitas of an order of the president is being challenged by these
new elements of openness, transparency, accountability and
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   With a government still in disarray and without a firm leader,
there is a danger of the kind of mob rule that helped bring down
Suharto and has kept Indonesia on edge since.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editors who once bowed to the grip of the censor now
say they fear the angry mobs that sometimes invade their newsrooms.
Local government offices have often been taken over by
demonstrators demanding the removal of officials they see as
corrupt or incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, a mob of several hundred men with sticks took
over the Jakarta city hall demanding that all nightclubs be closed
during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   The government had already ruled that they could stay open.
Closing them would run counter to the tolerant approach that is at
the heart of the new president's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   If this example is a sign of things to come as the liberal
president confronts the angry mob, it is not an encouraging one:
The nightclubs were ordered closed.

   WASHINGTON _ As a child, George Stevens Jr. loved to hang around
the movie sets where his father, the celebrated director, was
working.
</P>
<P>
   George Sr., director of such classics as ``Woman of the Year,''
``A Place in the Sun'' and ``Shane,'' was often asked if young
George would follow him into the business.
</P>
<P>
   George Sr. would laugh and say, ``Oh, I think he may go
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course he did not. George Jr. worked with his father on
``The Diary of Anne Frank'' and ``Giant'' and, by the time he was
28, had directed episodes of the television series ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents'' and ``Peter Gunn.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gone on to a career producing and directing hundreds of
films for the federal government, numerous documentaries and dozens
of television specials, including the annual ``Kennedy Center
Honors.'' He was executive producer of the 1998 film ``The Thin Red
Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, George Stevens is co-producing his biggest outdoor
extravaganza, the New Year's Eve celebration of ``America's
Millennium,'' on the Mall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is 67 but looks a decade younger. He wears a perpetual
smile and has a glimmer in his eye as if a key light were following
him, as he conducts a tour of the giant stage he has built on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   It is from here that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton will welcome the new century, but they are bit players in
the $10 million production that Stevens and Quincy Jones are
concocting.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to speak a few minutes before
midnight on New Year's Eve, after a 19-minute Steven Spielberg
paean to America called ``The Unfinished Journey'' accompanied by
an original score by John Williams. In keeping with the patriotic
theme, the host will be Will Smith, the actor who saved America
from aliens bent on annihilation in ``Independence Day,'' backed up
by 30 dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle, the opera divas, will be
there to raise the brow of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who commutes between Washington and Los Angeles and who
has long been active in Democratic politics, said that he was
recruited by Mrs. Clinton three years ago to help design the
celebration. He said the Clintons had also sounded out Jones and
Spielberg about what might be an ``appropriate manifestation'' of
the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is busy on several other film projects, said he had
decided to take on the millennium celebration ``because it is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity _ you might even say an honor _ to be
able to conceive this with Quincy,'' Stevens said. The result was a
gigantic undertaking encompassing hundreds of workers, tons of
sound, lighting and video equipment trucked in from California and
New York, and complex security considerations involving the local
police, the Park Police and the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has mixed government service with filmmaking for much of
his career. He served in the Kennedy administration as director of
movie and television services for the U.S. Information Agency,
working under Edward R. Murrow. Among his projects were
documentaries on the Little Rock school desegregation battle and
the death of President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson named Stevens founding director of the
American Film Institute, which is dedicated to preserving archival
films and supporting aspiring filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and his wife, Liz, are active in the Washington social
scene, frequently entertaining the city's media and political elite
at their Georgetown home. They are die-hard Democrats, but
latecomers to the Clinton bandwagon, preferring the more
old-fashioned Democratic politics of Robert F. Kennedy and his
ideological heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton saw valuable allies in the Stevenses and
cultivated them for their ties to the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   That, in part, accounts for Stevens' selection as co-producer of
the millennium show, which is being staged in close consultation
with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities expect a crowd of 100,000 to gather on Friday
evening at the base of the Lincoln Memorial, with tens of thousands
more on the grounds of the Washington Monument and along the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   While the producers have devoted thousands of hours to planning
the entertainment and the speeches, the event may be remembered
most for the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   A half-minute before midnight, a burning fuse will travel the
length of the reflecting pool, ending at the base of the Washington
Monument. As the final seconds of the century tick away, the
monument will be transformed into a giant Roman candle, sheathed in
cascading pyrotechnic light. At the stroke of midnight, the sky
behind the obelisk will turn golden with fireworks, symbolizing,
Stevens said, ``something about aspiration and the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the whole program, Stevens said, is to celebrate the
American experiment in popular government _ and to have a little
fun along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the persiflage and hype and expense,'' he said,
``our hope is to somehow capture a little of the wonder of
democracy on the swamp that George Washington chose as our capital
and designed into a city, between the monuments to Lincoln and
Washington with the Capitol in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this cynical age,'' he concluded, ``it makes your heart
beat a little faster.''

RUSSIAN TROOPS MEETING STIFF RESISTANCE FROM CHECHEN REBELS IN
GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After two days of fighting in the streets of Grozny,
the Russian military conceded on Sunday night that its troops were
meeting strong opposition as they struggled to seize control of the
Chechen capital from Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advance of the Russian troops is very difficult,'' the
Russian Defense Ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency.
``Practically at all crucial points the the rebels have established
strong positions.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior rebel leader, Isa Numunayev, told the Interfax news
agency that the fighting over the weekend was comparable in
intensity to the fiercest battles of the 1994-96 Chechen war.
Russia's NTV television network reported that the militants had
constructed a network of fortified trenches near the southwestern
part of the city, which has slowed the Russian advance.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain fell on Sunday in Chechnya, which, coupled with
fog, made it difficult for Russian planes to carry out the air
strikes that have been used to bombard Grozny for weeks. Russian
commanders pointedly refused to say when they expected to seize the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Grozny has become a critical test for Russia's
generals, who have promised a decisive victory over the rebels.
Even as they concede difficulties, military officials are anxious
to maintain popular support and have presented a picture of a
successful and disciplined campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Ministry troops and Chechen paramilitary forces
loyal to Moscow began the operation to seize Grozny on Saturday
after a heavy Russian bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have vowed not to repeat the mistakes of the
1994-1996 war in Chechnya, when Russian troops raced to the center
of Grozny and were cut off and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Russian forces hope to advance methodically through the
city, calling in devastating artillery and air strikes when they
encounter resistance.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of fighting in Grozny's streets, it was
impossible to confirm what territory the Russian forces actually
controlled or how many soldiers the Russian military had lost.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic rebels claimed to have killed hundreds of Russian
troops, but Russian authorities have only acknowledged the death of
two of their soldiers in the bitter fighting in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Little is also known about the fate of the tens of thousands of
residents who have found themselves trapped in the battle zone. As
many as 50,000 civilians are still believed to be hiding in
basement shelters in Grozny, according to Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military had hoped to evacuate Grozny's residents
before the battle but went ahead with its attack anyway after
efforts to remove the civilians failed. Talks were under way on
Sunday night between Sergei Shoigu, the minister for emergency
situations, and other officials on possible ways to evacuate the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the current storming of Grozny, there'll be nobody to
evacuate in a few days time,'' Numunayev, the rebel leader, told
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials again deplored Russia's heavy bombardment of
Grozny. But the complaints have become almost an empty ritual since
the Kremlin has made it clear that it is not listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia runs the risk of isolating itself from the
international community by continuing to utilize indiscriminate
force,'' a Clinton administration official said. ``We continue to
urge restraint and the commencement of dialogue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of the Russian forces
in the North Caucasus, provided an answer of sorts for that
criticism. He said the Russian flag would be flying over Grozny
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not hurry, but you'll soon see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for Grozny has been brewing for months. Russian troops
moved from the north, west and east to blockade the city. The
strategy was to bottle up the Islamic militants in the city and
force their surrender.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Russian military said it hoped the rebels in
Grozny could be talked into submitting. Russian commanders invoked
the example of Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, where
local elders agreed to the occupation of the city by Russian troops
after the militants left.
</P>
<P>
   But Grozny has always been different. Along with the mountainous
regions in the south, it has been a center of rebel resistance. And
by encircling the city, the Russians also closed the rebels' main
escape routes, setting the stage for a climatic and potentially
very bloody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not clear how many militants are still in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says there are 1,500 Islamic fighters in
Grozny. But the whereabouts of the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev
and Kattab, a rebel born in the Middle East, are unknown. That
raises the prospect that Russia will take the city only to find
that its main adversaries have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russian military has not publicly set a deadline for
taking the city, it seems determined to seize Grozny by early in
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to highlight their progress, Russian officials asserted
today that Russian troops had driven through Minutka Square, near
the heart of the city. They did not claim, however, that the
Russian military currently controlled the square.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen paramilitary forces allied with Moscow said that they
had captured Dom Pechati, a building in the city center that was
once the headquarters for local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The forces are under the command of Bislan Gantamirov, the
former mayor of Grozny who had been imprisoned for embezzlement,
but was released by the Russian authorities so he could serve as an
ally in the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conducting a cleanup of the city, checking all homes
and basements where rebels could hide,'' Gantamirov said.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov's forces, however, are widely viewed as a bit of
political window dressing for the Russian military, and his claims
of battlefield success could not be verified.

CATHOLIC THEOLOGIANS UNSETTLED BY BISHOPS' OVERSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a recent afternoon, in her class on how people
have portrayed Jesus throughout history, Theresa Sanders read aloud
a passage by a medieval nun, who had imagined Jesus in an
unconventional way, as a mothering figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians have always used the images at hand to talk about
the significance of Jesus,'' said Ms. Sanders, a professor at
Georgetown University, provoking a question from Michael Ballard, a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a limit on where you can go with that symbolism?''
Ballard asked, prompting Ms. Sanders to guide the class into a
discussion of how far Christians ought to go in seeking common
ground with people of other faiths in understanding God.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanders said afterward: ``When I present Catholic teaching,
like any responsible professor, I try to do it accurately. I
present it in as complex and nuanced and faithful a way as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic institution, Georgetown has become more
religiously diverse than it was a generation ago. In 1988, among
those undergraduates who indicated a religious background, only
about 57 percent were Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Its theology department has also grown, the offerings ranging
from courses in Scripture to feminist ethics to Islamic politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days, theology departments at all Catholic universities in
the United States, face a question of what will result from a
decision by the nation's bishops to require theologians to obtain a
mandate certifying that what they teach is ``authentic'' Catholic
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The stipulation was included in a document adopted by the
bishops at their meeting in November. The document, ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' (``From the Heart of the Church''), is subject to
approval by the Vatican, which is expected in the next several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bishops will have to decide how to grant mandates, how
to revoke them and what they think a university ought to do when a
theologian loses a mandate.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Georgetown suggested that any bishop who decided that
he wanted a closer look at theologians within his jurisdiction
might have a lot to do.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown offers more than 100 theology classes, taught by 25
full-time professors. Undergraduates may choose among numerous
courses, on Catholic social action, religion and film, the Dead Sea
Scrolls, Protestant Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism,
Hinduism and African religions.
</P>
<P>
   Would a bishop want to sit in on a class? Would he feel obliged
to read what the theologians have written?
</P>
<P>
   While the bishop's role is to convey Catholic teaching in the
community, said Anthony Tambasco, chairman of the theology
department at Georgetown, the university has a different focus.
There is, he said, ``an important distinction between evangelism
and mission, and the academic study of theology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Theology is not catechism,'' Tambasco said, referring to basic
religious instruction. ``We do the academic study,'' he said, ``and
campus ministry takes care of the spiritual needs of students.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The distinction at Georgetown was not always clear, Tambasco
said. In the 1950s, the department was smaller, staffed by Jesuit
priests who took an interest in promoting the faith within a
student body that was overwhelmingly Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But the department has changed. These days, although the
majority of professors are Catholic, most are lay people, a group
over whom the bishops have less direct control. And while the
number of students opting for a theology major is up, the Catholics
among them belong to a generation that has far less religious
education than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen must take a nonsectarian theology course, ``The Problem
of God,'' a nonsectarian class intended for a student body where a
majority is Catholic. The class deals with such issues as the
relationship between reason and faith, and the way religious
thinkers have responded to atheism.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before about 30 students recently, the Rev. Stephen
Fields discussed the conversion of St. Augustine. But as he
concluded the session, he reminded students that the class was not
intended to win over nonbelievers or to shake the faith of those
who did believe.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Fields said, the class was intended to introduce them to
the historic arguments for God's existence, and the strengths and
weaknesses in those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get this criticism here at Georgetown,'' Fields said.
```You're a Catholic university, shouldn't you be teaching
something explicitly Catholic to first-year students?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have a whole range of courses and Catholic
subjects,'' he said, adding that the bishops' document emphasized
that the mission of a Catholic university was to educate. ``So, I
think it's perfectly appropriate that the goals of a course like
this should be broadly humane,'' Fields said. ``And I think it's
perfectly consonant with our identity as a Catholic university.''
</P>
<P>
   Tambasco estimated that about 60 students were majoring in
theology at Georgetown, a fourfold increase over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   One is John Favier, 22, a Catholic and a senior from San
Francisco, who said studying theology ``forces you to think in new
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer in the comfort of blissful ignorance,'' said
Favier, a student in Ms. Sanders' class. By that, he said, he meant
that he had passed beyond ``a blind acceptance'' that lacked
``critical research and critical analysis of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, 22, a Presbyterian from Dallas, was one of Favier's
classmates. ``I really enjoy the discussions we have,'' Ballard
said, ``because there are so many people with radically different
viewpoints.''

   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. _ Sachin and Purvi Shah arrived with their
infant daughter at Newark International Airport on a crisp day in
February as the newest of immigrants from Barooda, India. But
instead of heading to Flushing or Jackson Heights, they slid
comfortably into a Nissan Quest minivan steered by Mrs. Shah's
brother, Kaushal Desai, and rode west on Interstate 78, away from
the shrinking Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   They drove past the older suburbs, beyond the Garden State
Parkway, through a blurry montage of wooded valleys and office
parks, before reaching this affluent township, some 40 miles from
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought New Jersey would be like Manhattan,'' Shah, a
31-year-old computer programmer, recalled recently at the new house
his family shares with the Desais. ``But as we were driving on 78,
past all these fields, I asked Kaushal, `Where are the buildings?'
''
</P>
<P>
   All told, it took an hour for the Shahs to achieve what earlier
immigrants often could not claim for decades, even generations:
middle-class comfort and prosperity in suburban America.
</P>
<P>
   By leapfrogging to desirable suburbs, many Asian immigrants are
upending stereotypes about new immigrants' being poor and
invisible, tethered to ethnic neighborhoods, desperate to wriggle
out of the city. Instead, these newcomers are younger and more
economically diverse, equipped with graduate degrees and work
visas, gifted in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgewater, a rambling township of 38,000 with a median
household income of $84,000, is no Monterey Park, Calif., where the
population is two-thirds Asian-American. Nor is it like Palisades
Park, N.J., where Korean-American businesses dominate the downtown.
Rather, it is a subtler example of how even the quietest bedroom
communities are finding their rhythms jolted by the greatest wave
of immigration since the start of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has this been more evident than in the southwestern
sections of Bridgewater, where in the last decade farms and woods
have given way to 3,000 houses in glistening subdivisions. As many
as half the residents in some neighborhoods are Asian, led by
Indians, Chinese and Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   During rush hour, people born on the other side of the world
line up in gleaming sedans and sport utility vehicles at the
intersection of Route 28 and Vanderveer Road, destined for
telecommunications, pharmaceutical and computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn, Chinese grandparents practice qigong breathing
exercises on the sidewalks, then tinker with sprinklers as
self-appointed lawn administrators. At dusk, families nudge baby
strollers past virgin $300,000 houses and converse in their native
tongues. There is a new, commodious Hindu temple here, and the
library stocks books in Chinese, Gujarati and other languages.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that Bridgewater, once a sleepy,
monochromatic Republican enclave, has turned into an oasis of
multicultural harmony. The police have recorded a growing number of
bias incidents, including repeated fires set to a Sikh family's
mailbox. Some parents have grumbled about the academic successes of
Asian-American students. Old-timers can be heard to complain about
residential and commercial sprawl, stoked in part by new
immigrants.
</P>

   Some natives even seem benumbed that whatever home-field
advantage they toiled to attain _ in school, at work, in life _ has
been erased by upstarts who do not fit the classic immigrant
profile.

   ``The middle-class white enclave is being challenged, and
they're afraid of what's going to come in,'' said Paul Richardson,
40, who grew up in Bridgewater, went away to college, then returned
to raise his children. ``I just hope the new people coming in will
want to become a part of our culture.''

   Robert Kiser, a weathered man with fraying copper hair, was
trudging through a treeless housing development under construction
when he stopped to point.
</P>
<P>
   Over there, by Route 28, was the endless front yard of his Civil
War-era house, where he and two older brothers used to play
football. Over there, closer to the stream, was the place where
schoolchildren once went on hayrides through his fruit farm. But
over here, he gestured, was a symbol of the present: a newly paved
street named Kiser Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reminder of how people were uprooted,'' Kiser said.
``Some day, our kids and grandkids can come back and say, `See,
there's our old name.'''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kiser, 49, reluctantly sold his family's 15-acre farm
to make way for the 63 houses of the Orchard Meadows subdivision,
becoming the latest member of Bridgewater's old guard to yield to a
more developed, more diverse world.
</P>
<P>
   The descendant of Prussian and Danish immigrants, Kiser grew up
in the '50s and '60s, when Bridgewater still exuded a rural rhythm
first established by Dutch and English settlers in the mid-1700s.
As an entrepreneurial eighth-grader in 1965, Kiser started Bob's
Fruit Stand on Route 28, selling peaches, pears and apples. He
eventually became an engineer, like his father and brothers, but
kept the stand as a side business.

   In those days, residents liked Bridgewater because it was far
away, but not too far: an hour's drive to the Jersey shore or the
Poconos; an hour's drive to New York or Philadelphia. Stations from
those cities played on the radio. The widest cultural divide was
between those who said stoop, lightning bug and sub (New York) and
those who said porch, firefly and hoagie (Philadelphia).

 BRIDGEWATER, N.J.: hoagie (Philadelphia).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like much of central New Jersey, Bridgewater began to change in
the 1980s, especially after the State Supreme Court, to promote
affordable housing, forced communities to change zoning to allow
clusters of smaller lots. A giant mall, Bridgewater Commons, opened
in 1988, becoming the de facto downtown for a 32-square mile
township that had never had one. Major corporations like AT&AMP;T and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson opened offices, attracted by the confluence of
six highways.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents sold family homesteads and moved deeper into the
countryside, leaving behind only their names on streets.

<P>
   New developments and cul-de-sacs sprouted up, particularly
inside a 1,000-acre triangle engirdled by Route 28, Milltown Road
and Vanderveer Road.

<P>
   Alarmed by the shifting landscape around his farm, Kiser joined
the Save Bridgewater Organization, an anti-development group, in
the early 1990s. But this year, Kiser, his wife, Pam, a 48-year-old
teacher, and three teen-age sons talked it over and decided to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we had to make a decision to make way,'' he said.
``This is the vision for Bridgewater. It has totally changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, they moved to a new house, two miles away, still in
Bridgewater. Bob's Fruit Stand remains, even though its produce
must now be hauled in from out of town, not from across the street.
The family remains active in local affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with developers, Kiser's boyhood home, a
white Colonial surrounded by magnolia, elm and maple trees, will
remain and be rented out. So, too, will the ranch house occupied by
Kiser's 90-year-old aunt, Constance, whose new address, in a
bittersweet touch, will be 4 Kiser Lane.

   ``This area has undergone such a tremendous transformation in
such a compressed amount of time, and it's been a challenge dealing
with that,'' he said. ``It'll probably hit home when they finish

   On a fall morning, the allegro pace at the Desai and Shah
household reached a peak, highlighted by Hindu prayers and the
wolfed-down breakfasts of cereal and masalapuri, an Indian snack.
</P>
<P>
   Off went Gati Desai, bundling her two young children to school.
Off went Desai to meet with a computer consulting client in Newark.
And down went Shah to the basement, headquarters of Trinet
Solutions, a small computer consulting business the Desais founded
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Four bedrooms, three small children, two cars, one home-based
business: this is the arpeggio of life for the Shahs, who have
settled into a comfortable if hectic suburban groove, just 10
months removed from their native state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
   The two families regularly inspect crafts fairs and shop for
vegetarian groceries in Edison. They worship at either the
Swaminaryan temple in Edison or the year-old Sri Venkateswara
temple in Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Shahs view Bridgewater as a satellite not of
New York City, but of Edison, 20 minutes away, with its plethora of
ethnic supermarkets and services, primarily for Indian and Chinese
immigrants. The Shahs treat New York as a tourist destination.
Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Statue of Liberty?
Been there. Jackson Heights? Haven't done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridgewater is very peaceful, very clean, very nice,'' said
Mrs. Shah, 28, after attending a free English conversation class
for immigrants at the public library here. ``We like it very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, her husband was a computer programmer, while Mrs. Shah
was a microbiologist. But they calculated that America would be
better for their careers, and for their daughter, Shaili, 3,
especially because the Desais, like many immigrants ensconced in
suburbia, were willing to live indefinitely with their newly
arrived relatives.
</P>
<P>
   So the Shahs became the latest beneficiaries of changes in
immigration law that have lifted restrictions on Asians and other
groups, particularly the highly educated and skilled.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants are still generally settling in the city. But more
are bypassing that stage and are heading straight to the suburbs,
led by the Asians, according to a new study in the journal
Migration World by Ronald J.O. Flores, a sociologist at St.
Lawrence University, and A. Peter Lobo and Joseph J. Salvo,
demographers with the New York City planning department.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1996, 46 percent of Asian immigrants _
including 66 percent of Indians _ settled directly in the suburbs,
up from 37 percent the previous six years, the study showed. In
that time, Bridgewater absorbed about 1,000 immigrants _ 54 percent
of whom were Asians, mostly professionals _ nearly doubling the
total between 1983 and 1989, Lobo said.
</P>
<P>
   For many new immigrants, the suburbs are a symbol of a clean
slate, a fresh start. ``The more I live here, the more I like it
here,'' said Sharon Wang, 33, a native of China's Hubei province,
who moved to Bridgewater four years ago with her husband, a
statistician, and two sons. ``I feel like this is my country. I was
born to come here.''

   Ms. Wang, a librarian, lords over a house filled with plants, a
reproduction of Renoir's ``Luncheon of the Boating Party'' and a
glistening Yamaha piano. She invites Chinese neighbors over for
dinners of dumplings, bean-thread noodles and squash soup, and an
occasional bout of karaoke. She sends her sons to the Huaxia
Chinese School, a private weekend school in Hillsborough, to learn
Chinese. Her mother, Chai Chunting, is among hundreds of
grandparents who shuttle regularly between Asia and Bridgewater.

   Ms. Chai, 61, had braced herself at first: she could not speak
English, could not drive. But soon, she was playing cards and
gossiping with neighbors from all parts of China. She even traveled
with other Chinese grandparents to Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Ms. Chai said on a stroll one midsummer night, ``is
like a small Chinese town.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set, the audience rapt.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the middle, sobbing, was a Japanese-American student,
played with flair by Chelsey Tanaka. She told her parents that she
had been ridiculed by her new classmates for wearing her mother's
kimono. Do not fret, said Jessica Tang, the student playing her
mother. Cherish your heritage. Ignore the bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tanaka's character marched into class the next day and
swayed the other students with her brio. ``Tolerance means not
hating people who are different from you, but still respecting
their differences,'' she said.

   The juniors in Will Ferry's advanced placement history class
were performing their original skit this June day before a special

School.

<P>
   School officials believe it is never too early to teach
tolerance. And no institution has been more affected by
Bridgewater's churning population than the schools, which have the
potential to become a model United Nations _ or a multicultural
tinderbox.

   The Asian population here has climbed from 1 percent in 1980 to
perhaps 10 percent now. In the school district, which includes the
tiny, middle-class borough of Raritan, almost 10 percent of the
students are not native speakers of English. The 41 different
languages represented include 11 from the Indian subcontinent and 4
from China and Taiwan, said Superintendent Stephen Sokolow.
</P>
<P>
   At Bridgewater-Raritan High School, where one-quarter of the
students are minorities, the Asian population is 13.9 percent, up
from 3.7 in 1988. At Van Holten Elementary School in southwestern
Bridgewater, the Asian population is 22.2 percent, up from 14.2
percent only two years ago.

   ``Bridgewater used to be a very white suburban school
district,'' said Susan Bova, who teaches English as a second
language at the high school. Enrollment in her classes has more
than doubled since last year, chiefly with students from Latin
America, Asia and Eastern Europe. ``Now, the ethnicity has changed
so completely, I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a minority
school eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, most students seem to be handling the changes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Kiser, Kiser's middle son, was president of the high
school's freshman class last year and said he had no problems with
the new diversity. His classmate Yousheng Tang, who lives close to
the former Kiser Farm, is just four years removed from a school in
Shanghai, but has been trying hard to absorb American pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 6 feet in cleats and a taut 150 pounds, Yousheng was
a reserve tight end on the sophomore football team, one of only two
Asian-Americans on the Panthers. ``He likes it, so we support
him,'' said Tom Tang, his father, a computer programmer at AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it is the parents who are struggling with a
multicultural system. Some Asian-Americans are excelling
academically; about half the seniors in the top 5 percent are
Asian-American. And so are a quarter to a third of the students in
a program that separates the highest-scoring elementary school
students from the rest of their age group.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents have criticized the program as being too
competitive and top-heavy with Asian-Americans. They have suggested
it fosters elitism at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   The whispers have not escaped the immigrants' ears. ``Sometimes,
people say, `You Chinese guys are smart. You have well-paid jobs,'
'' said Sharon Wang, whose older son is enrolled in the program.
``You can feel it. It's some sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   On a muggy evening in July, 400 people packed a Zoning Board of
Adjustment meeting, glowering at slide after slide of blueprints,
statistics and sketches. One by one, people denounced a proposed
shopping center, called Millbridge Village, on Route 28. There
would be too much traffic, they said. Too much disruption.

   But something was missing. ``I think everyone notices, where are
all the Chinese, the Indians?'' said Paul Richardson, a Bridgewater
native. ``You look at that crowd, it looks like Bridgewater from 25
years ago. It's the old guard trying to dig their heels in.''
</P>
<P>
   Overdevelopment is the hottest issue in suburbia, as evidenced
by Millbridge Village, which was ultimately rejected. But in
Bridgewater, where taxes are relatively low, unhappiness about
development may be a more complicated issue than in other places.
</P>
<P>
   For older residents, the new developments provoke varied
emotions, from envy to acceptance. Kiser, for one, said he did not
begrudge the Asian immigrants their success. But he does sense that
the community's anti-development mood may mask a muted dislike of
the newcomers and their unfamiliar customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people are somewhat resentful of some of the
foreign people coming in and jumping ahead so quickly,'' he said.

   Police have reported more bias incidents recently, including

the mailbox of their next-door neighbors, the Singhs, members of a
Sikh gurdwara, or temple, here.

   Apart from these flare-ups, some longtime residents believe that
few Chinese and Indian residents show interest in or understanding
of Bridgewater's civic life. One exception is Michael Hsing, an
Internet manager from Taiwan who moved here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Like two-thirds of the registered voters affiliated with a
party, Hsing, 44, is a Republican. He was the local party's
campaign treasurer this year. He was dispirited, though, when
voters narrowly rejected a $22.9 million bond issue at referendum
this month to expand the high school, which is projected to swell
to 2,800 from 1,900 students by 2009. So it is crucial, he said,
for more Asian immigrants, citizens or not, to participate in civic
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, when the community has an issue, people will say,
`Where were you last time?' '' he said. ``Or even worse, they'll
say, `Who are you?' `'
</P>
<P>
   Late in the summer at his new house, Kiser sat in the kitchen,
cherishing some photographs of the old Kiser Farm, and thinking
about the ones to come from the new Kiser Farm.
</P>
<P>
   After much deliberation, Kiser and his brothers, Franklin and
Bill, decided to buy another farm, one of 103 acres, 18 miles to
the west in Hunterdon County. ``You have to change with the
changes,'' he said, noting that about half the houses in Orchard
Meadows had been bought by people of Asian descent. ``There are a
lot of people with foreign backgrounds to make room for.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, on a chilly but bright autumn afternoon, the
Shahs and the Desais assembled in a guest bedroom and knelt for 10
minutes before a small shrine to three Hindu gods: Swaminarayan the
creator, Ganesh, the elephant god of goodness, and Hanuman, the
monkey god of religious piety.
</P>
<P>
   In their daily candle-lit prayer, the four adults and three
children sang hymns and clapped joyously, then chewed on almond
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be totally Americanized, but I feel very
fortunate to be here,'' said Desai, who became a U.S. citizen in
August. ``In this country, you can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shahs are not sure if they will stay forever. But they are
confident that their daughter, Shaili, will benefit from America's
technological wonders and Bridgewater's tapestry of new immigrants.

   ``She can come in,'' Shah said, ``right from the beginning.'' &QL;

 &HT;    R&AMP;B artist Curtis Mayfield dies at 57
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there's any good news to be gleaned from the death
of R&AMP;B pioneer Curtis Mayfield, it's that until he passed away
Sunday, he kept on pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, 57, died Sunday morning at North Fulton Regional
Hospital in Roswell, Ga. No other details were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my husband, the father of our children, my best friend
and my soulmate,'' said Mayfield's widow, Altheida. ``Thank God his
music and his legacy will live far beyond today.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as March, when he was inducted into the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame, Mayfield pushed, trying unsuccessfully to travel
from his Dunwoody, Ga., home to New York for the ceremony.
Ultimately, complications from a 1990 stage accident that paralyzed
him from the neck down kept him from going.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the Chicago native's injuries also kept him from
adding to his 41-year-old catalog, which includes ``Keep on
Moving,'' a civil rights rallying cry in 1964; the similar-minded
1965 classic, ``People Get Ready''; and the breakthrough funk
soundtrack of 1972, ``Superfly.'' In 1996, when the
singer-songwriter had been an Atlantan for 20 years, he recruited
local producers Darryl Simmons and Organized Noize to record his
last album of original work, the Grammy-nominated ``New World
Order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Making music keeps my soul working even when my body doesn't
want to,'' Mayfield said in 1996, one of the last times he was able
to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:20 a.m. Sunday, his body gave in.

COMMENTARY: CHRISTMAS IN GROZNY: DEATH TAKES NO HOLIDAY

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two New York Times columnists acted as moderators
at a session of Russian and Western investors in Davos a couple of
years ago. When Tom Friedman asked George Soros what was holding up
investment in Russia, the billionaire trader pointed to Boris
Berezovsky across the table and said: ``Him. He's a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gasps, I stuck a microphone in front of the accused
Russian oligarch, long whispered to be the money man behind Boris
Yeltsin's corrupt ``family,'' and asked, ``Are you going to let him
get away with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Impervious to criticism, Berezovsky shrugged and smiled. He was
not about to rise to the bait.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's parliamentary elections, the little man with
the darting eyes is smiling still. Thanks to the use of a bloody
war as a political campaign device, Berezovsky and his amalgam of
KGB apparatchiks, Yeltsin mafiosi and phony reformers have emerged
on top.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the Russian election was that it was held
at all. The next best thing was that the Primakov-Luzhkov marriage
of cunning no-goodniks, highly favored to take over the country
only a few months ago, was stymied.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about the Duma election was that it showed how
easily the Russian electorate can be manipulated. Nobody will
investigate the suspicion that the bombing of apartment houses was
the work of the KGB taking a leaf from the Gestapo's Reichstag
fire. But however caused, those terror attacks and ill-timed
Chechen troublemaking ignited Russian fear and fury at the
dark-skinned, independence-minded Muslims. It gave vengeful Russian
generals and the Yeltsin ``family'' a new lease on political life.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all politicians jumped on the kill-the-Chechens
bandwagon. Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's favorite ``reformer'' _ the
man who delivered the Soviet Union's wealth into the hands of a few
favored oligarchs _ led the charge to whip up hatred.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the war fever, and of the suppression of media
reports of the first Russian casualties, the Kremlin party won a
fourth of the seats; the Communists were held to another fourth,
while phony reformers plus Vladimir Zhirinovsky's lunatic fringe
have about 15 percent, as does the staggered Primakov-Luzhkov
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The only party to call for negotiation with the Chechen leaders,
rather than obliterating the women and children in Grozny, was
Yabloko. The lonely democratic reformers, Grigory Yavlinsky and
Sergei Stepashin, paid the price for resisting the bloodlust; their
Duma strength dropped from 8 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now we will see the second phase of the Putin-Berezovsky-Chubais
election strategy. Russian troops, accompanied by Chechen quislings
sprung from Moscow jails, will win nominal control of Grozny, now
pulverized by bombs and shells. Western reporters threatened with
criminal prosecution will be kept from seeing the killing of
civilians and the loss of Russian soldiers and tanks. The generals
will then declare the war over.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Russians will pose for pictures patrolling the key town
squares. The negotiations scorned by politicians during the
election campaign will be offered to Chechen leaders left standing.
'Twill be a famous victory.
</P>
<P>
   By night in Grozny, however, and in the southern mountains,
unconquered Chechen guerrillas supplied by terror networks may
continue to harass and bleed the Russian occupiers. They outlasted
Stalin; they could outlast Putin. If the grim Russia-haters act
true to past form, the fickle Russian public may find the Chechen
war not so popular by the time presidential elections roll around
next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the family and its supporting crooks will lean on
American politicians. Last week, under GOP pressure to react to the
Chechen massacre, Madeleine Albright had to use a national-security
law to stop the too-eager James Harmon, president of our
taxpayer-supported Export-Import Bank, from guaranteeing a loan to
Tyumen Oil, a sleazy Russian operation.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon was the Wall Street banker who provided a $1
million-a-year haven for Tony Coelho after that pol left Washington
under a cloud. Harmon also donated $115,000 in soft money to the
Democratic National Committee in its gilt-edged 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign. That bought him the Ex-Im bank job with Al Gore himself
swearing him in. Coelho, now Gore's campaign chairman, is likely to
be White House chief of staff if Gore wins.
</P>
<P>
   Do you wonder why well-connected Boris Berezovsky is smiling as
Chechens die at holiday time? Much business remains to be done.

DRIVERS PUSHING HIGHWAY SPEEDS TO NEW HEIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Utah, Md., Hawaii)   (rk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early last Monday morning, Mathew Hennessy, mild-mannered
computer programmer, was driving down the Saw Mill Parkway toward
Manhattan at 100 mph. Inside his Jeep Grand Cherokee, things were
calm. An old song by the Cure played low on the radio as Hennessy,
27, from New Rochelle, N.Y., sank into his leather seat, gripped
the wheel and watched rush-hour traffic stream past his window in
one long Manet-like smudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a guy who isn't looking, and you have to do
an avoidance maneuver,'' Hennessy, who says he can't talk while
driving fast, later explained. ``Or you have to go faster to get
around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hennessy is clearly an extremist _ he maintains a Web
page that gives how-to tips on speeding _ he is one of a growing
number of American drivers who, according to traffic experts, are
pushing highway speeds to new heights each year.
</P>
<P>
   Steering bigger and more powerful cars and exploiting
increasingly lax police enforcement, more drivers than ever are
treating speed limits as suggestions _ and not very good ones at
that, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no debate that speeds now are higher than they have
ever been in the history of this nation,'' said Richard Retting, a
senior transportation engineer with the nonprofit Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety. ``There seems to be no stopping that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has drawn little public notice, overshadowed by more
visible problems like drunken driving and, lately, the supposed
``road rage'' epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that may be veiling the national speeding binge
is this apparent paradox: While some analysts and consumer groups
insist that higher speeds cost lives, highway deaths have been
falling steadily for years. Though Americans are driving more miles
than ever, the fatality rate per highway mile has declined 11
percent since 1995, when the federal government abandoned the
national speed limit of 55 mph. Whatever the reasons for the safer
highways _ airbags, drunken-driving and seat-belt laws and
better-engineered cars foremost among them _ it is clear that those
who drive on them have become emboldened to speed. The evidence for
what Retting calls ``speed creep'' _ the gradual process of going
faster and faster on the highways, regardless of the posted limit _
is striking:
</P>
<P>
   _ Between 1980 and 1992, the percentage of interstate drivers
exceeding 65 mph quadrupled, from 4.9 percent on all interstates to
nearly 23 percent, according to Federal Highway Administration
data.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York in 1991, only 14 percent of drivers ticketed on
Interstate 87, which runs from New York City to the Canadian
border, had been driving over 80 mph, state records show. By 1996,
27 percent were.
</P>
<P>
   _ On many stretches of Interstates 80 and 280 in New Jersey,
fewer than 10 percent of drivers now obey the 55 mph limits, state
speed surveys show.
</P>
<P>
   _ And last year, state surveys of speeds along Interstates 95
and 84, two of Connecticut's densest traffic arteries, showed that
so-called ``85th percentile'' speed _ the speed a car should
maintain to flow smoothly with all the other cars _ reached as high
as 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Rising speeds are getting the attention of federal officials. On
Jan. 9, the Department of Transportation is scheduled to host an
all-day workshop in Washington to figure out ways to ``restore the
credibility of speed limits.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more states, especially those in the West, where
highways often stretch for uninterrupted miles, admit the growing
uselessness of their own speed limits. In Utah, a state that lets
rural interstate drivers go 75 mph, people now often drive 10 to 20
mph faster than they did just a decade ago, said Craig Allred, the
director of the Utah Highway Safety Office. Utah troopers commonly
allow drivers an 8-to-10 mph buffer zone above some limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis now is on hazardous drivers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, like Maryland, officials are combating faster
driving with electronic tools, like radar posts and variable signs
that show motorists how fast they are driving, said Manu Shah, a
manager of traffic safety analysis with the Maryland Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has an excuse for why they speed. Toll-road drivers,
like those on the New Jersey Turnpike, often feel entitled to
speed, Shah said. ``They think they are paying for the privilege of
driving a little faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers, especially those steering burly sport-utility
vehicles with mammoth engines, seem ill-equipped to handle all that
power, said Sgt. Paul Vance of the Connecticut State Police. These
days, his troopers see more drivers than ever fly by them at 80 and
90 mph, he said. Once caught, more drivers now simply blame their
vehicles. ``They'll say, `The car just got away from me,''' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast, home to some of the most crowded interstates in
the nation, is also home to the fastest drivers in the country,
including the likes of Hennessy, the computer programmer. Even in
dowdy Connecticut _ the so-called Land of Steady Habits _ drivers
nowadays ``don't pay particular attention to speed limits,'' said
Bob Ouellette, manager of the driving school in AAA's Hartford
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   On the two-lane Merritt Parkway, for instance, where rush-hour
traffic often flows toward New York at or near 75 mh, ``you're
putting your own life in danger by driving 55,'' the posted speed
limit, Ouellette said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why some people want speed limits to go even higher, for
safety. If speed limits went up, they reason, fewer drivers would
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heart of the problem,'' said James J. Baxter, the
president of the National Motorists Association, a national
lobbying group that is pushing for higher speed limits, ``is that
the legal speeds are not appropriate for what people consider to be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a 75 mph limit on the New Jersey Turnpike, you're
going to have 90 to 95 percent compliance,'' he suggested. ``Then
you could focus on the 5 percent that are rolling down the road at
120.''
</P>
<P>
   But would it really be just 5 percent? ``I used to live out west
so I am very comfortable with 75 and 80 miles an hour, even 85,''
Suzi Yebio, 23, of New York City, said during a speeding break
Thursday along the turnpike, her main conduit to friends in
Washington. ``If they raised the limit, I'd probably do 10 miles
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the idea of driving as video game, a phenomenon
Leon James, a professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii,
believes now rules many drivers' approach to the road. ``It's
almost impossible for most drivers to stay within speed limits,''
he said. ``The traffic emotions are very intense and competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say they believe speed is a factor behind a boom in
dangerous and menacing driving tactics. The latter problem became
so bad in New Jersey, in fact, that in 1997 the state police opened
an emergency line to report dangerous and aggressive drivers. It
has already fielded more than 30,000 complaints, said Sgt. Al Della
Fave.
</P>
<P>
   Like many traffic experts, James believes the burgeoning ``road
rage'' phenomenon will grow larger as the nation's roads grow ever
more clogged, compelling more people like Amy Emke to speed even
when she does not want to. ``It's the pressure of the people behind
you,'' Ms. Emke of Wingdale, N.Y., said during a rest break along
the New Jersey Turnpike Thursday. ``They push you faster.''

GEORGETOWN TAKES TEACHING VIEW OF NEW THEOLOGY MANDATE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes ``1988'' to ``1998'' in 5th graf.) 
(lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a recent afternoon, in her class on how people
have portrayed Jesus throughout history, Theresa Sanders read aloud
a passage by a medieval nun, who had imagined Jesus in an
unconventional way, as a mothering figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians have always used the images at hand to talk about
the significance of Jesus,'' said Ms. Sanders, a professor at
Georgetown University, provoking a question from Michael Ballard, a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a limit on where you can go with that symbolism?''
Ballard asked, prompting Ms. Sanders to guide the class into a
discussion of how far Christians ought to go in seeking common
ground with people of other faiths in understanding God.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanders said afterward: ``When I present Catholic teaching,
like any responsible professor, I try to do it accurately. I
present it in as complex and nuanced and faithful a way as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic institution, Georgetown has become more
religiously diverse than it was a generation ago. In 1998, among
those undergraduates who indicated a religious background, only
about 57 percent were Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Its theology department has also grown, the offerings ranging
from courses in Scripture to feminist ethics to Islamic politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days, theology departments at all Catholic universities in
the United States, face a question of what will result from a
decision by the nation's bishops to require theologians to obtain a
mandate certifying that what they teach is ``authentic'' Catholic
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The stipulation was included in a document adopted by the
bishops at their meeting in November. The document, ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' (``From the Heart of the Church''), is subject to
approval by the Vatican, which is expected in the next several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bishops will have to decide how to grant mandates, how
to revoke them and what they think a university ought to do when a
theologian loses a mandate.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Georgetown suggested that any bishop who decided that
he wanted a closer look at theologians within his jurisdiction
might have a lot to do.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown offers more than 100 theology classes, taught by 25
full-time professors. Undergraduates may choose among numerous
courses, on Catholic social action, religion and film, the Dead Sea
Scrolls, Protestant Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism,
Hinduism and African religions.
</P>
<P>
   Would a bishop want to sit in on a class? Would he feel obliged
to read what the theologians have written?
</P>
<P>
   While the bishop's role is to convey Catholic teaching in the
community, said Anthony Tambasco, chairman of the theology
department at Georgetown, the university has a different focus.
There is, he said, ``an important distinction between evangelism
and mission, and the academic study of theology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Theology is not catechism,'' Tambasco said, referring to basic
religious instruction. ``We do the academic study,'' he said, ``and
campus ministry takes care of the spiritual needs of students.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The distinction at Georgetown was not always clear, Tambasco
said. In the 1950s, the department was smaller, staffed by Jesuit
priests who took an interest in promoting the faith within a
student body that was overwhelmingly Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But the department has changed. These days, although the
majority of professors are Catholic, most are lay people, a group
over whom the bishops have less direct control. And while the
number of students opting for a theology major is up, the Catholics
among them belong to a generation that has far less religious
education than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen must take a theology course, ``The Problem of God,'' a
nonsectarian class intended for a student body where a majority is
Catholic. The class deals with such issues as the relationship
between reason and faith, and the way religious thinkers have
responded to atheism.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before about 30 students recently, the Rev. Stephen
Fields discussed the conversion of St. Augustine. But as he
concluded the session, he reminded students that the class was not
intended to win over nonbelievers or to shake the faith of those
who did believe.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Fields said, the class was intended to introduce them to
the historic arguments for God's existence, and the strengths and
weaknesses in those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get this criticism here at Georgetown,'' Fields said.
```You're a Catholic university, shouldn't you be teaching
something explicitly Catholic to first-year students?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have a whole range of courses and Catholic
subjects,'' he said, adding that the bishops' document emphasized
that the mission of a Catholic university was to educate. ``So, I
think it's perfectly appropriate that the goals of a course like
this should be broadly humane,'' Fields said. ``And I think it's
perfectly consonant with our identity as a Catholic university.''
</P>
<P>
   Tambasco estimated that about 60 students were majoring in
theology at Georgetown, a fourfold increase over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   One is John Favier, 22, a Catholic and a senior from San
Francisco, who said studying theology ``forces you to think in new
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer in the comfort of blissful ignorance,'' said
Favier, a student in Ms. Sanders' class. By that, he said, he meant
that he had passed beyond ``a blind acceptance'' that lacked
``critical research and critical analysis of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, 22, a Presbyterian from Dallas, was one of Favier's
classmates. ``I really enjoy the discussions we have,'' Ballard
said, ``because there are so many people with radically different
viewpoints.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BOWL WINNERS MAY BE MONEY LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Wisconsin's football team journeyed to Pasadena, Calif.,
last January to play UCLA in the Rose Bowl, the travel party
totaled 832, far more than were needed to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides 110 uniformed Badgers, the contingent included the
coaches, the 380-member band, the spirit squad, university
officials, athletic department staff and assorted spouses. The tab:
$2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers won, 38-31, but lost $300,000 on the California
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Losing money on the Rose Bowl sounds like a feat of fiscal
nuttiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People heard about the payout and that we lost money, and
wondered `How could that be?''' said Vince Sweeney, an associate
athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, whatever happens on the field, bowl teams are not
always winners on the bottom line. Whether a bowl pays out top
dollar, which can be $10 million and up _ for Wisconsin last season
it was about $12.5 million _ or it pays considerably less, some
teams consider themselves lucky if their costs do not exceed their
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, bowl games have offered colleges major
opportunities to strut before national television audiences,
whether they are Bowl Championship Series games with eight-figure
payouts like the Rose Bowl or smaller ones with payouts below $1
million like the Music City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Red ink or not, the bowls are about pageantry and recruiting, as
well as rewarding players and administrators for a successful
season with a nice road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be in the bowl business,'' said Val Hale,
athletic director of Brigham Young, which plays Marshall in
Monday's Motor City Bowl. ``If you don't, it hurts your recruiting
and your image.''
</P>
<P>
   And if appearing in a bowl causes a short-term financial loss,
he said, ``It's a cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   For playing in last season's Rose Bowl, Wisconsin and UCLA
received about $12.5 million each. But no team playing in a major
bowl game, except for an independent like Notre Dame, goes home
with the entire bounty. The revenue is shared among the other teams
in its conference, with the conference paying its bowl teams'
``expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's cut from the Rose Bowl came to $1.4 million. The
team raised $400,000 more from sponsors and alumni. Yet $1.8
million was still not enough to break even on the jaunt to
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   The loss on the trip generated criticism from local politicians
and state legislators, so for Wisconsin's return trip to the Rose
Bowl on Saturday to play Stanford, the team's contingent will be
pared by at least 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we'll get to where we want to be,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sweeney added, the bowl season produced a profit. Five
Big Ten teams _ Wisconsin, Ohio State, Michigan, Purdue and Penn
State _ played bowl games last season. The windfall from
distributing the bowl revenues produced an additional $1.5 million
for each team in the conference _ even Northwestern, which lost
nine of its 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Some state legislators are angry that Minnesota is spending $1
million to send 700 people, including the Gophers team, to Friday's
Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, so soon after an academic fraud scandal
in the men's basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the university, when it has such great
needs, should spend money like that, regardless of the source,''
said Leo Foley, a state senator.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Chryst, commissioner of the Mid-American Conference,
which sent Marshall to the Motor City Bowl in Pontiac, Mich., said
that even if a university loses money going to a bowl game, there
are many good reasons to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still great and still worth it to go,'' Chryst said.
``Only our champion gets to go to a bowl, and for Marshall to play
a great opponent like BYU, it's great for the players to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Motor City Bowl pays each team $750,000, which Marshall and
BYU will use for expenses. David Steele, Marshall's associate
athletic director, said the school would lose $100,000 to $120,000
to send its party from Huntington, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard it as a positive expense,'' Steele said. The
Thundering Herd lost similar sums to make Motor City Bowl
appearances in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Like BYU, Marshall's bowl finances would improve if it sold out
its allocation of 16,000 tickets, at $32 each, to the game at the
Silverdome. Every bowl team must guarantee the sale of a designated
number of tickets, but Steele said Marshall would sell only about
9,000 tickets, creating a loss of $224,000 for the tickets alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is selling out your tickets,'' said Hale of BYU. ``If
you can do that, you'll make a profit or break even.'' The
university is sending 500 people to Pontiac, including 300 band
members.
</P>
<P>
   Hale was hoping for a trip to the Las Vegas Bowl, which would
have entailed a shorter, cheaper trip from Provo, Utah, than the
one the Cougars will make to Michigan, and would almost have
guaranteed a profit. But Utah, which had the same overall (8-3) and
conference records (5-2) as BYU, was selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had gone to Las Vegas, we'd have sold all our tickets
and sent everyone on buses,'' Hale said. But the trip to Pontiac
will mean a loss of $256,000 to BYU on 8,000 unsold tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hale remains hopeful that the trip will not require the school
to spend more than the $750,000 it will receive for playing. Yet he
knows that at the Mormon school, a greater percentage of players
have wives and children than do players at other colleges. The
families' travel costs are also covered. ``When they get off the
plane, it's like a family reunion, with all the baby strollers,''
Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   Each conference divides bowl revenues differently. The Sugar
Bowl, which will determine the national champion, is paying $11
million to $13 million each to Virginia Tech and Florida State.
(The exact sum will depend on ticket sales and other revenues.) The
Orange Bowl will pay Alabama and Michigan a similar amount.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Tech will keep $4 million _ more than ensuring a
profitable trip, with 600 people in tow, win or lose against the
Seminoles. Alabama will keep $2.5 million, a reflection of the
different philosophies of their conferences. Alabama hopes to avoid
losing money, as it did last year when it played for a modest
payout at the Music City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone else pays as much, which has been our
history,'' said John Paquette, associate commissioner of the Big
East. ``Part of our philosophy is to reward success.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Southeastern Conference, the lower payment to Alabama
means more for the other 11 teams and the league office, said
Charles Bloom, a league spokesman. He added that the Big East could
be more generous because it had only eight football teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a fair way to let all 12 schools get a piece of the
pie,'' Bloom said.

WASHINGTON CONFIDENT ON HANDLING Y2K, CAUTIOUS ON TERRORIST
ATTACKS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's coordinator for the year 2000
conversion said Sunday that his concerns about the readiness of
hospitals, prisons and emergency service organizations had been
allayed, and Pentagon officials struck a carefully calibrated tone
of caution mixed with confidence that they could deal with any
terrorist attacks around the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke as the government entered the last five days of
preparations for possible computer malfunctions and terrorist
threats. Government officials have started to show off the White
House command center for dealing with threats, which keeps tabs on
everything from the amount of cash withdrawn from automated teller
machines to suspicious activities along the borders of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials repeated Sunday that they knew of no specific threats.
``People are pretty geared up,'' one administration official said,
``but there's not much new on our radar.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ABC News program ``This Week,'' John A.
Koskinen, the chairman of the President's Council on the Year 2000
Conversion, said that although half of the country's 911 emergency
systems had still not reprogrammed their computer systems six
months ago, ``over 95 percent of the 911 systems now report that
all their work is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are also ready, Koskinen said, though most of the
recent concern centers on rural hospitals where computer systems
might falter in processing reimbursements from health insurance
companies _ a financial problem, but not one that would affect the
quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Koskinen said, potential problems with automated
security systems in prisons have been largely solved.
</P>
<P>
   But as computer concerns have ebbed in recent weeks, they have
been replaced with worries about terrorists and cults. Some former
intelligence officials have predicted two or three terrorist events
around the world. And Clinton administration and New York officials
were clearly unhappy last week when Jim Kallstrom, former head of
the FBI's New York office, said he would not go to Times Square on
New Year's Eve because ``if there is a strike, it will be in a
large gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been trying in the last few days to strike a
balance between calling for vigilance and dissuading Americans from
showing up at Times Square, the celebrations here on the Mall and
at other large events. Kallstrom's message set exactly the tone
they did not want _ even as the police get ready to control access
to Times Square and as nuclear and biological response teams gather
in Washington and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Also on ``This Week,'' the deputy secretary of defense, John J.
Hamre, said that ``Americans should feel very confident that we'll
be able to defend the country'' against any external threats, and
he talked at some length about the Russian and American teams that
would be sitting side by side to examine early-warning data.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre said he was no longer concerned about the possibility of
an accidental Russian nuclear launching. The United States, he
said, has spent $10 million helping Russia prepare for the year
2000. ``We want to make sure that they felt as confident and we
felt confident that there was positive control over nuclear weapons
and their early warning system.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians,'' Hamre concluded, ``have been more insistent on
positive control over their forces than we have, because of the
nature of their society.''

GROWTH OF A SILICON EMPIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  By HENRY NORR &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A century ago, even if some seer could have foreseen the flowering
of digital technology, there was little reason to predict it would
be centered here. Santa Clara County was then a lush agricultural
district known as the Valley of Heart's Delight, while San
Francisco's economy revolved around trade, finance and
shipbuilding.
<P>
   In hindsight, though, it's possible to trace the origins of high
tech in the Bay Area during the first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   One key contributor, undoubtedly, was Stanford University, which
opened in 1891. By all accounts, the institution's founders _
lawyer, merchant, governor, senator and railroad magnate Leland
Stanford, his influential wife, Jane Leland Stanford, and the
founding president they appointed, David Starr Jordan _
deliberately set out to build a college with a more practical bent
than the elite private universities back east.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, that meant that Stanford, from the start,
had a strong focus on the sciences and engineering. It also meant
that the university administration sought to encourage and build
ties with local industry, and it tended to recruit faculty who
shared those objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, for example, Jordan himself put up $500, and several
members of his faculty made additional investments, to help a
recent graduate named Cyril Elwell launch a wireless communications
company in Palo Alto. Under the name Federal Telegraph Co., it
quickly grew into the area's largest electronics business and
scored some significant advances in the development of radio.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's role in fostering the industry grew after 1927, when
Frederick Terman (son of Lewis Terman, the noted Stanford
psychologist and intelligence-test pioneer) began teaching radio
engineering there. He went on to become chairman of the electrical
engineering department, dean of engineering and, finally, provost
of the whole university. Throughout his almost 40-year career, one
of his chief preoccupations was encouraging and assisting local
electronics businesses _ and getting their help for the university
and his students.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, for example, when three alumni of the school _ the
brothers Sigurd and Russell Varian and junior faculty member
William Hansen _ began developing a new kind of microwave
transmitter and receiver called a klystron, the university gave
them free use of a lab plus $100 worth of materials per year, in
exchange for a 50 percent interest in their patents. (Russell
Varian had worked for a time in the San Francisco laboratory where
Philo T. Farnsworth was developing some of the key underpinnings
for an emerging technology called television.)
</P>
<P>
   The klystron became an important component in radar-detection
and guidance systems and later in electron-acceleration technology.
After World War II, the Varian brothers, together with other
Stanford researchers, set up Varian Associates, which became the
first tenant of what was then called the Stanford Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nuturing Entrepreneurs
</P>
<P>
   Though it wasn't obvious at the time, one of Terman's most
important achievements was encouraging two of his former students,
William R. Hewlett and David Packard, to build a business around
the audio oscillator they had developed. Terman even invested some
of his own money in the operation, which was launched in a Palo
Alto garage and incorporated on Jan. 1, 1939, as the
Hewlett-Packard Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to becoming the Bay Area's largest company, HP over
the last half century has trained thousands of engineers and
managers who went on to build other companies. And with the ``HP
Way'' _ a set of policies that include profit sharing, open doors
and ``management by wandering around'' _ it set the tone for the
future Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   By the outbreak of World War II, then, the foundations for the
eventual emergence of a major electronics industry here had been
laid. But it would be foolish to argue that the region's eventual
leadership was already cemented at that time. In the scale of its
industry and the sophistication of its research, the area still
lagged far behind main centers of the nation's electronics
industry, such as New Jersey and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Federal Telegraph had relocated most of its operations
to New Jersey in 1931, on the grounds that Palo Alto was too remote
from its key markets and sources of supplies and skilled labor _
precisely the obverse of the arguments that were to bring so many
technology companies to this area a few decades later.
</P>
<P>
   And while local electronics companies grew and prospered from
federal contracts during World War II, most of the government's
wartime funding for electronics research went elsewhere, especially
to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its spin-offs.
Even Terman himself, to contribute to the war effort, went east,
assuming the position of director of the Radio Research Laboratory
at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Stanford as dean of engineering in 1946, he
was very aware that he was going back to the minor leagues. As he
wrote at the time, ``Stanford emerged from World War II as an
underprivileged institution. It had not been significantly involved
in any of the exciting engineering and scientific activities
associated with the war.''
</P>
<P>
   To bring to this region the kind of dynamism that had so
impressed him about the Boston area, Terman redoubled his efforts
to foster and support local industry. The results included new
programs that allowed engineers at local companies to take graduate
courses at the campus, as well as the formation of the Stanford
Industrial (later Research) Park and the Stanford Research
Institute (later SRI International), founded in 1946 to do applied
and contract research.
</P>
<P>
   Terman's efforts produced some important results. In the 1950s
he persuaded Lockheed Aircraft to set up a lab in the industrial
park and then to move its Missiles and Space Division from Burbank
to Sunnyvale. In the era of the Cold War and the space race,
Lockheed was one of the area's largest high-tech employers. And
researchers at SRI generated a long series of breakthroughs in
computing and communications, including the invention of the mouse
and pioneering work in wireless networking.
</P>
<P>
   Another milestone was IBM's decision to set up a lab in the area
to develop new data-storage technologies. According to company
lore, it was originally planned for Palo Alto, but was finally
situated in San Jose's Almaden Valley because real estate in Palo
Alto was considered too expensive, even for a giant such as IBM!
</P>
<P>
   From the lab soon emerged the first hard drives and later the
floppy disk. Both through its own advances and through alumni such
as Al Shugart, who left the company to start Shugart Associates and
later Seagate Technologies, IBM's Almaden facility was a central
factor in establishing the Bay Area's continuing leadership in the
storage industry.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors helped make the Bay Area an increasingly
important technology center, but it was still far from being the
center. Through the 1950s and '60s, that distinction belonged to
the Route 128 belt outside Boston, with its scores of spin-offs
from MIT and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Fortuitous Homecoming
</P>
<P>
   If there's one event that can be said to have set the Bay Area
on course to overtake Boston, it was William Shockley's decision to
return to Palo Alto, his boyhood home, in 1956 and set up the
Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories there. In 1947, while working
at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, Shockley and two associates had
invented the transistor, the tiny switching devices that are the
foundation of modern high tech.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement won Shockley and his colleagues the Nobel Prize
for Physics in 1956, but he didn't succeed in convincing
Massachusetts' leading electronics manufacturer, Raytheon, to
support him in commercializing the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he won backing from Beckman Instruments, a Southern
California manufacturer of biomedical devices, to set up the Palo
Alto lab, for which he recruited a star-studded roster of young
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Shockley's high-handed management style _ including lie-detector
tests _ alienated most of his team, however. Only a year later,
eight of them, including Shockley's favorite, Robert Noyce,
abruptly resigned. An infuriated Shockley denounced them as ``the
traitorous eight.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from Arthur Rock, then the local representative of an
East Coast investment company, the eight secured funding from the
Fairchild Camera and Instrument Co. of Connecticut and set up shop
_ first in Palo Alto, then in Mountain View _ as Fairchild
Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   Under Fairchild's auspices, Noyce in 1959 developed what is
generally considered the first commercially practical integrated
circuit, a single chip containing multiple transistors and other
devices. (Jack S. Kilby of Texas Instruments in Dallas had produced
a different kind of integrated circuit the year before; most
consider him and Noyce co-inventors of the technology.)
</P>
<P>
   Fairchild Semiconductor went on to become an important defense
contractor, but it never lived up to the hopes of its founders _ in
part, it is said, because its remote parent company never really
understood the business. But in several ways, the company played a
critical role in the creation of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   First, its unofficial corporate culture was reportedly marked by
the freewheeling exchange of ideas, enthusiasm about technology's
potential and a tolerance for failure that was unheard of in most
of corporate America _ all hallmarks of the distinct culture that
eventually became identified with the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Second, restless Fairchild employees _ including the original
eight, all of whom had left by 1968, and scores of talented young
engineers they hired, trained and inspired _ went on to establish
dozens of other companies. These pioneers _ sometimes known as
``the Fairchildren'' _ carried with them not only cutting-edge
semiconductor technology, but also the company's distinct culture.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Intel Enters the Valley
</P>
<P>
   The most important of these Fairchild-spawned startups was
Intel, founded by Noyce and Gordon Moore in 1968. Even before the
fledgling company had a written business plan, Arthur Rock raised
$5 million for it in 30 minutes on the phone _ an episode that
lives on in Silicon Valley legend, even though larger deals now
occur almost hourly.
</P>
<P>
   Noyce and Moore, soon joined by the young Andrew Grove,
originally built their business around the manufacture of
semiconductor memory chips, a faster and cheaper alternative to the
cumbersome magnetic ``core memory'' technology then prevalent in
the growing mainframe computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Intel was primarily a memory-maker until the mid-1980s,
when it was forced to abandon the business and slash employment
after Japanese manufacturers entered the market with more efficient
production techniques and aggressive pricing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Intel, by then it had another fast-growing business:
building microprocessors, the programmable central processing chips
used in personal computers. IBM had selected one Intel
microprocessor model, the 8088, to power the original IBM PC. IBM's
design, copied by scores of clone manufacturers, quickly
established itself as the standard for business computing, and
Intel was soon selling tens of millions of microprocessors every
year.
</P>
<P>
   PARC Place
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers elsewhere in the area were gradually
working out other elements of the computer as we know it.
Pre-eminent among them was Douglas Engelbart, a former Ames
employee then working at the Stanford Research Institute. In a 1968
conference in San Francisco, Engelbart staged a legendary
demonstration (later called ``the mother of all demos'') of several
of his inventions: not only the first mouse, but also the first
display capable of combining text, graphics and video, and even
early implementations of what we now call hypertext and video
conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ideas were taken up at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC), a technology think tank set up in 1970. Over the
next 15 years, PARC employees generated a portfolio of innovations
probably unmatched in the history of technology by any other single
research center (with the possible exception of Thomas Edison's
labs in that other Menlo Park).
</P>
<P>
   Among PARC's achievements were such mainstays of modern
computing as the point-and-click graphical user interface (later
popularized by Apple's Macintosh and then Microsoft Windows),
Ethernet local-area networking, object-oriented programming
techniques, the laser printer and the PostScript imaging language.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox's failure to capitalize on PARC's innovations earned it a
permanent place in the business hall of shame, but countless other
local companies, including Apple, Adobe Systems and 3Com continue
to profit from its work.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1970s, Silicon Valley had evolved into an
extraordinary center of high-tech innovation, but it still wasn't
the leader in the growing computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   In that era, the cutting edge of computing was the minicomputer,
a refrigerator-size unit that generally cost in the tens of
thousands of dollars, low enough so universities and businesses
that couldn't afford a mainframe could acquire them. And virtually
all of the top minicomputer-makers _ Digital Equipment, Data
General, Prime, Wang and others _ were located in the Boston
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Route 128 and the prosperity its high-tech
companies generated (known then as ``the Massachusetts miracle'')
were almost as celebrated as Silicon Valley is today.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, however, Massachusetts' high-tech industry was in a
severe decline, while Silicon Valley continued to flourish _ even
after the Japanese takeover of the RAM market pushed this area's
semiconductor industry into crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this reversal of fortunes can be explained by
epochal changes in the evolution of computing technology _
specifically, the rise of the workstation (powerful desktop
machines used mainly by engineers and scientists) and of the
personal computer, and the corresponding decline of the
minicomputer.
</P>
<P>
   Although some East Coast companies became players in the
workstation market, the emerging industry was dominated by Bay Area
businesses: HP, Sun Microsystems (established in 1982 to market
machines based on a design by Stanford graduate student Andreas
Bechtolsheim, which he called ``SUN'' for ``Stanford University
Network'') and Silicon Graphics (also founded in 1982, to
commercialize a graphics processing chip developed by Jim Clark,
then a Stanford professor).
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area also played a central role in the emergence of the
personal computer. The Homebrew Computer Club, a pioneering group
of personal-computing enthusiasts, began meeting in a Menlo Park
garage in 1975. Within months, its monthly sessions were drawing
overflow crowds from all over the region, and it had to relocate to
a large auditorium at the Stanford Linear Acceleration Center.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the club's meetings were marked by the selfless
sharing of ideas and innovations (and software), a countercultural
opposition to the old order of computing (where ``high priests'' in
the ``glass houses'' where mainframes and minis were located
controlled access and limited innovation) and a determination
(influenced in part by New Left ideas prevalent on campus then) to
use technology to build new forms of community and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While many important pioneers in the personal computer market
sprang up in the Bay Area _ including IMSAI of San Leandro, North
Star of Berkeley and later Hayward's Osborne Computers _ nearly all
of them have long since been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Only Apple, founded on April Fool's Day 1976 by Homebrew members
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, survived to become a major player
when the personal computer entered the mainstream in the 1980s.
Though its history has been tumultuous, the company has retained a
loyal following and remained an important source of innovation,
especially in making technology easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of the IBM PC in 1981 and the ``IBM clone''
market in subsequent years, production and distribution of the
standardized machines came to be concentrated in areas where costs
were lower, such as Texas, North Carolina and even North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Bay Area companies benefited handsomely from the PC
revolution. Intel, of course, made most of the microprocessors that
powered the new machines, while Advanced Micro Devices carved out a
smaller role as a second source of x86-compatible chips. The area's
smaller semiconductor-makers cranked out graphics processors,
peripheral controllers and the slew of other chips required to
build a fully functional PC.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-drive manufacturers such as Seagate, Conner Peripherals,
Quantum, Maxtor and even IBM battled ferociously _ often at the
expense of profits _ to increase storage capacity and market share.
While HP, with its focus on more-powerful business systems, stayed
out of the PC market itself in the early years, its introduction of
both inkjet and laser printers in 1984 gave it a commanding lead in
the lucrative printer and printer-supply market. (In the 1990s HP
made itself a leader in PC sales, too.)
</P>
<P>
   And during the past 15 years, with the emergence of local-area
networking, followed by the Internet and voice-data integration,
Cisco Systems, 3Com and other local networking companies have
joined the ranks of the giants.
</P>
<P>
   Networking for Success
</P>
<P>
   While the Bay Area's rise to undisputed pre-eminence in high
tech coincided with the rise of the PC and the workstation and the
decline of the mini, hardware evolution alone doesn't explain the
shift in power from Massachusetts to Northern California; it merely
begs the question of why the Bay Area was able to adapt so quickly
and successfully to the new technologies, while the Bay State was
not.
</P>
<P>
   That question is confronted directly in an influential book
called ``Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon
Valley and Route 128'' by AnnaLee Saxenian, a Massachusetts native
who now teaches at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Saxenian undertook the study in the 1980s, she said in an
interview, to try to understand why events had disproved the dire
predictions she made about Silicon Valley in a late 1970s master's
thesis. Saxenian had predicted that high costs and inadequate
infrastructure would soon bring the area's growth to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The answer she came up with, now widely accepted among other
authorities, is that the Bay Area had evolved a unique culture and
economic framework, one that gave it an unmatched ability to adapt
to and profit from fast-changing technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In that model, which she called a ``regional network-based
industrial system,'' technology leaders forgo the traditional goal
of vertical integration _ producing as many of their own components
as possible _ in favor of relying on a dense network of specialist
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Associated with that industrial model are such attributes as
open labor markets, marked by frequent job hopping; relatively
unimpeded exchange of ideas and techniques, through both formal
organizations and informal personal ties, even across company
lines; flattened corporate structures, with decision making largely
in the hands of individual product teams and engineering groups;
and a strong focus on innovation and risk taking and a concomitant
tolerance of failure.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it depends on an infrastructure of educational
institutions, technology consultants, contract manufacturers, law
firms, venture capitalists and even public-relations specialists
that consider their fortunes tied up not with any one company, but
with the economy of the valley as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It's this dynamic, self-reinforcing model, Saxenian argues, that
really explains the Bay Area's emergence over the past quarter
century as the undisputed leader of the high-tech revolution. It
explains why ambitious entrepreneurs and engineers keep pouring
into the region, and why so many firms with roots elsewhere feel
compelled to establish branches here, in spite of the area's
astonishing costs and jammed highways.
</P>
<P>
   And it explains why the region's high-tech economy has been so
resilient in the wake of setbacks like the collapse of the memory
market in the 1980s and so quick to capitalize on new technologies
and new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this model and the associated culture, Saxenian argues,
have enabled Silicon Valley to extend its leadership to a steady
stream of derivative markets _ multimedia, gaming and personal
digital assistants, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it explains why Silicon Valley has led the Internet
explosion of the 1990s, an economic revolution whose significance
extends far beyond the area's traditional silicon, hardware and
software industries. Indeed, Saxenian notes, ``dot-com'' startups
are overwhelmingly concentrated here, even though they could by
definition locate themselves anywhere, and in most cases they have
no direct dependence on the valley's older high-tech industries.

   NASHVILLE _ The Tennessee Titans had won 11 games in a variety
of ways. They had won with ruthless running from Eddie George. They
had breezed to victory by unleashing the rookie Pro Bowl end Jevon
Kearse. The snappy cornerback Samari Rolle had produced
game-winning plays. They had won with sparkling special teams.

</P>
<P>
   What about Steve McNair?
</P>
<P>
   Critics called him the Titans' weak link, a runner more than a
passer. They wanted Neil O'Donnell, who replaced an injured McNair
for five starts early in the season, to become the permanent
starter. Entering Sunday's clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars,
O'Donnell in 172 passes had tossed eight touchdowns. McNair in 287
passes had tossed six.
</P>
<P>
   McNair had heard enough. So had the Titans' coaches.
</P>
<P>
   McNair took a game plan designed to feature his arm and whipped
the ball around Adelphia Coliseum with extra style and amazing
punch Sunday. He threw five touchdown passes _ of 4, 62, 2, 65 and
13 yards _ electrified the crowd of 66,641 and mystified the
Jaguars in a 41-14 victory over what had been a glowing bunch that
owned the National Football League's best record. A team that had
lost only one game.
</P>
<P>
   That one, too, was to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tennessee (12-3) can topple Jacksonville (13-2) in the chase
for the American Football Conference Central title if it finishes
the regular season next week with a victory at Pittsburgh and
Jacksonville loses at home to Cincinnati. Tennessee can win the
home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs if it wins and
both Jacksonville and Indianapolis lose next week.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's victory, Tennessee insured it would be the host of
at least one playoff game and finished unbeaten at home (8-0) for
the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   McNair completed 23 of 33 passes for 291 yards, did not throw an
interception and connected with eight receivers. Each of his
scoring tosses was to a different receiver. He left the game late
in the third quarter proud and pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell exited before
halftime, having sprained his left knee. The Jaguars expect him to
miss some practice and maybe even the finale against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring the heat on me, the more I want to respond,''
McNair said. ``Of course, I felt the pressure and the talk. But
people don't realize the style of ball we play. We can win a lot of
different ways and, all year, we have. Today we decided to pass the
ball first. I decided to do something with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville had won 11 straight games, its last loss having
been to Tennessee in Jacksonville on Sept. 26, by 20-19. This one
was much uglier for the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us to the punch; they answered the bell,'' Jaguars
offensive tackle Tony Boselli said. ``They blew us out. Any time
you get whipped like that, it's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars safety Carnell Lake said: ``They threw us off balance.
We have lost twice to these guys, so we've got to really take a
look at this and figure out what is going on, hopefully make some
changes and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tom Coughlin, the Jaguars' coach, said: ``I don't have any
great explanations for this. One team came to play and one team
didn't. Once it started to slip, it looked like it was not the type
of effort we are accustomed to getting. I take my hat off to
Tennessee. They played extremely well. They controlled the game
from the outset. They were never in doubt, never challenged, and
I'm very disappointed in that. It concerns me greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee began the game with a drive from its 22. Thirteen
plays and nearly eight minutes later the Titans had scored when
McNair rolled right and passed 4 yards to tight end Michael Roan.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on. An extraordinary McNair passing display was in
gear.
</P>
<P>
   And there was help everywhere. George rushed for 102 yards.
Tight end Frank Wycheck caught a team-high nine passes. Rolle
intercepted three passes. The Titans limited Jacksonville to 65
rushing yards and running back Fred Taylor to 44, and won in first
downs, 26-16, and in total yards, 476-237. The Titans gained four
sacks, but neither McNair nor O'Donnell, who finished the game
while McNair was rested, was sacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has had a lot of heat on him since Day 1,'' Titans
cornerback Anthony Dorsett said. ``People need to realize that
Steve is the quarterback of this team. He doesn't have to throw
touchdown passes for us to win. We have a team that tries to win
the way the coaches ask us to play, whether it is in the running
game first or special teams or whatever. We've beaten the Rams and
we've beaten Jacksonville twice. They are supposed to be two of the
top teams. What more at this point could you want?''
</P>
<P>
   George said he recognized McNair's determination from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet, focused _ he looked ticked off,'' George said.
``He just came out today and showed off. We're breaking out of that
mold of being a one-dimensional team. We've established something.
We've proved something.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's nickname is Air McNair. Some began calling him Dare
McNair. Play the run. Make McNair pass. Watch the mistakes, the
lack of production. But Sunday McNair shredded that concept _ and
the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve does what we ask him to do,'' said Jeff Fisher, the
Titans' coach. ``He can run for 62 yards and score. He can throw
for 62 and score. Today we asked him to throw it and he did, with
style against a really good football team. We've got some things
going.''

   SURGE COULD SEND PROSPECTORS SEARCHING FOR MOTHER LODE &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Suddenly, biotech is hot, so hot that investors are bidding up
shares of new offerings and private startups are queuing up to go
public while the IPO window is open.
<P>
   As recently as this summer, when the Amex Biotech Stock Index
languished around 200, industry watchers fretted that Wall Street's
fascination with dot-anything would create a capital drought that
would make biotech extinct.
</P>
<P>
   But since November, that same index, which includes Immunex,
Biogen and Amgen, has climbed above 350.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the phenomenal reception of December IPOs like Maxygen,
a Redwood City firm with a technique for making stronger vaccines
and enzymes by swapping parts between genes, and Caliper
Technologies, a Mountain View company that makes chips to automate
lab tests.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen stock is up 300 percent since its launch, while Caliper
is up 200 percent. Three other firms are on the verge of going
public, including Diversa, a San Diego firm with a gene-shuffling
story similar to Maxygen's.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a flood of other offerings around the time the investing
community gathers in San Francisco for the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist _
oops, make that the Chase H&AMP;Q _ life sciences conference in early
January.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent edition of the San Carlos' BioCentury newsletter
listed 23 private firms with the venture backing and ambition to go
public soon. The list included Aclara Biosciences in Mountain View,
which has a lab-on-a-chip story nearly identical to Caliper's.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco biotech banker Steve Burrill said the
fastest-moving biotech issues are those that fall into the
tool-making or genomics category. Caliper, for instance, sells
chips that make for faster lab experiments. If biomedical research
is the equivalent of a Gold Rush, Caliper is among a class of
companies selling picks, pans and shovels.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics companies sell prospectors (i.e., big drug and biotech
firms) maps of the human genome that disclose the most promising
places to dig for the cures to a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Burrill said Wall Street is bidding up the stocks of genomics
companies, such as Incyte Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto, Human
Genome Sciences of Maryland and Millennium Pharmaceuticals of
Massachusetts, on the theory that gene maps will lead to pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a massive increase in valuations for all the
companies that are perceived as making drug discovery more
efficient,'' Burrill said.
</P>
<P>
   While I was in the Boston area a few weeks ago, I heard
Millennium CEO Mark Levin, a veteran of several Bay Area biotech
firms starting with Genentech, give his spiel for the value of
genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Levin crossed his hands in the air to make an ``X.'' The rising
slope indicated the amounts _ starting at $20 billion in 1988 and
passing $35 billion in 1998 _ that drug and biotech firms worldwide
were spending to discover new remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The falling slope represented the fact that, in the same 10-year
period, the number of novel drug candidates being discovered had
actually fallen _ from 60 per year in 1988 to under 25 by the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Millennium's stock price, Wall Street has bought
Levin's argument that companies like his, which use genome maps to
focus their discovery efforts, will eventually prove to be the
luckiest bets.
</P>
<P>
   So there seems to be no arguing that, for the near term, the
sheen is back on biotech, especially the segment of the industry
that can tell a persuasive tool-kit or genomics story.
</P>
<P>
   But having been one of the Chicken Little pundits who wrote,
accurately enough at the time, that the sky was falling on biotech
earlier this year, I am hesitant to proclaim that happy days are
here again, because happy days don't necessarily last many
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a small investor who hasn't invested in biotech
before, chances are if you jump in now, you'll get stung when the
air comes out of some of these stocks. It's not that the tool-kit
and genomics theories are wrong; it's just that drug discovery is a
five- to 10-year process, and over that long a period, the stock
charts of most of these firms look like mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're willing to do a lot of homework on a complex
industry, there's little doubt that the demographics favor this
industry. Over the long term, aging Baby Boomers will be the drug
industry's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make a New Year's resolution, determine to bone
up on your biology, and use your common sense, and we'll have some
fun next year panning for some golden opportunities amid the
glitter of all that iron pyrLTp/;H8n

HORRY REDISCOVERS SHOOTING TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has made it clear that, on a team with
Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice, there isn't much need
for a lot of scoring from the Lakers' power forwards.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he's been perplexed by Robert Horry's penchant for
passing up wide-open jumpers. ``He's a much better offensive player
than he's (shown),'' Jackson said last week. ``I think he's kind of
lost his lust for scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that lust renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Horry turned in his best offensive game of the season Saturday,
playing a key role in the Lakers' victory over the San Antonio
Spurs. Horry converted 4 of 6 field-goal attempts and made all four
of his free throws for a season-high 12 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jackson) has been really harping on me to shoot the ball when
I'm open,'' Horry said. ``They've been kind of saying it on the sly
in practice -- they've been saying, `It's OK, shoot that shot,
you're open, shoot it.' Now that I know I've got their permission,
it's a lot easier to shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A career 34 percent 3-point shooter, Horry has attempted just 14
this season, despite ample opportunities. A scorer in his early
years, Horry was averaging just 3.9 field-goal attempts and 4.0
points per game entering Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the best threesome out there scoring and we've been
winning,'' Horry said, ``so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's focused on the little things that have made him an
asset off the bench. On Saturday, he netted five rebounds, two
steals, a blocked shot and an assist in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert had another real good game,'' Jackson said, ``and he
had points to go with it, too. I thought it was important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   If Horry continues to hit the open jumpers, it will be that much
more difficult for opposing defenses to sag off him to double-team
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes to me, I'm going to take it,'' he said. ``Other
than that, I'm not going to go out there and look for my shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild, but good: Bryant's 18-point effort Saturday had its rough
spots, particularly in a 2-for-7 first half and in several
ill-advised forays into the paint, into the arms of Tim Duncan and
David Robinson. But Jackson, who has been critical at times of
Bryant's decision-making, liked most of what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all disappointed, I'm almost gratified at some
times that he is as impetuous as he is at times,'' Jackson said.
``He's such a mature kid, and to show some immaturity out there on
the basketball court is I don't think unusual or out of character
for a kid his age (21).''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: To make room for Travis Knight on the roster
Saturday, the Lakers sent rookie guard John Celestand to the
injured list for the second time this season, with a case of knee
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Celestand played sparingly in the month he was active, playing
in 12 games, averaging 2.1 points in 10.2 minutes. But he's likely
to get another opportunity later this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing really well,'' Jackson said. ``John's improved, I
think, dramatically since training camp and has come along really
well.''

COMMENTARY: A WHITEWASH IN ALBANY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justice in the Diallo case?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know the real reason the case was yanked out of
the Bronx and shipped 150 miles north to Albany, N.Y, consider
these facts. Of the criminal defendants who go to trial in Albany
County, 90 percent are convicted. But when the criminal defendants
who go to trial are police officers, approximately 100 percent are
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The cops who killed Amadou Diallo could not have found a
friendlier place than Albany if they had been allowed to pick the
venue themselves. And forget the self-serving garbage from the
Appellate Division judges about their attempt to find a locale with
a ``reasonable degree of ethnic diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is this: An all-white panel of five judges, one of
whom is a crony of the lawyer for one of the accused cops, took the
case out of the Bronx (and out of the hands of a black judge) and
sent it to a place where  &UR; all  &LR; the judges and nearly all of the
potential jurors are white.
</P>
<P>
   The judges knew what they were doing and they did it well. They
went out of their way to give the accused their best chance of an
acquittal, and to deliberately exclude blacks from participation in
a case that is of profound interest to black New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Lewis B. Oliver Jr., who has practiced law in Albany
County for many years, if he could recall a single case in which a
police officer went to trial and was convicted. There was a long,
long pause. I waited. Finally, Oliver, who is white, said, ``No,
but I'm not an encyclopedic source on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March a jury in Albany acquitted two cops who were accused
of assaulting a college student named Jermaine Henderson. According
to the indictment, the cops took Henderson into a police garage
and, while he was handcuffed, severely beat and kicked him. The
courtroom was jammed with police officers during the trial, and the
accused cops were cheered when the verdict came in.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Grace of The Albany Times Union covered the trial. She
wrote: ``All members of the jury, like the police officers, are
white. Henderson is black.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the venue into which the Diallo case has been moved.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jack Lester, a lawyer in Manhattan who previously
practiced in Albany, how difficult he thought it would be to get a
conviction against a cop on trial in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Difficult is the wrong word,'' he said. ``The word should be
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm not saying the Diallo police officers should be
convicted. From what I heard, the officers at the scene who fired
the shots were very remorseful about what happened. But in Albany,
it's a guaranteed acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is not that the Diallo case was taken out of
the Bronx. A change of venue might well have been appropriate. And
wherever these four officers were tried, it is likely they would
not be convicted of murder. I have called the killing of Diallo
cold-blooded, reckless and wrong. But I don't believe that under
the law it rises to the level of murder.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the five Appellate Division judges who
ordered the change of venue went out of their way to shift the case
to an almost lily-white comfort zone for the officers. The judges
stomped all over the appearance of fairness when they deliberately
placed the case out of the reach of black New Yorkers, who the
judges seem to feel are by reason of their color incapable of
considering the evidence in the case and rendering a fair verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that 9 percent of the nearly
300,000 residents of Albany County are black. But that percentage
of the population is not reflected in the pool of potential jurors.
Only a tiny percentage of the men and women available to serve as
jurors are black _ and the judges of the Appellate Division know
that as well as anyone in the state.
</P>
<P>
   If they wanted to move the trial out of the Bronx, fine. But
don't tell me these cops couldn't get a fair trial in an integrated
venue in another part of the city, or in Westchester or Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Kindlon is a longtime Albany lawyer who agreed with the
appellate court's decision and believes the officers will get a
fair trial in Albany. But he sounded as if he was speaking more
from faith than experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any black jurors, it's going to be surprising to
me,'' he said. And he acknowledged, ``In the cases here in which
officers have been accused, they've generally been acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``Almost always been acquitted.'' (BOX)

STANDOFF ON HIJACKED JET IS TANGLED IN INDIA-PAKISTAN FEUD
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hijacked Indian jetliner with 155 hostages on board remained
in a perilous limbo on a tarmac in Afghanistan Sunday as efforts to
end the crisis on its third day bogged down in a swirl of
recriminations and charges that seemed to reprise the bitter,
decades-old feud between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan accused India of staging the hijacking. India hinted
that Pakistan might be behind it. Officials of the Taliban, who
control most of Afghanistan, said they would not negotiate with the
hijackers. And while Russia called for a meeting of the U.N.
Security Council, India signaled that it did not want international
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, a senior diplomatic official told Reuters
that Indian representatives would soon be sent to Kandahar, in
southern Afghanistan, where the plane was on the ground. But the
official refused to say whether the envoys would try to negotiate
with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff continued, with hijackers threatening to blow up
the Indian Airlines A300 Airbus and Taliban soldiers surrounding it
at a remote airfield, there were no negotiations Sunday over the
captors' demands for the release from Indian jails of a Pakistani
Islamic cleric, Maulana Masood Azhar, and several men described as
fighters for Kashmiri independence from Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official in Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, spoke for an hour
by radio to the hijackers Sunday, but succeeded in obtaining the
release of only one passenger. The hostage, an Indian man suffering
from diabetes and needing medical treatment, was freed in what the
hijackers called a ``goodwill gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, who are known to have killed one hostage, had
released 27 other passengers _ women, children and elderly men _ in
a stopover in the United Arab Emirates on Friday, leaving 155
hostages at the mercy of what were believed to be five captors
armed with pistols, grenades and knives.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking odyssey began Friday on a flight from Katmandu,
Nepal, to New Delhi, and took the plane across India, Pakistan,
Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf before settling for the weekend in
Kandahar. It has reopened old wounds between India and Pakistan,
which have fought three wars since the Asian subcontinent gained
independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over the divided
Himalayan state of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pakistan and India both condemned this hijacking
and all acts of terrorism. Sunday, each was pointing a finger of
accusation at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, suggested that
India's secret intelligence service had staged the hijacking as
part of an effort to malign Pakistan's new military government. He
charged that since Oct. 12, when the army ousted Pakistan's elected
government, India has tried to isolate Pakistan's new government
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they're disappointed at the failure of their
efforts,'' The Associated Press reported Sattar as saying.
``Perhaps the government of India manufactured another incident in
pursuit of their aim of maligning Pakistan internationally. The
possibility can no longer be ignored that the incident involves a
preconceived design by a foreign intelligence organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi, an Indian official hinted that Pakistan might be
responsible because, he said, the hijackers had originated in
Pakistan and they and other militants have repeatedly sought the
release of Azhar, who has been in an Indian jail since 1994 for
encouraging a separatist revolt in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, was noncommittal in
response to questions at a news conference about the possibility of
negotiations and about the hijackers' demands. ``It's not a
yes-or-no answer to which I can address myself,'' The Associated
Press reported him as saying. ``I will exercise all options toward
the aim of ensuring the well-being of passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also insisted that the hijackers had arrived in Nepal on
Friday aboard a Pakistan International Airlines flight from the
southern Pakistani city of Karachi _ an assertion that Pakistani
officials denied. And Singh noted pointedly that the hijackers and
other militants had sought the release of Azhar.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim secessionists have waged a long insurgency in the
Indian-held portion of Kashmir, demanding either independence or
union with Islamic Pakistan. Azhar went to India in 1992 to join
the struggle and was arrested two years later. His group, Harakat
ul-Mujahedeen, formerly called, Harakat ul-Ansar, kidnapped six
Western tourists in 1995 in an unsuccessful attempt to win the
release of Azhar and other jailed insurgents; last October, the
group claimed responsibility for a grenade that killed three people
in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   On the tarmac in Kandahar, the shades of the plane were down
Monday morning, the engines were running and the hostages were
reported to be suffering in deterioriating conditions, with the air
on board hot and fetid and many people sick, Mohammed Khiber, a
civil aviation official, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Russia's first deputy ambassador, Gennady
Gatilov, was quoted by the Russian news agency Tass as urging that
a special session of the Security Council be held, perhaps Monday,
on the hijacking, which he called a ``dangerous situation for the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior U.N. official said India did not want international
mediation.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian forces have advanced deep into the Chechen
capital of Grozny in a major offensive to take the city and deal
separatist rebels a decisive blow, the government said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian units reportedly were close to the city center and
conducting house-to-house searches for rebel fighters in parts of
the capital. A pro-Russian Chechen commander promised to raise the
Russian flag over Grozny before the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the balance was the fate of up to 42,000 civilians
trapped in Grozny without heat, electricity, or running water.
Russia had been encouraging them to leave via several ``safe
corridors'' the army claimed to have set up, but on Friday Moscow's
envoy to Chechnya said civilians should wait in their basement
shelters for Russian troops to liberate them.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces announced their offensive Saturday, as special
forces troops and pro-Moscow Chechen militia entered the city on
four sides, supported by heavy artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters trying to leave the embattled city had been
stopped with ``a barrage of fire,'' according to a statement by
Russia's defense ministry reported by Russian news agencies. The
military made no mention of what was happening to civilians who try
to escape the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, talks between Russian and Chechen representatives on the
fate of civilians produced no workable plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few days, there will be nobody to evacuate,'' Interfax
quoted a Chechen military commander, Isa Munayev.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the city would provide a powerful moral victory for
the Russian military, which was humiliated and battered in a
1994-96 campaign against the Chechen separatists. Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin hopes to parlay his leadership of the
current campaign in Chechnya into a win in the presidential
election in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior Russian commander in Chechnya played down the
scale and pace of the battle for Grozny, in an apparent attempt to
avoid comparisons with their disastrous attempt to take the city by
storm five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing terrible is happening in Grozny, it is just a
continuation of the operation for liberating the city of bandits,''
General Victor Kazantsev told Russian news agencies, using Moscow's
term for the separatists. Kazantsev added that the ``most
important'' part of the operation is ``to save lives of civilians
and soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks captured the methodical approach Kazantsev has
sought to portray throughout the three-month campaign in Chechnya.
While the Russian onslaught has often seemed heavy-handed and
indiscriminate, the tactic of pounding rebel-held areas into
submission has allowed the army to occupy much of Chechnya while
claiming to have suffered minimal casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Sunday how easy the victory in Grozny will be.
The rebels say they can hold out for months in Grozny's vast
network of underground passages and Soviet-era bombshelters.
</P>
<P>
   For civilians in Grozny the situation is dire. Most appear to be
elderly people with nowhere to go, or no way to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sick of this _ since the first war we have been
suffering and we are still suffering to this day,'' said one
elderly Chechen woman in footage from the city shown on Russian NTV
television.
</P>
<P>
   The footage showed devastated and nearly abandoned streets and
confident, well-armed rebel fighters who move about at night with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-Moscow Chechen leader, Beslan Gantamirov, Sunday claimed
that his force of 800 fighters had reached a strategic square just
outside Grozny's center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conducting a cleanup of the city, checking all homes
and basements where rebels could hide,'' Gantamirov, a convicted
embezzler who was released from prison to lead the loyalist army,
told Interfax. The agency said Gantamirov had promised to raise the
Russian flag over Grozny ``in the next few days, before the new
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But a prominent rebel commander, Shamil Basayev, dismissed
Gantamirov's force.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fighters are all criminals like him. They are not fighting
for ideals, they are only fighting for money,'' the Associated
Press quoted Basayev Sunday from one of his basement hideouts in
Grozny. ``I will fight the Russian Army or anybody sent in by the
Russians, even Chechens.''
</P>
<P>
   Basayev also brushed off the prospect of peace talks: ``With
Russians it's impossible to make a deal; only fighting works.''
</P>
<P>
   Basayev led an incursion into the Russian region of Dagestan in
August. That prompted Russia to send a 100,000-strong force into
Chechnya. The Kremlin also blames the rebels for a series of deadly
apartment bombings in September, a charge Basayev has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they give up Grozny, the rebel fighters say they can
retreat to the mountain gorges in southern Chechnya, although
Russia has been bombing and mining the gorges for months.
</P>
<P>
   Large groups of refugees from mountainous villages were moving
along the Argun Gorge to the northern lowlands to escape the
bombings, the office of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said
Sunday.

FOR WORRIERS, WINDING DOWN ON YEAR 2000
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Wis., Utah)  (rk)

<P>
   They have devoted months and sometimes years to raising
consciousness about potential year 2000 computer disruptions. Now,
many of the most prominent worriers are folding their tents.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Golter and his fellow advocates at the Northern Virginia
Year 2000 Community Action Group wrapped up their group efforts
with a ``New Year's Eve'' party on Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, the Canadian programmer who became a year 2000
Paul Revere in 1993, said he would be on the interview circuit
through next weekend. But Year2000.com, the popular Internet site
he set up with the Tenagra Corp., is already on the auction block
at eBay.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crusade part of this is just about over,'' said Edward
Yardeni, a Wall Street economist who still believes there is a 70
percent chance that year 2000 breakdowns will usher in a worldwide
recession. ``Now it's just a matter of what happens. There's no
point in being alarmist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, it is time to send in the clowns. As the
rollover approaches, enough people are paying attention for
comedians to shift into full gear. Dde Jager can hope the rising
urge to laugh at year 2000 may help sales of one of his sideline
ventures, a year 2000 cartoon book called ``The Bug Stops Here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the field is getting crowded, mostly with survival tips that
run the gamut from wry to lewd.
</P>
<P>
   The Onion, a Madison, Wis., satirical newspaper, suggested,
among other things, in its Dec. 15 issue: ``Develop the ability to
convert sunlight into energy using the chlorophyll in your body.''
The paper, viewable at www.onion.com, also advises: ``If disaster
strikes, it's God's wrath _ quote the Old Testament. But if nothing
happens, God is merciful _ quote the New Testament.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro RSCG/DSW Partners, a Salt Lake City-based advertising firm
that is a unit of Havas Advertising, has been distributing ``31
Ways to Prepare for Y2K,'' a December calendar pamphlet with one
suggestion a day. For Dec. 11, the suggestion was ``Have plenty of
clean towels. It's not specific to any millennial disaster but when
have you ever not needed clean towels?''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, DSW suggested collecting spoons because, ``Right
now spoons are everywhere but after January 1, who knows?''

STRICT NEW RULES MUDDY PLANS FOR GAS PIPELINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ Freed by deregulation and the demise of
utility monopolies, pipeline companies are seeking to build two
major new lines to open the New York-New Jersey market to vast
reserves of natural gas from western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the pipelines will enable more independent
gas-marketing companies to enter the market, encourage competition
and cost cutting, and lead to lower gas bills for homeowners,
offices and industries.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the fate of the two big proposed projects and their
impact on deregulated sales in the metropolitan region are
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proposed projects would stretch from a major
natural-gas hub in Chicago through Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
into New Jersey, cutting through 33 New Jersey towns in 10
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The other would link the Chicago hub to New York state and run
from Canada under Lake Erie and then east along New York's Southern
Tier, through Orange, Rockland and Westchester counties, ending in
Mount Vernon and Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline companies proposing both want them built and
operating by next November to coincide with the completion of a
pipeline that will bring 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas a day from
the Canadian Rockies to the Chicago hub. Each of the proposed lines
is intended to carry about half that volume _ 700 million cubic
feet a day _ to markets in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But completion dates of late next year seem too ambitious now.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which
grants permits for new pipelines, imposed stiff environmental and
marketing conditions on the proposed Chicago-to-New-Jersey line.
Elated opponents of the line predicted that the new requirements
would delay construction and possibly doom the project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed line ending in Westchester County is not as far
along in the review process. The regulatory commission is still
preparing a final environmental-impact statement on the project. It
is unclear when the agency will schedule a vote on a construction
permit for it.
</P>
<P>
   The political climate surrounding each line is sharply
different. Opposition is deep in New Jersey. An unusual bipartisan
coalition has denounced the Chicago-to-New-Jersey project, calling
it speculative and unnecessary, a risk to public safety and a
threat to preserved open spaces and sensitive wetlands that the
pipeline would cross.
</P>
<P>
   Foes include Gov. Christie Whitman; both New Jersey senators,
Frank Lautenberg and Robert Torricelli; the state's congressional
delegation; the state Legislature; and the hundreds of local
officials and residents in the 33 towns.
</P>
<P>
   New York's political and government hierarchy has been far less
strident about the proposed pipe between Lake Erie and Westchester.
Landowners and residents along its route, particularly in Orange
and Rockland counties, oppose it on safety and environmental
grounds, including the proposed line's proximity to the
earthquake-prone Ramapo fault.
</P>
<P>
   But the local complaints have not inspired any broad-based
criticism. Unlike Whitman in New Jersey, Gov. George Pataki has
been silent on the project.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The regulatory agency in each state that oversees utilities and
deregulated sales of natural gas also views the respective projects
differently. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities says the
state does not currently need any of the new gas from the proposed
Chicago-to-New-Jersey line. Deregulation of all residential natural
gas will begin in New Jersey on Jan. 1. But a board spokesman, Eric
Hartsfeld, said that existing supplies were expected to be
sufficient for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's gas-deregulation law requires an open and
competitive market providing users with a choice of gas merchants.
But the law does not require a cut in gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board hopes introducing competition will lower rates,''
Hartsfeld said. ``But no one can guarantee anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's regulatory counterpart in New York, the Public
Service Commission, says new gas pipelines are needed for growth in
demand in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   David Flanagan, a commission spokesman, said the agency had not
taken a position favoring one proposed line over the other. But in
the next decade, Flanagan said, existing pipelines will not have
enough space to carry the extra gas needed for increased demand,
for conversion of homes from oil to gas furnaces, and for several
new gas-fired electrical generating stations.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan declined to comment on the possibility that the
Chicago-to-New-Jersey line would never be built and the effect that
could have on deregulation in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-to-New-Jersey project is proposed by the New York
region's biggest single gas supplier, Transcontinental Gas Pipe
Line Corp., of Houston, along with ANR Pipeline Co., of Detroit,
and a subsidiary they have formed called Independence Pipeline Co.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed line across New York state, called the Millennium
Pipeline, is a joint venture of Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., of
Charleston, W.Va., and companies building the big trans-Canada
pipeline from the Canadian Rockies to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-to-New-Jersey line ran afoul of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission on Dec. 15 on marketing and environmental
issues. Against the backdrop of New Jersey's chorus of complaint
about the lack of a proven market, the commission criticized
Transco and ANR for not having enough customers for the line's
sections in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the transmission space on the line was bought by a
subsidiary of the companies. The commission said it would not allow
construction until companies that are not affiliated with Transco
and ANR sign binding contracts for half the transmission space.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental restrictions the commission imposed included a $3
million bond to pay for any damage during construction and a ban on
the building of any piece of the line until all state permits are
issued for the entire project. Previously, the commission permitted
piecemeal construction once permits for different segments were
obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Foes predicted that the edict on permits would delay
construction for months. Cuba Wadlington Jr., chief operating
officer of Transco, denounced the condition as unprecedented. But
he said Transco would press ahead with the project.

<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ ``Placid'' sometimes seems too agitated a word
for this self-satisfied city of 135,000 in the heart of Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine is the United States' largest master-planned community, a
city with just the right number of curves in its roads, just the
right mix of single-family and multiple-family housing, auto
dealers and churches, carved out of strawberry and tomato fields on
a billiard-table-smooth parcel of land. It is as calm as Los
Angeles, the messy metropolis just to the north, is tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   One of Irvine's few long-term irritants had been the adjacent
and enormous El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, where F-18s were
screaming reminders of a troubled outside world that many people
had moved here to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   So it might have seemed a time for joy when the Pentagon
announced a few years ago that with the end of the Cold War, it was
going to close the base.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out that way. The Pentagon's decision has
triggered not a celebration but a new kind of Cold War that has
divided the county, north from south.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether to build an international airport on El
Toro's 4,738 acres, a plan supported by the older, more ethnically
mixed suburbs to the north, or to use the land for parks, schools
and other public amenities, as Irvine and the neighboring, mostly
new cities to the south are urging.
</P>
<P>
   The base is near the center of the county, but the flight paths,
and expected auto traffic, would generally affect the southern end
far more. And that has inspired much of the ire.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying debate, however, also has a lot to do with the
sometimes jarring contrast between the heavily Republican retreat
that Orange County was _ focused heavily on its quality of life _
with the economically booming and increasingly ethnically diverse
bastion of the ``new economy'' that it has become.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful subtext to this battle has left the cities here so
bitterly divided that some experts worry that the standoff could
obstruct efforts to tackle other regional issues, such as
affordable housing, transportation and education.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County, which long defined itself as the not-Los Angeles
of Southern California, has emerged as a booming high-technology
metropolis that instead of sending commuters out to jobs elsewhere,
draws tens of thousands of commuters from surrounding regions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it has been the destination of so many immigrants that it
is on the verge of becoming, like Los Angeles, a place without a
white majority, a striking shift from its past as a nearly
all-white bedroom community.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the battle over El Toro is as much as anything a
highly revealing distraction from the real issues the county must
confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main point is that there's a lot of denial in Orange
County about what they're becoming,'' said Mark Baldassare, a
senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California and the
author of an annual survey of attitudes in the county and its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of this county does not depend on whether they
build this airport,'' Baldassare said. ``The biggest threat to
Orange County's future is the conflict over the airport and what it
is doing to the political climate, not the airport itself.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a small air facility, John Wayne Airport, at the
northern end of the county. It is so limited in its commercial
service, however, that most residents must drive to Los Angeles, up
to two hours in heavy traffic, to travel.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of greater convenience has given some momentum to
the forces that support an airport at El Toro. Two ballot measures
backing an airport have passed, with a third scheduled for this
March, even though there is still no detailed proposal or cost
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But the predictable fusillades of litigation have started, and
both sides have resolved to fight in court as long as necessary.
Irvine's city hall sports a defiant Us vs. Them banner that counts
the number of days the city has resisted the airport since El Toro
was closed in July.
</P>
<P>
   The banner symbolizes the fact that the imaginary wall that had
once separated Orange and Los Angeles counties, commonly referred
to as the ``Orange curtain,'' has effectively moved to the middle
of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could fight this 15, 20, 25 years,'' said Larry Agran, a
member of the Irvine City Council, who argues that the issue is one
of common sense, safety and quality of life. ``It's a virtual civil
war. The county's really coming apart because this has been so
sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many areas of the country have fought over how to use
old military bases, and airports have divided communities for
decades. But this battle comes in a county that had tried to plan
away such problems until it found itself with, effectively, too
much of a good thing as its population swelled and its economy
boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere these battles have frequently turned on concerns over
job creation, but neither side here maintains that the vibrant
economy needs an airport to grow. The county's unemployment rate
has drifted to an almost negligible level of less than 3 percent
and it has been generating about 40,000 jobs a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about creating jobs or creating wealth here,''
conceded Michael Lapin, manager of the county government's
pro-airport planning group. ``Those are ancillary questions. The
issue is demand and quality of life, convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   George Argyros, one of the county's wealthiest developers and
possibly the airport's most ardent supporter, cast the battle in
neo-Marxist terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic case of class warfare to me,'' Argyros said.
``The south county is all spanking new and they live behind their
guarded gates. It's almost the working people of the north against
the haves in the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Most southerners reject any suggestion of such snobbism, but
they generally agree that they simply do not want their quiet lives
disrupted. The southern town of Laguna Woods, for example, a
retirement community once known as Leisure World, twice rejected
ballot measures to incorporate as a city. The measure finally
succeeded this year in part because leaders explained to voters
that as a city it could battle the El Toro airport more
effectively.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Orange County is the sixth-largest county in the country, with
about 2.8 million residents. While at one time much of the
population commuted to jobs in Los Angeles, only about 14 percent
do now, and a larger number commute in from other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The county is about 54 percent white, 30 percent Hispanic and 13
percent Asian-American, with a tiny proportion of
African-Americans. But it is estimated that, within a decade or so,
the white population will no longer hold a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest changes, though, have been economic. In spite of the
county government's nearly forgotten bankruptcy five years ago, the
area is choking on the spectacular growth of businesses that often
located here because of the pleasant lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Some airport opponents claim the north wants to shut down John
Wayne Airport and simply transfer the pollution, noise and traffic
to the southern end of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Northerners deny this. The county government insists that it
plans to have two airports, keeping John Wayne open.
</P>
<P>
   The county envisions that the El Toro facility would be phased
in gradually, with the capacity reaching nearly 29 million
passengers annually around 2020. There has also been a proposal to
stop the expansion in 2010, when the capacity would be 18 million
passengers per year.
</P>
<P>
   Northerners say neither plan would satisfy the growing demand
for air service. Southerners counter that traffic at John Wayne,
which operates under tight restrictions, is actually declining.
Northerners say that is because fares on the small number of
flights are too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Annual passenger traffic at John Wayne Airport dropped to 7.5
million passengers last year from a peak of 7.7 million in 1997.
And in the first 10 months of this year it slipped to 6.2 million
passengers from 6.3 million in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Just the process by which the issue is being decided worries
some people because of the way it has invited emotional responses.
No company has a greater interest in the battle than the privately
held Irvine Co., the largest landowner in the county and the
developer of the city of Irvine. The politically influential
company has not taken a stance, but it has expressed dismay at this
lack of hard facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the land-use issue has been approached turned
traditional sound planning on its head,'' said Larry Thomas, the
company's senior vice president. ``By that I mean without a
detailed strategy, without a detailed economic analysis or specific
plan a ballot measure was taken to the people. They voted from
their gut. There wasn't a third category people could vote for,
saying, `Tell me more about this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness has left some people fatalistic. Peggy Ducey, the
executive director of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority,
the body leading the drive, said that if an airport is not built at
El Toro, the John Wayne Airport will have to be expanded, but that
this, too, would lead to litigation.
</P>

ARMSTEAD (INJURED) AND STRAHAN (DOUBLE-TEAMED) FLOUNDER AGAINST
VIKES
</HEADLINE>
  (With FBN-GIANTS-VIKINGS)

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J _ This week a teammate of the Giants'
Jessie Armstead watched as the Pro Bowl linebacker tried to bend
his right knee. As Armstead winced, struggling to flex it several
inches, the player said he heard a crackling noise. At first he
thought Armstead had stepped on something. Then he realized it was
Armstead's knee, which sounded like a breakfast cereal just after
the milk was poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be playing,'' he told Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford not to,'' Armstead replied.
</P>
<P>
   This is what fighters do. A champion like Armstead will play
unless he can't walk. But there is a cold reality to the National
Football League. When a team smells blood, it attacks. The
Minnesota Vikings noticed on film that against St. Louis last week,
Armstead was sluggish, able to perform at only a fraction of his
ability, because of that knee. So they decided to go after Armstead
on Sunday, and at times, he was barely able to move across the
field.
</P>
<P>
   In a game the Giants needed, Armstead played but had a modest
impact, making six tackles. Michael Strahan, one of the
hardest-working players in the game, was also not a major factor
for the Giants, with two tackles and no sacks. The lack of
production from the team's two Pro Bowl stars is the main reason
Minnesota racked up 174 yards on the ground and the Giants lost
34-17.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants may still be mathematically alive for a playoff
berth. And they may even get in. But they could easily lose to
Dallas in the final game of the regular season, too, and be knocked
out. This is a team that one week dominates Buffalo on the road,
then gets beaten easily by Minnesota at home. The Giants are hard
to figure.
</P>
<P>
   Even more difficult to understand is this: In the biggest game
of the season for the team, one in which it had to win to control
its postseason destiny, where were its two stars, Armstead and
Strahan?
</P>
<P>
   It is too simplistic to say merely that both players played
terribly. Football is much more complicated than that. Strahan is a
perfect example. The common theory among the news media is that
Strahan is not giving his usual effort. There have even been
ridiculous statements about his diet being a possible problem, as
if him eating more roughage would increase his sack total.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' coaching staff, much more grounded in reality than
the press, noticed while watching film of the Giants that Strahan
is getting double-teamed more than ever, and so the Vikings did a
lot of that against Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we singled him,'' Minnesota Coach Dennis Green said,
``but we were always sliding protection to his side.'' Meaning
there were always a number of bodies on Strahan. Maybe the tackle
would get help from another lineman or a tight end or both.
</P>
<P>
   But Strahan has always been double- and sometimes triple-teamed
the last few seasons, so why would there be such a difference now,
as Strahan has just five and a half sacks this season? There are a
number of factors at work that were not present last season. The
schemes against him, a number of injuries _ including elbow and
knee problems _ and the fact that each week, an offensive lineman
wants to make his name against Strahan, all contribute to the sack
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Against Minnesota Sunday, the two times Strahan was
single-covered, he made plays. The first was Strahan's pressure on
quarterback Jeff George that led to an interception by Jeremy
Lincoln. Later in the game, Strahan beat right tackle Korey
Stringer on a speed move and Stringer was called for holding after
he tackled the defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead's situation may not be as complicated, but it is just
as difficult. The coaches know how hurt Armstead is, but what are
they supposed to do in the biggest game of the season, bench him?
The leader of the defense and maybe the team?
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of those strange seasons for the two great
players. They will most likely be back next year, in prime form.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they can revert to last season's form for one more
game, and push the Giants into the postseason.

LOOK CLOSER AT MARCIANO'S RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thirty years after his death in a plane crash,
Rocky Marciano remains near and dear to the hearts of many boxing
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we ranked the top 20 fighters, pound-for-pound, of
the century. That Marciano was not on the list raised the ire of
many readers. We received dozens of phone calls, e-mails and
letters with the same sentiment: What? No Marciano? Blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was no misprint.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Marciano, as determined and courageous as any fighter
in history, is among the greatest of all-time. The fact he is the
only major fighter to have retired with a perfect record _ 49-0 _
is reason enough to label him great.
</P>
<P>
   That all but six of his victories came by knockout only adds to
his legend.
</P>
<P>
   However, we cannot judge Marciano solely on those facts.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant deficiency on his resume was his
opposition: He faced no exceptional fighter in the prime of that
fighter's career or in his primary weight division.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Louis was 37 and badly faded when Marciano knocked him out
in eight rounds in 1951. Jersey Joe Walcott, probably Marciano's
most credible opponent, was capable but 38 when he was stopped in
round 13 after dominating most of his first of two bouts with
Marciano.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzard Charles was a great light heavyweight but not quite at
that level as a 33-year-old heavyweight when Marciano outpointed
him in the first of two fights between them.
</P>
<P>
   And Archie Moore was 41 when Marciano stopped him in nine in
1955, Marciano's last fight.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that? A wasteland. Who today even remembers Carmine Vingo
or Roland La Starza or Rex Layne, some of Marciano's bigger-name
opponents at the time?
</P>
<P>
   Many will contend that a fighter should be judged only by his
rate of success against his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no, with more weight on the no. Yes because it doesn't
seem fair to punish a fighter over something he can't control. No
because a fighter's greatness can be determined only by meaningful
tests, tests that can be provided only by other great fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Take Roy Jones Jr. as a contemporary and more extreme example.
The undisputed light heavyweight champion might be as talented as
any fighter in history but will never be considered among the very
greatest for lack of decent opposition.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his fault _ but it's reality. Of course, Marciano faced
more credible opponents than Jones, but he clearly would have
benefited had he met and beaten a fighter as good as, say, Joe
Frazier or George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano's legacy also suffers because of his brief reign as
champion. He defended only six times after he stopped Walcott to
win the title.
</P>
<P>
   He might be compared to a baseball player who's hitting .400
when he reaches the minimum number of at bats required to win a
batting championship and then decides to sit out the rest of the
season to preserve his mark.
</P>
<P>
   Do we respect his ability? Yes. Would we respect him more had he
played out the season? Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano didn't retire at 32 to preserve his perfect record.
However, he (begin ital)did(end ital) quit in his prime. That
leaves us wondering what might have been and with some room to
question to Marciano's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with his deficiencies, Marciano must be considered
among the best heavyweights of all time. We rank him No.5 since the
turn of the 20th century, which is another reason we couldn't rank
him in the top 20 pound-for-pound.
</P>
<P>
   Had we done so, five of the 20 would have been heavyweights.
That seems top-heavy when the long list of great fighters in the
lighter weight classes is taken into account, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to reward fighters simply because they're
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   So, in one opinion, this is where Marciano stands: Only four
heavyweights since 1900 were better and he probably would have
landed between 20 and 25 had our list of the best fighters of the
century gone on.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the thousands of fine fighters who've stepped
through the ropes, that's not exactly disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 heavyweights: Now that we mentioned where Marciano ranks
among the century's best heavyweights, we're compelled to provide
the rest of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again:
</P>
<P>
   1. Muhammad Ali (56-5, 37 KOs) 1960-81. Ali was lucky to have
fought in an era rich in fine heavyweights and defeated them all,
including two _ Sonny Liston and George Foreman _ who seemed
unbeatable at the time.
</P>
<P>
   2. Joe Louis (68-3, 54 KOs) 1934-51. Louis didn't have the
benefit of Ali's level of opposition but did beat six world
champions when it meant something to be heavyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, he held the title for 11 years (three of
which he spent in the armed services) and defended (begin
ital)25(end ital) times. No other heavyweight controlled the
division as Louis did.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jack Dempsey (61-6-8, 50 KOs) 1914-27. He, too, didn't face
an abundance of imposing opponents. However, he tore through the
heavyweight division like no one before or since and became an icon
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Half his 50 knockouts came in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jack Johnson (78-13-11, 49 KOs) 1897-1938. Johnson, perhaps
the greatest defensive heavyweight ever, was champ for seven years
in an environment so hostile that officials conspired to throw him
in jail rather than allow him to remain champion.
</P>
<P>
   5. Rocky Marciano (49-0, 43 KOs) 1947-55. He did all that could
be asked of him: He beat everyone who was put in front of him. And,
with an 88-percent knockout rate, he did it with impressive
finality.
</P>
<P>
   He might not have had the boxing skills of some champions, but
no one was tougher or more driven. He arguably could be ranked as
high as No.3.
</P>
<P>
   6. Larry Holmes (67-6, 43 KOs) 1973-present. Holmes, too, fought
in an era generally void of inspiring opposition, but the length of
his reign as titleholder was remarkable: He was champ from 1978 to
1985 and won 21 title fights during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who had perhaps the best jab in history, started his
career 48-0 before losing to Michael Spinks.
</P>
<P>
   7. Evander Holyfield (36-4-1, 25 KOs) 1984-present. Holyfield
and Ali are the only three-time world champions, a testament to
their grit and ability.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he has hovered at or near the top of the division for
15 solid years is impressive. He beat once-feared Mike Tyson twice
in title fights.
</P>
<P>
   8. Joe Frazier (32-4-1, 27 KOs) 1965-81. Frazier, who fought
like a runaway train, fell short only against Ali (two out of three
times) and Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   9. Sonny Liston (50-4, 39 KOs) 1953-70. Immensely strong,
extremely talented, Liston had the misfortune of being Ali's
contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   His left jab was as punishing as some fighters' left hook.
</P>
<P>
   10. George Foreman (76-5, 68 KOs) 1969-97: Foreman might have
been the most imposing heavyweight ever. However, like Liston, he
was unlucky to have run into Ali.
</P>
<P>
   His knockout of Michael Moorer to regain the title _ 20 years
after he first won the championship _ was one of boxing's great
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Next 10: 11.Mike Tyson; 12.Gene Tunney; 13.Jim Jefferies;
14.Jersey Joe Walcott; 15.Ezzard Charles; 16.Sam Langford;
17.Riddick Bowe; 18.Harry Wills; 19.Max Baer; 20.Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson explanation: How can Tyson be No.11?
</P>
<P>
   His thrilling run through the heavyweight division ended at the
tender age of 23 and he's been utterly ordinary since.
</P>
<P>
   He also defeated a string of forgettable opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Champions John L. Sullivan, Jim Corbett and Bob
Fitzsimmons fought primarily in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Other opinions: Marciano was ranked the No.3 heavyweight of the
century by a panel of experts put together by the Associated Press.
Ali was No.1 and Louis No.2. Tyson was not ranked.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano was (begin ital)not(end ital) ranked in the top 10
pound-for-pound. Heavyweights Ali (No.2), Louis (No.4) and Dempsey
(No.6) (begin ital)were(end ital) listed in the top 10. &QL;

BOOKING A HOTEL ROOM IN MANHATTAN IS TOUGH IF YOUR ROOMMATE IS A
KOALA
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ohio, Va.)  (nk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finding a hotel room in Manhattan during the holiday
season can be a bear. For those who travel with bears, it is even
harder.
</P>
<P>
   It is much the same for those trying to check in with an adult
kangaroo, several penguins or a cheetah. In New York, the pleasures
of a carpeted suite, skyline view and room service are mostly
restricted to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Take the struggles of Edward Clark, president of the Wildlife
Center of Virginia. Clark planned to come to New York with his bald
eagle last July for an appearance on the ``Today'' show, and began
to hunt for a room. At first he could find only frightened hotel
clerks, talk of liability and rejections all over town.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was hardly surprised. On previous visits to other cities,
he has concealed pythons in duffel bags and smuggled birds through
hotel parking garages until shocked maids blew the whistle on him.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Embery has also had doors slammed in her face. The
conservation ambassador for the Zoological Society of San Diego,
Ms. Embery and her 72-pound boa constrictor, Squeeze, took it hard
when the Hilton New York &AMP; Towers turned them down cold in 1997,
when they had come to town for ``CBS This Morning.'' The hotel, on
Avenue of the Americas at West 53rd Street, allows only dogs, and
they must be under 25 pounds, explained the front-office
coordinator, Abrahm Valdez. He added that the dog owners must leave
a $35 deposit in ase of messy cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   Even celebrity does not guarantee a room, as Jack Hanna, a
regular on ``Good Morning America'' and ``Late Show With David
Letterman,'' can tell you. Hanna, director emeritus of the Columbus
Zoo, has tried to find accommodations for everything from tigers to
camels.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine their relief that two Manhattan hotels _ the
Mayflower on Central Park West at 61st Street and Le Parker
Meridien on 57th Street off Seventh Avenue _ accommodate wild
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only hotel that allowed me to check in with an eagle as a
roommate was the Mayflower,'' said Clark, delighted to find
``eagle-friendly'' accommodation. The hotel, built in 1925, has a
frayed old-world elegance in its 365 rooms and modern amenities
like conference rooms and a health club. Rooms start at $180 a
night, and a penthouse terrace suite is $500.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the liberal guest policy that drew Suzi Rapp,
promotions director of the Columbus Zoo. She checked in with her
adult kangaroo, which got its exercise hopping down the halls
wearing a leash and collar. ``They have been a wonderful hotel for
us,'' she said. ``Of course, we're very responsible,'' she added.
Most animal trainers cover the costs of any damage to rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ms. Embery learned of Le Parker Meridien, with its
expansive atrium lobby, glass penthouse and 494 luxurious rooms,
from $365 a night to $2,500 for a Presidential Suite; she never
looked back. She took her koala bear, booked it a room and rigged
up several trees so it could sleep. Ms. Embery stored the koala's
food, 500 pounds of eucalyptus leaves, in the room-service
refrigerator downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's slogan, ``Uptown, but not uptight,'' proved true.
``I can see no reason not to allow animals,'' said the general
manager, Steven Pipes, who has even allowed Ms. Embery's cheetah to
stroll the lobby. ``They are easier than humans, and when they
leave, the rooms are usually cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mayflower was less eager to discuss its unusual guest
roster, a tradition that began more than 15 years ago, when the
staff from the Columbus Zoo began checking in. ``Animals must be
kept in cages,'' said a hotel spokeswoman, Michele De Milly. But
from time to time, she said, curious guests may stroll by the rooms
and ask, ``Oh, what do you have in there?'' Ms. De Milly added that
guest safety is paramount and that large and dangerous dogs are not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the two penguins that stayed in a two-bathroom
suite, some baby tigers that smashed a lamp, a cheetah that
urinated on the bedroom carpet and the kangaroo hopping up and down
the halls, she said that the hotel made its decisions on a
``request-by-request basis,'' but was not eager to ``expand this
particular guest situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But those zoo professionals and wildlife experts _ who
frequently travel with industrial vacuum cleaners, drop cloths and
meals of live rats _ have nothing but praise for the Mayflower,
with a staff they described as courteous and well-trained.
</P>
<P>
   Clark appreciates how the bellhop always brings the oversize
luggage cart for his kennels. Ms. Rapp recalls that room service
delivered raw steak for her cougar when she ran out of meat. The
doormen will even keep an eye on those animals too large for rooms,
like camels and bulls, which can be parked outside in trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron McGill, zoo ambassador for the Miami Metro Zoo, said the
Mayflower was exceptionally generous, even after his cheetah had
that accident. ``They came right up with the carpet cleaner,'' he
said, and added, ``It's extremely rare to have a hotel like this on
Central Park West.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his penguins did not tap out the hotel's good will. He kept
the noisome birds in the bathtub, though they would occasionally
pop out, and he was concerned about the smell. ``They're fish
eaters, and I thought, `Surely, these people are going to hate
me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But no. The staff remained upbeat and even came to the room with
air freshener. ``This is a full-service hotel like I've never seen
before,'' McGill said.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this with restrictions at other Manhattan hotels, which
limit animals mostly to dogs and other ``normal'' pets under a
certain weight limit.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pierre, which has a 15-pound per-pet weight limit, a
scrupulously polite reservations agent, Joachim von Moltke,
defended the hotel's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really doubt that we would be able to accommodate a
kangaroo,'' he said, ``but I would have to check that with one of
our managers.''
</P>
<P>
   A python? ``Security would have to analyze how it should be
brought in and kept.''
</P>
<P>
   With a cheetah, the game wore thin. ``I would probably presume
the answer would be no,'' he said somewhat impatiently, ``given
that the animal might just tear the room apart.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons hotel limits its animal guests to
``laptop''-size dogs under 10 pounds. As for a small leopard, ``I
don't think so'' was the answer. ``We have an obligation to make
sure that our employees are working in a safe environment,'' said
Brian Honan, director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   So it went, from the New York Palace to the Waldorf-Astoria to
the Inter-Continental, even though the City Department of Health
does not explicitly ban wild animals in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is hardly much better in other cities, where
hidden animals and their owners face extraordinary heat from the
guests who encounter them.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad, for example, at the Toluca Lake Motel in California,
when an adult aardvark from the Cincinnati Zoo tunneled through the
wall with its tremendous claws, and wound up protruding into the
next guest's room, said Jim Fowler, host of ``Wild Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Burbank, Calif., where
Fowler sneaked in his 200-pound anaconda in a suitcase full of
cedar chips. After bathing it in the tub, Fowler, wearing only
jockey shorts, wrapped the snake around his upper body to dry and
then leaned out his door to pick up a newspaper. The door clicked
behind him, just as members of a girls' basketball tournament
rounded the corner. ``I can hear the screams to this day,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me half an hour to get a porter up there because
whenever the elevator door opened, I got this kind of reaction,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Fowler said, is to make the animals ``really
comfortable,'' and nothing does that quite as well as a
full-service hotel. ``In all the years I was on Johnny Carson, no
one could ever accuse me of my animals' being stressed,'' he said,
acknowledging luxurious digs at the Burbank Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, however, there is some stress that no top
hotel can erase. In November, staff members from the Columbus Zoo
pulled their trailer up to the Mayflower, and within minutes, a
12-year-old barn owl named Seymour was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The owl had no street value, but was scheduled to make
appearances with Jack Hanna on the ``The Maury Povich Show,''
``Good Morning America'' and Letterman's show. Instead, Hanna had
to appear with an opossum, giving Letterman an opportunity to rib
him. ``Jack,'' he said, ``I have those in my garbage can at home.''

BEHIND Y2K? SOME GREEK AND SOME GEEK 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ka-blam!'' Edyth Florio, a third-grader at Public
School 234 in Greenwich Village, responded assuredly. ``Because the
whole world is going to go bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2 is 2000, the K is for knockout, and Y? I have no idea,''
said 28-year-old Anthony Reiss, hanging out with a friend selling
Christmas trees on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``K is obviously a Roman numeral,'' said 45-year-old Joe Grahek.
``It's a quick way of saying 2000. Y, I'm not sure.'' But then
Grahek, who works for a government agency he did not want to
specify, ventured a guess. Borrowing from algebra, he ventured:
``It's a missing piece. In other words, you have X and you try to
determine Y.''
</P>
<P>
   So went the answers to the question: What, exactly, does Y2K
stand for? And fair enough, many of those informally polled
responded with the impossibly simple yet correct: Year 2000. But
for millennial initials spoken so often by so many, a surprising
number of people were in league with Edyth, Anthony and Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Let's clear up the specifics straight away. The abbreviation is
a combination of Greek and geek, with Y standing for year, and 2K
short for 2000. The K comes from the Greek prefix, kilo-, which was
brought into more common usage in 1795, when the French instituted
the metric system, according to Elizabeth Jewell, managing editor
and acting director of U.S. dictionaries for Oxford University
Press. The abbreviation became popular in computer circles, as
programmers began trying to solve the glitches expected on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At least little Edyth was on the right track, sort of. She
actually got the Y and 2 right; but that darn K. But she was a lot
closer than a classmate, Noemi Bilger, who chimed in with a
``Katalog?'' Edyth and a couple of other girls in Pat Sanabria's
class then went on with claims that Y1K was when Jesus was alive.
(His birth date, perhaps, would have been Y0K.)
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Wolf, another third-grader, guessed that the K stood for
the Kind of year coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Older New Yorkers also have trouble explaining why ``Y2K'' is
used to express the year 2000 and the meltdowns that some fear may
occur when computers that are used to years beginning with 19 have
to operate in years beginning with 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rite-Aid drugstore at Eighth Avenue and West 50th Street,
Ray Morales and John Katritos were questioned as they restocked the
store's soda supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, would the K be for thousand?'' Katritos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For crash; I think it's Year 2000 Krash,'' said Morales,
noting that he and some friends had recently been talking about the
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   At a Midtown office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, on 34th
Street, Thomas Jacobsen, 19, a retail worker from the Bronx, said
he had never really thought about what the characters meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the media,'' he said. ``The media hyped it up
and got everyone excited about it. It's not even the millennium.
The real millennium isn't until 2001.'' Asked to guess what Y2K
stood for, he quickly succeeded, despite or perhaps because of the
media. ``Year. . . oh, Year 2000 _ obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cardona, 39, who makes sample dresses, was sitting in the
sun in Bryant Park one recent lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for Year 2000, but I don't know the K,'' said Cardona,
who lives in Islip Terrace. ``Is it like a key?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Connie Marhefka, an administrative assistant in charge
of millennial preparations for her office, had heard others suggest
that the K was for Katastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   John Monahan, 45, who works with rigging for theatrical
delivery, treated it more as an existential question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter; we'll all be dead by the 1st,'' he said,
standing at the back of a truck outside the Helen Hayes Theater.
``Y2? 'Cause one time ain't enough.''

THE STARS WHO MADE L.A. THE PLACE

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Y'know, the (begin ital)beeee(end ital)utiful thing about making
a list of the the top 10 Los Angeles sports figures who over the
last century best personified the L.A. lifestyle... it's truly a
(begin ital)beeee(end ital)utiful thing to see.
</P>
<P>
   As it should.
</P>
<P>
   Good looks and a great hook go a long way here. Come for the
sporting life, stay for the supporting actor Oscar. It's an
ego-a-go-go.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe in other parts of the country, athletes become legends.
Here, we make 'em into icons. Or, in Shaquille O'Neal's case,
(begin ital)he(end ital) tries.
</P>
<P>
   This is a unique club all right. Beach volleyball legend Karch
Kiraly didn't make it. Howie Long, Fred Dryer, Merlin Olsen, Mark
Harmon... thanks, but don't call us, we'll call you. Not even
Cotton Warburton, the All-American USC back in '33 who won an Oscar
for editing the film ``Mary Poppins'' could cut in.
</P>
<P>
   For outstanding lifetime achievement in athletics and
aesthetics, these 10 are always ready for their close-ups:
</P>
<P>
   10. Wayne Gretzky: Managed to keep all his teeth during his
years with the Kings for post-career endorsements. And more
impressively, kept his aspiring actress wife from getting work in
Hollywood, which only would have tarnished the Great One's legend.
</P>
<P>
   9. Dodgers first basemen: The first-base bag at Dodger Stadium
is the equivalent to Schwabs Drugstore. Steve Garvey, everyone's
All-American. Eric Karros, dubbed ``Fabio'' by former teammate Mike
Piazza. And don't forget Wes Parker, still one of the city's most
eligible bachelors whose acting career didn't quite make it past a
``Brady Bunch'' cameo.
</P>
<P>
   8. Jerry Buss: Without him, there's no Jack Nicholson and all
his rowdy friends gettin' their mugs on camera at courtside during
Lakers games. The Hugh Hefner of sports owners, whose daughter once
posed for Playboy, also isn't above asking bar-pals like Dennis
Rodman to help out the club.
</P>
<P>
   7. Pat Riley: It started when he was a backup guard on the
Lakers in the mid-'70s, with the long hair and sideburns. He stuck
around as Chick Hearn's sidekick, and worked his way to the bench.
Eventually, Mr. Armani put the show into ``Showtime'' and made good
on a guarantee of back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bill ``Spaceman'' Lee: He not only fit the stereotype of the
California flake when he admitted to sprinkling his pancakes with
marijuana. He expanded on it. A self-proclaimed Roman Catholic Zen
Buddhist who believes the spirit of Satchel Paige jumped into his
body, this San Fernando Valley native got into USC and survived a
decent major-league career by throwing left-handed comments past
stunned writers. The Hunter S. Thompson of baseball now has Woody
Harrelson ready to be executive producer of a film on his life,
likely named after his autobiography, ``The Wrong Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Oscar De La Hoya: ``The Golden Boy'' was named ``Hispanic of
the Year'' in '99 by an Hispanic marketing company. He's made
Forbes' Power 100 and its Celebrity 100. Soon, he'll enter the
acting and music worlds. Occasionally, he'll box.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bo Belinsky: The '60s were his party, and the Angels pitcher
was freaking out. When he wasn't swinging with babies like Mamie
Van Doren, Tina Louise or Jayne Mansfield, opposing hitters were
swinging and missing at his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   3. Chuck Connors: He had a taste of pro basketball (an original
Boston Celtic in '49) and major-league baseball (with the Brooklyn
Dodgers and Chicago Cubs), but the future star of ``The Rifleman''
shot down his future with a bold move in 1951. As a member of the
Pacific Coast League's L.A. Angels, he refused to participate in
the major-league baseball draft. He wanted to stay here so he could
be an actor.
</P>
<P>
   2. Buster Crabbe: The USC All-American struck Olympic gold at
the '32 Games in Los Angeles _ the only U.S. swimmer to do so. Then
he cashed it in. After five world records and 35 national
championships, he took Paramount up on an offer to become an actor
_ specifically Tarzan, which would be their studio's answer to
Johnny Weismuller over at MGM.
</P>
<P>
   1. Marion Morrison: A tackle on USC's football team in 1925 and
'26, he swaggered over to small movie parts and found out he liked
it more. Thus became John Wayne. Without his true grit, would
movies and TV have been as open to a legacy of local gridders?
Doubtful. He's the original. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ About midnight on New Year's Eve, the voice of Daisy
Lopez _ Bronx teen-ager, Cathedral High School student and loyal
parishioner of St. Brendan's Church _ will travel through telephone
lines, across thousands of miles, and reverberate in the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18 relatives and hundreds of other parishioners will be
with her at St. Brendan's, in the Norwood section of the Bronx, to
celebrate not just the advent of a new millennium, but a singular
honor for their church. St. Brendan's was the only Roman Catholic
church in America to be chosen for a 24-hour, 24-country radio link
to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, churches from Papua New Guinea to Seoul to
Nairobi to the Bronx will broadcast prayers and greetings to Rome
through a special phone link, and Rome will broadcast to them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, 16, will be one of 13 St. Brendan's parishioners _
five young people and eight adults _ who will read prayers from a
script during the 15-minute link to the Vatican. The church's
Spanish and Filipino choirs will also sing as part of the program,
which is scheduled for the same time as a radio link between Rome
and Havana. The efforts of thousands of people around the world
should make it ``one of the most powerful prayers ever offered,''
said Monsignor. Patrick J. Boyle, who has been the pastor of St.
Brendan's for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   And so as New Year's Eve parties, concerts and cruises deflate
from surging millennial anxieties and sudden nesting urges, the
program at St. Brendan's is still a hot ticket. Boyle said that
hundreds of people were expected to attend the program and a social
gathering afterward at St. Brendan's School. Roughly 100 show up
for a typical New Year's Eve Mass. It was promoted at every Mass
Sunday, and even those who cannot be there were eagerly inquiring
whether the link could be heard on a local radio station. (As of
Sunday, no.)
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Delgado, 40, a building superintendent, was one of those
asking: he has elderly relatives and cannot be at church New Year's
Eve. Still, Delgado was pleased. ``It puts us on the map,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Boyle, ``It is a way to call people's attention to the
spiritual value of the New Year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said the church was selected for the ceremony because of a
connection between Jo Grafil, the chairwoman of the Vatican's Youth
Committee for the Great Jubilee Year, and the Rev. Sebastian
Bacatan, who is in residence at St. Brendan's while studying at
Fordham. The two are best friends, so when Ms. Grafil was looking
for a parish in New York, she called Bacatan, Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The parish, which serves about 2,000 families, celebrated its
90th anniversary this year. Its current building, a modern
structure that resembles a large brick ark, was completed in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Like many churches, St. Brendan's is in transition. At the 11
a.m. Mass Sunday, the upper level was half full with mostly elderly
parishioners, the Irish immigrants who once filled this
neighborhood. But downstairs, at the Spanish-language Mass, a new
church was being born. Every pew was packed with Hispanic
worshipers _ single young men, young parents and squirming
children.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bear out the church's revitalization. Ten years ago,
it performed about 250 funerals and 150 baptisms a year, Boyle
estimated; now it performs about 350 baptisms and 90 funerals.
</P>
<P>
   And Hispanic parishioners are not solely responsible for the
rebirth. There are also Filipinos, many of whom work as doctors and
nurses at nearby Montefiore Medical Center, African immigrants,
African-Americans, new Irish immigrants and more. At the 1 p.m.
Mass, a mix of ages and ethnicities assembled to hear Bacatan
preach.
</P>
<P>
   In the rectory, Ms. Lopez was volunteering, as she often does.
She has attended St. Brendan's since she was about 6, and said she
wanted to participate in the link as soon as she heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to speak out to the people _ to let them know the
truth,'' she said.

BEHIND THE SCENES ON HEALTH REFORM: UNION LEADER WAS KINGPIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki and the leaders of the Legislature
basked in the spotlight after agreeing this month on an ambitious
effort to double the state's cigarette tax as part of a plan to
provide health care coverage to up to a million uninsured
residents.
</P>
<P>
   But ask any lawmaker or lobbyist who made this plan happen, and
fingers point immediately to a behind-the-scenes player who is not
even a state official: Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the
state's largest health care union.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, often described as the state's most powerful union
leader, orchestrated what some lobbyists said was the largest
pressure campaign ever here.
</P>
<P>
   His union, working jointly with the Greater New York Hospital
Association, a grouping of 175 hospitals and nursing homes, spent
$10 million on broadcast ads, on mailings and on an unusual
telephone program. Union members and their allies sent more than
100,000 postcards to Albany and placed more than 100,000 calls to
an 1199-sponsored number, which transferred those calls to the
governor's office or to lawmakers so the callers could say the
state needed to do more for those without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent a significant amount of money, but if you think of
the return on their investment, it's stratospheric,'' said Elliott
Shaw Jr., chief lobbyist of the Business Council of New York State,
the plan's most vocal opponent.
</P>
<P>
   For that $10 million, Rivera's union, the National Health and
Human Service Employees Union, persuaded Pataki and legislative
leaders to back a $1 billion program aimed at providing coverage to
one-third of the 3.2 million New Yorkers without health insurance.
The deal would raise hundreds of millions of dollars a year by
increasing the cigarette tax by 55 cents a pack, to $1.11, and by
using a share of the $450 million a year that the state is to
receive from the national lawsuit against tobacco companies. The
state will also receive a $300 million federal matching grant.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, 48, also persuaded Pataki to continue a separate program
in which $1 billion a year in surcharges would be added to hospital
bills to finance medical training and charity care.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are often forced to swallow the cost of care for the
thousands of patients who show up in their emergency rooms without
health insurance. ``We've had a growing problem in New York State,
and that is the rapid increase in the number of uninsured,'' Rivera
said. ``That has hurt many of our hospitals, and we need to deal
dramatically with this problem. This problem hurts the working poor
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera sold his plan in Albany by explaining that, politically
speaking, it would be like hitting the trifecta. ``This is good for
hospitals, it's good for patients and it's good for health care
workers,'' he said. ``It's good for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody agreed, least of all the state business council,
which has 4,000 corporations as members. It opposed the health care
package, saying that raising the tobacco tax unfairly picked on one
product in a way that might encourage bootlegging. The council also
opposed maintaining a large surcharge on hospitals' bills,
insisting that it made New York's hospital bills and insurance
costs the highest in the nation.

STATE BILL WOULD HELP INFORM PATIENTS ABOUT DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As far as prospective patients know, Dr. Salvatore
Zelano will be taking new cases in March. At least that is what the
staff in his Brooklyn office tells callers, even though the doctor
lost his license and his right to admit patients to hospitals,
because state officials found he neglected to treat several
patients properly.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, he performed what the state considered a very
dangerous procedure: a biopsy on a patient who was already bleeding
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Hwu, who is listed among available doctors in
several health maintenance organizations' brochures, was recently
reprimanded by the state for incompetence and neglecting to care
properly for seven patients, including one with congestive heart
failure who died under his care. But that reprimand did not cause
New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens to dismiss him or the
HMOs to drop him from their lists.
</P>
<P>
   Hwu said in a telephone interview that he disagreed with at
least part of the findings, but that he did not want to comment
further, because he feared the state. Zelano, for his part, said he
fully expected his license to be reinstated this spring, and
disparaged the disciplinary process.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, patients who are interested in knowing the
disciplinary history of their doctors are highly unlikely to have
access to such information. Disciplinary records against doctors
are not widely disseminated, and are often not divulged by medical
groups and hospitals who employ many of the physicians involved in
troubled cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, HMOs do not include such information with the names
of the doctors who fill their provider lists, and doctors are
hardly inclined to volunteer the information to patients. If a
patient asks an HMO to provide the information, it is not required
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and medical groups say some disciplinary actions are
taken because of personal animosity and some could be
misinterpreted by patients who do not understand the complexities
of modern science and medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   A bill now before the Legislature in Albany would give consumers
better access to doctors' disciplinary and malpractice history.
Part of a pile of health-care bills the legislators considered this
month, it is known as 1401-A but is more familiarly called ``Lisa's
Law,'' for Lisa Smart, a woman who died in 1997 during routine
gynecological surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The primary surgeon in the operation on Mrs. Smart, Dr. Marc
Sklar, was on probation with the state at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would augment the information about doctors available
on the state Health Department's Web site. Under the bill, the
site, which currently lists doctors who have been disciplined by
the agency, would also include each doctor's malpractice history,
educational background, and any dismissal from a hospital staff.
Massachusetts, the model state for New York's proposed law,
provides the same information.
</P>
<P>
   More important, under the proposed law, doctors would have to
hang signs in their offices telling patients about the state Web
site and the toll-free telephone number they can call for the same
information.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, few patients even know there is a Health Department
Web site where information is available, say the bill's proponents,
which include a broad range of groups, from consumer advocates to
the Business Council, a statewide chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients do not have access to computers. ``The current Web
site is a buried treasure in state government,'' said Blair Horner,
the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is one of several moves that state and federal
officials have considered in response to medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a congressional debate has focused on the
so-called patients' bill of rights, which seeks to hold
managed-care companies accountable for the result if they refuse to
pay for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences recently recommended that
Congress begin a standard and rigorous system for reporting
mistakes made in hospitals, noting that tens of thousands of people
die each year as a result of medical errors. And several states
have considered legislation similar to the New York bill.
</P>
<P>
   The New York bill, which passed the Assembly last year and is
now before the Senate, will be taken up next session. The Business
Council has supported it because it sees consumer information as a
possible way to lower health care costs, because patients would
tend to avoid a doctor whose mistakes have led to further costly
procedures and care. The New York Health Plan Association, a trade
group for 33 HMOs, also offers guarded support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always supported the effort to provide consumers with
information,'' said Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the
association. But she added: ``We have to remember that when someone
has a disciplinary action pending against them, we can't disregard
due process. The other question is: Whose responsibility is it to
tell the consumers?''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's detractors include the Medical Society of New York, a
professional association for doctors, which strongly opposes
posting doctors' malpractice history. The association contends that
this can be misleading, because some specialties, like obstetrics,
have a higher rate of malpractice suits, as do doctors who take on
high-risk cases. They also argue that patients may not be
sophisticated enough to understand all the reasons that a hospital
dismisses a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates argue that patients need the information,
because disciplinary records often do not keep doctors from moving
to different hospitals, or to different states.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night this week, according to plan, a homeless
man will find a suitable air duct or steam grate near Pennsylvania
Station, hook up a plastic intake tube that inflates a
personal-size plastic cocoon, and crawl into it for a warm night's
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He will be introducing to New York a two-year-old project to
help the homeless whose creator, Michael Rakowitz, acknowledges
that its centerpiece is potentially life-saving and pointedly
creepy. Working with his homeless clients, Rakowitz custom-builds
free temporary shelters that keep them from freezing, let them see
out and even have plastic pockets where they can put up pictures or
store clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The personal shelters were used by 15 homeless people in Boston
and Cambridge, Mass., in the winter of 1997-98, with assent from
building owners and no problem from the police, said Rakowitz, who
was then a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and now lives in Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first New York tent for a man he met outside Penn
Station. He also plans to help a group of men near the Staten
Island Ferry terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The structures, which resemble giant grubs or some sort of
device for removing hazardous materials, are just a Band-Aid for
the problems faced by street people, Rakowitz acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ugly condition, and people shouldn't like the
project,'' he said. ``The project should disappear. The project
should never have been made in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was trying to alter ``the everyday experience of
seeing homeless dwellings as bundles of clothing in doorways,
cardboard boxes,'' and getting passers-by to ``experience the sight
of the homeless once again for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal shelters also work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an urban planner, and I'm not somebody who can serve
as a social worker,'' said Rakowitz, 26, who is an adjunct lecturer
at the State University of New York at Purchase. ``I'm an artist,
and this is the only way I can act.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Open Door drop-in center on 41st Street near Ninth
Avenue, Kane, a man who said he had until recently lived on the
streets for 18 months, examined photographs of Rakowitz's shelters
and said he liked them. He praised the tents' designs and approved
of their special features. But would he use one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong,'' Kane said, as a friend nodded in
agreement. ``I think it's a good idea.'' But, referring to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, he added: ``In New York, Giuliani is kind of
tough on anything, especially homeless people. You hook that up to
anything, you're going to get arrested. Giuliani don't want
homeless people on the streets in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the
Homeless, was also not optimistic about the reception the tents
might face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll last more than a few hours, except in
the most hidden, remote places of our city,'' Ms. Brosnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Walter Burnes, a police spokesman, said: ``When you
really think about it, it's a nice thing that he's doing. It's a
nice thing he's designing these tents. There's no problem with his
giving them away. But there's a legal issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnes said that using the tents on city property was illegal
camping, using them on private property without permission was
trespassing, and using them on sidewalks was impeding traffic. ``If
you want to pitch a tent in your back yard, there isn't a problem
with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brosnahan described the issues raised by Rakowitz's shelters
as ``very complicated terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent the last decade advocating for decent, safe,
affordable housing, and this obviously falls short of that
threshold,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``This is a life and death struggle, and clearly
anything people can provide as an interim measure to enable our
homeless friends to survive through the night cannot be dismissed
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brosnahan noted that she had just finished two weeks of
legal work fighting Giuliani's policy against allowing homeless
people to sleep on sidewalks, and that the litigation included
testimony from a Boston doctor about his autopsies of 13 people who
had frozen to death on the streets. ``Not even very cold weather,
but 32-degree weather,'' Ms. Brosnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rakowitz began designing the tents, which cost him about $5 each
for materials, in 1997 as a graduate project at MIT, partly in
response to a decision by Harvard University to put raised bars on
many of its building grates to keep the homeless from lying down on
them. That winter, 15 structures were in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, they were their own designers,'' Rakowitz
said of the street people, whom he calls collaborators. They
insisted on clear plastic, not black trash bags. They were less
concerned about privacy than security; they wanted to see and be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted a place to store their caps and gloves and
maybe put up a picture or a ``hungry'' sign, so Rakowitz put zipper
bags between the ribs of the tents. The bags are attached with
Velcro and can be taken off and carried in chains like bandoliers.
The whole tent fits into a clear plastic carrier the size of a
shopping bag.
</P>
<P>
   The tents' biggest advantage, aside from warmth, is that street
people do not have to sleep directly on hot grates, where they risk
severe burns, Rakowitz said. Occupants do not breathe air and
possibly harmful fumes from the vent or grate; instead, the warm
air circulates through the ribs of the tent, as in a radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Rakowitz titled his original project ParaSite, which he said
referred to the use of waste air from buildings and to an ancient
Greek root word: a person who received free meals in return for
amusing or entertaining conversation. The day he graduated with his
master's degree, two former users of the bags called him from their
shelter to congratulate him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the New York project with the current uproar about
the homeless is pure coincidence, Rakowitz said. ``It's not a
protest against Giuliani at all,'' he said. ``Actually, the plan
was to do this project since last winter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that the issue is being discussed,'' he added, and
then, referring to the mayor, he said, ``He himself is agitational,
just as this project is.''

CURTIS MAYFIELD, CONSCIENCE-DRIVEN SOUL SINGER, DIES AT 57
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ga., N.Y., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis Mayfield, one of the most important and conscionable soul
singers and songwriters of the '60s and '70s, died at the North
Fulton Regional Hospital in Roswell, Ga., Sunday. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not immediately available. In 1990, Mayfield was
paralyzed from the neck down after a lighting scaffold fell on him
on a concert stage in Brooklyn. Though he continued to compose and
play music, his health deteriorated. Last year his right leg was
amputated because of diabetes related to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in 1996, Mayfield said,
``Being a quadriplegic, it's a life-or-death situation almost every
minute of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though never a superstar to the extent of many of his peers,
Mayfield captured the spirit of his time in songs that have endured
as classics beyond their context. These compositions range from his
inspirational anthem ``People Get Ready'' to his lowdown funk
classic, ``Superfly,'' from the blaxploitation movie of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the group the Impressions in the '50s and '60s
and as a solo act in the '70s, Mayfield imbued his songs with
messages of love, optimism, unity, faith and self-awareness. He
stood out from his contemporaries by bravely, intelligently and
passionately delving into racial and political issues in powerful
and prophetic songs like ``We People Who Are Darker Than Blue'' and
``Mighty Mighty (Spade and Whitey).''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond lyrics, Mayfield was a funk and rap pioneer, laying down
grooves full of bongos, bass, horns and wah-wah guitar that took on
a new life when acts in the '80s and '90s, like Ice-T, Mary J.
Blige and Digable Planets began sampling his music.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield was born in Chicago on June 3, 1942. Before his
teen-age years he was already deep into soul and gospel, leading
his own group, the Alphatones. At 14, his family moved to the North
Side of Chicago, where he met Jerry Butler, a soul singer who urged
Mayfield to join his group, the Roosters. The group renamed itself
the Impressions, and quickly had its first pop hit, ``For Your
Precious Love,'' which reached No. 11 on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   Ego clashes led Butler to leave the group for a solo career,
though Mayfield continued to write songs for him, including
Butler's Top 10 pop hit ``He Will Break Your Heart''.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years the Impressions re-established themselves with
Mayfield as their leader, fusing gospel, soul and doo-wop into
powerful hits like ``Gypsy Woman'' and ``It's All Right.'' With the
Impressions' 1964 hit ``Keep on Pushing,'' Mayfield became one of
the first rhythm-and-blues singers to take the civil rights
movement to the pop charts. Themes of black pride and equality
between the sexes, confidence and self-determination, mixed with
more gospel-based messages of devotion, began to populate his songs
with the Impressions until he left the group to begin a solo
career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Mayfield began releasing solo albums, each one a
musical or lyrical revelation. He also acted as a producer, working
with Aretha Franklin, the Staple Singers and Gladys Knight and the
Pips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superfly,'' his classic groove and falsetto-filled workout,
cemented his legacy by topping the pop-album charts for four weeks
in 1972. On albums like ``There's No Place Like America Today,''
from 1975, his songs seemed to penetrate the minds of the urban
hopeless and despondent, telling them to remain strong in times of
poverty, unemployment and black-on-black violence.
</P>
<P>
   This message of strength under adversity was one Mayfield
followed all his life. His career began to falter as disco hedonism
became popular, though he never lost faith and continued to record
inspirational albums. Despite his paralyzing accident, Mayfield
said that his spirit was soaring and he believed in mankind even
more after seeing people of all races and creeds rally to his
support.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, there were three boxed sets released of his music,
two tribute albums with other acts recording his songs, and, in
1996, an album from Mayfield with spirited songs like ``Back to
Living Again.'' Mayfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame twice, in 1991 as a member of the Impressions and this year
as a solo artist.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by The New York Times in 1996 how he felt about this
flood of recognition since his accident, he replied with
characteristic optimism, ``I'm a great believer in the saying, `It
might not come when you want it to, but it's right on time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield is survived by his wife, Altheida, of Atlanta; his
mother; 10 children; two sisters; a brother; and seven
grandchildren.

   (NYT9) WASHINGTON -- Dec. 26, 1999 -- BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN -- Former
Sen. Bill Bradley across the table from Sam Donaldson, Cokie
Roberts and George Will on ABC's ``This Week'' earlier this year.
Just 15 months ago, Bradley was not a candidate and Vice President
Al Gore was the party's presumptive nominee. Today, he has matched
Gore in fund-raising, built a national organization and given
himself a shot at upsetting the vice president. But the coming
weeks will provide a critical test of Bradley's staying power. (ABC

 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The room in Peter Schickele's Upper West Side
apartment where he composes and listens to music is in considerable
disarray. LPs and CDs are stacked atop and beneath the Yamaha grand
that takes up much of the space. Tapes, scores and more CDs cover
his desk, and a handful of Grammy Awards for his P.D.Q. Bach albums
are stashed haphazardly on a bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Schickele had an excuse. Having built his career on his passion
for an unusually wide range of musical styles and an uncanny sense
of how to combine them in entertaining and illuminating ways, he
had been invited to discuss some of the recordings that he
considered the best of the century, or _ why not? _ the millennium.
And he had been doing some preparatory rummaging, pulling albums
from floor-to-ceiling shelves holding perhaps 4,000 discs, CDs
making up the top two-thirds, LPs at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he protested, ``I'd prefer to say they were my
favorites, rather than `the best.' I don't believe in absolute
values of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not surprising that unruliness appears to be the
room's natural state: Schickele's most famous creation _ P.D.Q.,
the fictional ``last and least'' of J.S. Bach's musical offspring _
is a study in chaos, meant to tweak the classical music world's
pretensions with a balance of slapstick and sophisticated
musicological parody. The stage persona that he adopts for his
P.D.Q. Bach shows (his latest can be seen Monday night and
Wednesday at Carnegie Hall) is that of a studiedly disheveled
academic, devoted to the study of P.D.Q.'s life and work.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unreasonable to expect anyone as busy as Schickele,
64, to also keep a tidy work room. Besides writing works for his
P.D.Q. Bach shows (this year's premiere is a string quartet called
``The Moose,'' S.Y2K), he is a prolific composer of symphonic,
chamber and vocal music. His recent works include a symphony, which
the New York Philharmonic played last season; a set of chamber
works that the Lark Quartet recorded, and a film score for Maurice
Sendak's ``Where the Wild Things Are.''
</P>
<P>
   The omnivorous eclecticism that keeps the P.D.Q. shows lively
informs these compositions as well. And that same spirit runs
through ``Schickele Mix,'' his radio show. Since 1992 he has
recorded about 170 installments for Public Radio International. (In
New York it runs on WNYC-FM, 93.9, on Saturdays at 4 p.m.) Each has
a theme, usually an exploration of a musical form (sonatas, fugues,
variations and marches, for example) or a technical aspect of
composition, like rhythm, meter or how transitions work.
</P>
<P>
   A dry music-appreciation lecture is not Schickele's way. Taking
the view that ``if it sounds good, it is good'' _ a notion he
attributes to Duke Ellington _ he illustrates his points with
suites in which he is likely to juxtapose a Mozart symphony
movement, a Beatles song, a jazz piece by Gerry Mulligan, a
17th-century dance by Praetorius and an obscure cowboy ballad.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of playlist that makes a listener wonder what the
host's record collection is like, and when asked for an annotated
tour, with his favorite discs singled out, Schickele readily
agreed. He also assembled a list of more than 60 favorites, adding
several more during a conversation that was periodically
interrupted for a sampling of the more obscure entries. Several
choices have not yet been transferred to CD, but the assiduous disc
hunter might find them in collectors' shops.
</P>
<P>
   One such rarity, the officiously titled ``Music of Africa
Series, No. 11: Best Recordings of 1953, Part 2,'' is at the top of
Schickele's list. A 10-inch LP on the British Decca label, it
includes field recordings of traditional tribal chants and
ceremonial music. Schickele received the disc as a gift in the
mid-1950s, when ethnomusicologists were the principal audience for
such recordings. Today it might be a hot item in a world-music
catalog were it not long out of print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a lot of the things on this album, but there is one
track that has been terribly important to me,'' he said, singling
out ``Auou Mungoya,'' a four-minute recording of the Bantu Gogo
tribe. The piece begins as a chant and expands into a harmonization
that, to Western ears, sounds like the mildly dissonant dominant
seventh chord. But while in Western music the dominant seventh is
usually followed by a chord in which the tension of the dissonance
is resolved, the Gogo tribesmen maintain the harmonization as the
melody continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used this harmonic system in quite a few of my classical
pieces,'' Schickele said. ``There's a section of my symphony that's
directly inspired by it.''
</P>
<P>
   More recent world music recordings made it to his list as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the music that Bartok got it from,'' he said, handing
over his copy of ``Balkanology,'' a recording by Ivo Papasov, a
Bulgarian clarinetist, and his orchestra (Hannibal, on CD), and
referring to folk music currents in some of Bartok's works. ``This
is a modern guy who has a band and actually plays weddings,
although weddings are a little different there than they are here.
They go on for four days. And he's one of the world's great
virtuoso instrumentalists. What gets me is that the tunes are
played at an incredibly fast tempo, yet they have all these little
turns and embellishments.''
</P>
<P>
   This music, too, left its mark on a section of Schickele's
Symphony. When the work was performed by the National Symphony in
Washington, Schickele recommended the recording to a
contrabassoonist who was having trouble with some of the passage
work. ``When I saw him later,'' Schickele said, ``he told me, `It's
so much easier to play that lick in your symphony now that I've
listened to Papasov.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schickele has always been drawn to American folk music as well.
``Swarthmore College, which I attended from 1952 to 1957, was one
of the first colleges to present a folk music festival,'' Schickele
said as he cued up Jean Ritchie's a cappella recording of ``Guide
Me O Thou Great Jehovah'' from her album ``Saturday Night and
Sunday Too'' (Riverside, on LP). ``When Jean Ritchie sang this, it
was the only time in my life I remember calling friends at
intermission and saying, `You've got to get down here.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard anything like this in American music,'' he
continued. ``The vocal embellishments sounded almost Eastern to me.
When I was growing up, folk music was Burl Ives, whom I still love
_ he's a charming presence _ but I had never heard the
down-and-dirty stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered Earl Taylor's ``Folk Songs From the Blue Grass''
(United Artists, LP) in 1960, when he was living in Los Angeles and
had a foundation grant to compose music for high schools. ``This is
one of my all-time favorite albums,'' he said. ``I love the energy
of this band. I also love harmony singing, and this has a lot of
it. My producer on `Schickele Mix' kids me that by the time the
series ends, people will have heard the whole album because I use
different songs to illustrate different things.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true of several rock albums as well. The Beatles
seem to turn up on every other show; pressed to select one album,
he chose ``Rubber Soul'' (Capitol). ``I like the simplicity of the
arrangements, and the quiet swing. It really rocks without being
frantic.'' Among the other rock discs he pulled from the shelves
were the Rolling Stones' ``Beggar's Banquet'' (Decca), Elvis
Presley's ``Golden Records'' (RCA), Fairport Convention's ``Full
House'' (Hannibal), the Beach Boys' ``Smiley Smile'' (Capitol) and
Bob Dylan's ``John Wesley Harding'' (Columbia), all reissued on CD.
</P>
<P>
   The last two were quirky choices, not the discs typically cited
as the artists' best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said, ``most people would choose `Pet Sounds' for
the Beach Boys, and I love that, too. But there's something about
the feeling of `Smiley Smile.' It has `Good Vibrations,' for one
thing. There are also early explorations of Minimalist techniques,
in the way they repeat certain things without changing, as well as
songs like `Wind Chimes,' where the changes are so unusual that you
have no idea where they're going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of affinities, there are people who react to words
and people who react to music. I'm definitely a music kind of guy,
and it took me a while to come to Dylan. And while `John Wesley
Harding' is perhaps not as universally well regarded as `Bringing
It All Back Home' and some of those earlier ones, I like its
spareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Dear Landlord,' for example, you have just guitar, bass,
drums and piano. Simple, direct. And songs like `All Along the
Watchtower' are so powerful, even if I don't know what they're
about, exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching into his jazz section, Schickele fished out a pair of
Miles Davis classics, ``Kind of Blue'' and ``Porgy and Bess''
(Columbia); Ornette Coleman's ``Shape of Jazz to Come'' (Atlantic)
and the Oscar Peterson Trio's ``At the Stratford Shakespearean
Festival'' (Verve). (All are available on CD.) But the discs he
seemed fondest of were ``Gerry Mulligan Quartet'' (Pacific Jazz,
reissued on a Mosaic CD), the group's first album, and Lennie
Tristano's ``Jazz Record Series'' (Atlantic, reissued on a Rhino
CD).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you know these,'' he said, putting the
Mulligan disc on the turntable, ``but this quartet was baritone
sax, bass, trumpet and drums: no piano, nothing to fill in the
chords. It makes for a fantastically clear three-part counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennie Tristano does this hard bop style of playing that's
unlike a lot of other pianists. A lot of it is in the middle of the
piano, in the tenor range rather than up high. And he doesn't fill
in the chords a lot. Another thing I picked up from him was the
idea that the deaccentuation of notes can be as important as their
accentuation. One note will suddenly drop way down in the volume.
It's a great effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Schickele's classical tastes, too, are
idiosyncratic. Among Mozart symphonies, for example, he chose the
earliest ones, in 1950s recordings by Erich Leinsdorf (Westminster;
a CD reissue is out of print), rather than the 40th, or the 41st,
the ``Jupiter.'' Among his favorites are Stravinsky's recordings of
his Symphony in Three Movements and Symphony of Psalms (Sony
Classical, CD) and a disc by the pianist Maurizio Pollini with the
Boulez Sonata No. 2 and works by Webern, Prokofiev and Stravinsky
(Deutsche Grammophon, CD).
</P>
<P>
   Although Schickele said he enjoyed current period-instrument
groups, many of his choices in pre-Romantic music reflected styles
that prevailed in the 1950s and '60s or earlier. One favorite, for
example, is a 1962 collection of dances by Praetorius, Widmann and
Schein, performed by the Collegium Terpsichore (Archiv, reissued on
CD by Boston Skyline).
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge this was the first of what you might call the
Renaissance big band recordings,'' he said. ``The players added
percussion, even though those parts weren't written in those days.
But the performances are so lively and peppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Schickele's choice of Bach ``Brandenburgs'' is similarly
nostalgic: a long out-of-print traversal conducted by Fritz Reiner
(Columbia, LP).
</P>
<P>
   ``These would be completely inauthentic now,'' he conceded.
``But, boy, the sense of rhythm and momentum still sounds good to
me. And in terms of the musicianship involved, these are among my
favorite Bach recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, a visitor looking through Schickele's shelves found
P.D.Q. Bach filed under Bach, with the real members of the Bach
family, rather than with the Monty Python and Spike Jones discs on
the comedy shelf, or with the other works by their composer,
Schickele.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, of course he is,'' Schickele said with a rolling laugh.
``What did you think?''

LEO SMIT, 78, COMPOSER AND CONCERT PIANIST, DIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., N.Y., Pa., Mass., D.C.)   (jw) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Smit, a composer, pianist and teacher, died on Dec. 12 in
Encinitas, Calif. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said Nils Vigeland, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   During a long and varied career that began when he was 15, Smit
worked with Stravinsky, was closely associated with Copland, wrote
an opera with the British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle and became a
highly valued teacher.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in notes for a new recording, he remembered these and
other highlights from a rich life, including ``the golden years in
Rome with the high-spirited companionship of Alexei Haieff, Harold
Shapero and Lukas Foss''; the time Leonard Bernstein ``set a
high-jump record while conducting the climax of my Second
Symphony''; and encounters with painters, dancers and poets.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 12, 1921, the son of a
violinist, Kolman Smit. At 8 he went with his mother to Moscow,
where he studied for a year with Dmitri Kabalevsky. He then
returned to Philadelphia and went from there to New York to
complete his studies with Isabella Vengerova and Jose Iturbi for
piano and with Nicolas Nabokov for composition. In 1936-37 he was
Balanchine's rehearsal pianist, and it was in that role that he met
Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Smit made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1939, when he was only 18.
Disdaining the conventional recital program, he later pioneered
thematic concerts (``Liszt in Italy,'' given with his own slides;
``Mozart: A Self-Portrait,'' mixing piano and vocal music) and made
a feature of new pieces, especially by Copland and other composers
close to him. In 1952, he gave the first performance of Haieff's
Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   His start as a composer was slower. Two ballets written for
Valerie Bettis, ``Yerma'' (1946) and ``Virginia Sampler'' (1947),
won him some attention, but his big break came in 1957 when the
Boston Symphony played his Symphony No. 1, honored by the New York
Music Critics' Circle as the best new orchestral work of the year.
Also in 1957, he moved to Los Angeles to teach at the University of
California. In 1962, he began teaching at the State University of
New York at Buffalo, but he returned to California each winter and
settled there last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among his later works are two more symphonies, a piano concerto
and a second collaboration with Sir Fred, ``Copernicus: Narrative
and Credo,'' which had its first performance at the National
Academy of Sciences in Washington in 1973. His last decade was
devoted to songs based on the poems of Emily Dickinson, of which he
completed nearly 100.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

DEWITT SAMUEL COPP, 80; WROTE ABOUT THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeWitt Samuel Copp, a writer whose work often focused on the
Cold War, died on Nov. 29 in Burlington, Vt., where he lived. He
was 80 and also had a home in Manchester, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Copp wrote more than 30 books, fiction and nonfiction, and many
articles about the Cold War and espionage, as well as another
passion, aviation. A flight instructor and pilot, he served in the
Army Air Corps during World War II. Later as the international
marketing director of the Weather Engineering Corp., he helped
develop equipment that created artificial rain by using airplanes
that dropped silver-iodide crystals into clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Copp began writing professionally at 19, when his first radio
play was broadcast. After the war he wrote radio and television
plays for Kraft Theater, the Bell Telephone Hour and the Hallmark
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He published his first book, an aviation thriller, ``Radius of
Action,'' in 1960. In 1961 he and Marshall Peck Jr., an editor at
The New York Herald Tribune, wrote ``Betrayal at the U.N.,'' an
investigation into the death of Paul Bang-Jensen, a former Danish
diplomat at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to increase U.S. support for the government in Taiwan,
their next collaboration, ``The Odd Day'' (1962), told of the
Chinese Communist shelling of the islands of Quemoy and Matsu.
Other works by Copp include ``Incident at Boris Gleb'';
``Overview,'' a history of aerial photography; and ``Famous Soviet
Spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Copp also taught history and civics at St. Luke's School in
Wilton, Conn., and worked for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Susan; a daughter, Wendy Copp
Hodgson of South Burlington, Vt.; a son, Peter Campbell Copp of
Manchester; three grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

GOMEZ NETS HAT TRICK FOR DEVILS, BUT RANGERS RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 15 games, Scott Gomez scored no goals. He was
still getting assists, but the overall pace of production had
slowed for the Devils' contender for rookie of the year. Before the
New Jersey Devils visited the New York Rangers on Sunday at Madison
Square Garden, Gomez got some advice from Claude Lemieux, a veteran
teammate and also his linemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You know, you need a couple goals tonight,''' Lemieux
recounted. ```You're due for some goals. You've been passing a lot.
You've got to get shooting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Obeying Lemieux, Gomez put five shots on Mike Richter in the
Rangers' net. Three of them went in and the third one _ late in the
second period _ gave the Devils a two-goal lead. But the Rangers
refused to fold. They tied the score before the second intermission
and both teams settled for a point after overtime left them with a
3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the standings, Gomez said, ``I'd rather have two
points than a hat trick any day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted that it was most enjoyable to have his first
three-goal game in a special building while his mother and father,
visiting from Alaska, cheered from the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about this place,'' Gomez said, with a smile on his
face and a dazzled look in his eyes. ``Kind of magical.'' Early in
the day, in talking with his father, Carlos, Scott had said, ``Dad,
when you skate at the Garden, you've made the big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez has just turned 20 years old and he could become the
sport's first Hispanic star. His attitude about big-league hockey
is still at a kid-on-Christmas-morning stage, and he is charming
his teammates, fans and the news media with an exciting playing
style and a guileless personality. As he spoke there was an ice bag
on his right ankle, which was sore from stopping a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's result affected several streaks. It ended the Rangers'
losing streak at two games, and it ended their losing streak
against the Devils at six, although they have not defeated the
Devils in 16 regular-season games (0-11-5). But as they left for a
three-game road trip, they conceded that this one felt better than
your average single point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Theo Fleury, who had a goal and two
assists. ``When you're down a couple goals, it means you battled
back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Devils led by 2-0 after one period, Fleury scored at
six minutes 29 seconds of the second, taking advantage of a
turnover by Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer. After Gomez gave
the Devils a 3-1 lead at 14:03 of the same period on a breakaway
out of the penalty box, Fleury helped Adam Graves score to make it
3-2 at 15:11.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury did it by baiting Devils defenseman Scott Stevens with
irritating forechecks. When Stevens concentrated on chasing Fleury,
it created more room for Graves, who carried the puck through a
poke-checking attempt by goalie Martin Brodeur. Graves didn't get
an assist on Mathieu Schneider's tying goal at 16:51, but he was
important to the play, creating traffic in front of Brodeur as
Fleury and Mike York worked the puck into scoring position for
Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   York, a Rangers rookie, had three assists. Two years ago, he and
Gomez were roommates on the U.S. team in the world junior
tournament, and they remain close friends. This did not stop them
from tussling late in the third period and getting penalized for
roughing. Gomez said he laughed when he saw whom he was wrestling
and was tempted to tease York for playing in college instead of in
a major junior league, as Gomez did. But he thought better of it.
</P>
<P>
   The goals gave Gomez eight for the season to go with 26 assists
for 34 points, most on the team and most among rookies in the
National Hockey League. (York leads all rookies in goals with 10.)
</P>
<P>
   The Devils outplayed the Rangers for most of the game,
outshooting them, 44-24, as Richter played in his 17th consecutive
game, the last 13 of them starts. ``Spotting them two goals early
certainly isn't a good beginning,'' he said. As for the long
stretch without a victory against the Devils, Richter said that
most players on the Rangers don't make much of it, because not many
were with the team when it started.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had the best chance to win in overtime when Patrik
Elias hit the goal post just 10 seconds after the opening face-off.
The Rangers' best chance, a shot by Schneider, was stopped by
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who wears the captain's C in place of the injured Brian
Leetch, led the comeback with aggressive forechecking, particularly
against the line of Gomez, Lemieux and Sergei Nemchinov. ``We kept
it simple and tried getting the puck in deep and forcing
turnovers,'' Graves said. ``Fortunately, we were able to get back
into it. It is not very often you come back against the Devils,
because they play so well defensively.''

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As the New York Giants ran from the
tunnel at the west end of Giants Stadium early Sunday afternoon,
there was a throaty roar from the grandstand _ an ovation with a
past, when the Giants regularly played meaningful games in late
December.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tumult of an uneven year, the Giants had much to
play for in Sunday's final regular-season home game, and the
cheering, if nothing else, was a gesture that recognized a turn of
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly three hours later, the Giants left the field to the
humbling murmur of indifference.
</P>
<P>
   For all the promise the day brought, in the end, after a
discomforting 34-17 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Giants had
once again squandered another playoff opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' collapse was so thorough _ the defense inept, the
offense feeble and the special teams play disastrous _ the fans
were too disgusted to boo and at least one player too dejected to
find hope in what remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, we're alive in the playoff race,'' running back
Tiki Barber said. ``We don't deserve it. That was rotten today.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Giants (7-8) live still, by the miracle _ or folly _ of
the NFL's parity party. The Giants will sneak into the postseason
with this combination next Sunday: a Giants victory in Dallas and a
loss by Green Bay at home to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-8 record might document mediocrity, but this season in the
N FC, an 8-8 team _ either the Giants, the Packers or the Cowboys _
will be heading to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants can make the playoffs if they and the Packers each
win Sunday, but only if they pull off the wildest finish for a
wild-card berth. If the Giants and the Packers each win Sunday, but
the Giants win their game by 56 more points than the Packers win
their game, the Giants go to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were dominated by the Vikings (9-6), who scored
touchdowns with great variety _ on a reverse option pass by wide
receiver Randy Moss, on an 85-yard kickoff return and on a 70-yard
run in which Robert Smith was barely touched.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Giants' front four created no pressure in the
Minnesota pocket, where quarterback Jeff George placidly picked
apart their depleted secondary with the aid of the stellar
receiving duo of Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, facing the 30th-ranked defense in the league, the
Giants moved the football but rarely when it counted. They rushed
for 42 yards on their first possession and 34 yards the rest of the
game. Quarterback Kerry Collins was forced to throw 51 times, and
though he completed 31 passes for 297 yards, he also had a costly
interception and generally seemed as out of sync as the rest of the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, the high-water mark of the game was in the first
eight minutes. After forcing the Vikings into a three-and-out
series, the Giants marched down the field, with running back Joe
Montgomery carrying nine times for 37 yards. They had a first down
at the Vikings' 5-yard line, but could not advance the ball for the
touchdown and Cary Blanchard kicked a 24-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota's second drive, Leroy Hoard pushed over from 3
yards out to give Minnesota a 7-3 lead it never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard kicked a 43-yard field goal in the second quarter, but
a second Hoard touchdown gave Minnesota a 14-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants drove to the Vikings' 16-yard line with the opening
kickoff of the second half but again got only a field goal out of
the possession.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one play after Collins was intercepted by safety Anthony
Bass, the Vikings ran a reverse to Moss, who stopped and threw a
perfect pass to Carter in the right corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard added a 42-yard field goal as the third quarter ended
to cut the Vikings' lead to 21-9, but on the ensuing kickoff Moe
Williams burst through a gaping hole in the coverage for an 85-yard
touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the worst Giants attempt to stop the Vikings from
scoring. That came several plays later in the fourth quarter. After
the Giants had cut Minnesota's lead to 28-17, Smith ran around left
end for 70 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The only Giant who got a clear shot at Smith, who rushed for 146
yards, was cornerback Jeremy Lincoln, who put both hands on Smith's
back _ like he was playing two-hand touch _ as Smith ran past him
about the 15-yard line and into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   By then, empty seats outnumbered spectators at Giants Stadium.

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Mark Cohen, a major collector of comics and
an agent representing some of the world's leading cartoonists in
the sale of their original art, died at his home in Santa Rosa on
Dec. 19. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the real estate business several years ago, Cohen
built up an impressive clientele of comic-strip artists, including
Charles Schulz (``Peanuts''), Lynn Johnston (``For Better or for
Worse''), Pat Brady (``Rose Is Rose''), Greg Evans (``Luann'') and
Jim Borgman and Jerry Scott (``Zits'').
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a native of Stockton, Calif., was a lifelong collector of
cartoon art and amassed one of the world's largest collections of
original Mad magazine art, numbering some 9,500 items.
</P>
<P>
   His comics collection, including about 3,000 books autographed
by cartoonists _ many with original drawings _ and hundreds of
other cartoon-related items, from Dick Tracy badges to Little
Orphan Annie decoders, has been donated to Ohio State University,
the repository of the National Cartoonists Society.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rose Marie McDaniel; two sons, Eric,
of Santa Rosa, and Jeffrey, of Jackson, Calif.; a daughter, Marsha
Christmann of Santa Rosa, and a sister, Rochelle Warnier of
Cupertino, Calif.

<P>
   Dr. Hans Waine, who received a doctorate in history in Germany
and worked as a journalist in Berlin before moving to the United
States and becoming a prominent rheumatologist, died Dec. 5 at a
nursing home in Stamford, Conn. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   In his medical career, he worked for foundations and other
organizations that addressed arthritis treatment. He traveled
around New England, setting up outpatient clinics for treating
rheumatic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any problem cases we had, we would present to him,'' said Dr.
Samuel Potsubay, an internist who lives in South Hadley, Mass. Dr.
Potsubay said that in the '50s, there was considerable frustration
because so little was known about arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We doctors kind of hated to have these patients, you know,''
he said.``So we welcomed his input.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Waine, whose father was a mining engineer, was born in
Hagen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His son Martin said he had wanted to go to medical school, but
his father told him he could not afford to send him.
</P>
<P>
   So the young man went to Switzerland and waited on tables,
ultimately saving enough money to receive a doctorate in history at
the University of Muenster in Germany, where he studied with the
theologian Karl Barth.
</P>
<P>
   He then worked as foreign editor for the Berliner Kreuz Zeitung.
He earned a fellowship to the Columbia School of Journalism, where
he received a master's degree. While at Columbia, he met Edith
Sutro Loewenstein, whom he married. They returned to Berlin, where
he chafed under Hitler's censorship, and his wife, as a Jew, was
increasingly endangered.
</P>
<P>
   They fled, ultimately finding their way to New York, where the
dean of the Columbia Journalism School paved the way for him to
attend Columbia Medical School. He failed biochemistry, and had to
make it up in the summer, but he won entrance to Harvard Medical
School, from which he graduated in 1937. After graduation, he
worked in the arthritis unit of Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He then worked in San Francisco in the emerging field of
rheumatology and wrote more than 30 articles about arthritis and
rheumatism. He returned to Boston in 1950, where he was the first
medical director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Arthritis
Foundation; chief of staff of the Boston Dispensary; director of
the rheumatic disease training program of the Tufts-New England
Medical Center; and professor of Medicine at Tufts University
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of grants at the National Institute of Arthritis and
Metabolic Diseases, he influenced research around the United
States, said Dr. Hubert Caplan, a former student and colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Waine is survived by his wife; three sons, Martin of
Greenwich, Conn., Kenneth of Marathon, Fla., and Peter of
Baltimore; two grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. A
daughter, Susan, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the last years of his life, at Loomis Village, a
retirement community in South Hadley, Dr. Waine returned to his
first career, newspapers. Though blind, he edited the Loomis
newspaper, ``The Villager.'' &QL;

LEWIS SARETT, 81, LEADER IN CORTISONE RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Ill., N.J., Wash., Colo., Pa., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis Hastings Sarett, an organic chemist who received the
National Medal of Science for his work with cortisone and other
substances as the senior vice president for science and technology
of Merck &AMP; Co., died on Nov. 29 at his home in Viola, Idaho. He was
81 and lived in Princeton and Skillman, N.J., before he retired in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was advanced colitis, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarett was one of 15 scientists to receive the medal, the United
States' highest award for scientific achievement, from President
Gerald Ford in 1975. He was cited for his contributions to the
chemical synthesis of various chemotherapeutic agents, including
cortisone, used in the treatment of inflammatory, allergic and
neoplastic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The synthesis of cortisone was Sarett's first assignment at
Merck, which he joined as a research scientist in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the synthesis of cortisone was completed in
principle, but it took two more years before the compound could be
produced in quantities large enough for the Mayo Clinic to conduct
tests. Those later proved it to be effective in controlling
rheumatoid arthritis and similar inflammatory disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Sarett was elected to the National Inventors Hall of
Fame, created by the National Council of Patent Law Associations
and the Patent and Trademark Office in 1973. Among his other honors
were the Wallace H. Carothers Award of the American Chemical
Society (1986) and the James Madison Medal of Princeton University
(1983).
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Champaign, Ill., and was a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Northwestern University in 1939. He received a Ph.D. in
chemistry from Princeton in 1942, and then joined Merck in Rahway,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sarett was named director of the company's department of medical
research in 1952, director of the department of organic chemistry
in 1956, vice president for basic research in 1966 and president of
the Merck Sharp &AMP; Dohme Research Laboratories in 1969. He became
senior vice president in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Pamela Thorp Sarett;
their son, Will of Bonney Lake, Wash., and daughter, Renee of
Denver; two daughters from an earlier marriage, Mary Sarett of
Skillman and Wendy Young of Devon, Pa.; a sister, Helen Stockdale
of Sacramento; and five grandchildren. His previous marriage, to
Mary Adams Barrie, ended in divorce.

GIANTS ALIVE IN A WORLD OF PARITY
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-GIANTS-VIKINGS) 
(rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ By late Sunday afternoon, before a Green
Bay score could be had, Jeremy Lincoln was not quite sure how the
New York Giants could still make the playoffs. He thought it might
have something to do with the square root of the number of his
team's defensive blunders divided by the sum of the Packers'
conference points allowed, on the road, in the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much out of it,'' the cornerback said sadly,
before suddenly remembering that until proven otherwise, contention
in this NFL is conceptual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not. I'm not a math genius, with all these equations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln and the rest of the Giants were actually too depressed
to compute the possibilities, too dizzy from watching Cris Carter
zig and Randy Moss zag into and beyond their shopworn secondary. By
the time the home team marched off the Giants Stadium turf, 34-17
losers to the Minnesota Vikings, the number of fans still in the
house roughly equaled the sum of NFC playoff berths that are
unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   This was not quite the send-off to Dallas for the regular-season
finale that Giants coach Jim Fassel envisioned during a week of pep
talks about the benefits of destiny controlled. In the season's
latest statement game, the Giants stood up and told their fans to
go get a head start on the traffic, if not on next season. The game
itself was a medley of the Giants' worst hits, particularly those
of the tackling variety. After all the noise about obstacles
overcome and corners turned, the Giants reverted to a show of
ineffectual offense, uninspired play calling, overrated defense and
dismal special teams.
</P>
<P>
   But they were, in the eyes of their coach and the ebb of their
conference, still mathematically alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you the percentages right now,'' Fassel said.
``Are we playoff caliber? I'm not going to dis this team right now
and tell you we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   They had been all set up to prove themselves the class of
several common man teams, and perhaps, with some luck, even secure
a first-round playoff game at home. Dallas had lost in New Orleans
on Friday. Detroit had blown a home game Saturday against Denver.
Minnesota had beaten Green Bay last week. All the Giants had to do
was control the ball on the ground, punch it into the end zone two
or three times, charge into Dallas and bust those ghosts running
around in Cowboys uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   This game plan worked perfectly until the Giants reached the
Minnesota 5-yard line, first-and-goal, on their first series. They
wound up losing 2 yards in three downs and settling for a field
goal. After the way Joe Montgomery had churned up yardage as the
Giants drove from their 28, there was something defeatist,
something deflating, about their inability to get into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Vikings' Jeff George was given time to throw, the
big plays began coming in bunches. When it wasn't George to Carter
or Moss, it was Moss on the fake end-around, leading Carter into
the right side of the end zone with a better throw than we have
seen from any New York quarterback all season. Fassel, trailing by
21-6, for some reason ordered a field goal on fourth-and-3 from the
Vikings' 25. This was the last play of the third quarter. The first
play of the fourth was Moe Williams' 85-yard touchdown on a kickoff
return, an untouched speedster running through stooges.
</P>
<P>
   Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. Cary Blanchard, the Giants' kicker, was
knocked cold on the play. Before he was even back on his feet,
thousands began an exodus from the stadium, presumably to get a
good seat in front of the television for next weekend, when this
playoff jog will be settled, once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the league right now,'' said Jessie Armstead, the
Giants' Pro Bowl linebacker. ``You've got teams going back and
forth. Eight and seven. Seven and eight. You have a team that you
expect to win and they lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Given an opportunity to pass the Giants and the Packers,
Carolina lost yesterday to Pittsburgh. The fading Packers, home
next week to Arizona, were slaughtered at Tampa Bay. None of this
bottlenecking, this parity, is anything to get upset about. Not
when a third of all major league baseball teams begin every season
with no realistic postseason aspirations at all. Unlike baseball,
the NFL at least has a playoff system in place that puts these
wild-card impostors on a longer road to glory.
</P>
<P>
   What's the harm? Let the Giants and the Packers and the rest of
the pretenders dream on, for one more week. Let them go approach
the end alive, if not kicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you play for, what you work for,'' said Ernie
Accorsi, the Giants' general manager. ``After all we've been
through this season, we can go into the 16th game with a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, though, it is the Packers' turn to play the early
game. The Giants could be dead by 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they could score 80 points and rewrite the
tiebreaker script. Keep the beer cold, and the calculator close by.

EDITORIAL: TWO VISIONS ON HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Recent debates between Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Bill
Bradley have put health care squarely on the campaign agenda, but
no doubt confused many voters about complex cost and coverage
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes an expensive plan that invites uninsured people
to buy coverage, with the help of federal subsidies for families
with incomes of up to about $50,000, from any one of hundreds of
private plans that serve federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, arguing that Bradley's plan would lead to unacceptably
high tax increases or federal spending cuts, proposes taking modest
steps that would reduce the number of uninsured people by expanding
existing federal-state programs to cover more low-income children
and their parents. He would also offer tax credits to individuals
and small businesses that acquire coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two approaches poses the central
question that divides liberals from moderates in the Democratic
Party: Is universal access to health insurance worth its costs?
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to achieve universal coverage. The first
imposes a legal mandate. But with mandates come complexity and
intense political opposition, as President Clinton learned to his
regret in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The second _ Bradley's way _ relies on voluntary purchase. The
problem here is cost. If Bradley were to subsidize coverage only
for uninsured people, he would encourage employers to drop
coverage, use some of the savings to boost wages and invite workers
to switch to the subsidized public program. That would drive up
costs and possibly increase the number of uninsured workers.
</P>
<P>
   So Bradley is forced to offer subsidies to low-wage workers who
remain insured through their employers, eliminating any incentive
to drop their private coverage. He says his program, including a
drug benefit for the elderly, would cost up to $65 billion a year.
Gore's advisers say it could cost twice that much. In fact,
Bradley's figure is probably low.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley provides a maximum subsidy of $1,800 for a single adult.
The problem, as Gore never ceases to point out, is that in many
parts of the country there are no federal plans that offer coverage
for only $1,800. In practice Bradley's subsidy would probably have
to rise to an average of between $2,100 and $2,400. Bradley's drug
plan would also probably cost more than he estimates. It would
cover 75 percent of all drug costs for the elderly above $500 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore's drug plan would pay 50 percent of the costs
up to an initial maximum of $2,000 a year. Bradley says the two
plans would cost about the same amount, but his more comprehensive
coverage might cost 50 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   It is when the debate shifts from costs to coverage that Bradley
has a chance to score with voters. Gore's advisers say his plan
would provide coverage to 12 million uninsured people, while
Bradley's would reach 15 million. Bradley's advisers counter that
the Bradley plan plan would cover 30 million Americans, Gore's only
7 million. Gore also accuses Bradley of eliminating Medicaid. But
Bradley says he is doing what Clinton proposed in 1994, enrolling
the poor into the same health plans that cover everyone else. He
says he provides enough money to keep their benefits from falling.
</P>
<P>
   On narrow calculation, Gore's plan gets more coverage per
dollar. It covers approximately 10 million people at a cost of
about $25 billion a year. Bradley's plan would cover between 15
million and 30 million people for $85 billion to $100 billion a
year. But Gore's strategy of incremental steps is unlikely to ever
produce universal coverage. Once he tries to extend coverage beyond
the least privileged people, he will run into Bradley's problem
that any effort to subsidize uninsured workers requires subsidizing
insured workers as well.
</P>
<P>
   A realistic look at budget options starkly outlines the question
underlying their differing approaches. In a $9 trillion economy
that is experiencing the best economic times ever, is it worth
spending $100 billion a year on universal coverage, something
other, less wealthy industrialized countries have already achieved?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would mean less money for Medicare, education and
other programs and might require higher taxes. Gore says, in
effect, that the benefits are not worth these costs. That is the
right debate for an election year.

WALT LEVINSKY, COMPOSER AND JAZZ CLARINETIST, DIES AT 70
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla., N.Y., N.J., Ga.)   (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Walt Levinsky, a jazz clarinetist, composer and
arranger, died here on Dec. 14, days after being released from a
hospital in New York City. He was 70 and lived in River Edge, N.J.,
and Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   He was suffering from brain cancer and had been in a coma for
more than two months, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, Levinsky played with jazz greats
like Benny Goodman, led his own swing band featuring Goodman
alumni, composed television and movie scores and was a respected
arranger. His band played familiar swing music but with new
arrangements. Levinsky bristled at the word nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as nostalgia music,'' he said in 1994.
``That's like saying Mozart is nostalgia. Just because it's old
doesn't mean it's nostalgia. What we're doing is taking
arrangements that were written then and putting our own touches on
them. We're playing them with a modern conception. They're still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinsky prepared most of the arrangements for Bob Rosengarden,
a drummer, while he was musical director for Dick Cavett's
late-night talk show in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years playing with Tommy Dorsey and worked with
Goodman on and off for about 19 years. He once estimated that he
played in more than 5,000 recording sessions, and he arranged songs
for Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Richard Harris and Doc
Severinsen.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the theme songs for numerous television shows,
including ``The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather,'' ``CBS News
Nightwatch,'' ABC's ``20/20'' and CBS coverage of National Football
League and college basketball. For 12 years he was musical director
for the Daytime Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He also ran the control booth for the composer and arranger Dick
Hyman during his work for several Woody Allen films.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Natalie; a son, Ken, a musician from
Hackensack, N.J.; two daughters, Judy Hobbs of Kennesaw, Ga., and
Susie Nathanson of Hampton, N.J.; and four grandchildren.

NEW WEAPON AGAINST RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.J.)  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department and New Jersey have taken a
constructive and necessary step to end racial discrimination by the
New Jersey State Police. They have agreed to an outside monitor to
oversee the department, an arrangement that may also restore public
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey attorney general's office admitted in April that
some state troopers had violated the constitutional rights of
minority motorists by targeting them for traffic stops and searches
based on the color of their skin. The office continues to dispute
the Justice Department's finding of a widespread ``pattern and
practice'' of racial profiling. But instead of a lengthy and
probably futile court battle _ the existing evidence suggests that
black drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike are far more likely than
whites to be stopped _ Attorney General John Farmer Jr. wisely
chose a deal that will cement reforms he instituted earlier this
year while imposing additional safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which still awaits approval by a federal
judge, the monitor will have broad powers to inspect the
performance of officers and their supervisors. The agency will be
required to keep records of arrests and traffic stops by race to
make sure that minority motorists are not being singled out _ a
precautionary practice all police agencies should follow. The
monitor will also oversee the revamping of the internal affairs
office of the state police to eliminate cronyism and an entrenched
instinct to cover up wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The department's behavior has long been a source of
embarrassment for state officials. Nevertheless, many of these
officials, including Gov. Christie Whitman, dismissed complaints
that the police engaged in racial profiling. Had they acted
earlier, they might have avoided the outside intervention that is
so clearly necessary now.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: DELAYING A RUSSIAN LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acted appropriately recently in
ordering the Export-Import Bank to delay $500 million in loan
guarantees to Tyumen Oil, a state-affiliated Russian company whose
abusive business practices cheated foreign companies. But the
loan's delay, which is likely to be short term, should not signal a
broader disengagement from Russia. Such a retreat would make little
sense after the election of a new parliament expected to be more
friendly to economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen's main offense was its alleged manipulation of bankruptcy
proceedings to take over a Siberian oil field previously owned by
American and other foreign investors. That grab was reversed
Wednesday, after the loan delay. The longer-term solution to
problems of this kind is for Russia's new parliament to strengthen
legal protections for all investors, domestic and foreign.
</P>
<P>
   The administration continues to resist pressure to scale back
other assistance programs to Russia. These serve important American
interests like reducing nuclear dangers and encouraging democracy
and economic reform. Washington should stand firm in its
condemnation of Moscow's warfare in Chechnya. Broad cutoffs of
American aid programs would not halt the combat. But delaying these
ill-advised Export-Import loan guarantees sends a useful political,
as well as economic, message.

NEW HARVEST ON THE RANCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLCOX - It's enough to make the old Texas cowboys and farmers
who settled these parts shortly after the shooting at the OK Corral
turn over in their graves.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in once stolid cattle and cotton country, folks are
harvesting cucumbers, tomatoes and whatnot in mass quantities, all
grown indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, organic orchards have sprung up everywhere - with talk
of holistic experiences and concerns more about pesticides than the
pest insects themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, city slickers come and pick vegetables on farms
on the weekends or take in a trail ride at a bed and breakfast on
once-working ranches.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the ranchers? They've been raising all kinds of
weirdness from ostriches to rabbits and chinchillas. One couple has
been herding chickens around their spread while another has been
digging up creosote bushes to sell at nurseries in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Cochise County figures to stay rural well into the new
millennium, but there's little tradition left in traditional
farming and ranching.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation and change have transformed these southeastern
Arizona parts. Indeed, notes University of Arizona horticulturist
Rob Call, the area illustrates how rural America is fitting into
the high-tech, modern world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that we are already reaching our yield potentials
here unless there are advances in biotechnology,'' Call said. &QL; 
YIELDS RAISE EYEBROWS &QL; 
Many of those yields have raised a number of eyebrows. Like at the
100-acre, indoor Eurofresh hydroponic tomato greenhouse north of
Willcox, where more than 500 people work and about 800,000 tomatoes
are produced daily. Dutch entrepreneurs liked all the sunshine for
winter growing so much they set up shop with a 10-acre greenhouse
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Using a controlled growing environment, only a trifle of soil
and liberal amounts of liquid fertilizer, the greenhouses produce
10-foot high vines and reams of tomatoes free of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent round of labor woes over pay and working
conditions with its largely Mexican workforce, Eurofresh Ltd. plans
to double its acreage over the next few years. The University of
Arizona also has gotten in on the act with courses on the use of
hydroponic techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes aren't the only crop. Greenhouses around Willcox also
produce cucumbers and houseplants, tapping into the area's
plentiful pool of clean groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are all the apple orchards which have sprung up in
vacated farm fields during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our apples found their market niche in the three weeks every
year before the Washington apple industry begins production,'' said
Norman Brown, vice mayor of Willcox. &QL; 
NICHE FOR APPLES &QL; 
Another major niche was found in the production of organic apples,
said Nancy Dudney, marketing director of Valley Farms, which has
500 acres of apple trees using natural growth methods. Most of the
orchards in the area have gone organic in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a humongous growth industry for us and our
production is up about 20 percent since we went organic,'' Dudney
said. ``Our apples are being sold in almost every state now and we
are on the verge of exporting to Europe. We thought we had a deal
in England but there are still some points to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the more traditional farmers who have remained in the area,
decidedly untraditional marketing techniques have been used.
</P>
<P>
   The ``You Pick It'' industry now attracts about 120,000 people
annually, largely from Tucson, from July 4 to Halloween, Chamber of
Commerce Director Eddie Browning said. They pick from fields of
corn, squash, peas, chiles and tomatoes and from orchards of apples
and pears.
</P>
<P>
   Call said the days of heavy irrigation down farm rows for
thirsty crops like cotton are coming to an end. The area once had
six cotton gins and 160,000 acres under cultivation 20 years ago.
It now has one gin and 60,000 acres in cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is more development of high-yield field crops like
corn which use more water-efficient things like sprinklers that use
a central pivot,'' Call said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Shores, co-owner of the Willcox Livestock Auction, can
only wish that there is an alternative that produces more money in
the cattle industry these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, my dad sold 82,000 head of cattle through
these gates'' each year, said Shores, looking out on a vacant
holding pen. ``Now, we're down to between 20,000 and 30,000 a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the livestock industry is heading is anyone's guess. The
area has been plagued by droughts which has reeked havoc with
foliage, cattle prices have remained stagnant and feed prices have
increased. &QL; 
OSTRICH RANCHES DISAPPEAR &QL; 
Earlier this decade, ostrich ranches were all the rage - producers
billed the bird's meat as a lean, healthy alternative to beef. At
its height in 1996, the Willcox area had 25 ostrich ranches and
nearly 15,000 birds with prized breeding pairs going for as much as
$50,000. But the industry failed to find a market and died
virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they've got ostriches for sale on the bulletin board of
the local supermarket for $25,'' said Kim McReynolds, a livestock
and grazing specialist for the University of Arizona extension
service.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the area flirted with rabbit and chinchilla production
with similar results.
</P>
<P>
   Many longtime ranchers in the area, McReynolds said, are
reducing herds and going into selling the ``ranch experience'' to
tourists, including trail rides and bed and breakfast lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Karen and Clay Riggs, who own a big spread in the
foothills of the Chiricahua Mountains, are raising natural,
grass-fed cattle with no use of growth hormones that permeate
feed-lot production of beef. They also are directly marketing their
cattle to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Riggs also have mobile pens and water tanks and move their
chickens around constantly so the fowl can experience a more
natural environment. As a result, the ``free range'' chickens have
grown a lot faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful. They aren't stacked on top of one another and
don't have to breathe fecal dust,'' Karen Riggs said. ``They can
scratch the ground and give themselves dirt baths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Despite fewer livestock being sold locally, they are anything
but an endangered species in northern Cochise County. McReynolds
said the extension service put out a brochure recently about proper
range management because so many people who were buying subdivided,
40-acre tracts were overgrazing their land with cattle.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds sees a lot more people living on smaller tracts of
land as ranches shrink in size in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``But hopefully they will be retired,'' McReynolds said. &QL;

 Y2K doomsday predictions fade  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Now is the week of our discontent.
</P>
<P>
   As we tackle gift returns and deal with visiting relatives,
there's a slight uneasiness not present in the ghosts of holidays
past. With five days remaining, will the computers that form the
fabric of our society let us down?
</P>
<P>
   By most reasonable accounts, they won't.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K doomsday predictions that filled the air 18 months ago
have been replaced by almost unbridled optimism. Warnings about
lengthy power outages and survivalists heading for rural hideaways
turned out to be more bunk than bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it may even be hard to notice if anything's
happened at all,'' said John Gantz, chief researcher for Project
Magellan, the Y2K research arm of International Data Corp., a
research firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is likely that, beginning about 4 a.m. Central time
Friday, some computer systems around the world will fail. Overseas,
in fact, scattered power and other utility outages are probable.
</P>
<P>
   And while those types of disruptions may not happen domestically
in the United States, other problems _ ranging from cash register
snags at small stores to billing glitches at large corporations _
will.
</P>
<P>
   But those aren't the kinds of problems that will affect the way
we live. ``It is naive to think we'll come through this without any
hiccups at all,'' said Canadian Peter de Jager, the programmer
widely recognized as being the first to bring the Y2K problem to
the public eye nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will go wrong,'' de Jager said last week. ``But they
won't be the systemic kinds of problems that could cause widespread
outages.''
</P>
<P>
   And why would they?
</P>
<P>
   All told, American business and government spent $100 billion to
inoculate computers against the Year 2000 computer bug _ $365 for
every man, woman and child in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Did we get our money's worth?
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Department of Commerce shows that Y2K
computer problems should have no major effect on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't care about isolated problems, they happen every
day,'' said Robert Shapiro, undersecretary for economic affairs
with the Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you worry about are large, systemic effects _ disruptions
in energy, transportation, finance and telecommunications _ and all
of these are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the imperfections will show up is anyone's guess. But
potential trouble spots include the infrastructure of developing
countries and small business in both the United States and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, the United Nations Y2K working group issued its
final assessment, which cited a ``medium to high risk'' that Y2K
errors could harm public health and safety in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The International Y2K Cooperation Center predicted many computer
mistakes, but said businesses and governments will experience only
limited damage in the early days of January.
</P>
<P>
   It called the threat to human life small, but ``not zero.''
</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup, a Stamford, Conn., research firm considered to be
a leading Y2K resource, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 10, we see this as a two or a three,'' said Matt
Hotle, a GartnerGroup vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are likely to see some disruptions that probably will last
a week or two in some underdeveloped countries,'' Hotle said.
However, he said, citizens in those countries are accustomed to
infrastructure failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be surprised by the things that go wrong,'' said de
Jager. ``Computer problems can cause any type of problem you can
imagine. It sounds like hype and exaggeration to say a factory
could explode. It could.''
</P>
<P>
   But de Jager believes governments themselves may be the biggest
trouble spot. ``The good thing is...most of the things that fail in
government no one cares about and most are easily circumvented,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are more concerned that Y2K problems
overseas may spark fear in the United States as news begins to show
up on television networks in advance of the bug's arrival in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like watching election returns,'' Hotle said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some believe... MORE
</P>
<P>
   (Undated) ...election returns,'' Hotle said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some believe that last-minute panic is the only serious
Y2K problem that may occur in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for ``a smaller subset of people'' to rush the
stores in advance of a storm, said Lou Marcoccio, GartnerGroup's
lead Y2K analyst. If people find long lines at gas stations,
grocery stores and ATM machines, the panic could well become a
self-fulfilling prophecy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House doesn't believe a panic reaction, at this point,
will cause systemic breakdowns in the supply lines that provide
food, clothing and other basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   But will problems overseas affect the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, said Shapiro at the Commerce Department. For that to
happen, a trading partner would have to be a major player, a big
technology user and totally unprepared for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   No country fits that profile. U.S. trading partners Canada and
Mexico are generally in good shape, as are South Africa, Israel,
Turkey and Saudi Arabia, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Project Magellan at IDC is projecting that the Y2K loss to the
world economy will be only $23 billion _ on a global scale, an
insignificant figure. To put that number in perspective, Hurricane
Andrew did $30 billion in damage to Florida in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But where some experts like Gantz see order, other global Y2K
watchers see the potential for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Grabow, CEO and founder of the Millennium Investment
Corp. of Chicago, believes the United States won't be able to get
the products and parts from overseas necessary to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of foreign Y2K-related computer failures is
very serious and troublesome,'' Grabow said.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, some recent reports have cast doubt on the
preparedness of the nation's water supplies, emergency 911 response
systems and the gasoline supply.
</P>
<P>
   All three reports were later discredited.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the water study was based on outdated information,
said John Koskinen, President Clinton's top Y2K expert.
</P>
<P>
   Another hyped worry _ hidden computer chips _ turned out to be a
dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embedded systems issue doesn't appear to be as broad as we
once feared,'' said Michael Ashton, a chip consultant for Sprint
Corp. For the most part, electronics will work, even if an
incorrect date appears on a fax, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce McConnell, director of the International Year 2000
Cooperation Center in Washington, said gloomy reports will be
flying for the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what we'll find, with a lot of confusing
information, especially in the first couple days of 2000,''
McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Small-business efforts to battle the bug also remain a concern.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were disheartened to learn last month that
one in four small-business owners with 100 or fewer employees have
done nothing to prepare for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Business survey showed
that as many as 1.5 million small-business owners had decided to
take a wait-and-see attitude toward Y2K, up from the 800,000
expected to do nothing several months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry that will zap the vitality of an economy
based heavily on small business, while others say those who choose
to do nothing probably don't rely on computers anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not likely you will see small business impacted heavily
at once,'' Marcoccio said. ``Only 10 percent of the total failures
will occur within the first two weeks of the year. There won't be a
mad rush for replacement parts or massive supply-chain gaps that
others predict.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, New York economist Ed Yardeni with Deutsche Bank
still is expecting a recession next year. ``I'll be very happy if
Y2K turns out to be a non-event,'' he said. ``But I remain amazed
by the confidence of all the optimists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we'll all find out together soon.''

NETS CRUSH BULLS, 103-76 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For nearly three weeks, the New Jersey
Nets carried the grudge, remembering their horrific performance at
the United Center, struggling with the fact that they were one of
only two National Basketball Association teams to lose to the
woeful Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   As the rematch approached, the Nets spoke with venom about their
intentions on the court, with talk of owing and destroying
dominating their quotations.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night at Continental Arena, the Nets backed up their
words. Roaring past the Bulls and ending the game's competitive
value in the first quarter, the Nets whipped their guests soundly,
103-76, their largest margin of victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets will have to live with the thought that they gave
away an important game to Chicago (2-22) on Dec. 10, they can at
least take solace in having evened the score. In addition to giving
their minds some peace, the Nets raised their record to 10-18 with
the victory, and gave them an impressive seven-game home winning
streak heading into Tuesday's game against the NewYork Knicks
(17-11) at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise record for most consecutive home victories is
nine, dating back to the final two games of the 1994-1995 season
and the first seven contests of the 1995-1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn led the Nets with 17 points on Sunday night, and
Kendall Gill added 14. Stephon Marbury, with 12 points and 11
assists, and Kerry Kittles (12 points) followed. The Nets had 25
assists, 22 more than the confused Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's three assists matched a league record for fewest in a
game. Four teams have accomplished the futile feat, the last being
the Knicks on March 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period early in the first quarter on Sunday night,
the Nets looked like they had forgotten their mission, like their
hearts had softened on the Bulls. They committed two turnovers and
six fouls, and Van Horn had one of his shots blocked by the
6-foot-6-inch guard, Corey Benjamin. All of the above helped the
Bulls score 6 straight points and take a 10-8 lead after five
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed by his club's effort, Coach Don Casey called a timeout
and apparently reminded his team of the embarrassment it suffered a
few weeks back. Suitably enraged, the Nets emerged from the huddle
and went on a 24-8 run over the next 6 minutes 45 seconds to end
the quarter with a 32-18 lead.
</P>
<P>
   No one transformed himself quicker than Van Horn, who started
the game sluggishly and missed his first four shots. Right out of
the timeout, he tied the score with a 3-point play, then drilled
the first of three 3-pointers he hit in the first half. Van Horn
scored 9 points over the last half of the first quarter, outscoring
Chicago by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets turned around the game with rebounding, defense and
teamwork. In a switch from their debacle in Chicago, they
outrebounded the Bulls, 16-8, in the first quarter. At the United
Center, the Bulls grabbed 17 offensive rebounds in destroying the
Nets on the glass, 54-38. The Nets also held Chicago to 36.8
percent shooting over the first 12 minutes, including a five-minute
stretch in which they allowed the Bulls only one field goal. And,
with efficient and unselfish ball movement, the Nets recorded 10
first-quarter assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls conspired with the Nets in doing themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   A weak team when at optimum health, Chicago presently looks like
something out on the second tier of a poor foreign league. Toni
Kukoc, Randy Brown, Fred Hoiberg and the aging Hersey Hawkins are
on the injured list, leaving the Bulls with players like Chris
Anstey, Rusty LaRue and Kornel David in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bulls' seemingly endless string of losses, they have
apparently opted for small victories.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent when Benjamin pulled off a nice offensive play
and then got ridiculously cocky afterward. With his team down by
47-22, Benjamin drove past Kittles and soared for an authoritative,
one-handed dunk over Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement was something to be proud of, but Benjamin made
himself a laughingstock by landing and staring maliciously at the
Nets bench.
</P>
<P>
   As high-flying and powerful as the basket was, the Bulls were,
still down by 23 points. Understanding this, the Nets on the bench
got a good laugh out of Benjamin's antics and those on the court
resumed the massacre. &QL;

FREAK STORM BLITZES EUROPE, KILLING SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs for new penultimate graf on conditions in Britain) (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ A fierce storm with hurricane force winds barreled
across northern France and parts of Switzerland and Germany on
Sunday, injuring hundreds and killing as many as 62 people,
including one victim who was crushed in a falling ski gondola in
the Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The freak gales, which reached 95 mph in the heart of Paris,
left broken branches and uprooted trees along the Champs-Elysee,
smashed windows at Versailles and littered this city with twisted
awnings, smashed roof tiles and Christmas trees ripped from their
planters.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of once neatly parked motorcycles lay in helter-skelter
piles in the streets. Huge sheets of roofing and television dishes
rested in the gutters, and many of Paris' tourist destinations
closed for fear of further falling debris. One of them was
Disneyland Paris, where six people visiting the Davy Crockett Ranch
were seriously injured by falling branches.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the need to clean up, most of Paris' gardens and
public spaces will be closed until late Monday, the authorities
said. Mayor Jean Tiberi called for the city to be declared a
disaster area and asked for state funds to help with repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day the city's train stations and airports were
filled with holiday travelers, most of them glum and angry as
services were widely disrupted. The airports closed for two hours,
but delays and cancellations continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also shut seven of the city's 14 subway lines as
well as nearly all commuter train services to and from the suburbs.
Paris, which has for days been full to bursting with tourists, was
eerily quiet, and the streets were virtually empty.
</P>
<P>
   The Champs-Elysee, a favorite place to stroll _ which is to be
the focus of this city's millennium celebrations and is already
home to 12 specially erected Ferris wheels _ was shut completely.
The authorities feared that pedestrians might be hit by flying roof
debris.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also helped push hundreds of tons of viscous fuel oil
onto the beaches along France's Atlantic coast, where bad weather
has hindered efforts to contain the damage caused two weeks ago
when a tanker broke up in stormy seas.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the area, France's minister of environment,
Dominique Voynet, said the situation had become very grave. ``What
is really striking,'' she said, ``is the fact that the elements are
against us. You can't take the boats out and do the things you
would like to do to battle this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,000 tons of the tar-like oil are believed to have
escaped from the tanker, but so far, pumping vessels have mopped up
only about 1,000 tons. On the beaches Sunday, hundreds of
volunteers used shovels to pick up globs of the smelly, black oil,
but rough seas just kept delivering more of it.
</P>
<P>
   While stormy weather had been predicted, the force of the winds
took meteorologists by surprise. In Paris, such winds have never
been recorded before, officials said. Nor did they loose strength
as they moved rapidly eastward. The storm, which gathered force
over the Atlantic, apparently hit the Brittany coast at about 4
a.m. Sunday and had crossed France by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   While a storm this strong is ``very unusual,'' it is not
unprecedented, said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania
State University. This one, he said, ``just happened to have all of
the ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a storm system characterized by unusually low
atmospheric pressure, to an extent normally associated with a
hurricane, moved off the Atlantic into Europe, Warner said. Low
pressure is a measure of the intensity of a storm; the lower the
pressure, the worse the storm.
</P>
<P>
   French officials estimated that nearly 2 million households lost
electricity at some point and that nearly half that many would
probably go the night without power.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those hurt or killed were hit by falling debris. In
Paris, one person was gravely injured on the Avenue du Maine when a
piece of a chimney broke off. On Rue de Pergolese two passers-by
were hurt when a building facade collapsed. On the outskirts of
Paris in Versailles, one man was killed when a tree fell on his
car. In Argenteuil, a couple died when the roof of their apartment
building caved in.
</P>
<P>
   And one woman, apparently walking her dog, drowned when she was
swept into a river near Strasbourg. Another woman was apparently
blown into Le Havre harbor.
</P>
<P>
   News broadcasts showed helicopter views of devastation across
the country, where roads were blocked by fallen trees, cars were
crushed under piles of debris, roofs had been ripped off and small
planes had been dragged across runways and tipped upside down.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac expressed his sympathies for the
families who had been hurt in the storm and issued a statement
praising rescue workers. Paris firefighters said they had received
10,000 inquiries and responded to 1,600 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The gale-force winds also swept through parts of Switzerland
reaching 120 mph at some points.
</P>
<P>
   In the ski resort of Crans Montana, one skier was killed and
four injured, two seriously, when an uprooted tree crashed into the
cable of a ski lift, sending the gondola they were in crashing to
the ground. Other deaths included an elderly man blown off his roof
near Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   In southwestern Germany, six people died, most of them in road
accidents caused by fallen trees, including three occupants of a
car hit by a tree near Ettlingen.
</P>
<P>
   High tides and the threat of floods forced about 300 people out
of homes along the south coast of England on Christmas Day. Three
people have died in weather-related incidents in Britain since
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   France's national weather service said rain and strong winds
would continue through Monday but would not reach the levels seen
earlier Sunday.
