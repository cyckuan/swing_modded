 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ His body couldn't move, but his mind raced. And then it
crawled. But it never rested.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Barkley's friends and family finally left him to his
thoughts, but there were too many to cover in one night. He lay
awake all night, the pain in his heart throbbing worse than his
damaged left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was hard,'' Barkley said Thursday. ``After all my
friends left and it was me by myself in the middle of the night, it
was very hard. I didn't sleep at all last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed and frustrated. But last night was
really hard about 3, 4, 5, 6 in the morning. Not much pain.
Obviously I'm in some pain, but the depression No. 1, the
depression of knowing it's over, and the depression of knowing the
next six months I'm going to have of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad, and it's hard. I cried for like three hours
straight last night. It's still hard, and I know it's going to get
harder. My heart is broken. My spirit is broken. I can't sit here
and sugarcoat it. I'm just real down and depressed right now. I
know I have to go on. But it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, for so long an irrepressible, jovial, celebrated lover
of life, was sullen on the day after.
</P>
<P>
   He told himself to remember the good times, to focus on 16 years
in the NBA rather than the end. He heard from friends Michael
Jordan and Tiger Woods, from NBA players John Stockton, Karl Malone
and Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scottie (Pippen) is on my voice mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of quips or good wishes changed the facts, or his
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley ruptured his left quadriceps tendon in the first quarter
of Wednesday's game in Philadelphia, ending his career where it
began. Surgery is scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was over immediately,'' Barkley said. ``You could
just look at it. I said, `Ugh.' I thought when it first happened I
had one of those compound fractures, but I knew it was bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen the replay. I was thinking about that. I'm not
sure I want to see it. It does me no good.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 priority now is to rehab. This is an injury that is
really serious. You can't mess around with the rehab. I know for
the next six months I have to dedicate myself totally to that. I
want to be able to do things, normal things. This is a very serious
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley spoke about the diligence his rehabilitation will
require. But he said the work he must put in would not give him any
thought about playing again. If anything, he said the stunning
events in Philadelphia convinced him the time was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by what I said last night,'' Barkley said. ``I am a
religious person, even though I might not show it or act like it
all the time. I think the big fella is always protecting me and put
me in situations to be successful. There's no doubt in my mind just
the way everything happened last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a really good game in Phoenix last week. I had a really
good game in Houston. They're the last memories of me. I played
good games. Then for it to happen with my mom and grandmother
there, I think it just can't be coincidence the way things
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is profound it started there and ended there.''
</P>
<P>
   Few players have enjoyed the game and NBA life more. But for
Barkley, that made losing it that much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing prepares you for retirement,'' he said. ``It's hard.
All those years I thought about retiring, I could never get the
words out. This year, I forced myself to say it because I knew my
game was coming down and it's important for me not to disrespect
the game. It's very important for me to play at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about a week to say those words publicly. I called
all my friends, hoping one of them would say something to talk me
out of it. They all said, `That's a great decision, good luck to
you.' That lets you know they think you should retire too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss the guys. There's nothing like the
fraternity of players,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to miss the fans. Man, the fans are really good.
People judge the fans by one or two bad people. They should not be
judged by that. I met the most unbelievable people in my lifetime.
Some of them I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he said, he will miss the games. The public and the
friends will remain. His celebrity will endure, and he will
continue to meet the kind of people he has so enjoyed. But he said
he could never replace the 48 minutes on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing basketball when I was 9, and I played almost
every day since then,'' Barkley said. ``One sad thing about being
an athlete, when you retire, you don't play anymore. I'm not one of
those guys (who's) going to join the church league for faded glory.
I know I'm not going to play basketball anymore. That's the thing
I'm probably going to miss the most.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley said his career is complete. Even the lack of a
championship that so many may use to temper his accomplishments
does not detract from his happiness with a sweet, 16-year run. Even
his four seasons in Houston, he said, were more than he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed playing in Houston,'' Barkley said. ``I loved
my coaching staff. They've been terrific. The fans accepted me from
day one. It's just been a blast. I'm glad I got a chance to play
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more, more than I thought it would be. We were older.
We weren't the best. We had one realistic shot at it, the first
year, when Utah beat us in the conference finals. After that, we
were on the downhill of our careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than I expected the way I was appreciated and
respected. It was a unique situation. We had two seven-game series
(when Barkley was with the Phoenix Suns) the years the Rockets won
the championships. They were all-out wars, and I was the villain.
But from the first day I came to Houston, they treated me
unbelievable. That's what I'll remember the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The more he contemplated his career and its turns, the more he
found to remember and to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball has given me everything in the world,'' Barkley
said. ``I'm going to be 37 in a couple of months. I've never had a
real job. I've got great things. I've been all over the world. I
met the most fantastic people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm going to miss. If I could tell the young guys
anything, I hope they appreciate the game. You can take one wrong
step, and it's over. I'm glad my wrong step came after 16 years.''

`LOST SQUADRON' STORY A SNOW JOB 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a frigid tale fit for a nippy day across Arizona. It's
about the ``Lost Squadron,'' a group of eight American planes lost
in a storm over Greenland during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As told by Robert Balling, an Arizona State University climate
expert, the story would seem to debunk claims of global warming and
melting ice in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   I'd describe it as something else: a good snow job.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, 1942, U.S. pilots were flying two B-17 Flying
Fortresses and six P-38 Lightnings from Greenland to England when
bad weather forced them to ditch the planes on Greenland's icecap.
All 25 crewmen survived, but the planes were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several expeditions searched for the aircraft,
estimating they would be found below about 40 feet of snow and ice.
But when they were finally located with the help of subsurface
radar in 1988, the planes were 268 feet below the surface. With the
help of hot water cannons, one of the P-38s, dubbed ``Glacier
Girl,'' was brought up piece by piece in 1992 and is being
restored.
</P>
<P>
   If reports of global warming and shrinking ice sheets are true,
Balling asks in a Web site article, why were the planes buried so
deeply?
</P>
<P>
   ``If those planes were sentient, they would find it hard to
believe all these apocalyptic stories about melting icecaps,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to cite temperature records for that area of
Greenland that show a cooling of 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit during the
50 years before the P-38 was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much of Balling's work, this story was not published in a
peer-reviewed journal, and for good reason. As he concedes, a large
inland accumulation of ice and snow over a half-century doesn't
prove anything about the overall state of Greenland's ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, global warming theory predicts more precipitation as
temperatures rise, and recent studies have found significant
melting in the Great White North. The evidence includes:
</P>
<P>
   A report by Norwegian researchers in the journal Science using
satellite data that show Arctic ice diminished 14 percent in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A study relying on sonar data from nuclear submarines that found
the floating ice cover in the Arctic Ocean was 40 percent thinner
than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the current issue of Science that examined five
different sets of data and concluded that sea ice in the Northern
Hemisphere declined 7 percent in the past 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   A finding by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
that several edges of Greenland's ice sheet have lost 3 to 6 feet
in thickness per year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's best-known global warming critics, Balling
has published 103 peer-reviewed articles, including dozens on
greenhouse gases and warming. The ``Lost Squadron'' story, however,
was written for the Greening Earth Society, a creation of the
Western Fuels Association. Both organizations dispute that fossil
fuels have harmed the global environment.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of his work has been funded by fossil-fuel groups,
Balling has been called a rent-a-scientist who's in bed with the

that his largest current grant, $500,000, came from the National

</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it all goes through peer-review, and anything
industry-funded is likely to be held to a higher standard,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Balling correctly warns that people shouldn't leap to
conclusions based on any single study. He points out that ice
masses are constantly thinning and thickening, and the net change
isn't easy to measure. Any warming, he contends, could be the
result of increased solar output just as likely as human activity.
</P>
<P>
   We should be skeptical of ``bold, simplistic pronouncements
about global warming,'' Balling says, and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   We should be no less skeptical of glib anecdotes from Greenland
more likely to mislead than inform. &QL;

TITANS TOP RAIDERS, 21-14 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The Tennessee Titans found themselves in a battle
with the Oakland Raiders where the offenses looked worn, and the
defenses appeared pumped with enthusiasm. All night, big plays, and
points, would be scarce.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect setup for running back Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   They call him the Beast. He has always loved cracking open tough
games and tough defenses. Ride me, he demands. Fifty carries is too
little for him, he insists. And on a night like Thursday night,
where George felt it, sensed it, running with direction and purpose
and authority through the Raiders' defense, 28 carries would prove
just enough.
</P>
<P>
   That got him 199 total rushing yards and the Titans three
rushing touchdowns (two by George) in the second half. Tennessee
jumped to a 21-7 lead with 8 minutes 1 second remaining and wound
up winning, 21-14, before 66,357 fans at Adelphia Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee improved to 10-3. Oakland fell to 6-7, a big loss for
a team confident that it is of playoff caliber.
</P>
<P>
   George scored on runs of 8 and 19 yards that helped fend off
Oakland's comeback. He hit the holes, read the defense, ran low and
fast and with such force that by game's end, he had nearly matched
his career-best rushing day of 216 yards. He also caught six passes
for 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a monstrous game from the Beast.
</P>
<P>
   The final quarter served as the final push that would separate
these teams. It was set up by the Raiders finally figuring out a
way to get into the end zone in the third quarter, on a 10-play,
90-yard drive. The critical play was a 50-yard run off a swing pass
by Napolean Kaufman. He ran up the left sideline and in blinding
speed down to the Tennessee 2-yard line, where he was tackled by
cornerback Denard Walker. Zack Crockett then scored from the 1-yard
line and the score was tied at 7-7 with 2:36 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee had scored a touchdown on the previous possession.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back scores in the third quarter? That was a complete
turnabout from the game's first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were scoreless at halftime, despite big plays by the
Oakland offense. Too many of the plays were bungled. Tennessee did
not have to worry about blown scoring chances _ for the entire
half, it never moved the football past the Raiders' 41.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Husted is a seven-year place-kicker from Virginia who
could be in his last season with Oakland unless he rediscovers his
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Husted entered the game having missed at least one field goal
attempt in each of his last four games. Make it five. And two
misses in the first half in this one. The first came after Oakland
had driven from its 37 to the Tennessee 14. Husted tried a 32-yard
field goal with 25 seconds left in the quarter. It hooked wide
left.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, the Raiders took the ball at their
21 and drove to the Tennessee 27. They took nearly 7 minutes
getting there. With 4:47 left before halftime, Husted tried a
45-yard field goal. That attempt missed short and to the left.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the missed chances for Oakland, however, was Rich
Gannon's fumble at the Tennessee 8. It came with only 35 seconds
left in the half, with the Raiders ready to leave for halftime
ahead. But Gannon scrambled on a second-and-4 play, was sacked by
Jevon Kearse and lost the ball to cornerback Samari Rolle.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland dominated in the first half in first downs (9 to 4),
total yards (204 to 99), passing yards (133 to 44) and in
possession time (17:25 to 12:35). The Raiders knew they would
regret the lost chances. They simply hoped they could overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, though, made the Raiders pay with a touchdown drive
to open the third quarter.

WITNESSES PLEAD FOR FALA
 TER'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix - Former co-workers, rela tives and friends implored a
judge Thursday not to end Scott Falater's life, which they said was
exemplary until that bizarre night in 1997 when he stabbed his wife
to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most compassionate, caring boss that I've ever
had,'' said Wyvaughna Mullins, a shipping clerk at Motorola, where
Falater was an electronics engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the calm, level-headed one,'' said Michael
Vines, who befriended Scott and Yarmila Falater 20 years ago when
the couple were living in Illinois. ``He just had the greatest
heart of any man, I think, I have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins and Vines were two of 11 witnesses who testified on the
first day of a sentencing hearing for Falater, who was convicted in
June of first-degree murder. The 44-year-old father of two faces
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member jury rejected the defense claim that he was sleep
walking when he stabbed Yarmila dozens of times, dragged her into
the backyard pool and held her head underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his fate is in the hands of Judge Ronald Reinstein, who is
weighing the circumstances of the crime before deciding from three
options: the death penalty, life with no chance for parole, or life
with the possibility of parole after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Juan Martinez is attempt ing to convince Reinstein
that the murder meets the state death penalty standard because it
was ``especially heinous, cruel or depraved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense attorneys Mi chael Kimerer and Lori Voepel
argue that the ``mitigating circumstances'' in Falater's life
should persuade Reinstein to impose the least severe sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez launched the hearing by guiding a county medical
examiner through a graphic description of the 44 stab wounds that
punctured Yarmila Falater's upper body with a hunting knife.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was so fierce that two of the wounds penetrated to
the hilt of the 5-inch blade, according to the testimony of Dr. Ann
Bucholtz.
</P>
<P>
   Bucholtz, spoke in calm, clinical terms, holding up autopsy
photos and explaining that the cause of death was ``multiple stab
wounds with asphyxiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez attempted to establish the attack's cruelty by arguing
that Falater left his wife to die while he returned to the house,
washed the blood from his hands and arms and stashed his crimsoned
clothes in the wheel well of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   After Bucholtz's testimony, defense attorneys began questioning
their 20 witnesses. The testimonials about Falater's character will
resume Mon day.
</P>
<P>
   All expressed bewilderment about the killing and disbelief that
Falater acted consciously that night, after having what his two
teenage children said at trial was a calm dinner at home. All urged
the judge to spare the life of a man whose son and daughter have
already lost their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and Megan adore this man, and they need him desper
ately,'' said Cheri Allen, who knows the family through Mormon
Church activities. She described Falater as ``a kind, devoted,
loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez challenged all the defense witnesses. Some had only a
superfi cial acquaintanceship with the Fala ters, he said, and none
could truly understand what happened inside the Falater home.
</P>
<P>
   He said Falater was responsible for the suffering of Megan and
Michael, who were described by Falater's mother as ``devastated''
in the kill ing's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Thursday that the placid surface of the Falater
home concealed tensions and turmoil seething beneath.
</P>
<P>
   He described Yarmila as a strong-willed, independent woman who
re sented a church to which her hus band was devoted. He suggested
that Yarmila was weighing a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense witnesses said they saw no indication of
domestic stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was crazy about her,'' Allen said.

about global warming,'' Balling says, and he's right.

HANFORD PICKED AS LOW-LEVEL NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELA GALLOWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The federal government wants to nearly triple the
amount of radioactive waste shipped into the Hanford nuclear
reservation, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After years of study, the Department of Energy plans to announce
Friday that it has picked Hanford as one of two sites to dispose of
low-level nuclear waste, some of which also is contaminated by
hazardous chemicals such as industrial solvents.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford, in eastern Washington, and the Nevada Test Site near
Las Vegas were chosen from six potential disposal sites, according
to an Energy Department document to be distributed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The news was no surprise to state officials, but they called it
disappointing. The governor and state attorney general, among
others, said they would do what they could to get the federal
government to focus on their priority: cleaning up Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state has contributed heavily to the nuclear defense of
the United States for a long time. We've never shirked that
obligation. But, having said that, we do want to be treated
fairly,'' said Sheryl Hutchison, a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Ecology. `` ... We want to see a very good commitment
to cleaning up the messes from the past. This obviously adds to
what's over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanford was built in 1943 to produce plutonium for the world's
first atomic weapons. The government stopped making plutonium there
in 1987. Today, the highly contaminated 560-square-mile site is the
world's largest environmental cleanup project. The Energy
Department plans to spend 50 years and $100 billion cleaning it.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said her department would respond within a few weeks
to the Energy Department's decision, which is not final for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it cleaned up and we feel like the onus is on them to
demonstrate to us why (taking in more waste for disposal) is a good
idea,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not give the state clear authority to stop
disposal of federal low-level waste, Hutchison said. It does have
limited authority over whether to accept low-level waste combined
with hazardous chemicals, which is called mixed low-level waste,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke has asked Attorney General Christine Gregoire to
explore if the state can limit the disposal, said Ed Penhale, a
Locke spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as (the federal) DOE continues to drag its feet on the
cleanup, then there's no incentive for us to willingly accept this
waste,'' Penhale said. `` ... We are in negotiations about the tank
waste cleanup and we can bring this new issue into those
discussions and link them.''
</P>
<P>
   And the attorney general's office is not counting itself out,
said David Mears, chief of the office's ecology division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an uphill battle, but we're not yet ready to
concede that we don't have any leverage,'' Mears said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Energy officials would not comment on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   An Energy Department report says Hanford and the Nevada site
were chosen based on ``low impacts to human health, increased
operational flexibility and lower implementation costs.'' They were
also selected for their ``ability to dispose of a wide range of
radionuclides as well as expansion capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Energy Department determined it needed to find a
place to dispose of 1 million cubic meters of low-level waste plus
176,000 cubic meters of mixed low-level waste, according to the
Energy Department fact sheet to be distributed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agency's plan, such as where the waste should be
stored on the Hanford site, are still unclear, Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, Hutchison said, that the agency plans to send an
average of 3,889 cubic meters of low-level waste to Hanford each
year for 18 years. In addition, it wants to dump 5,556 cubic meters
of mixed low-level waste there annually, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford already accepts about 5,500 cubic meters of low-level
waste from other sites each year, but no mixed waste. One Hanford
facility, run by the Energy Department, takes in about 2,000 cubic
meters of low-level waste each year. A commercial site there, U.S.
Ecology Inc., accepts another 3,500 cubic meters of low-level
waste, mostly debris from decommissioned nuclear plants such as
Oregon's Trojan nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Low-level waste generally includes irradiated clothing, tools,
dirt and debris left over from nuclear power generation and weapons
construction. It is usually shipped in barrels via trucks and
train. Low-level waste is relatively safe, when compared to the
high-level radioactivity of liquid, solid and chemical waste such
as spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest terms, while low-level waste can be fairly
dangerous, it's not usually an immediate health risk if covered
with something like a tarpaulin. High-level waste, on the other
hand, requires containment, often by steel or concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford watchdog groups condemned the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Pollet, executive director of the Heart of America
Northwest, called it a ``fool-hardy'' compromise intended to
convince Congress to fund Hanford's clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making us the nation's nuclear waste dump to clean up what
they already are supposed to clean,'' Pollet said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Carpenter, West Coast director of the Government
Accountability Project, added of Hanford, ``It's got enough
problems. Hanford is wasted enough.''

MURRAY BACK TO KICK, NOT TO CARRY TORCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Eddie Murray isn't the least bit interested in
carrying a torch for all you middle-aged males out there.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a modern-day George Blanda. He's much too young for
that.
</P>
<P>
   At 43, Murray is merely the oldest player in the NFL (three
months older than Kansas City quarterback Warren Moon) and tied for
the fifth-oldest player in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   But his fortysomething mind is strictly set on helping the
Cowboys change what has become an old storyline this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, 6-6, have lost four games in which they've held the
opposition to 13 points or less. Richie Cunningham, who was waived
Tuesday because of his inconsistency, missed five field goals in
those four low-scoring losses and missed 10 of 22 altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to prove that 43-year-olds should be able to do
something, and I'm not on the bandwagon for people in their 40s,''
Murray said. ``I've come back into the league, hopefully, to add
some stability and help this team get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 24 years since Hall of Famer Blanda retired as the
NFL's all-time leading scorer. He was 48. He also was an national
icon for millions of middle-aged males in this country through the
first half of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who was known as Eddie Money when he kicked for the
Cowboys in 1993 and helped win a Super Bowl, has not kicked
competitively for 23 months. His last NFL job was with the 1997
Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   He officially retired this past June with Detroit, after signing
a day earlier just so he could retire with the team for whom he
spent two-thirds (1980-91) of his 18-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire was always still there to kick,'' Murray said. ``I
was 41 when I last played. I'm 43 now. I can't do anything about
that. I can't change my age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I don't know what a 43-year-old is supposed to kick
like ... because I see younger (kickers) out there who are having
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is six years older than the next-oldest player on the
Cowboys (Dale Hellestrae, 37) and two years older than his position
coach, Steve Hoffman. Murray and Hoffman have remained close
friends from their days together in '93, talking as often as twice
a month.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hoffman who told Murray that if any kicking change was to
be made with the struggling Cunningham that the Lions would have to
give Murray his release.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Cunningham miss a potential game-tying field goal from
43 yards in the Cowboys' 13-6 loss at New England on national
television Sunday night, Murray phoned Hoffman on Monday morning.
Then he phoned Chuck Schmidt, the Lions' VP/chief operating
officer, and received his release. All that was left was for Murray
to clear waivers, which he did on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who has continued to live in the Detroit area, has been
a sideline radio reporter for Lions games.
</P>
<P>
   He was contacted by Washington and Cleveland before training
camp this summer to see if he was interested in coming out of
retirement, which motivated him to start an indoor kicking regimen
at his home gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Leg strength? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kicking 50-yard field goals,'' said Murray,
dismissing questions about distance with his own philosophy about
success. ``My thought has always been in ``making'' field goals,
not on how far they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he added, ``there aren't that many 50-yard field
goals being attempted these days in the NFL, with the rule change
and the ball being put back at the spot of the (missed) kick. That
puts a premium on making the kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because the Cowboys want me to make those kicks from
43 yards and in.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder Eric Bjornson worked with Murray and long-snapper
Hellestrae on Thursday and, in spite of gusting winds, everything
looked right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not picky about the laces or anything,'' said Bjornson,
adding, ``neither was Richie. We should be smooth Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray ranks third all-time in the NFL in career field goals of
50 yards and more. He has 21. Yet, if the Cowboys need to launch a
55-yarder at the end of a half, it will probably be punter Toby
Gowin who will try it.
NFL OLDIES
</P>
<P>
   At age 43, Cowboys kicker Eddie Murray becomes the oldest player
in the NFL (three months older than Kansas City QB Warren Moon).
Only four players in the history of the NFL have played at an older
age. Here's the list: Age Pos. Player Last season/Team 48 QB-PK
George Blanda 1975 Oakland Raiders 45 PK Ben Agajanian 1964 San

U.S. EXPELLING RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT IN BUGGING OF STATE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for new 12th graf providing additional details on
counterintelligence operation) 
(jw) 
By DAVID JOHNSTON and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department said Thursday that it had
ordered the expulsion of a Russian diplomat who was apprehended
outside the department's headquarters with electronic equipment for
monitoring a listening device hidden in a conference room used by
senior American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The order to expel Stanislav Borisovich Grusev, an employee of
the Russian Embassy here, came after a long investigation that also
uncovered a tiny sophisticated transmitter on the top floor of the
State Department, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said their investigation had uncovered a
``very aggressive'' Russian intelligence operation that represented
a serious penetration of the State Department. The FBI and the
department are still trying to determine the extent of the damage
to national security from the eavesdropping operation, which may
have been running for months before it was detected early this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the case marked the first time that the
State Department headquarters was known to have been successfully
penetrated with listening devices by a foreign intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   FBI counterintelligence agents detained Grusev on Wednesday in a
public park across the street from the State Department. Grusev,
identified by the federal authorities as an embassy attache, was a
technical expert from the SVR, or Russian foreign intelligence
service, officials said. He was not charged with any crime, and was
quickly turned over to Russian officials after he invoked
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were later directed to remove Grusev from the
United States within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, a senior FBI official in charge of
counterintelligence operations, told reporters at the State
Department that investigators first became suspicious of Grusev
almost by accident early last summer when an FBI surveillance team
working on another case noticed him outside the department. The FBI
agents recognized him from their surveillance of Russian Embassy
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made an observation that Stanislav Grusev was standing in
the vicinity of the State Department, and it took them as a little
bit odd, and they just remembered that very brief observation and
came back and developed a surveillance strategy,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said the FBI had information before Grusev
was detected that led them to suspect a Russian operation was under
way at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, FBI agents watched how Grusev often drove up to the
department, got out of his car and walked around in the surrounding
streets and parks. Gallagher said that Grusev always parked his car
_ with diplomatic license plates _ in the same location, and that
that action had attracted the attention of surveillance agents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Agents documented his movements around the State Department, the
frequency of his visits and the activity surrounding his car, and
concluded that the Russians had planted an electronic eavesdropping
device inside the department. After a search lasting several weeks,
a transmitter that Gallagher said was a ``very sophisticated'' and
``sensitive technical'' piece of espionage equipment was found this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   American counterintelligence agents had been controlling the
operation for the last few months, making sure that no important
and sensitive meetings were held in the conference room and that
some misleading statements were made so they could be detected by
the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode should be a stark reminder to all of us in
government that despite the thawing of tensions between competing
nations, government facilities and personnel remain a desirable
target for foreign intelligence services,'' Assistant Secretary of
State David Carpenter told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the investigation of Grusev began
months before the recent espionage incidents that evoked the Cold
War practice of retaliatory expulsions. In late November, the
Russian authorities expelled an employee at the American Embassy in
Moscow after they said they had found her carrying spy
paraphernalia, including a device designed to detect signals of
electronic surveillance gear.
</P>
<P>
   And just before that, a Navy enlisted man who had worked at the
super-secret National Security Agency was arrested and charged with
passing secrets to Moscow about American submarine espionage
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they did not know how long ago
the listening device had been installed at the State Department or
who might have planted it. Officials said they had no suspects
under investigation who might have aided the operation from the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials described the potential damage as serious, but it
was unclear what conversations might have been monitored by the
Russians. Officials said that 50 to 100 meetings might have been
held in the conference room since the time that Grusev was thought
to have begun his activities.
</P>
<P>
   Grusev entered the United States in March, but officials said
the listening device could have already been in place by that time.
He may have been sent to Washington to continue an eavesdropping
operation already under way.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the FBI would study the listening device to
look for clues about when it was installed. Officials are also
studying logs of meetings held in the conference room to determine
who had access there.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated eavesdropping device was carefully installed
in a hidden location that was not visible, officials said Thursday.
They said the installation required tools and a high level of
technical skill and could not have been completed in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials theorized that whoever planted the listening device
had probably entered the conference area more than once, and
probably at a time when the State Department allowed authorized
visitors to move throughout the building without an escort. The
department tightened its policy on allowing unescorted visitors in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Grusev's visits to the State Department did not appear to be
timed to eavesdrop on particular meetings, which the officials said
suggested that the Russians did not have inside information in
advance about high-level meetings. The device could work only when
activated from close range, and could not store previously recorded
conversations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was caught, Grusev had hidden in his clothing a remote
switching device that turned on a receiver and tape recorder in his
car and a device designed to detect electronic surveillance
signals.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Bob Pruett, who produced a Division I-AA national championship and
some of the nation's most explosive offenses in Division I-A in
four seasons at Marshall University, will be the next head football
coach at the University of Houston.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two sources close to the university said Thursday night that
Pruett has agreed to leave Marshall, his alma mater, to succeed Kim
Helton as coach of the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, 57, who was in Orlando, Fla., on Thursday night with his
quarterback, Heisman Trophy finalist Chad Pennington, for a college
football awards program at the Walt Disney World Resort, would not
comment on reports of his hiring at UH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not have any comment on the situation until the Heisman
Trophy ceremony on Saturday,'' he told television station WSAZ in
Huntington, W.Va. ``That's the most important thing with Marshall
football right now. I won't comment until I talk with the
administration, my coaches and my team on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   UH athletic director Chet Gladchuk was unavailable for comment
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett is expected to receive a multiyear contract, probably at
least five years, for an estimated $500,000 annually. He recently
agreed to a seven-year contract at Marshall with a $1 million
annuity after turning down an invitation to interview for the
then-vacant job at Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is ranked No. 11 in the nation by the Associated Press
and will play BYU in the Motor City Bowl on Dec. 27. In four
seasons under Pruett, Marshall is 49-4 with a Division I-AA
national title, three Mid-American Conference Eastern Division
titles and two MAC titles.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the first day under state hiring policies that the new
UH coach could be announced.
</P>
<P>
   UH's ninth head coach, Pruett will succeed Helton, who was
dismissed Nov. 21 after seven seasons with two years remaining on
his $300,000-a-year agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett arrived at Marshall after serving as a defensive
coordinator at Florida when Jim Donnan was hired away from Marshall
by Georgia. Marshall currently has a 16-game winning streak and has
won 31 in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the MAC title game, which the Thundering Herd won 34-30
over Western Michigan, Marshall's offense ranked fourth in the
nation in total offense at 471.4 yards per game. Pennington was
fifth in the nation in total offense at 326.2 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's most prominent player of the Pruett era was wide
receiver Randy Moss, now with the Minnesota Vikings. Teaming with
Pennington in 1997, Moss caught 90 passes for 1,647 yards and 25
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two years at Florida, Pruett was defensive
coordinator at Tulane in 1992-93 and an assistant at Mississippi,
Wake Forest and Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Perry, Marshall's interim president, announced Nov. 24
that Pruett had signed a new seven-year contract, quelling
speculation that the coach would leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned that rumors about him considering another
position would damage his recruiting efforts,'' Perry said. ``He
asked that I make today's announcement to try to put an end to such
rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett was to be paid $132,000 per year at Marshall, including
incentives based on game attendance and promotions. An annuity was
established for him through the private Marshall University
Foundation Inc., but he would have had to remain at the school
through the 2002-03 school year to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia state law prevents the university from issuing
multiyear contracts, but additional payments to Pruett were to be
guaranteed by the private foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Pruett downplayed reports that he would seek to
leave his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been here, I've always looked for reasons to stay
at Marshall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett's arrival at UH will end a week of rumors that only
seemed to accelerate Thursday. In the latest round, Kansas State
officials denied a broadcast report that Wildcats coach Bill Snyder
was headed to UH.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Max Urick, K-State's athletic director, said of
the Snyder report: ``There is no truth to the rumor.'' Snyder was
at a Holiday Bowl function preceding the Wildcats' Dec. 28 date
with Washington, then was going to Orlando for the same awards show
attended by Pruett and Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State coach Tony Samuel also surfaced in speculation
for the job. Samuel, who had been a candidate for the Texas Tech
job until withdrawing Dec. 3, never mentioned interest in the
Cougars position, but his status as a former assistant coach at
Nebraska for Tom Osborne led to the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne made a brief stop at UH last week at the request of
Gladchuk in a consultant's role. Gladchuk then denied on Tuesday
that the job would be offered to Osborne after a Nebraska radio
station reported that Osborne was headed to UH to accept a $1
million-a-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State athletic director Brian Faison said Thursday
that UH never requested permission to talk to Samuel, who just
completed the third season of a four-year contract. Faison said the
school and Samuel are in the process of working out a contract
extension.

   DETROIT _ The Dodgers haven't had roommates on the road since
the late '70s. By his own admission, Wilt Chamberlain had a lot of
roommates during his NBA career, but none of them were Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the NHL, things are a little different. Los Angeles Kings
captain Rob Blake bunks with Matty Norstrom. Luc Robitaille rooms
with Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Salary and status don't matter. Only goalies get their own
rooms. Goalies and veteran defenseman Garry Galley. He could win a
Stanley Cup for snoring.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition is king in the NHL and this season the Kings have
taken this togetherness and built a winner by playing well out of
town. At home there is distance and distractions, players living
anywhere from Encino to Hermosa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, every minute is choreographed from a mandatory
mid-day team meal to a pregame nap back at the hotel. There even is
time set aside for a snack before everyone leaves for the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, all that bonding goes out the window if you
snore,'' Galley said with a grin. ``It's something we've all grown
up with in hockey. There is a compatibility. When you're running
with somebody on the road, it helps on the ice. It's nice to have
someone to talk to. All that builds a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it didn't work. But this year, I think everyone knew
if we were going to be as good as we're capable of being, we had to
play well on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the place where this once-fractured team began bonding
opening night in Nashville on Oct. 2 and really jelled during a
seven-game trip to start the season. The Kings are 8-3-3 on the
road entering tonight's game against the Detroit Red Wings at Joe
Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they were 14-25-2 away from home and missed the
playoffs for the fifth time in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A tightly knit schedule created by tightly wound coach new coach
Andy Murray has provided structure. Victories are enjoyed, losses
are dissected. And the night before every game on the road, a
scouting report is slipped under the door of each player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very thorough,'' general manager Dave Taylor said of
Murray. ``He not only has broken down tendencies about the other
team, he has the team already thinking about the game the night
before.''
</P>
<P>
   After replacing Larry Robinson, Murray brought in a new coaching
staff and had seven new players. He stressed accountability as much
as fundamentals. There were motivational tapes and uptempo
speeches. It has been a hands-on approach and so far the players
have responded.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings played well in training camp, but Taylor knew it would
be a long season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got a great opportunity to come together by opening
the season with those games on the road,'' he said. ``The Staples
Center wasn't open. It was a good chance for everyone to get to
know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new faces were Ziggy Palffy and Bryan Smolinski, who
came over from the New York Islanders last summer. Defenseman Aki
Berg returned from a season playing in Finland. Norstrom came back
after missing all of training camp because of a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ignore that we really improved talentwise,'' Blake
said. ``We have a lot more ability to get out of losing streaks.
But that first trip was a huge confidence builder. It made us
believe we could win anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, game days begin around 10 a.m. with a bus ride to
the arena or a practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes of stretching, players hit the ice for what is
aptly termed the ``morning skate.'' It was designed years ago to
keep players from carousing the night before. Now it allows players
to get loose and often is optional as the season wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is back to the hotel, where a meal is catered for the
club in one of the ballrooms. There is an afternoon nap built into
the schedule and a snack that helps players build reserves for the
night ahead. Off to the rink at 5 p.m. with game time at 7 or 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule is very important,'' Murray said. ``It gives
players focus that they might not have at home.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it really build a winner? They did all that last year,
but it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of training camp, I really keyed on that first game in
Nashville,'' Murray said. ``All through camp we had Nashville signs
all over the dressing room. We had their lineup up about 10 days
before the game. This was a measuring stick for our team. We wanted
to be a harder-working team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what playing on the road is all about. Hard work.
That's why Nashville was the perfect place to open the season. Last
year, they outworked us and beat us three times. We felt that might
be as important a game as we play all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings opened the season 3-1-1 before taking a week break and
heading to Calgary and Edmonton. Another impressive stretch came in
late October during a three-city swing through the East and
Midwest. The Kings beat the Pittsburgh Penguins, then tied Detroit
the next night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you eat together, sleep together and go to meetings
together, it's easier to focus,'' Galley said. ``On the road,
that's your life.''

NBA LOSES RASCAL, GEM WHEN BARKLEY RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was not enough notebook paper to cover Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   And so he retired Wednesday night. A knee injury in Philadelphia
brought a sudden end to one of the most colorful careers since,
well, Redd Foxx. Charles might chuckle at the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   He was crass and yet he could be so disarming. He could be
``Outrageous,'' as his autobiography is titled, and yet his words
could be so profound.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time _ on NBC _ when he railed about TV _ namely, NBC _
showing ``too many Lakers games.''
</P>
<P>
   Or like the frequent answer he would give when it appeared that
his remarkable, 16-year NBA career would not be crowned by a
championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that a ring would do,'' he said, ``is make me
not have to answer that question anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He came so far, from a corpulent college kid that Southeastern
Conference crowds used to taunt as ``Fat Albert'' to Sir Charles,
one of the 50 greatest NBA players of all-time, as named in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, Indiana scoundrel Bobby Knight cut Barkley
from the 1984 Olympic team. And it's just as well. Eight years
later in Barcelona, Spain, early in the Dream Team's opening game,
Charles threw an elbow to the chops of an Algerian forward _ ``to
let him know we weren't here on any vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had a way of saying what was on his mind, whether David
Stern had the fine meter running or not. He could be cruel, but the
people who know him quickly add that he could be kind.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, they say, nobody in the NBA signed more autographs for
kids than Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody did as much with so little.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Barkley was listed as 6 feet, 6 inches, and 252
pounds. Unofficially, his bald pate never reached the 6-5 mark. Yet
Barkley scored more than 20,000 NBA points, grabbed 10,000 rebounds
and had 4,000 assists, and the only others to do so were Wilt
Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, both 7-foot giants.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches like to say that rebounding is 10 percent height and 90
percent desire. On the basketball floor, Sir Charles was a blazing
furnace of desire. For a guy who wasn't good enough for Bobby
Knight, Barkley did just fine, making the All-NBA team 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fifth pick in the 1984 draft, a memorable talent pool
that included Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and John Stockton.
The irony shadowed him to the end.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley was with the Philadelphia 76ers, making the
playoffs six times in eight years, there were always the Bulls and
Michael. When Barkley was with the Phoenix Suns, there was always
Hakeem and the Rockets. And when he joined Houston three years ago,
the unscaled hurdle became Stockton's Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have no regrets,'' Barkley said in Philadelphia after
his final game. ``I have nothing but 16 years of great memories.
I've been all over the world. I've met unbelievable people who I
would never have gotten the opportunity to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met some of the best actors in the world. I met some of the
best athletes in the world. I met presidents, Bishop (Desmond)
Tutu. I met just regular people who made an impact on my life. I
played in two Olympics. I've exceeded all my expectations, all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was cast by his critics as selfish and disruptive. Yes, he
could be all of that. But nobody, maybe not even Jordan, wanted to
win more.
</P>
<P>
   He was, like his book said, outrageous. He was, as far as
commissioner Stern was concerned, the anti-Jordan in some ways. He
once tossed a heckler through the window of an Orlando night spot.
He broke the nose of a drunk who wouldn't shut up in a bar in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But life, for Charles Barkley, clearly was a participation
sport.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barkley, wasn't it, who spilled the beans about golf
partner Jordan's retirement? And when it was time to sign his last
contract, Sir Charles inked his at the Tamarisk Country Club, where
he couldn't bear to leave the Bob Hope Classic. Barkley had his
agent meet him with the contract on the 10th hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was so right that his mother and grandmother were with him
Wednesday night, flown in from Alabama to Philadelphia for the
franchise's final farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the postgame press conference in a golf cart, Barkley
sighed and observed, ``Just what America needs _ one more
unemployed black man.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball just got a lot duller.

UNION HEAD HOPES SMITH CAN PLAY SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ NBA union leader Billy Hunter is devising a plan to get
Mavericks rookie Leon Smith back on the basketball court as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Hunter is making sure Smith stays in the National
Basketball Players Association after-care players assistance
program.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is at an undisclosed Dallas hospital receiving psychiatric
treatment. Hunter would not identify the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is doing well, and we're going to continue to monitor
his situation and help manage his affairs,'' Hunter said. ``I have
had some discussions with the league and with the team, and
hopefully we're going to be able to work this thing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ambition is to make sure Leon is well. And once Leon has
been given a clean bill of health, the idea is to make sure he's
able to put himself in a training program that we're going to
monitor and set up for him in consultation with the league, and at
least keep them and the Mavericks aware of what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he doesn't know when Smith will be ready to go
through such a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might take the remainder of this season,'' he said. ``I'm
hoping it doesn't take that long. Hopefully, from the first day of
the program, Leon will be able to demonstrate that he's ready to
come back to the NBA.'' TRENT UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Gary Trent watch continues.
</P>
<P>
   Trent tore his hamstring during an Oct. 21 preseason game
against Toronto, and the Dec. 2 target date for his expected return
has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks medical staff still doesn't know when Trent will
play. But they're hoping he will return during the five-game
homestand, which starts Saturday against Jason Kidd and the Phoenix
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Trent practiced for the first time since his injury on Monday,
and a fitness test he took Tuesday indicated that the leg has
healed. Now it appears it's just a matter of Trent getting in
basketball shape. FINLEY IN MINI-SLUMP
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 30.3 points per game recently against Chicago,
Minnesota and Milwaukee, Michael Finley has slipped a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games against Vancouver and Utah, Finley has
scored 17 and 11 points, respectively. That's just the second time
this season he has scored fewer than 20 points in consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   During consecutive games earlier this season, Finley followed a
19-point effort against the Los Angeles Lakers with a season-low
4-point outing against the Miami Heat. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson has used nine
different starting lineups this season. The lineup of Michael
Finley, Dirk Nowitzki, Sean Rooks, Robert Pack and Erick Strickland
is 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 79 points the Mavericks scored in Wednesday's six-point
loss to Utah was their lowest-scoring game of the season. It also
was only the second time the Mavericks have been under 90 points
this season _ the other time being a 107-82 shellacking at the
hands of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mavericks scored 100 or more points in six of their first
eight games, but have topped the century mark only three times in
the past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mavericks lead the NBA in free-throw shooting at 79.6
percent, but are last in the league in points allowed at 103.7 per
game. nn

STARS HOPE TO IMPROVE ON PAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Stars' third defensive pair is Jamie
Pushor and Brad Lukowich, but you aren't likely to see them on t together too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it being a pair right now. There are too many
errors there,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``If they can play
better, they are going to get more minutes and it's going to help
us. If this is as good as they can play, then from that pair we're
going to need more.''
</P>
<P>
   With rookie defenseman Richard Jackman sent down to their
minor-league affiliate Thursday, the Stars are going to find out
how good the two can be.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have only six defensemen on the roster. They have
compensated by having their top defensive pair of Derian Hatcher
and Richard Matvichuk play their shift and then an extra shift
alongside either Pushor or Lukowich.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock acknowledges that their top four defensemen can't
keep playingthat many minutes without wearing out. Hatcher is among
the leaders in the NHL in ice-time.
</P>
<P>
   So it's sink or swim for Pushor and Lukowich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope me and Push can become a pair together and not worry
about having Hatch or Matty being out there,'' Lukowich said.
``It's almost like they're a dad or a babysitter. I don't want to
be a guy that has to be babysat on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lukowich and Pushor can prove they don't need to be
``babysat,'' Hitchcock said he'll send them out together and
increase their minutes. If not, the Stars may have make a trade to
solidify that third defensive pair, Stars general manager Bob
Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a situation we'll give more time for a couple of
reasons,'' Gainey said. ``No. 1, give some players time to get
comfortable and show improvement and also give (injured defenseman)
Shawn Chambers a little more time. We'll have a clearer idea a
month or so from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, of course, is the missing piece in the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't begin the season planning to depend on Pushor,
in his first season with Dallas, and Lukowich, in his first full
season period, as their third pair. Pushor, Lukowich and Chambers
were supposed to be the fifth, sixth and seventh defensemen, but
Chambers has missed most of the season after having knee surgery in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody said Shawn Chambers is a definite player on the
15th of January, I'd feel great. But we can't tell that and neither
can Shawn,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's right now a big question
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers admits as much, saying that he has ``no idea how it's
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, the Stars have to bank on Pushor and Lukowich
developing into a strong, third defensive pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take that bet,'' Pushor said. ``Brad and I are ready for
that role. That's what we want. I know that Brad is capable of it,
and I'm capable of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushor also realizes that his play early on didn't show that.
The fourth-year player struggled from the get-go until finally
finding himself among the healthy scratches for a couple of games
in late November and early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you get out of the lineup that's kind of, for any
athlete, I don't want to say rock bottom, but it makes you take a
hard look,'' Pushor said. ``You realize you have to come back and
do the things you are supposed to do. I know I can definitely
improve and become the player they want me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hitchcock: ``I think he lost some confidence and we lost
some confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's confidence in Pushor has been growing lately,
though. He has played back-to-back strong games, and teamed with
Lukowich for seven or eight shifts in Monday's game against
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you noticed in the Phoenix game, until Luke got hurt, we
were using them as a pair,'' Stars assistant coach Rick Wilson
said. ``We'd like to see them get up to a point where they can give
us a very sound 10 minutes of even-strength hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushor and Lukowich would like nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps in the long run if he and I can be a
consistent pair together,'' Lukowich said. ``Right now, Hatch is
playing 30 minutes, leading the league I think, but maybe if we
take four of those minutes ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't finish the sentence. He realizes the way to get those
minutes is to prove that he and Pushor can do the job _ by
themselves. The time is now. The chance has presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   Can they become a pair in more than name only?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Hitchcock said. ``I guess it's a matter of how
much they can improve.'' nn

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ Charles Barkley's will is sure to contain a passage asking
that those attending his funeral smile, tell jokes openly and laugh
loudly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barkley's playing career ended Wednesday in Philadelphia. After
surgery and a long, painstaking rehabilitation, his life will go on
pretty much as he has planned. And as mourners will someday be
expected to laugh, his teammates now will be called on to play.
</P>
<P>
   In a season of injuries to their stars, fines, a suspension and
Wednesday's painful irony, the Rockets find themselves trying to
move on. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley stayed with the team and will attend tonight's game in
Boston against the Celtics. Meanwhile, Hakeem Olajuwon is more than
a month from returning after hernia surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Only three players from last season's team _ Matt Bullard,
Cuttino Mobley and Bryce Drew _ will take the court tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But life will go on. It just won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every negative, you have opportunity,'' coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``I heard something the other day: Stumbling
blocks and steppingstones can be the same thing. It depends on
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year came early.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are not conceding this year, Tomjanovich and the
players say. But the team is not likely to seek stopgap solutions.
Asked if he would consider picking up a player whose age made him a
short-term fix, Tomjanovich said, ``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' immediate move was to add Devin Gray, a rookie
forward who has been playing in the Continental Basketball
Association after showing great promise with the Rockets' summer
team in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But without Barkley and the multitude of ways he led the
Rockets, the transition will be significant, even if the roster
remains relatively unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be 62 games of experience for these guys,''
Tomjanovich said of the rest of the regular season. ``It's almost a
bonus for the young guys. They're going to have to learn to grow up
quickly and mature quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put the ball in Charles' hands, almost 50 percent of
the time the team scored. That's a big security blanket that's no
longer there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things will change,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We've got to
get some easy baskets. We can't run all the time. We don't have
enough firepower. We have to be a better-executing team. We have to
run more five-man plays, not just `iso.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive rebounds have to go way up because our
(shooting) percentage is not going to be as good.''
</P>
<P>
   But before anything can happen, the Rockets must retool
emotionally. They have had only three players available for every
game, fewer than any team in the league. They have only two players
_ Shandon Anderson and Walt Williams _ who have started every game,
matching Seattle for the league low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels for Charles,'' Tomjanovich said. ``The good
thing is his attitude about the whole deal. He almost made them
feel (as if he was) fortunate, that that (a major injury) could
have happened a long time ago, before he had a chance to do all the
wonderful things he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Through each test, Barkley provided the booming voice and
outsized leadership capacity to continue to push the team. With so
many new players and so few veterans, Barkley's leadership was as
important as his rebounding or his command of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the leadership going to come from?'' Tomjanovich said.
``These guys are basically young. The older guy (Matt Bullard) is
basically a reserve. Walt (Williams) is older. But everybody is
going to have that responsibility. I'm asking them to grow up
early.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step, Rockets players said, is to get over the shock
of Wednesday's events. The Rockets played much of their loss to the
76ers in a daze.
</P>
<P>
   They took a three-game winning streak, a season best, to
Philadelphia. But when Barkley left, any intensity and precision
the Rockets had showed in recent days went with him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the team's few veterans, Williams, said: ``Last night was
damn near impossible to concentrate on the game. It was just a bad
situation. It really made you think about other things, more
important things, like, Is he going to be all right? It was a bad
situation to try and concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every professional knows injuries are part of the game and
that injuries can end a career. At the same token, he's not only
one of the 50 greatest ballplayers to play the game, he's a good
person, a good locker-room guy, a fun guy to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think leadership doesn't automatically come because of how
old he is. It's going to have to come from everybody. I definitely
have to be more vocal. But I'm not going to say I'm going to
replace Barkley. That's something all of us have to do, to step up
and make contributions. Everybody has to be leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, more burden than ever may fall on rookie Steve
Francis. Barkley already had said the Rockets are Francis' team.
The Rockets will certainly reshape themselves around his talents.
</P>
<P>
   But without Barkley, and while the Rockets wait for Olajuwon's
return, it is more important than ever that Francis serve as a
facilitator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know I'm going to continue to try to do what I'm doing
and stay aggressive,'' Francis said. ``With Dream and Charles out,
everybody's scoring is important, not just one person.
</P>
<P>
   Of Barkley's contention that the Rockets are Francis' team, the
rookie said: ``I really can't see it. I'm just a member of the
team. I'll shoulder leading the team. But I don't want them to look
at me as a leader until I display that on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   He will, however, have increasing control of the offense.
Barkley drawing double teams in the low post had initiated much of
the Rockets' offense. Now, much of it must go through Francis _ a
role he said he welcomes, particularly as the Rockets attempt to
run more.

   ``It's not just me. We have a lot of guys that get up and
down,'' Francis said. ``The first thing for me is to be the
starter. I'm the ignition that starts the car. Then everybody runs.
The main thing is we still want to be a good team this year. We
don't want to wait for next year. I still think we can be a good
team.''

<P>
   Tomjanovich insisted he would have his team ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is always to win,'' he said. ``I'd be cheating the
guys if I didn't coach to win and have them focused. That's the
worst thing that could happen. I don't want to lose, but I don't
care if we lose every game if our mentality is every possession,
every minute out there we're trying to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't let them get into playing this thing out.''

``It's over.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   With those two words, Charles Barkley announced the end of a
16-year NBA career. Barkley had just ruptured a tendon in his left
knee in Wednesday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, ending his
days as an NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   How much more ironic can it get?
</P>
<P>
   Not only because Barkley had ended his career in Philadelphia,
the city where it all began in 1984, when the Sixers made the 6-6,
300-pound ``Round Mound of Rebound'' the fifth pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   But there further is irony in the brevity of his comment.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he landed in the NBA, Barkley has been to words
what blizzard is to snow _ one nonstop comedic stream of
consciousness, with Richard Pryor's awareness and Sam Kinison's
irreverence mixed in with the superb timing of Groucho Marx.
</P>
<P>
   There is further irony in that with that statement, Barkley used
the same number of words to announce his retirement that his good
friend _ ``brother,'' even _ Michael Jordan used to announce his
return after his self-imposed exile _ ``I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Karl Malone used one word to sum up Barkley's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underappreciated,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Scottie Pippen, with whom Barkley shared a rivalry, a
locker room and _ finally _ a war of words, was moved by Barkley's
injury. Pippen shrugged off the differences between himself and
Barkley, and spoke about his one-time friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him,'' Pippen said. ``I didn't want to see him
end his career like that. I wanted to see him go out as a fighter
and a warrior, the type of player he's been his whole career.
Things happen like that. You don't wish that on anybody. I just
hope he's able to get himself back to where he was before he
suffered the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to miss not having Charles out there. The
fact he's been such a competitor his whole career, he's tried to
win and take over games and do things. He's going to be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   By many.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's career path often crossed those of Malone and John
Stockton. Barkley, Malone and Stockton were selected as three of
the 50 greatest players during the league's 50th anniversary
celebration at the 1997 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole league,'' said Stockton, ``will miss him and his
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he brought to the game, how he prepared to play the game
and how hard he played trying to win,'' Malone said, ``all that
makes Charles part of a dying breed, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was Utah that eliminated the Rockets from the 1997
Western Conference finals, the closest Barkley came to a title
since advancing to the NBA Finals in 1993, when his Phoenix Suns
lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. But that, said Phoenix
coach Danny Ainge, who teamed with Barkley for three years with the
Suns, should not detract from Barkley's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that stand out to me are just the daily things he
does to make you laugh,'' Ainge said. ``You can talk about him
being a comedian and entertainer and all those things, but those
things can go a long way with a team. Being loose and playing loose
is a lost art, in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, Stockton and Pippen were just a few who spoke Thursday
about the end of the Barkley era.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people put in that nonsense that because he doesn't
have a (championship) ring, he's not a great player,'' Lakers
center Shaquille O'Neal said. ``I find that not true. He played
with a lot of enthusiasm. He played with a lot of heart and never
backed down from anybody. That's what I liked the most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I was disheartened by the turn of events in
his life,'' said former Sixers teammate Julius Erving, now the
executive vice president of the Orlando Magic. ``Him having been a
former teammate of mine and a friend of my family, we are all sad
that his career had to end on the note it did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to see it,'' said Seattle forward Chuck Person, a
teammate of Barkley's at Auburn. ``Nobody will ever forget what
he's meant for the game. I'm telling you right now, for one game,
he's the best power forward I've seen in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said he is considering a phone call to his one-time
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is a great player, he's a legend, a Hall of Famer,
he'll be remembered like all great players who played the game,''
Pippen said. ``You don't have to label him that he didn't win a
championship; he's still great in his own way.''

ANGELS BRACE FOR BUSY MEETINGS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Baseball's annual Winter Meetings begin here
today, a five-day gathering of the major leagues' general managers
during which trades often involving big names are made.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels are expected to be as active as any team,
with new general manager Bill Stoneman having made it clear there
is no such thing as an ``untouchable'' Angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of discussions,'' Stoneman said.
``We'll push toward doing something from a player standpoint if we
can do it. We haven't kept any secrets about what we are trying to
do. We're trying to improve our pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also no secret what the Angels will give up to get
pitching. One of their four outfielders is almost certain to go.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, center fielder Jim Edmonds and Garret
Anderson, who has played all three outfield positions, have been
mentioned in trade rumors the most. Now, though, even Tim Salmon
and Darin Erstad could be dealt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's doing his best to acquire starting pitching,'' said
Paul Cohen, Edmonds' agent. ``Through conversations I've had with
other general managers, Bill's statement to the press that anyone
could be traded is correct. I can say with certainty one of the
outfielders will be dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Edmonds and Anderson can become free agents at the end
of the 2000 season, they are more likely to go. But even the
mention of his name in trade speculation is a little strange to
Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new for me,'' Salmon said. ``If I got traded it would be
for the short term. After my contract is up (after the 2001
season), I'll exercise my rights as a free agent and look for
greener pastures around home (Paradise Valley, Ariz.). The
Diamondbacks would love to have me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, though, said he hasn't given up on the Angels and said
he hopes the team isn't torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a bad year, there was a lot of turmoil inside
the clubhouse,'' he said. ``But that doesn't take away from the
talent we have. We need pitching to put us over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels lacking pitching, many including Salmon didn't
see the point in letting Chuck Finley go. Stoneman, though, said he
couldn't compete with the offers that other teams were making.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Finley will be felt throughout the organization, and
not just on the field. Tim Mead, the Angels' vice president in
charge of communications, developed a close friendship with Finley
during the pitcher's 14 seasons in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in the industry sees enough to know that you
may not always like things, but it's not a matter of agreeing or
not agreeing with what might happen,'' Mead said. ``When I look at
Chuck Finley, the things I will think about have very little to do
with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus crash (in '92). Chuck was in the back of the second
bus playing cards. When the other bus crashed, he was hopping over
seats. He was the second one out of the bus. By the time I got out
of the bus, he was reaching into the first bus pulling guys out of
windows.... He's the last of Mr. Autry's boys. And that's as
symbolic or meaningful as anything.''

LAKERS GETTING WISE TO JACKSON'S PLOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Los Angeles Lakers winning streak that ended
with a thud Wednesday in Sacramento began in mid-November with a
bit of pop psychology, Phil Jackson style.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' cerebral coach chided his team after a disappointing
Nov. 18 loss in Denver and warned them, prior to a home date
against the hot Toronto Raptors, that trouble might loom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some good teams coming up,'' Jackson recalled telling
his team, ``and (we) might just go 2-6.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't think we were playing good enough.... We'd lost
to Denver, we were kind of fiddling around there in that period of
time. That's when I mentioned, before the Toronto game, that maybe
there's a chance we were going to end up eating our lunch a little
because we had to get better. We got better.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot better, in fact. They did lose to the Raptors on Nov. 21,
but recovered to win seven straight _ beating Utah, Seattle and
Portland _ before watching the string end against the upstart
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   A product of Jackson's calculated mind ploy? Maybe, but
Shaquille O'Neal scoffed at the idea, and mocked the coach's
earlier predictions that his team, now 15-5, might struggle to a
.500 record in the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't think I believed that (garbage), did you?'' said an
indignant O'Neal. ``First 15 games, .500? Please.''
</P>
<P>
   But did the ``psychology thing,'' as O'Neal called it, work? Or
was it recognized for what it was?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always recognize it,'' he said. ``I guess we used it as
motivation. We won seven straight.... I don't listen to what people
say, especially you guys (reporters).''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, O'Neal seemed quite affected by Jackson's
modest predictions, saying testily, ``Some people, including you
guys, including some guys in this locker room, didn't expect us to
go this far. But I expected to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his players appearing to respond to the ploys, Jackson said,
``It's good,'' but smiled at the realization they might be catching
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know, they're starting to learn a little bit,'' he said.
``I'm going to have to do some different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the numbers: O'Neal's MVP campaign is strong in large
part because he's improved his stats in nearly every category when
comparing this season to last. But his average minutes are also up,
by 3 to 4 per game, so is he really playing that much better?
Actually, yes.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal's numbers are boiled down to a per-minute basis,
it's clear he's greatly improved in rebounding and blocked shots,
and slightly in assists.
</P>
<P>
   Last season he averaged 26.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, 1.67 blocks
and 2.3 assists in 34.8 minutes. This season he's averaging 28.2
points, 13.7 rebounds, 3.26 blocks and 3.1 assists in 38.4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But recalculating O'Neal's current averages based on last year's
minutes still shows improvement. At 34.8 minutes per game this
season, he would average 12.4 rebounds (up 1.7), 2.96 blocks (up
1.29) and 2.81 assists (up 0.51). Only his points would decline, to
25.5, but he also is taking fewer shots on a per-minute basis.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant briefly left Wednesday's game to go to
the locker room and on a couple of occasions seemed to wince after
getting hit on his right arm. But Bryant said his right hand,
recently healed from a broken bone, was OK. Beefy Kings guard Nick
Anderson had simply slammed Bryant's upper arm a couple times, he
said.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ After being humiliated by Baltimore in their
worst game of the season, the Tennessee Titans were desperate for a
victory Thursday night at Adelphia Coliseum.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running back Eddie George answered the distress call with his
most impressive game of the season, rushing for a season-high 199
yards and scoring two touchdowns in the Titans' 21-14 conquest of
the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd of 66,357, the Titans recovered from the Ravens
debacle to improve their record to 10-3. They have 10 days to rest
before they host Atlanta and Jacksonville, the latter for what
could be the next big game in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   George wasn't the whole show Thursday night; it just seemed like
it.
</P>
<P>
   He carried 27 times for 200 yards, but he lost a yard on his
final attempt, finishing with 199. He also led the team with six
catches for 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's been possessed since Sunday night,'' coach Jeff Fisher
said, alluding to the 41-20 blowout at Baltimore. ``He got that
look in his eye and kept it. It was a great effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was to run the ball because you have to run the ball
successfully to win in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blocking was outstanding. The defense made so many big
plays against a very good offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse continued his assault on
quarterbacks with two sacks, the same number as linebacker Eddie
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   With three games left, Kearse has 11{ sacks, one behind the NFL
rookie record shared by Leslie O'Neil and Simeon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders finished with 364 yards. They entered the game
ranked first in rushing, but they generated only 111 yards on the
ground. They committed three turnovers to Tennessee's one.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans accumulated 307 yards, including 204 rushing.
Quarterback Steve McNair, who scored the first touchdown on a
one-yard run, completed 12 of 20 passes for 114 yards. He was
intercepted once when the ball was deflected at the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a championship team, you have to find a way
to win,'' George said. ``You can't be embarrassed like we were in
Baltimore. You have to fight through adversity, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Both offenses struggled in the first half, and there was no
score at halftime. George, who rushed for 55 yards on 11 carries in
the first half, exploded in the last two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a mindset to run the ball, and that's what we did,''
George said. ``After the Baltimore game, it was time for the
leaders to stand up and be counted. I wanted to provide some
leadership. I got into my rhythm the longer the game went. I felt
fresh even though I got a lot of carries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders had no answers for George, who gained yards inside
and outside. He broke tackles like Earl Campbell and kept his
balance like Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I finally found that game where I can just cut it
loose,'' George said. ``And I wanted it tonight. I wanted the win.
I think everyone in this room wanted to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite upset. We wanted to come out and prove something
not only to the fans and the nation but ourselves that we're a good
team. We can bounce back from a defeat like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried several things to stop Eddie, but we couldn't do
it,'' Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. ``When a back is running hard
like that, there aren't a lot of adjustments you can make. We did
try to move some guys around and play eight- and nine-man fronts,
but he still made some good plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got stronger as the game went on. I tip my hat to
Eddie George.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders never led. After the scoreless first half, McNair
gave the Titans a 7-0 lead. Oakland tied it on Zach Crockett's
one-yard run for a 7-7 game entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, George erupted and scored on eight- and 19-yard runs for a
21-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders scored their last touchdown on Rich Gannon's
two-yard pass to tight end Rickey Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders had a chance to tie the score with 59 seconds left,
but Darrien Gordon fumbled a punt and Donald Mitchell recovered for
Tennessee, allowing the Titans to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get the big guy (George) down, but we didn't,''
Raiders defensive tackle Russell Maryland said. ``We just weren't
up to par. They put the ball in No. 27's hands, and we give our
respect to them.''

PINCAY TIES SHOEMAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ On a day that contained moments as truly
exciting, moving and frustrating as any in all of sports, Laffit
Pincay Jr. nearly became an immortal.
</P>
<P>
   Falling momentarily short of that however, Pincay achieved the
status of legend at Hollywood Park Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old jockey, once thought to be on his way out of
racing because of weight problems, picked up his 8,833rd career win
and moved into a tie with all-time leader Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   `It's very good,'' Pincay said. `I feel very proud and content
that I've done this. I just need one more winner and my dream will
come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The win, aboard I Be Casual in the fourth race was Pincay's only
trip to the winner's circle in five mounts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to ride five horses this afternoon at the
Inglewood track.
</P>
<P>
   As he has been throughout his pursuit of Shoemaker's record,
Pincay has maintained a casual and calm demeanor. Just before his
only win of the day, the 5-1, 117-pound Pincay relaxed comfortably
on an soft couch in the jock's room. He focused his attention on a
crossword puzzle in the back of a glossy magazine, stopping
occasionally to adjust a pair of oversized reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the jock's room, Pincay somehow found the edge to
ride a perfect race aboard I Be Casual. The three- year-old gray
colt had to mount a powerful stretch run between horses and
overcome a strong early leader.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pincay, once known as `the Pirate` among fellow jockeys,
wasn't sure he would do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that (David Flores') horse would die on the turn
and he did die on the turn,'' Pincay said. ``That other horse was
very tough inside and for a while I thought he was going to come
back and beat me. I was lucky I had enough horse left to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, a native of Panama who began riding in the United States
in 1966, has five chances today to prevail. Just one more win will
place him atop an unparaled pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   In the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing the accomplishment is
on a par with Cal Ripken's consecutive games played streak in
baseball or Wilt Chamberlain's 100- point game in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   `You cannot understate by use of adjectives this guy's
accomplishment,'' said rider Chris McCarron. `The English language
to describe this ... it blows everything away.`
</P>
<P>
   `The average racegoer; there's no way he can grasp how much
skill it takes to ride a race horse like Laffit Pincay Jr. ''
</P>
<P>
   Just because Pincay tied the Shoemaker's record and didn't break
it Thursday, didn't mean there wasn't cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the race, a moving tribute in the winner's
circle honored both Pincay and Shoemaker. The only blemish of the
day was a faulty sound system that kept fans from hearing much of
what was said.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his proud family and smiling friends, Pincay,
waving a Panamanian flag, was hoisted on the shoulders of his
fellow riders. They then paraded from the winner's circle to the
track.
</P>
<P>
   `I didn't know somebody was going to hand me a flag, but
somebody gave it to me and I took it and it was nice,'' Pincay
said. `There are a lot of people in Panama watching and I think
it's nice to show that I still remember Panama and all my family
and friends that I have over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay can also number Shoemaker among his many friends. The
former jockey had nothing but kind words for the man who shares his
record and will soon break it.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker watched the race in the jock's room and cheered on
Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very exciting for me,'' he said. ``I know it was an
emotional for Laffit because he's been trying hard to get this
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay had been scheduled to ride just four horses Thursday, but
got an extra mount in the second race. Jockey Emile Ramsammy took
ill with stomach flu and was taken off heavy favorite De Witt.
</P>
<P>
   On short notice, trainer Bob Baffert elected to put Pincay
aboard the horse. Although the horse was in contention for the
entire 6{-furlong sprint, he ultimately finished second.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the fourth race, Pincay finished sixth aboard
Finally in the fifth. In the sixth he finished seventh on Justice
Bold. The seventh race saw Pincay finish fifth aboard Alert to Go.
All of his horses were contenders and most were heavily bet by
gamblers looking to take home a piece of history. A slip with the
right horse in the right race could become a collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's five mounts today include Demidoll in the first; Flying
Journey in the third; Irish Nip in the sixth; Storm Dog in the
seventh and I Gotcha Covered in the eighth.

<P>
   MIDEAST-ASSESS (Jerusalem) _ Analysis: A feeling that change was
imminent swept through Israel Thursday after President Clinton's
surprise announcement on Wednesday that Israeli-Syrian talks would
be resumed after nearly four years. Almost palpably, the national
pulse seemed to quicken _ for some with elation, for others with
anxiety. Even the Israeli right-wing, so uninspired these last few
months, girded up for a real opportunity. By Deborah Sontag.

European summit conference, which is set to open Friday with
unexpected rancor. By Warren Hoge.

   ITALY-TV-HOLYYEAR (Rome) _ Italy, the country that perfected
housewife strip-tease quiz shows, is better known for pizazz than
piety on television. But on Dec. 25, a Roman Catholic Holy Year
begins, one that coincides with the 2,000th anniversary of the
birth of Jesus. So even on television, there will be little respite
from the Jubilee celebration. By Alessandra Stanley.

<P>
   WELFARE-WORKERS (Milwaukee) _ Lots of people consider themselves
experts on this city's war on welfare, but few have ridden its
highs and lows as intensely as Michael Steinborn. Eighteen months
ago, Steinborn was an unemployed jack of the building trades, down
on his luck and in need of a job. Improbably enough, he is now one
of the system's most popular caseworkers _ and a de facto authority
on the nation's most famous welfare experiment. By Jason DeParle.

   SCI-MARS-OCEAN (Undated) _ Scientists at Brown University say
they have found tantalizing evidence that the northern lowlands of

hidden depths and long beaches. The findings are hailed as making
the best case yet for the existence of a sea on primordial Mars. By
William J. Broad.

   KING-TRIAL-ASSESS (Atlanta) _ With key players long dead, with
confessions recanted and altered, and with a vast conspiracy
alleged but not proven, Wednesday's verdict in the civil trial
connected to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. may
ultimately do little to demystify the tangle of fact and theory

   COCACOLA-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ Do you remember what a
two-liter bottle of Coke cost five or 10 years ago? Have prices
gone up? The answers to those questions go a long way toward
explaining why M. Douglas Ivester is leaving his job after little
more than two years as Coca-Cola's chief executive. It's hard to
sustain the stock price of a growth company when the company can't
raise prices. By Floyd Norris.

<P>
   EMAIL-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ You usually don't want to stand in
the way of agencies rushing to complete deals before the end of the

MEMORY STILL BITTER FOR McCULLOUCH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Poly High's more famous graduates, Earl McCullouch, plans
to be at Edison Field Saturday night to root for his alma mater
against Mater Dei in the CIF championship match.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least this Poly team has a chance to win it all,'' says
McCullouch wistfully. ``Unfortunately, we didn't. They took it away
from us for something we didn't even know was against the rules. We
were kicked out of the playoffs. That was 36 years ago, and I still
haven't forgotten it. It still hurts when I think about it. We were
deprived of an almost certain title because of a silly rule that no
one knew about.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians of Poly High athletics never will forget that the
Bill Mulligan-coached 1963 Jackrabbits were disqualified from the
playoffs after it was revealed that they had watched film of their
quarterfinal victim, El Rancho, before the game.
</P>
<P>
   What a crime!
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Poly actually had to forfeit its victory over El Rancho
for such a dastardly indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rule the CIF put in for just that one year, and it
was a rule that I wasn't even aware existed,'' says Mulligan, who
was head football coach only that one season at Poly and who went
on to coach basketball at both USC and UC-Irvine. ``Aaron Wade
(then coach at Centennial) offered the film to me. His team had
faced El Rancho earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it with the then-Poly athletic director, Sam
Iantorno, and then I watched it with my team. I know Iantorno
didn't know it was against the CIF rules, or he'd have never
allowed me to show it to my players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few former Poly High players saw the film, and told some El
Rancho graduates who were attending Long Beach City College that
Poly was going to beat El Rancho. Well, the CIF got wind of it, and
all hell broke out after we did beat El Rancho. The CIF director,
Ken Fagans, waited until Monday to disqualify us. El Rancho took
our place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so aggravating is that we would have beaten El Rancho
had we not watched the film,'' says McCullouch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCullouch, a receiver who averaged more than 20
yards a carry on double reverses and ends-around, the Jackrabbits
had another future NFL star performing at quarterback in Gene
Washington and a slew of exceptional running backs in Marvin
Motley, Elwood Steward, Oscar Brown and Al Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good team,'' says McCullouch, who would go on
to become a world class 110-meter high hurdler and extraordinary
receiver with USC and then have an exceptional career with the
Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team we had was even better than that legendary
Poly one of 1959 that had Willie Brown, Dee Andrews and Alonzo
Irvin,'' says the 69-year-old Mulligan, now a scout for the
Portland Trail Blazers and a resident of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan would gain a measure of solace later that season when
his Poly basketball team, led by Chuck Moore, Trent Gaines, Gene
Washington and a promising reserve named Mack Calvin, would win the
CIF title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans booed Ken Fagans at the presentation of the
championship trophy,'' recalls Mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   Earl McCullouch isn't surprised that Poly High has maintained
its dominance on the football field across the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poly High kind of reminds me of how USC was in the 1960s and
1970s,'' says McCullouch. ``There's just such great tradition
there, and it's carried on from one generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I moved here from Bakersfield, and heard all
about Dee Andrews, Willie Brown, Alonzo Irwin and all the other
great Poly stars. A lot of us young guys wanted to be like them,
and I think that inspired us. I honestly think Poly is the best
high school in the United States in scholarship and athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McCullouch's youngest child, Dawn McCullouch, is
currently attending Wilson High, where she's good enough of a
basketball player to already have earned a scholarship next year to
Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dawn's choice to go to Wilson,'' explains McCullouch.
``I've always let my kids make their own decisions about what high
school they want to go to. My other four all chose Poly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old McCullouch these days is a night manager at the
Federal Express facility at LAX, and on his off days can be found
handicapping horses at Los Alamitos with old pals like Alonzo
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I'm picking Poly to beat Mater Dei this time,''
says McCullouch. ``I hear the defense they have is pretty mean. At
least they're getting a chance to play for the title. I wish we had
been given such a chance.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   After watching a special screening the other night in Westwood
of Ron Shelton's ``Play It To The Bone'', I'll be surprised if this
comic-drama boxing yarn featuring Woody Harrelson, Antonio
Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Robert Wagner and Tom Sizemore isn't a
huge hit and a recipient of a few Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is the most entertaining fight film I've ever seen,
and, yes, I've seen ``Raging Bull'', ``Rocky'', ``Body &AMP; Soul'',
``The Champ'', etc.
</P>
<P>
   I think this is Shelton's best film, exceeding even his much
acclaimed ``Bull Durham'', as well as ``White Men Can't Jump'',
``Tin Cup'', and ``Blaze''.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I might be slightly biased since I do make a couple
of appearances I'm one of the ringside sportswriters in the film,
as do a couple of my pals, Johnny (The Downey Flash) Ortiz and Bill
(Bozo) Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   But Shelton trusted Ortiz and Caplan enough to give them a few
lines of dialogue. Me? Well, at least I got my name in the credits.
...
</P>
<P>
   When Magic Johnson was 21, he knew how to play basketball and
never made all those vexing turnovers that continue to haunt Kobe
Bryant. . .
</P>
<P>
   I'll be surprised if Charles Barkley doesn't attempt to play in
the NBA again. ...
</P>
<P>
   When I covered Bill Bradley as an NBA player, I always found him
to be remote and even arrogant. ...
</P>
<P>
   The ring record book will show that Fernando Vargas beat Winky
Wright for the IBF junior middleweight title last Saturday evening
in Lincoln City, Ore. Don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   This was just another example in boxing where a deserving
veteran who can fight is sacrificed by the establishment for a
heralded youngster with a more promising future.
</P>
<P>
   But what Winky Wright did do was expose Fernando Vargas for what
he is and what he is is not another Oscar De La Hoya. ...
</P>
<P>
   One of Southern California's most talked about bodyguards, Mike
(The Hammer) DiMarzo, is on the mend after breaking his left leg in
a mysterious golf cart accident in the hills of Bel Air. None of
the people DiMarzo was protecting were injured. . .
</P>
<P>
   Where are the laws of compensation when it comes to Georgia
Frontiere? ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the person who thought up mute buttons on TV remotes
had in mind Dick Vitale, the Most Irritating Man In America.

JOURNEY NO WALK IN THE PARK FOR UCLA SOCCER DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As UCLA and Indiana compete in Friday's NCAA men's
soccer semifinal in Charlotte, N.C., the Indiana players will
survey the Bruins defense, taking note of Steve Shak and Adam
Cooper's locations and tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   They'll see Shak and Cooper are solid players. What they won't
see, however, is they began as walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does a nonscholarship player start on a team playing in
the national semifinals. UCLA has Cooper. Shak was a walk-on his
first two seasons before winning a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Here they are, joining the rest of the unseeded Bruins (19-2) in
the College Cup at Ericsson Stadium. They play second-seeded and
defending champion Indiana (19-3) at 3:30 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've proven it as seniors they can play soccer at this
level,'' UCLA coach Todd Saldana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always take a step back and say, `I'm playing for one of the
best programs in the nation, that's in the top five every year,'''
said Cooper, a Calabasas graduate. ``It's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Cooper was a recruited walk-on, having impressed
then-assistant coach Saldana at a UCLA summer camp. No one knew who
Shak was.
</P>
<P>
   Shak was academically accepted to UCLA but loved soccer enough
to consider a tryout. He impressed then-coach Sigi Schmid enough to
earn a spot.
</P>
<P>
   But he never saw a minute of playing time. He came in 1996 with
an eight-member recruiting class that includes current seniors
Sasha Victorine (who won the Missouri Athletic Club's Player of the
Year award this week), Pete Vagenas, Nick Paneno, Martin Bruno and
Shea Travis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the ninth guy, so I was the only guy without a soccer
roommate,'' Shak said.
</P>
<P>
   His game days were practices, so he practiced like he would
play. The next season, Schmid put him in the first match for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The next match, Shak started.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to make the practice squad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That season, UCLA's defense shut out 14 opponents and won the
national championship. Shak earned the Bruins' Most Improved Player
award.
</P>
<P>
   Things have improved since. Shak has played in the U.S. Soccer
Festival and on the national under-23 team that won a bronze medal
at the 1999 Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's road has been longer but no less rewarding, especially
when it's revealed he played just one year of club soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Cooper's an AYSO graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know one single person in Division I who didn't play
club,'' Cooper said, ``except myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That really inspires younger kids,'' Shak said. ``They think
they have to play club to reach the highest level. Sometimes,
that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper redshirted the 1997 season with an torn abdominal muscle.
Because he felt pain in his groin, doctors first misdiagnosed the
problem as a groin injury, so it took time to find the tear was
higher in his body.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper, who played all of 53 minutes in his first season and
never more than 48 in any match his sophomore season, was so eager
to return he aggressively rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, his minutes had tripled, and he had scored his first
goal.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he has excelled as a marking back, in part because
Saldana switched to a more standard defense.
</P>
<P>
   If the unseeded Bruins beat Indiana, they'll play either
unseeded Santa Clara or No. 4 Connecticut on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saldana, while pleased with his two walk-ons, isn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're put in the toughest environment. It's either sink or
swim,'' Saldana said. ``Steve Shak and Adam Cooper have stepped
forward.''

SCHOOL DISTRICT BREAKUP PETITIONS FILED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After two years of collecting signatures, a group
working to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District has
filed petitions to force hearings that could lead to a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Restoring Excellence in Education, based in Los Angeles'
San Fernando Valley, announced on Thursday it has more than the
21,000 signatures needed to push its plan to split the district
into North Valley and South Valley school districts. The dividing
line would run across Saticoy Street and Roscoe Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   FREE officials said their plan would create two racially and
ethnically diverse public school systems that are large enough to
win state and federal funds, but small enough to improve public
education in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan will give San Fernando Valley parents neighborhood
schools. Schools where parents can partner with teachers and local
administrators to meet the educational needs of every child,'' said
former state Assemblywoman Paula Boland, chairwoman of FREE.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful holiday present to the people of the
Valley,'' Boland said, adding that her group collected more than
30,000 signatures. ``We're in good shape. I'm sure any and all
groups that care about kids will support us.''
</P>
<P>
   The county Office of Education and state Board of Education must
approve the plan to cut up the nation's second-largest school
district, and voters would have to endorse it in a special
election.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles school board President Genethia Hayes said the
breakup movement is ill-timed because it does not take into account
sweeping administrative and curriculum-based reforms in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things they want are possible now, and all they can do
is bitch and gripe,'' said Hayes, one of four board members elected
on a reform platform earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Julie Korenstein, who has often found herself at
odds with the new board majority, said she supports a Valley
breakaway, but would endorse only the creation of one new district.
</P>
<P>
   Carving the Valley into two new public school systems would
create too much new bureaucracy, said Korenstein, who represents a
large portion of the potentially affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have two superintendents, two school boards. There would
be major duplication,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines declined to express
his position on attempts to dismantle Los Angeles Unified, which
has an enrollment of more than 710,000 students. Through a
spokesperson, Cortines referred to the matter as political and
therefore not something he intends to get involved in.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Caprice Young, one Los Angeles Unified's three
newly elected board members, said she has confidence that the new
regime's changes will have improved the district substantially
before FREE's plan makes it to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sincere hope is the day this hits the ballot,'' Young said,
``people will vote no because we will have fixed the district. We
have made a lot of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   FREE sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Carter, a former teacher and co-chairwoman of FREE,
said Los Angeles Unified's ``current one-size-fits-all mentality''
of delivering programs ``has proven not only ineffective, but
alienating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New, smaller districts will redirect the focus to the
educational needs of all the children,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   FREE's petition comes as momentum builds among legislators and
activists fed up with Los Angeles Unified's low test scores,
shortage of qualified teachers, downtown administrative upheaval
and botched construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movements are much younger than FREE's, having been
formed only in recent months out of outrage to the district's
handling of the Belmont Learning Center scandal and the board's
decision to oust Superintendent Ruben Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, expects to submit
legislation in the new year to launch a breakup study, and other
area lawmakers have signaled their support for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Breakup groups in the Valley, Los Angeles, Carson, Lomita and
Garden Grove have formed a coalition and begun drafting a single
plan uniting their efforts, hoping to gain clout by working
together.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition to Break Away from LAUSD includes Valley Voters
Organized Toward Empowerment, which recently rolled out an
exploratory committee to examine the idea of forming a Valley
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Los Angeles City/County Latino Redistricting
Coalition has backed a plan to divide the public school system into
six autonomous districts, including an east-west split of the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Activists in the South Bay also jumped into the fray this year,
pursuing a secession study in the Wilmington and San Pedro sections
of Los Angeles Unified. They hope to join with neighboring Lomita
and Carson to create a district that would still be large enough to
pull some weight in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Little Hoover Commission weighed in on the matter,
issuing a harshly critical report on LAUSD in October that called
for a breakup study.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other movements, the Latino Redistricting Coalition's
plan would slice up Los Angeles Unified based upon socioeconomic
factors, regional identity and race, according to Allan Clayton,
the movement's regional chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan raises legal questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the resegregation of many little districts
in this city,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's education code requires that the reorganization of a
school district not promote segregation. The code, however, does
not specify what ratios among races and ethnicities are acceptable,
creating a judgment call for legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Even with attempts like FREE's to create new districts with
diverse student populations, the school board president argued
``you would still be left with the possibility of some districts
that would be comprised mostly of communities of color.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Office of Education must verify the
signatures on FREE's petition by Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   If the petition is valid, the Los Angeles County Committee on
School District Organization would discuss the plan at its Jan. 5
meeting and hold public hearings in the affected areas within next
60 days.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the county committee, which consists of 11
elected members, would conduct an independent study into the
benefits and drawbacks of FREE's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would review the plan based upon nine conditions
and four other criteria, including the number of pupils in the
proposed district, the resulting distribution of school property
with the original district, and racial diversity.
</P>
<P>
   By March 6, the commission would be required to make a
recommendation to the state Board of Education, which would then
review the plan. The state could take as much time as it needed to
act.
</P>
<P>
   If the state board agrees, a special election would be held in
the area that state education officials determine would be affected
by the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority of voters back the plan, the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors would implement the creation of the two new
Valley districts over an unspecified period of time.

HAPPY FOR NOW WITH DEAD HEAT

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The mountain came equipped with a wheelchair
ramp.
</P>
<P>
   That way, Laffit Pincay could share the summit with Bill
Shoemaker on Thursday, the two winningest jockeys in history
basking in the rarefied air of mutual admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Something felt so right about this, about Pincay calmly
answering reporters' questions from behind a dais in a tunnel
outside the Hollywood Park jockeys' room, about Shoemaker sipping
and puffing his electronic wheelchair up a wooden ramp to sit
beside him.
</P>
<P>
   If only they could have stood side by side. If only Shoemaker
hadn't lost the use of his arms and legs in a 1991 freeway
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in spirit, they did stand together.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay will break the Shoe's record as early as today, but until
that happens, the two old friends and rivals seem pleased and proud
to be tied, each with 8,833 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the winner's circle ceremony, Shoemaker had referred
to Pincay reaching ``the top of the mountain.'' Later, at the press
conference, he said he's happy to have company there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good only because it's Laffit Pincay,'' said
Shoemaker, the living icon of American thoroughbred racing, dressed
in a blue blazer, white turtleneck shirt and red wool scarf. ``He's
been a good friend of mine for 35 years, ever since he came from
Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I didn't know then that he was going to break my
record. I didn't even know I was going to break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   They met four years before Shoemaker took the record from Johnny
Longden with his 6,033rd winner on Sept. 7, 1970 at Del Mar. They
became buddies, competed shoulder to shoulder during the day at
Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Del Mar, in some of the greatest
races of the 1970s and '80s, and celebrated each other's victories
together at night.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker, 68, watched Pincay's record-tying victory aboard I Be
Casual in the fourth race on television in the jockeys' room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I'm most comfortable, I think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody (the idle jockeys) was rooting for him very hard,
including me,'' Shoemaker said of the scene in the jockeys' room.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nip-and-tuck race as I Be Casual, a maiden gelding,
needed every tap of Pincay's left-handed whip and nearly the length
of the stretch to win the 6-furlong sprint by a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was going to get up,'' Shoemaker said,
``then it looked like he wasn't, then it looked like he was ...''
</P>
<P>
   Which also describes Pincay's pursuit of Shoemaker, the only
thing that has kept the 52-year-old Hall of Famer riding into his
35th season.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said he first considered the possibility Pincay would
break his record when the younger man drew within 300 or 400
victories. At that point, though, Pincay was struggling without
choice mounts and had worried he might have to leave the
major-league Southern California circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if he could stay healthy, he could do it,'' Shoemaker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1970, on the verge of Longden's record, Shoemaker went
into a slump and needed a week to break it. He was asked if he had
any advice for Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need any advice from me or anybody else,''
Shoemaker said. ``The only thing I want him to do is get to
9,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Defending champion Manistique (ridden by Corey
Nakatani) is assigned 124 pounds, six to 13 more than his
opponents, in the Bayakoa Handicap for fillies and mares at
Hollywood Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, General Challenge (Chris McCarron) is the 123-pound high
weight for the Native Diver Handicap, the 3-year-old Pacific
Classic winner's first start since his 10th-place finish in the
Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Native Diver, only a Grade III race according to the
national committee that decides such things, has an impressive list
of winners in the 1990s, including major-stakes winners Twilight
Agenda, Sir Beaufort, Slew of Damascus, Best Pal, Alphabet Soup,
Gentlemen and Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   __The United States will be represented in the rich races at
Hong Kong's Sha Tin on Sunday by two California horses, Big Jag in
the $700,000 Hong Kong Sprint and Self Feeder in the $900,000 Hong
Kong Mile.
</P>
<P>
   __Pincay said he'll ride his six scheduled mounts at Hollywood
Park Saturday whether or not he has already broken the record.
There had been a chance he'd go to Turf Paradise in Phoenix for a
stakes race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Laffit Pincay,
20 wins; Pat Valenzuela, 19; Alex Solis, 16; Corey Nakatani, 14;
Isaias Enriquez, David Flores and Martin Pedroza, 9. Trainers: Bob
Baffert and Richard Mandella, 9; Jack Carava, 8; Wesley Ward, 6;
Paul Aguirre, Bobby Frankel and Mike Mitchell, 5. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: Unless you're a souvenir hunter, a wager on
Laffit Pincay offers poor value these days. Pincay's horses were
bet down from their morning line odds by a factor of nearly 40
percent Wednesday and Thursday. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $150,000
Bayakoa Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1 1/16 miles; Sunday,
$100,000 Native Diver Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1 1/8 miles. At
Sha Tin Race Course, Hong Kong: Sunday, $1.3 million Hong Kong Cup,
3-year-olds and up, 1 1/4 miles on turf. &QL; 
Mileposts: Eoin Harty, the assistant trainer who deserves some
credit for Bob Baffert's success, has been hired by Godolphin
Racing to prepare its young horses for the Triple Crown. The
Irish-born Harty, 37, will split the year between Dubai and the
United States. Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation made its first
try at the Triple Crown this year when Worldly Manner finished
seventh in the Kentucky Derby.... Pat Valenzuela recorded his
3,000th victory aboard Sexy Too last Saturday. Valenzuela,
sidetracked by suspensions, is 37. Laffit Pincay won his 3,000th at
28.... A Jan. 1 national riders' strike apparently has been averted
with a reported three-year contract agreement increasing the
amounts tracks pay to the Jockeys' Guild insurance program....
Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Anees returned to trainer Alex
Hassinger at Santa Anita after a 20-day freshening, and could begin
his Derby preparations with the Jan. 30 Santa Catalina Stakes....
Hollywood Park will play host to a 10-race, $1.2-million program of
stakes for California-breds April 30, 2000 _ sort of a midterm Cal
Cup. The card, headed by the $250,000 Snow Chief for 3-year-olds,
will combine existing stakes previously held on separate days....
Hollywood Park's summer Shoemaker Mile has been moved up from Grade
II to Grade I. Silic won the race this year on his way to a
Breeders' Cup Mile triumph.... Canadian International winner
Thornfield was voted Canada's Horse of the Year.

UNLIKE SHAQ, TRACK STAR ARNOLD RELISHES OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal would sooner see Greg Ostertag
come after him than his country.
</P>
<P>
   That all-expenses-paid trip to the other side of the world that
Uncle Sam is dangling in front of the Lakers center like a Krispy
Kreme doughnut? O'Neal has made it abundantly clear he's not at all
tempted.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, no, he won't go.
</P>
<P>
   The other day O'Neal sounded like a man who'd burn his passport
rather than get on that chartered airplane to Sydney to serve his
country as part of the basketball battalion in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already got (a) gold medal,'' O'Neal said, making it
sound more like a battle wound than a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he explained, summer is his time for relaxing and
rapping. Why should he sacrifice all that to spend a few weeks in
one of the most desirable destinations on the planet, working up a
sweat against the likes of Lithuania?
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough life, being one of the few, the chosen; a
prospective Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask O'Neal about it. A better person to consult would
be Dominique Arnold, a track athlete who has the 10th-fastest time
in the world this year in the 110-meter high hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Arnold on the Cal State Northridge track most
mornings and at The Home Depot in Canoga Park in the afternoons.
His job there, secured through the Olympic Job Opportunities
Program, is nothing like O'Neal's dabbling in rap during the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold is not moving plywood off the shelves as some kind of
lark. It's the way he makes ends meet while clearing the hurdles,
both real and metaphorical, that stand between him and the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When we caught up with the 25-year-old Arnold Thursday morning
at CSUN, he was none too pleased to hear O'Neal talk about dodging
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely bothers me to hear him say those things,''
Arnold said, ``because I've been through hell and back trying to
get there. To miss out on an opportunity to represent your country
in an event of that magnitude, I don't understand that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Our purpose here today is not to pick on O'Neal, who was just
being honest. The truth is, the sentiments he expressed aren't
anything we haven't heard before from tennis-playing millionaires
and puckish hockey players.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal mumbles and his words rumble like an avalanche down theon
down _ are on the take these days, the symbol of the Games ought to
be changed. The five concentric rings should be replaced by a line
of zeroes broken only by commas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cash is even exchanging hands above the table.
</P>
<P>
   John Godina, a former UCLA standout who is among the world's
best shot putters and discus throwers, will make more money this
year in endorsements and prize money than quarterback Kurt Warner
will clear with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   'Twas not always so.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of sporting excellence long has been a full-time
job. Until recently, it wasn't much help paying the bills. The
reconfiguring of amateur guidelines over the past 20 years has made
it possible for world-class athletes to have their Olympic dreams
and eat, too.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for every Godina there continues to be many more
Arnolds.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a graduate of Long Beach Wilson and Washington State,
came late to the hurdles (he was a junior in high school when he
first started racing) and retired early, in 1997 after suffering a
groin injury that was slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Jeff McAuley coaxed Arnold back onto the track and
the hurdler since has gained a lot of ground on the world's best.
He placed fourth in the 110-meter high hurdles at this year's Pan
American Games after missing a berth on the U.S. team that competed
in the World Championships in Spain by one spot.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was improving despite keeping a schedule only an
insomniac could love. Until just recently he worked behind the
registration desk at a Howard Johnsons from 11 p.m. until 7 a.m.,
grabbed two hours of sleep, then practiced at CSUN for another
three.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot job affords Arnold a much more sane schedule. And
yet there remain obstacles even after he leaves the track.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him why he continues to chase a finishing line so few reach
and Arnold talks about maximizing his God-given talent. He speaks
eloquently of ``feeling the wind blowing through my head when I'm
running fast.''
</P>
<P>
   And he talks about honoring the country that has given him the
freedom to chase all his dreams, on and off the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Europe racing this summer I understood why
people get on planes and come over here and kiss the ground,''
Arnold said. ``Being over there made me appreciate the privileges
and opportunities we have in the United States. It made me want to
wear USA on my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arnold _ and for swimmers and wrestlers and gymnasts and
fencers and archers like him _ the Olympics is Mount Everest. It's
the ultimate sporting experience, unlike the tennis players who
have the Grand Slam, the hockey players who have the Stanley Cup
Finals and the basketball players who have the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   If a hockey player such as Keith Tkachuk or a basketball player
like O'Neal is eligible to compete in the Olympics, so be it. If
they choose to pass on the event, that's their prerogative.
</P>
<P>
   We just wish they'd step away from the mirror long enough to see
the Olympics through Dominique Arnold's eyes. Then maybe they'd
recognize its allure.

GONZAGA TRIES TO RECAPTURE MARCH MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's time for a name change for those lovable
gunners from Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga.com seems appropriate, considering expectations of the
No. 24 Bulldogs have risen faster than Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, after a loss to Detroit Mercy, the Bulldogs
were 4-3 and wondering if they'd make the NCAA Tournament. They
did, of course, vanquishing Minnesota, Stanford and Florida before
a five-point loss to eventual champion Connecticut in a riveting
West Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with three starters back, the Bulldogs (4-2) are
being compared to the best teams nationally, not the best in the
West Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat Montana by 15, and people said we should have won by
more,'' Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ``We battle back against
Cincinnati and lose by seven, and everyone wants to know why we had
to battle back. Expectations are way, way out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't control what the polls say, or what a guy from
Redondo Beach thinks, or what a physics major on campus thinks. We
can't get caught up in the expectations. And so far, we haven't.
The kids still have their perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. They still have savvy point guard Matt
Santangelo, who's considered an NBA prospect. They have super
shooter Richie Frahm. They have powerful, athletic forward Casey
Calvary. And they have the same precision offense that sliced up
Stanford and is bound to frustrate No. 11 UCLA when the teams
collide Saturday in Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put on an offense clinic every time they take the
floor,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``They're similar to
Princeton. They play at a higher speed and shoot it quicker, but
they're like Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not good news for UCLA. Not now, not ever. But the Bruins
(3-0) will have one grand advantage Saturday: rest. They haven't
played since a 61-point victory over Morgan State nine days ago
while Gonzaga has twice traveled long distance in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs lost to Cincinnati in Cleveland last weekend,
returned to campus for two days, lost to Temple in Chicago on
Wednesday in the Great Eight, then returned to campus again for two
days for final exams. They are scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles
tonight. Will their legs make the trip?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those games are good for us, it just happened that they all
ended up one on top of another,'' Few said. ``It would have been
nice to have a week to prepare for UCLA, instead of a day. They
have a week to prepare for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are not the same Bulldogs the nation embraced last
spring _ not in personnel or performance.
</P>
<P>
   They're defending well and rebounding well, but something's
amiss on offense. Perhaps its a rhythm thing that will develop over
time. Perhaps it's a change in dynamics they won't ever correct _
March Magic lost forever. Whatever the reason, the Bulldogs are
shooting 26.1 percent from 3-point range after a 6-of-37
performance against Temple. Frahm, the chief bombadier, is shooting
20.5 percent. Santangelo isn't much better at 28.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing that well,'' Santangelo said. ``We're not
doing the little things that made us successful. I don't know when
we'll start clicking. As good as we are offensively, I'm sure we're
not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the Bulldogs are adjusting to the departure of coach
Dan Monson, who took the Minnesota job in July after signing a
10-year extension with Gonzaga. Few, a longtime assistant,
recruited many of the Bulldogs and has kept Monson's motion offense
intact, but no coaching change is seamless.
</P>
<P>
   First-team all-West Coast Conference center Jeremy Eaton is
gone, along with his leadership and 12 points per game. (Axel
Dench, a 6-11 senior, has replaced Eaton as the starting center.)
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant loss _ bigger, even, than Monson _ is
point guard Quentin Hall. He teamed with Santangelo to provide a
double-dose of ballhandling. He collapsed defenses with
penetration, which created open 3-point attempts for Frahm. He gave
Gonzaga its speed and its nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quentin got a lot of easy shots for everybody,'' Few said.
``He was fearless, and we fed off that. He was the guy who, if
(Cincinnati center) Kenyon Martin says something, he'd say it right
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also would have known what to do about those darn
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are coming after us, and we need to be able to hold
serve,'' Santangelo said. ``But this is what we all hoped for when
we decided to play college basketball. Whether we win or lose,
we've got stories to tell our grandkids.''

MISSION CONTROL FOR STAPLES CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe if NASA had access to the television
production facilities at Staples Center, it would not only have
found the Mars Probe, but images of the planet's south pole would
be entertaining fans on the Diamondvision at halftime of the Lakers
games.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But then, maybe after seeing what's behind the curtain at the
$14 million, 6,500-square-foot, dual-control rooms that are used
this season for Lakers, Clippers and Kings home games, you'd
understand that it pretty much makes the buzz-phrase ``state of the
art'' fit better with a description of an eight-slice toaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easily the No. 1 in-house facility in the country at this
time,'' said Gary Garcia, Fox Sports Net's vice president of
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the envy of sports-TV production around the country,''
said Jeff Proctor, Fox Sports Net's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing with a regional broadcast is making it
network quality with network resources,'' Kings producer Bob Borgen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Start by thinking of the 10-acre Staples Center not as a
sporting venue but a highest-of-tech TV studio with 34 permanent
camera positions in place. None of the 150,000 feet of fiber-optic
cable is exposed _ it's all built into the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the building, on the second floor of Staples Center
administrative offices on the corner of 11th and Figueroa, the
production facility owned by Slingshot Productions and rented out
to networks to use for any event inside is where it begins to looks
like a mission-to-Mars control room.
</P>
<P>
   In the main studio, a bank of some 60 TV screens fill one wall,
almost floor to ceiling, like an extravagant security room at a Las
Vegas casino. In the adjoining studio, separated by a pane of
glass, is for now an audio room with enough dials and slide bars to
record a few CDs while a game is going on. But it's also ready to
run High Definition Television, or HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a work in progress with the potential for millions of
dollars of more equipment and software to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Game producers and directors who've been accustomed to cramming
into long, narrow mobile-production trucks gasp when they first
enter this massive studio that isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intimidated, kind of in awe when I first walked in,''
said Mike Hassan, who has directed Kings games for four seasons and
got to do the first sporting event at Staples Center in late
October when the Kings opened against the Boston Bruins. ``The day
before the first game, we were in here 12 hours practicing. All the
cameras weren't up then. We didn't know what to expect. We had a
production truck outside as a backup.''
</P>
<P>
   But when nothing blew up and everyone realized what they were
just a part of, the future of TV didn't seem that far off.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the biggest adjustment for the crew had to be the
additional number of tape machines. Popping a feature together with
this new system can be done almost as quickly as the producer
thinks about it. And what makes that happen are the additional tape
machines, especially a couple of four-channel gadgets known as EVS
_ or ``Elvis'' in the production parlance _ that collect images and
have the immediate-replay ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that much different than what a TiVo machine will
do,'' said Garcia, referring to the popular new home-video digital
record and replay systems. ``The facility is really like a big
computer. With the push of one button, you can do almost
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Staples Center has room for six underground TV
production trucks, where visiting teams and networks will now
congregate rather than outside in the parking lot, the benefits to
those who get to use the in-house studio continue to be realized as
the less-than-two-month-old building continues to be worked in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's little to no set-up time for a TV game. The
Sony digital equipment is top-notch and stays that way because it
doesn't have to be packed up and moved by truck after every show.
</P>
<P>
   When games were at the Forum, preproduction meetings used to be
held in one part of the building while the game crew was off in
another part. Now, on a Kings game for example, broadcasters Bob
Miller and Jim Fox meet in the studio with producer Borgen and can
discuss graphic and replay ideas right with the technical crew
working on the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony one-of-a-kind cameras not only transmit the signal that
a standard TV production uses, but they simultaneously send HDTV
signals. Only a small number of facilities have in-house studios to
begin with, and of those, Madison Square Garden in New York is the
only other with the ability to do an in-house HDTV telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the next TV revolution,'' said Garcia of
HDTV. ``That's the next big thing we hope to roll out. When hockey
goes to HDTV, it'll become a sport people will want to watch even
more. Imagine not only seeing the puck clearly but seeing the logo
on the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've prided ourselves here, going back to Prime Ticket, of
being a leader in regional sports, and this keeps us there.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only the Lakers, Kings and Clippers have used the
control room. When a wrestling show came by Staples Center
recently, it had its own production truck. When NBC arrives on
Christmas Day to do the Lakers telecast, it also plans to bring its
own truck. KCAL-Channel 9 will take a crack at it on Tuesday's
Lakers-Clippers telecast (technically, a Lakers road game). Down
the road, it should be used for the Grammy Awards in late February
or even the Democratic National Convention later in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Center communications director Michael Roth said the
first HDTV telecast will likely involve a Japanese TV crew
televising a game to that country, but nothing has been booked.
</P>
<P>
   Are the crews spoiled by having all this at their fingertips?
Put it this way: When the Lakers, Kings or Clippers production
teams go out on the road, they feel as if they're taking a step
back in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to a truck to do a boxing show the other day and
felt like I was in a closet,'' said Jerry Romano, who produces
Lakers games for Fox Sports Net. ``Maybe this building is less
intimate than the Forum, but as far as working conditions, these
are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, and maybe even on Mars. &QL;

WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
__How 'bout Chick Hearn doing the wave on Sunday's Lakers-Magic
telecast? &QL; 
__Pay attention NBC: ABC won its ninth Eclipse Award for its
coverage of the Belmont Stakes. &QL; 
__Dick Enberg, waiting to find out if the Angels can work him into
a limited play-by-play duty for next season, has all but left NBC
after 25 years to join CBS, where he can do NFL games again as well
has have a role in Masters golf and U.S. Open tennis coverage.
Enberg's arrival comes as CBS has allowed the contract of Sean
McDonough run out after 10 years. &QL; 
__ESPN expands its ``Outside the Lines'' show to a weekly
Sunday-morning half-hour edition starting in April _ single-topic
shows that will dissect the week's major news events. The next
monthly installment, entitled ``Sports Behind Bars,'' will be
Wednesday at 4 p.m., a look at how sports thrive behind the walls
of the country's penal system. Included is a look at how the
inmates at the state prison in Lancaster get up each year for their
Super Bowl party. &QL; 
__ESPN SportsCentury's book will debut on The New York Times Best
Seller list _ No. 10 under nonfiction hardcover _ when it comes out
Sunday. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
__Howard David, the ``Monday Night Football'' play-by-play man on
CBS Radio, said it after the referee stopped the game and called
for the third video replay of the first half in the Vikings-Bucs
contest: ``They've had more reviews in this half than Gene Siskel
has had this month.'' Considering Siskel, the former Chicago
newspaper movie reviewer, has been deceased for almost a year. &QL; 
__USA Today's Rudy Martzke, in his annual ``Rudy Awards'' that seem
to come out about three times a year, decided that Fox's adding
Jimmy Kimmel to the NFL Sunday pregame show was one of the ``best
moves'' _ just months after he proclaimed it to be the worst hiring
this decade. &QL; 
__The nomination ballot for this year's Southern California Sports
Broadcasters Award, ``honoring the best in our profession'' for
1999, includes Karl Malone of KXTA in the radio talk-show-host
category. Funny enough in itself, except Malone never touched an
1150-AM mike (thankfully) in 1999. He was off the air by then when
the NBA lockout ended and he returned to his night job.

U.S. BEATS WORLD ALL-STARS

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The screams sounded more like it was an 'N Sync or 98
Degrees concert, but the red-white-and-blue painted faces revealed
who was really in town.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated's sportswomen of the year, the Women's World
Cup champion Team USA squad, brought its ``Toys R US,'' Victory
Tour to The Pond on Thursday, beating a group of World All-Stars,
9-7, in front of 11,613.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly scored five goals for Team USA, which visited the
Southland for the first time since beating China in the Women's
World Cup final last July at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the U.S. is nearing the end of what feels like an extended
victory lap, completing the final leg of the 12-city indoor tour
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team has three stops left, heading north to San Jose
(Saturday), Tacoma, WA. (Sunday), and then Portland Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do only have three games left, but I think the enthusiasm
is still building,'' said defender Brandi Chastain. ``It's
exciting, from the opening whistle the crowds have really been into
it and that get's us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. team finished its final training camp for
1999 in San Diego, saying goodbye to coach Tony DiCicco. The former
U.S. coach guided the U.S. to the 1996 Olympic Games gold medal as
well as this summer's World Cup. DiCicco, who retired in October,
leaves as the all-time winningest U.S. coach, compiling a 103-8-8
record in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Heifetz, press office for the U.S. Soccer Federation, said
he expects a successor to be named by mid-January, but wouldn't be
surprised if a new coach was named in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team learned Tuesday that it will not have four years
to call itself world champions. FIFA, international soccer's
governing body, announced that the next Women's World Cup will be
held in 2002 instead of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA made the change to avoid using the Women's World Cup as a
qualifying tournament for the Olympics, as it did with this year's
World Cup. By moving the World Cup to 2002, FIFA can now have an
Olympic qualifying tournament in 2003 for the 2004 Olympic games in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the switch, however, is that the men's World
Cup also competes in 2002, leaving the women wondering if that's
too much soccer for the American public to handle in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer was an indication of how well this tournament can
do on its own,'' said Chastain. ``There's no need to piggy-back it
with the men's tournament, even if they're giving some excuse that
teams need to qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ludicrous. The tournament needs to be a
stand-alone event for the very fact that it stood alone this summer
and drew greater crowds than playoff football and almost as many
people as the Pope (when he visited here).''
</P>
<P>
   Even Marla Messing, President of this summer's Women's World
Cup, was a little skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I was surprised and I think I'm still digesting the
decision,'' said Messing. ``I've heard they made the decision to
promote women's soccer which I'm a strong proponent of. But I think
it's difficult and will bring significant challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The women will likely lose media coverage, with most news
organizations spending their resources on the men, rather than the
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``FIFA is a smart organization and they have done wonders for
men's soccer, but I hope what they're doing will bear fruit for the
women's game,'' said Messing. ``Hopefully, people will look at this
as a really big year for the sport of soccer. I just hope FIFA
preserves their resources and spends wisely that year.''

MINIMED PRICE DIPS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As they witness the slide of their stock price,
officials at insulin pump maker MiniMed struggled Thursday to find
reason in the market's fickle ways.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in the Los Angeles-area community of Sylmar,
has absorbed two recent body blows. Rival Cygnus Inc., a Redwood
City, Ca.-based medical products developer, is nearing approval on
a product that will rival one of MiniMed's main lines. And the
company found a flaw in its newest insulin pump and had to notify
customers of this development.
</P>
<P>
   But neither should have driven down MiniMed's stock by half,
chief financial officer Kevin Sayer said. The stock price has
fallen 51.8 percent from its 52-week high of $108.25.
</P>
<P>
   The slide continued on Thursday, with shares losing 7.73 percent
to close at $52.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is fine. I really don't have an explanation for
what's going on,'' Sayer said. ``Cygnus' approval (of a rival
glucose monitor) has created some confusion among our investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Kruger, medical devices analyst for Banc of America
Montgomery Securities, said the real issue among investors is
figuring out just how quickly the company will grow in the next
year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger said the Cygnus issue is not the real problem but that
the investment community is re-evaluating MiniMed's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all scratching our heads, wondering what the company's
underlying growth rate is in the next few quarters,'' Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger still recommends the stock as a buy and has not
downgraded his earnings estimate of 21 cents per share for the
fourth quarter, but he believes the company might not grow as
rapidly as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Cygnus has designed a glucose monitor and a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration panel has recommended its approval.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed already has a monitor on the market.
</P>
<P>
   These devices continuously measure blood glucose levels.
MimiMed's is inserted under the skin and Cygnus' is external.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed says its monitor takes more measurements per day than
the Cygnus product and does not require a finger prick test for
calibration.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, MiniMed hopes to marry its continuous glucose
monitoring system with its insulin infusion pumps to create a
product that both monitors and adjusts a diabetes patient's blood
sugar levels.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A day after introducing its new product to the
telecommunications market, Vertel Inc. saw its shares rise sharply
for the second consecutive session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares increased 179.6 percent a day after
announcing the company has secured a major purchaser for its e-ORB
technology.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey-based optical switch maker Tellium will install
Vertel's e-ORB in its newest product, a switch for fiber optic
networks on which much of the Internet's traffic travels.
</P>
<P>
   Vertel spokeswoman Sandy Christopher said the market's response
to the new product has been outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very significant for us because it is a technology
that's taking us into the future,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   E-ORB is an object request broker, a piece of software that
manages the movement of data. It is designed to work under various
software platforms, including Linux and Microsoft NT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy because this is the area we wanted to get
into as we move into the future,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Vertel introduced e-ORB at a telecommunications conference in
Las Vegas on Wednesday, Christopher said. The response was
immediate, with the company's stock gaining more than 40 percent in
afternoon trading. The increase continued Thursday until the stock,
which was lingering around $2 per share before the announcement,
closed at $9 per share.
</P>
<P>
   More than 24.4 million shares traded hands Thursday, a stunning
amount considering the company has only 25.5 million shares
outstanding.!dlim!!end!

 Bruins start to understand the point 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRL
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A better effort. Better skating. More grit, determination, and
better execution.
</P>
<P>
   Those were all coach Pat Burns was looking for when he put his
club through punishing drills for three days after last Saturday's
embarrassing dismantling at the hands of the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday night's game at the FleetCenter against the
Edmonton Oilers, Burns wasn't predicting an outcome but said he
wanted complete commitment from his team.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A 2-2 tie that could easily have been a victory. But
the Bruins had trouble finishing against former Boston goalie Bill
Ranford (35 saves).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are now winless in their last five games (0-2-3), but
their coach said he was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the team responded well,'' said Burns, whose club
got a big lift from the return of defenseman Kyle McLaren and
forwards Joe Murphy and Rob DiMaio. ``We played well and played
hard right to the end. That's all I'm asking. I'm asking for a good
effort, and good things will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would've liked to pick up that extra point, but .
. . we had our chances to do it. We'll keep on working and if you
keep on working, it's going to come. We recall maybe two months ago
when we were getting our chances and we weren't winning games and
there was a lot of panic. I don't want to set that panic in. It'll
come if we stay and work the way we're working now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins carried a 1-0 lead into the first intermission, and
it easily could've been more as Boston outshot the visitors, 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:43, Mikko Eloranta made a perfect feed to Dave Andreychuk
in front for a point-blank opportunity. Thaw followed less than a
minute later when the checking line of Anson Carter, DiMaio, and
P.J. Axelsson peppered Ranford with a series of shots. All three
had bids from the left side, with Axelsson's second of two chances
nearly squeaking past Ranford at the left post.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison finally broke through with Boston on the power
play at 15:41. Andreychuk, who had the puck along the right side of
the goal line, dished to Allison, who was charging down the left
side. Allison shoveled it over Ranford for the 1-0 lead. It was
Allison's fourth goal and just the fifth power-play goal in the
Bruins' last 31opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers tied it less than a half-minute into the second
period on a goal by Doug Weight. Defenseman Tom Poti relayed a pass
to Weight, who was in the far right circle. Weight blasted a slap
shot that struck goalie Byron Dafoe in the right shoulder before
landing in the net at the 25-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock didn't last long, as Murphy, who was playing just
his second game as a Bruin and his first since Nov. 17, struck for
his second goal of the season. Murphy tried to beat Ranford with a
backhander from the left circle, but the Oilers goalie made the
save. The puck went out in front, caroming off skates. Murphy got
to the rebound, and his second backhand shot squeaked past Ranford
at 1:10.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins suffered a serious loss at 1:40 when Eloranta got
tangled with defenseman Bert Robertsson in the left corner of the
Oilers' zone and crashed feet-first into the boards. Eloranta, in
obvious agony, lay still and was attended to by the medical staff.
After several minutes, he was placed on a stretcher and transorted
to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a
badly broken left ankle and could be out several months.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he noticed a change in his team from that point.
``After that Mikko injury, I felt our play go down a little bit,''
said the coach. ``I don't know if it was the delay or because
players were concerned. It took a while to get going after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers took advantage and tied it, 2-2, on a goal by Todd
Marchant. Ryan Smyth, behind the Bruins' net, centered a pass out
to Marchant, who rapped it in at 13:59.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins outshot the Oilers, 7-5, in the third period and 3-0
in overtime, but had to settle for the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, I think we should be pleased with the effort,''
said Dafoe, who faced 21 shots. ``You're never happy with a tie,
but it's definitely a step in the right direction.''

 STATE JUSTICES LIMIT SCOPE OF SEX HARASS LAWSUITS  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Supreme Court limited the scope
of sexual harassment suits Thursday, ruling that victims can sue
their employers but not the co-workers who harassed them.
</P>
<P>
   By a unanimous vote, the high court said the state's harassment
laws apply only to employers who know or should know about the
offensive conduct and do not stop it.
</P>
<P>
   If an employer fails to take ``immediate and appropriate
corrective action,'' Justice Ming Chin wrote in the court's
opinion, ``there may be an unlawful employment practice, but it is
by the employer, not the co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   In a side note, the court made it clear for the first time that
if a supervisor is doing the harassing, the employer is
automatically liable, whether it knew about the conduct or not.
</P>
<P>
   However, it did not address whether supervisors can be held
personally liable if they harass people who work under them.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's decision, the court ruled against a female
employee of the state Department of Corrections who sued both the
department and the co-worker who she said harassed her over a
seven-month period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann Carrisales, who worked in a warehouse at the California
Institute for Men in Chino, claimed that co-worker Dave Selkirk
touched her on the buttocks and around the breasts and would come
up from behind her and touch her between the legs. She complained
to her bosses but said that he was let off with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, the court rejected the woman's argument
that holding the co-worker liable would help deter future
harassment. The law applies only to management, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the justices said the Legislature can always change the
harassment law if it wants to.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not mean that a harasser can escape unpunished.
The justices said the co-workers can still be held responsible
under other statutes, including battery and intentional infliction
of emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a setback for plaintiffs, who routinely sue both
the employer and the employee under the state's sexual harassment
law. William Quackenbush, the lawyer who argued the appeal for
Carrisales, said victims now will have to sue under statutes that
have largely been untested in harassment suits.
</P>
<P>
   But Quackenbush said he was relieved that the court didn't rule
out personal liability if a supervisor is doing the harassing.
``The bottom line is that supervisors are still on the hook,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrisales' trial lawyer, Mark Tundis, said the decision will
not hurt his client's case because she can still pursue her suit
against the department. But he said juries in general may wonder
about the strength of a case if the victim is suing only the
employer for harassment and not the co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was also a setback for the state Fair Employment and
Housing Commission, the agency in charge of implementing sexual
harassment laws and which had backed Carrisales' suit against her
co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're of course disappointed that the court decided to
eliminate this deterrent,'' said Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for
state Attorney General Bill Lockyer. She said the only way to
change the law is through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Selkirk's lawyer, Kathleen Stosuy, said Thursday's decision
brings California in line with federal law and most other states.
</P>
<P>
   She said the harassment law ``is directed at employers, who have
the best resources and incentive available to prevent any sort of
conduct or deal with it when it occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrisales had originally sued the department, Selkirk, and two
supervisors who she said did nothing to stop the harassment. A
trial judge threw out her suit, but a state appeals court said she
could pursue her harassment charges against the department.
However, the appeals court said that neither the supervisors nor
the co-worker could be sued under the law.

Charles gets the last laugh 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The funniest man in the NBA limped into the Ritz-Carlton
Thursday night and said he was depressed. He wore a symbol of his
depression on his left leg: a bulky brace that, remarkably, made
Charles Barkley look vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   You looked at the brace. You looked at its 36-year-old owner's
face. You knew it would be a while before Barkley would be able to
joke about his career ending five months earlier than he expected.
But there was never any doubt that the comedy would come. Remember,
we're still talking about Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's days as a pro ended Wednesday night in Philadelphia,
the city where he developed his unusual playing _ and saying _
style. Before this season began, he said he would retire. Thursday,
he said he has no plans to renege on that promise. His mother and
grandmother were in Philly's First Union Center when he ruptured
his quadriceps tendon, an injury that provided the ironic
punctuation for a 16-season career. He said maybe the ``Big Fella
who has always protected me'' is trying to tell him this is the
time to stop playing. Because of his injury, he also won't be able
to play his beloved golf for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf and sex are the only two things you can be bad at and
still have a blast doing them,'' he said. He followed that
statement with some additional comments that cannot be repeated in
a newspaper. Barkley did not whisper those words or say that they
were off the record. He was merely being himself.
</P>
<P>
   When he enters the FleetCenter Friday night and is given a
tribute at halftime, some people will applaud that aspect of
Barkley. In a society of timid speakers, he is fearless. He is
unafraid to speak about race, religion, sex, or politics.
</P>
<P>
   As he was checking into a 1994 game at the old Richfield
Coliseum in Ohio, he looked at Burt Graeff of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer and quipped, ``You know, you are still one of the ugliest
white men I have ever seen in my life.'' It was a running joke he
had with Graeff from the previous season, when he scanned a huge
crowd of reporters, paused to look at Graeff, and then broke
everyone up with the line.
</P>
<P>
   He targeted reporters of all shades. I saw him in Houston in
1996 and told him I worked for the Globe. He then smiled and
shouted to Clyde Drexler, ``Hey, Clyde! They've got a brother
covering the Celtics in Boston . . . and he ain't the mascot! Can
you believe this?''
</P>
<P>
   I laughed. And that was the point. Barkley can be contradictory
at times, but, essentially, he loves hearing and seeing people
laugh. Unlike many players in the current NBA, he understands that
it isn't exactly normal to make $9 million a year playing
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how my life could be any better,'' he said. ``I'm
telling you, it has been a blast. And it's very hard right now, I
ain't gonna lie. I tell you, I cried for like three hours straight
(Wednesday) night. It's hard and I know it's going to get harder. I
was 9 when I started playing basketball and I've played every day
since.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part? No more games. He won't play basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those guys who is going to join the church
league,'' he said. ``I'll be 37 in a couple of months and I've
never had a real job.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley made his job sound easy, but it wasn't for him. He
played most of his 16 seasons at power forward, a position that is
usually manned by those who stand anywhere from 6 feet 8 inches to
7 feet. Barkley is not quite 6-5, but he dominated his position for
years because he had two things going for him: a very big backside
and a big heart. He once said that rebounding is nothing but
desire, so he was able to set goals of leading the league in
retrieving missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   You never knew what to make of Barkley, the man or the player.
He has said that he would like to run for governor of Alabama, his
home state. He would run as a Republican. He once joked that he
hated white people, a comment that caused a furor. He once called
himself a ``1990s nigger,'' another comment that got a lot of
attention. He received feel-good phone calls Thursday from Michael
Jordan, Tiger Woods, Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, Rod Thorn (a man
who has fined him several times), and John Stockton. He was asked
if he heard from ex-teammate Scottie Pippen, who recently
criticized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scottie is on my voice mail,'' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to see Barkley leave so abruptly. He is an original
in today's NBA, kind of like a classic bodega surrounded by Stop &AMP;
Shops and Star Markets. Obviously the league will survive without
Barkley and Jordan and Ewing and Malone. There are players such as
Gary Payton, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal, and Jason
Kidd who would have been great in basketball's Golden Age (the
early 1980s). But who among them will speak so honestly? That's
what I'll miss most about Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   What will he miss? Boston, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when we came to Boston, the old guys on (the 76ers)
changed their whole disposition,'' he said. ``It wasn't just
another game. When we came to play the Celtics, you would see Moses
(Malone), Doc (Julius Erving), Maurice (Cheeks), Andrew Toney,
Bobby Jones . . . their whole demeanor changed. We would go into
other cities and would want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley learned about the parquet floor, Bill Russell, and the
banners hanging in the rafters. Red Auerbach once gave him a
compliment and ``I was on Cloud Nine.'' He still thanks Larry Bird
and Magic Johnson when he sees them because he believed they helped
make him who he is. Since Barkley likes to talk so much, it won't
surprise you to learn that he also chats with fans and thanks them,
too. He said he knew he was a good player after his trade to
Phoenix. The Suns were in Boston and he got a nice ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out somewhere, and a fan came up to me and said, `Did
you enjoy the game?' I said, `Every bit of it. That was a nice
ovation.' He said, `We couldn't cheer for you when you played for
the 76ers; we thought you were a good player but you played for the
76ers.' And that let me know that they know their basketball and
they appreciated what I was doing. That made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley will be back Friday night as a Houston Rocket. A retired
Rocket. He'll be limping. He'll also be telling a few jokes, but it
will still be sad to hear them this way.

BRUINS PAY THE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service cients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty-five minutes. One point. No detention.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins extended their winless streak to five games with a
2-2 tie against Edmonton Thursday night. It was a boring game, but
the Bruins were cnsderably better than last Saturday night when
they dropped a 9-3 decision to the Blackhawks, and coach Pat Burns
lifted the mandatory postgame media grilling that was in effect
after the rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well. We played hard right to the end,'' said the
coach. ``That's all I'm asking. It'll come if we stay and work the
way we're working now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston locker room was empty when officials threw open the
doors to the media. Players eventually drifted in for commentary,
but it was nothing like Saturday, when they were forced to face the
Fourth Estate. After the Saturday massacre, Burns told his players
to stay at their lockers until the local media had no more
questions. There would be no hiding, no trainer's room cowardice,
no back-door exit. Making it sound like reporters would be wielding
pickaxes instead of notepads, Burns ordered his players to ``sit
there until they are done with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Explained Burns, ``I told them I wasn't going to sit there and
make excuses for them. I wasn't trying to embarrass them. But it's
like, `You want the money? You want the contract? You want the
respectability? Well, you've got to be accountable.' I closed the
gym they sometimes use after games. I didn't want guys off in the
trainer's room sitting on ice bags. I told them to be respectful,
shut off the radio, and explain what happened. I wanted to hear
their version.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are highly paid athletes, and they should explain to the
guy who paid 95 bucks or 65 bucks why his night was spoiled. I
think the guys were all right with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a coach in another sport getting away with this. Imagine
Pete Carroll telling the Hell's Angels Patriots to siin front of
their lockers and engage the media after their latest stink bomb.
Who'd be the first member of the Kraft A.C. to tell Pete to
(expletive)? Players would be beating a path to the Foxy Lady
before traffic cleared on Route 1. (Come to think of it, how about
a special access road that'll get players from the new stadium to
he Foxy after games?)
</P>
<P>
   Accountability. It's a hockey thing. It's a word we don't use
enough in a world gone mad with excuses and diagnosed disorders.
It's a word that still exists in skating circles.
</P>
<P>
   Why are hockey players more accountable than Major League
Baseball players or the mastadons of the NFL and NBA?
</P>
<P>
   Some of it has to do with unions and contracts. Baseball's
Players Association runs that sport more than the commissioner.
Players have guaranteed contracts, and it's OK for Bobby Bonilla to
play cards in the clubhouse while his teammates are losing the
final game of the playoffs. The NBA is similarly smothered by
long-term deals, and few coaches have the hammer that Rick Pitino
wields in Boston (but who'll win the ultimate showdown between $50
million Rick and $70 million Antoine Walker?). In theory, pro
football coaches can be as powerful as hockey honchos, but only a
few flex the muscle _ think it's a coincidence Terry Glenn was most
productive in his one year under Bill Parcells? _ and the athletes
aren't as respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the way we're all brought up,'' said Bruins goalie
Byron Dafoe, who was mercifully pulled from the pipes in the middle
of the Saturday debacle. ``The coach has the authority. Guys make
more money than the coach, but he's the authority figure and we
respect that. may not be happy with all his decisions, but we
follow them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ray Bourque. The Bruins captain has been skating at the Old
and New Gardens for 20 years now. He is the consummate professional
hockey player and he's still not too big or old to be spanked by
his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we respect authority,'' said Bourque. ``The coach is
the coach and we respect the game. We weren't accountable on the
ice the other night, so after the fact we've got to be accountable.
That wasn't one or two guys the other night. It was a total team
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they sat in front of their lockers and took the heat
(``Take your best shot,'' volunteered Steve Heinze). Then they
skated until their blades flattened during training camp-type
practices Monday and Tuesday. There were no public complaints, no
Terry Glenn saying that being on time won't make them champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happens, we have to answer to it,'' said
veteran Dave Andreychuk. ``We're all adults. We've got to live up
to the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the Bruins skated harder and it showed. They
outshot the Oilers, 13-7, in the first period and 14-9 in the
second, 37-21 overall. The coach was pleased. It was the first of
six games in 10 nights and Burns said, ``The way we're working now,
everything's coming into place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday was god-awful,'' admitted veteran Don Sweeney. ``We
took it to heart. All of us realized we'd let everybody down.
(Thursday night) we got back to playing the way we want to play,
the way we need to play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They were accountable.

BARKLEY WILL STILL BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ His former coach knows for sure this is the end of the
line for Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say anything you want about the guy,'' Paul Westphal said
Thursday. ``Charles is not going to rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   Long live the Chuckster, who now says he wants to be turned
loose on national TV, where he wants a basketball analyst job.
</P>
<P>
   Guess it's better news than ``Barkley for Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no. I don't think that's a very good idea,'' Westphal
said, laughing, about Barkley's old declaration that he would make
a run in his native Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, but considering some of the candidates on the political
horizon, is Barkley really a worse choice than, let's say, Donald
Trump?
</P>
<P>
   One day after Barkley ruptured a tendon in his left knee and
fell to the floor in Philly _ his old Round Mound of Rebound
stomping ground _ the NBA was taking notice of its hefty loss.
</P>
<P>
   And Barkley, like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson,
was one of the big reasons why, during the '80s, the NBA surged to
become the standard-bearer for the wild success pro sports could
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, commissioner David Stern did his share to turn the NBA into
a sports/corporate juggernaut. But like the other Mount Rushmore
figures (Bird, Magic and Michael), Barkley _ all 6-foot-4 of him,
with two Olympic gold medals, the 11 All-Star appearances and his
inclusion as one of the NBA's 50 greatest _ did more than his
share.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley wasn't throwing fellow bar patrons through plate
glass windows; when he wasn't skewering referees such as Mike
Mathis by saying they belong in jail; when he wasn't trading
put-downs with Scottie Pippen; when he wasn't spitting on
spectators; when he wasn't clotheslining opponents; when he wasn't
making hysterically funny but racially charged jokes; when he
wasn't out playing hooky and golfing with Jordan during NBA
All-Star media days; when he wasn't getting summoned to New York to
visit with Stern about his boorish behavior ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, in other words, Barkley still had the time and the talent
and the personality and the inclination to turn the NBA on its ear
_ hard.
</P>
<P>
   He set a standard for competitiveness, for rebounding, for
playing the game to full-tilt boogie. And he did it while
entertaining fans as if he were playing for the Harlem
Globetrotters instead of NBA title-chasing teams.
</P>
<P>
   He sold tickets. He played the game to win. He lamented the
changing times that has given rise to too many agents, cell phones
and players as individual heads of corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In October, on the day Barkley announced this would be his last
season, he kicked off his farewell tour by giving away $3 million
to three different organizations in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a loss,'' said Westphal, whose time with Barkley in
Phoenix resulted in a tough Game 6 loss to the Bulls in the 1993
NBA Finals _ the closest Barkley ever came to the ring he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't artificially make someone be Charles Barkley. It's
like when Sandy Koufax retired, Major League Baseball lost
something. Or when Bill Russell retired or Larry Bird or Michael
Jordan,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   We're not trying to take anything away from Shaquille O'Neal,
who has probably only begun to show us what sort of force he will
be over the course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not taking anything away from Tim Duncan, a super
player who stepped up when David Robinson stepped back and led the
Spurs to the 1999 NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not depriving Allen Iverson of his props for being a
star attraction and even listening to coach Larry Brown once in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the NBA and its links to its heyday,
Barkley was the lone ranger out there this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Karl Malone and John Stockton
are active testaments to the beauty of the game when played at its
greatest level.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley did that and more ... in his own, inimitable
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the funniest people alive. And he's also a very,
very kind-hearted person who also has a temper. And he's
competitive. So how many people do you know like that?'' Westphal
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who he thinks has been dealt a tough break in life or
who are hurting, he cares about. And the people who he thinks are
trying to get something from him, well, he's got a saying for them,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed perfectly fitting that while Jordan retired (twice) to
whirring tape recorders and TV cameras in well-orchestrated news
conferences, Barkley's last NBA moment came with a hard hit to the
floor. He landed on his infamously large backside and knew right
away what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   His basketball days are over, Barkley said as he headed to
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But, certainly, we have not heard the last of Sir Charles. Not
hardly.

 AIR BOARD OKs MTBE-FREE GAS FORMULA  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The California Air Resources Board unanimously
approved Thursday a new formula for the state's gasoline that will
eliminate the additive MTBE while maintaining strict air quality
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new gasoline formula, which could increase gas prices
anywhere from 1 cent to 15 cents per gallon, will be required by
the beginning of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The board's 10-to-0 decision satisfied neither environmentalists
nor oil industry representatives, who testified before the board
for more than eight hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry representatives charged that the new formula is too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Jay McKeeman, executive vice president of the California
Independent Oil Marketers Association, said he expects a 10- to
15-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline costs as a result of the
approved regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very significant concerns that this will turn into a
situation that equals this summer's price conditions, if not
worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists argued that the formula does not go far
enough to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coleman, a spokesman for Bluewater Network, an
environmental group in San Francisco, said he does not believe that
the air board recipe will maintain existing air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically handed over the keys to the oil industry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lloyd, chairman of the air resources board, said, ``Today's
action will enable us to further clean our air without putting our
drinking water at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) is an additive that was
intended to reduce emissions. Studies have shown that it has leaked
into groundwater and can cause cancer in animals.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Gov. Gray Davis ordered a phaseout of MTBE by the end
of 2002, while at the same time maintaining current air quality
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under Davis' directive, the air resources board was required to
remove MTBE from the current gasoline formula. However, federal
regulations still require the use of either MTBE or ethanol in the
worst-polluted areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes a very narrow path for us,'' said air resources
board spokesman Jerry Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is asking for a waiver from federal regulations to allow
the use of additives other than ethanol that would give the oil
companies more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   An original air board staff report on the changes suggested that
gas prices would go up as much as 7 cents a gallon to make up for
the reduced capacities the refineries would have as they switched
to non-MTBE gas.
</P>
<P>
   But another study by the California Energy Commission and
statements by one oil refinery, Tosco Inc., suggest that there may
no price increase at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pretty much resolved that their predictions are more
accurate,'' Martin said. ``We notoriously overestimate things. If
everything else remains same, then there will be less than a cent a
gallon increase.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the view held by Dave Fogarty, a spokesman for
the Western States Petroleum Association, a group that represents
the oil industry. He said the air resources board formula goes
beyond just maintaining current standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The option we are suggesting has the least consumer risk in
it,'' he said. ``It would remove MTBE and would provide emissions
reduction equivalent to the gasoline we have in California today,
which is the cleanest in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry laid out a proposal that would still remove
MTBE but would not alter the formula as much, thereby providing
greater flexibility in how the gas can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty said he expects the new regulations to decrease oil
refinery capacity by 10 to 15 percent, raising prices about 7
cents.
</P>
<P>
   But Tosco said it fully supports the California Air Resources
Board regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tosco is pleased to unconditionally support the staff's
proposal,'' said company representative Duane Bordvick. ``They will
eliminate MTBE, provide the flexibility needed to minimize the
potential reduction in supply, and minimize the economic impacts of
the MTBE phaseout. In addition, they provide some additional air
quality benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Tosco announced that it will phase out all MTBE by
the end of 2000, two years ahead of schedule, if the federal
Environmental Protection Agency grants a waiver of its requirement
to have an oxygenate in the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has pledged to push for the waiver, which all oil
companies said would greatly lessen the burden of eliminating MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The waiver) would certainly mitigate the problems to a large
degree,'' said McKeeman. ``It basically gives refiners a lot more
flexibility in trying to figure out how to make compliant
gasoline.'' &LR;

 STATES TOLD TO TRACK DATA IN HIV CASES  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government's major AIDS agency issued controversial
new guidelines Thursday calling on states and local public health
departments to report all HIV cases either by name or code in an
effort to develop a nationwide AIDS surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction was swift from AIDS advocacy groups, many of whom
oppose any national reporting requirement for fear that any system
based on names will discourage many  &LR; people from seeking testing.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines were issued by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, which wants to track where and how the AIDS
virus is spreading. The agency has kept complete records of
patients with the diseases defined as AIDS since the epidemic began
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC estimates that as many as 900,000 Americans are now
living with HIV infection and that 297,000 of them have AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal health agency has been trying to create a
national HIV reporting system for more than two years, maintaining
the system's accuracy is difficult because most states and cities
have anonymous HIV testing sites, and home testing kits can be
bought anonymously at many pharmacies or even by mail or through
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   California does not require any reporting of HIV cases, but AIDS
cases _ like most other infectious diseases _ must be reported by
law.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by California Assemblywoman Carol Migden, D-San
Francisco, that has twice passed the Senate and Assembly would
require reporting of HIV infection cases using a secret code
instead of names, but it has been vetoed by both Gov. Gray Davis
and his predecessor, Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said early this year, however, that he would sign a new
version of the Migden bill if the CDC provided funding for the
reporting system. The cost for maintaining such a statewide system
has been estimated at $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill has been supported by the state Health Department
as well as by the California Medical Association and many other
medical groups.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Dr. Herminia Palacio, director of the Health
Department's special projects, said the city is experimenting with
a pilot project collecting information on new HIV infections using
a cryptographic code instead of names. The reports contain detailed
and coded information such as the person's gender, age, ethnicity
and whether the infected person is in a ``high risk'' category of
drug use, has other sexually transmitted diseases, or is a man
having sex with other men.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the new federal guidelines was predictable Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California's Center for AIDS Prevention
Studies in San Francisco, director Thomas J. Coates called the
CDC's system _ already operating in more than 35 states _ ``a huge
mistake'' because it cannot detect when or where the HIV infections
have occurred and surely would discourage many people from being
tested or treated.
</P>
<P>
   Far more effective, Coates said, would be a system based on
reporting HIV cases detected in prenatal clinics, substance abuse
services and clinics for sexually transmitted diseases. Such a
``sentinel surveillance'' system would give truly useful
information for effective HIV prevention planning, Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see any disincentive to undergo HIV testing as a problem,''
Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action, a
Washington-based advocacy group, told the Associated Press.
``Anything that's keeping people away from knowing their HIV status
is a bad idea, unless there's a compelling reason to do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco AIDS Foundation, however, issued a statement
Thursday supporting a statewide HIV reporting system that could be
transmitted to the CDC as long as it uses codes rather than names,
and urged the governor and the legislature to move swiftly in
developing the system.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four states have developed HIV surveillance methods using
the names of those who test positive for the virus, although the
names are legally kept confidential and are not forwarded to the
CDC. Four other states use some sort of code for their HIV
reporting systems.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's new guidelines maintain that ``confidential
name-based'' HIV surveillance is the best way to track how the
infection is spreading, but that states adopting ``coded
identifiers'' can count on technical and financial assistance from
the agency.

 SEVERE NURSING SHORTAGE AHEAD IN CALIFORNIA, REPORT SAYS  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without a substantial boost in public university training,
California will face a serious shortage of nurses in the coming
decades, according to a new federally commissioned report.
</P>
<P>
   The study by researchers at the University of California at San
Francisco estimates that by 2010, California will need 43,000 more
registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Current training programs would add only 9,000, and another
13,000 registered nurses are expected to move to California from
other states. That still leaves a shortage of 21,000 nurses.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 183,000 California registered nurses in
active practice today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommendation is for an increase in the number of RNs
educated at public colleges and universities. It would require an
increase in state funding,'' said Janet Coffman, associate director
of the UCSF Center for California Health Workforce Studies, and
lead author of the report. She estimates that 3,600 more nurses
need to be trained in the state each year, two-thirds more than the
5,400 who graduate from current programs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8 out of 10 registered nurses in California were
trained in either community colleges or the California State
University system.
</P>
<P>
   The university system, however, does not track the cost of
training a registered nurse, so there are not definitive estimates
on the cost of training 3,600 new nurses.
</P>
<P>
   John Richards, director of budgeting for the California State
University system, notes that nurse training requires about twice
the number of faculty per student as most programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most expensive,'' he said. Overall, California
spends about $10,000 a year on each student in the state university
system.
</P>
<P>
   The study, underwritten by the federal Health Resources and
Services Administration, is published in this month's issue of the
journal Image: Journal of Nursing Scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman's forecast of a nursing shortage is based on projections
of a 23 percent increase in the state population by 2010, and
assumes that the ratio of registered nurses per state resident will
remain constant.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman concedes that the estimates are conservative. A new
state law requiring the Department of Health Services to set
staffing ratios for nurses in hospitals could increase the demand
for nurses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the current labor force is aging, and large number
of nurses will be retiring. ``Just as Baby Boomers begin to need
more care, Baby Boomer nurses are going to start leaving the
workforce,'' said Coffman.
</P>
<P>
   Kay McVay, president of the California Nurses Association, said
there is already a shortage of nurses, and puts the blame for it on
the legacy of layoffs and mistreatment of the profession by
California hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do something to make nursing extremely attractive.
You can't mistreat nurses and expect them to continue on,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Study co-author Joanne Spetz, a fellow of the Public Policy
Institute of California, said wages for nurses in the state have
not kept up with inflation. Average hourly earnings in 1997 were
$25.46, two dollars less, when adjusted for inflation, than nurses
made in 1994.

 SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA TECH FIRM'S STOCK SOARS A RECORD 697%  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the hottest initial public offering in Wall
Street history, shares in a little-known Sunnyvale, Calif., company
Thursday soared from an offering price of $30 to a close of $239.25
_ a record 697.5 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux Systems Inc., which sells computers, software and
services based on the upstart Linux operating system, ended the day
with a market capitalization of $9.5 billion _ even though it has
lost $29.9 million over its six years of existence and declared in
official documents accompanying the IPO that it ``expects to
continue to incur net losses for at least the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a huge general surge of momentum around Linux
companies,'' said Gail Bronson, a startup strategist based in Palo
Alto, Calif., and senior analyst at the IPO Monitor. ``They're
riding the crest of a wave of euphoria about the idea of an
alternative to Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux is ``open source'' software _ programmers all over the
world work cooperatively to extend and improve it, and their work
is available free for anyone to download from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the software has gained popularity as an
alternative to Microsoft's Windows NT and other heavy-duty
commercial operating systems, especially for Internet server
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux has the potential to become a major industry over the
next few years, and this is probably the strongest of the Linux
companies we've seen,'' said Irv DeGraw, a Florida professor who
earned his doctorate in economics by studying IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Linux ``could be almost as big as Microsoft (Windows),'' added
DeGraw, an assistant professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg,
Fla., and research director of WorldFinanceNet.com, a Web site that
focuses on IPOs. ``I'm not saying that's going to happen, but it
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Thursday seemed to think that prospect was worth
betting on. The banks underwriting the VA Linux sale had originally
set a target offering price of $11 to $13 for the 4.4 million
shares they planned to sell. In the face of strong demand they
raised it several times over the past month, up to a final figure
of $30.
</P>
<P>
   But when the shares hit the market Thursday morning, the first
trade took place at a staggering $299. Over the course of the day
the price soared as high as $320, then dropped all the way back to
$233, before closing at $239.25 on the Nasdaq. At that price, the
179-person company is now worth slightly more than Best Buy,
Staples Inc. or Estee Lauder. VA Linux closed at $250 in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 697-percent single-day jump shattered the old record
of 606 percent, set last year by TheGlobe.com, a Web site that
allows people to build personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``These outrageous jumps between the offering price (set by the
underwriters) and the opening trade are something new,'' DeGraw
said. ``Historically, until recently, it's averaged around 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has us academics all screwed up,'' he acknowledged. ``We
really don't know what's making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux is not the only Linux-related company to enjoy a huge
post-IPO bump. Red Hat, the first company in the field to go
public, sold its first share on August 11 at $14 and closed
Thursday at $286.25. Andover.net, a company that runs a complex of
Web sites aimed largely at Linux programmers, sold its first shares
on Tuesday at $18 and closed Thursday at $77.50.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Linux is available free and runs on conventional
PCs, among other kinds of computers, installation is sometimes
complex, and some PC hardware components are not compatible with
the system _ which is why companies starting to use it are often
willing to pay for professional assistance.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux got its start in 1993 selling computers with the
operating system preinstalled and tested. Over the past year it has
expanded its business to provide consulting and support to
corporations running Linux. It also acquired the coveted Linux.com
domain name and used it to set up what has become a heavily
trafficked informational site for Linux users and developers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's IPO brought the company a capital infusion of $132
million. At the closing price, company chief executive and
president Larry Augustin and his wife, who own 6.6 million shares,
are now worth about $1.6 billion, at least on paper. Augustin, who
was one of the company's founders, already has some experience with
runaway Internet success: As a Stanford graduate student, he helped
write the business plan for Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the chip giant and an investor in VA Linux, also made a
handsome gain: Its 3.5 million shares are now worth about $837
million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's backers also include Silicon Valley venture
capital firm Sequoia Capital, which holds a 23 percent stake valued
at $2.16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ending in July, VA Linux had a net loss of $14.5
million on revenues of $17.7 million. For the quarter ending in
October, its net loss totaled $10.2 million on revenues of $14.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux apparently made an effort to share its bounty with the
community of programmers who helped create the operating system it
now sells. According to reports posted last week at several
Linux-related Web sites, the company offered some 3,000 Linux
programmers outside the company the opportunity to purchase up to
140 shares each at the opening price.
</P>
<P>
   Eureka Endo, a spokeswoman for VA Linux, declined to confirm the
report, saying the company's lawyers had insisted that all
employees respect the government-mandated ``quiet period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say,'' she said, ``is that it's been a really high
day.''

 &HT;    `Walker, Texas Ranger' star quits to run for Congress
 &HT;    By Glenn Evans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Noble Willingham, who portrays C.D. Parker on
the television show ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' says he will leave
the show at the end of the year to concentrate on his run for
Congress from East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He announced here this week that he has laid out the $2,500
filing fee to enter the race for Texas's District 1 congressional
seat. Willingham will run as a Republican against incumbent
Democrat Max Sandlin.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham told supporters that his final episode is the
Christmas show. Writers tentatively plan to have his character win
the lottery and take off to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad idea,'' he said before describing his
departure from the show after seven years. ``We had a mutual deal.
They wanted to know what I thought they should do about it. They
were amenable to me leaving, and they wanted me to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get to what's really important, and that's this.
I wouldn't want to stretch myself too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Willingham contrasted himself with Sandlin as ``about like
daylight and dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin, he said, has veered too far to the liberal side of the
political spectrum by linking himself with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham said he would return to his California residence this
week, planning to catch the annual dog show in Indio, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the first of the year we're going to hit it running,'' he
said. ``And we're going to hit it hard, and we're going to have
blood in our eyes.''

GORE REGAINS FOOTING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's decision to opt for a more relaxed
approach with voters and a more combative stance against former
Senator Bill Bradley appears to have arrested his slide in New
Hampshire, according to a new Boston Globe/WBZ-TV pollof the
state's likely Democratic primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley's unexpected success in leveling the contest in
the state that will hold the critical first presidential primary,
Gore has regained his footing, especially among registered
Democrats. And voter preference, which appeared to be inching
toward Bradley over the fall, has evenout.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of good news for Gore, core Democratic voters who had
begun to drift away from him while his campaign was in a state of
public disarray in September and October appear to be coming back.
On the other hand, despite Gore's more aggressive campaigning and
pointed criticisms of Bradley, the former New Jersey senator has
continued to become better-known and more populaang Granite state
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll of 400 Democrts and independents who say they plan
to vote in the Feb. 1 primary, 43 percent said they would vote for
Gore and 43 percent for Bradley if the primary were held now.
Thirteen percent said they are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the standing of the Democratic candidates remains
essentially unchanged _ a Globe/WBZ-TV poll in late October had the
two in a statistical tie _ the poll made it clear how much the race
could change between now and the primary. Just 31 percent of those
who expressed a candidate preference said their choice was
definite. And among independent voters, 37 percent said they still
might switch over and vote in the Republican primary instead. That
could be a critical factor, as Bradley remains immensely popular
among independents, who are free to vote in either party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was conducted on Monday and Tuesday evenings by
KRC Communications Research, has a potential margin of error of
plus or minus five percentage points for the whole sample. For
subsamples within the poll, the potential margin of error is
greater.
</P>
<P>
   The poll underscores the volatility among primary voters, but
especially among independents, whose ranks have swollen in New
Hampshire. Since August, polls by the Globe have shown that
independents, no matter which primary they say they plan to vote
in, have high opinions of Bradley and Republican Senator John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If the poll suggests Gore has arrested a modest slide, it
contains heartening news for Bradley as well: Despite Gore's strong
criticism of him, Bradley's favorable ratings among likely voters
have only increasd as he becomes better known. Put another way,
Gore's continual attacks on Bradley's policy notions may have
helped the vice president. But as Gore has placed a spotlight on
his opponent, the result seems to have increased Bradley's
recognition _ and his popularity, too.
</P>
<P>
   And even as registered Democrats in the sample seem to prefer
Gore, by 50 to 37 percent, Bradley has an even stronger lead among
independents, who prefer him to the vice president by 58 to 26
percent. And among those voters who said they are paying a lot of
attention to the contest, Bradley leads by 56 to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, the third measurement of the Democratic contest
done for the Globe and WBZ-TV since August, shows that the race
remains a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of August, Gore held a lead of just 40 to 36 percent
_ the first poll to show that the vice president faced a formidable
challenge in the state. In the second poll in mid-October, Bradley
had forged a small lead, 45 to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, Gore's association with President Clinton
remains a political ball and chain. Indeed, Gore goes out of his
way to avoid mentioning Clinton while campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job performance ratings remain very high among
Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, where the economy is
extraordinarily robust. But personally, Clinton's popularity
ratings are anemic, well below the ratings of both of the Democrats
who want to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley's supporters are asked why they do not support
Gore, fully 25 percent cite his ties to Clinton. Another 16 percent
say they do not like Gore's image _ a hint that the subordinate
office Gr holds has its own downside with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Because the candidates are campaigning constantly in the state,
are running advertising spots, and the contest receives substantial
media attention, early poll results in New Hampshire remain a
potential barometer for later national sentiment. And a victory in
New Hampshire, especially for an insurgent candidate, often
provides momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls, Gore still retains a substantial lead _ 56 to
34 percent in a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll last month, for instance.
But Bradley is less well-known nationally. In New Hampshire, 81
percent of the likely primary voters can now name Bradley as a
candidate without prompting, compared to 88 percent for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are highly popular with Granite State voters,
suggesting that either one could draw support from the other. Fully
75 percent of the likely primary voters have a favorable view of
Gore, up from 57 percent in October. Seventeen percent have a
negaive view of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, despite the rhetorical pounding meted out by Gore, is
viewed favorably by 72 percent of voters, and unfavorably by just
10 percent. Another 16 percent of the voters could not rate Bradley
because they do not yet know enough about him.

 &HT;    Connerly still plans to change Florida law
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ending affirmative action in Florida has
become tougher than Ward Connerly expected. Delays in the Supreme
Court are forcing him to postpone his petition drive and dimming
the chances of getting the issue on the ballot next year.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court justices will not hold hearings until March 6 on
whether Connerly's proposed changes to the state constitution meet
the legal requirements for getting on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, it could take months for the court to make a
ruling. The seven justices must determine if the amendments are
clear, easy to understand and address only a single topic. Connerly
has offered four versions of his amendments hoping the court will
be unable to reject all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of stopping our campaign,'' Connerly said
Thursday from California, where he is a member of the state
university board of regents. ``We certainly need to reevaluate how
the campaign needs to be organized in light of the Supreme Court's
timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting on Florida's ballot to change the constitution is not
easy in the best of circumstances. First, 43,500 signatures must be
collected from registered voters. Those signatures must be verified
by elections supervisors in each county where they are collected.
Then, the proposed amendment must go to the state Supreme Court for
its approval. If a majority of the justices give it the nod,
another 391,500 signatures must be collected by August. All of
those signatures must be verified by county election supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only time consuming, but expensive, with the cost
estimated at $1 million. Connerly said he doesn't want to spend the
money collecting signatures now in case the court tosses out the
amendments. If he wins approval, Connerly says there simply won't
be enough time after the court's decision to collect the necessary
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   While the slowness of the process here is frustrating to
Connerly and his supporters, he said he is determined to see it
through. If Connerly continues the effort, the earliest he could
get on the ballot after 2000 would be November 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that Mr. Connerly has decided to slow things
down,'' said Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. ``I don't support the
initiative and if this means there won't be a divisive ballot
initiative, I believe that is a good thing.'' Bush has his own plan
to do away with affirmative action, which he calls the One Florida
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who succeeded in passing state amendments in
California and Washington, is coming to West Palm Beach next Friday
to speak at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches luncheon at the
downtown Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Called divisive, disruptive and a traitor to his race, Connerly
has received blistering criticism for his nationwide effort to
force state and local governments to abandon affirmative action
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who is black, argues that affirmative action does more
harm than good. He contends that blacks should be given
opportunities based on merit. He says the role of government is to
help those in need regardless of race or gender.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have indicated that if Connerly's amendment were to
get on the ballot it would pass overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another,'' he said, ``we are going to get on the
ballot.''

 &HT;    Obituary sweepstakes
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ We had finished a delicious breakfast of
Eggbeaters, low-fat jelly and seven-grain toast dabbed with
margarine made from yogurt. I was starting on the sports section
and a second cup of coffee dosed with Sweet 'n' Low when she looked
up from her end of the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've changed the way they write about people when they
die,'' my wife said. ``Why did they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way things are,'' I explained. ``Everything gets
changed. Like what we have for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by that?'' she asked, somewhat irritably, I
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean anything,'' I lied. ``I was just thinking how
lucky we are now that we aren't clogging our arteries with terrible
stuff like real eggs, sausage, cheese grits, hot biscuits, butter
and gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're lucky to have me looking after your diet,'' she
replied. ``If you ate like you want to, you would weigh 300 pounds
and have a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks a lot,'' I answered. ``What do you find so different
about newspaper obituaries?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mostly about ordinary people,'' she said. ``They used
to be mostly about prominent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I agreed. ``I've noticed that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why they changed to ordinary folks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the egalitarian age,'' I explained. ``Used to
be you had to run a big company, be rich and live in Buckhead, or
be in the Legislature to get a big headline on the obituary page.
That wasn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you have to do now to qualify for a nice obituary?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly you have to just die,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ordinary people die every day,'' she said. ``How do
they pick the ones they write about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I admitted. ``Potluck, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed men who liked to have gardens and go fishing get
nice write-ups,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good crop of tomatoes can get you a three-column headline on
a slow day,'' I agreed. ``So can being a good dancer, liking to
play poker and telling funny jokes. If you took up sewing and
started back frying chicken and making gravy you might be a
candidate yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that people who aren't rich and famous can get in the
obituaries, do you think they might write something about you when
you die?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about it,'' I admitted. ``It could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they get information about ordinary people?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, they call the surviving spouse and the children,'' I
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you died and they called me?'' she asked. ``What in
the world could I say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we need to think about,'' I replied,
``especially since I've just had another birthday I really didn't
expect to have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And with the way you keep slipping off on the tractor and
smoking those cigars,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard of an advance obituary?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean one that's written before you actually die?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' I said. ``The newspaper sends a reporter to
interview old people who ran big companies, or who are rich and
live in Buckhead, or have been in the Legislature. They get to tell
about their notable achievements and list all the exclusive clubs
they belong to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporter goes back to the newspaper and writes it all down
and puts it in a computer. When the person dies all the newspaper
has to do is call up the story and punch in age and time of the
funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is that going to help me?'' she asked. ``They don't do
advance obituaries on ordinary folks, do they?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could do one ourselves,'' I replied. ``If you
were to get a call, you could just read it off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What would it say?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bit of a problem,'' I admitted, ``but I've done a few
things in my lifetime that ought to qualify under the new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't play golf or poker, and you sure can't dance,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played poker in the Army,'' I replied. ``That's why we had
to go to the Varsity instead of the Owl Room when we were dating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate for our friends to know about that,'' she said.
``Can't you think of anything that would impress people?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could mention my longtime membership in the Moose Lodge.
You could say I won a $10 bet from Heyward Owens when Harry Truman
beat Tom Dewey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put in that I raised a fabulous tomato crop in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you think of anything sophisticated?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can point out that even though I didn't go to Georgia
Tech, I learned how to use e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't call,'' she said. ``I don't think you'd make
much of a story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to work on that,'' I replied. ``If this starvation
diet you have me on works, maybe I'll live long enough to learn how
to dance and play poker. I might even do something really weird
like getting into organic gardening or turning into a Republican
and running for the County Commission.''

 &HT;    Following for contemporary Christian music grows
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gospel music caught fire in the 1990s. At the
beginning of the decade, contemporary Christian music, though it
had been around for about 20 years, tended to be viewed in the
mainstream marketplace as old-fashioned, irrelevant or inferior.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Among the acts that have climbed pop, modern rock,
adult contemporary and R&AMP;B charts in the decade are Amy Grant,
Michael W. Smith, BeBe and CeCe Winans, Jars of Clay, Kirk Franklin
and Sixpence None the Richer. dc Talk's 1998 rock release,
``Supernatural,'' debuted at No. 4 on Billboard's top 200, and Bob
Carlisle's ``Butterfly Kisses (Shades of Grace)'' album reached No.
1, the first Christian album to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream media haven't missed this phenomenon. Entertainment
Weekly, in its Dec. 3 and 10 issues, looks at the rapid growth in
Christian music, fiction and film, calling it ``The Greatest Story
Ever Sold.''
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of this story, ``gospel'' music is a
broad-based term encompassing a wide range of musical styles from
Southern Gospel to black gospel to praise and worship and pop,
rock, R&AMP;B, hip-hop, swing, reggae and so forth. Contemporary
Christian music has a slightly narrower focus, generally speaking
more in terms of pop, rock, R&AMP;B, hip-hop and other genres that
reflect popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   According to SoundScan Inc. figures reported by the Gospel Music
Association in July, 20.5 million units were sold in the first six
months of 1999, a 21 percent increase e same period in 1998.
This was on top of increases of 30 percent, 32 percent and 1.4
percent in 1996, '97 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   SoundScan numbers placed Christian music fifth in size in 1998,
behind R&AMP;B, rap, country and soundtracks and ahead of metal, jazz,
classical, Latin and new age.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, someone wanting to buy a release by a Christian
artist, other than Grant and Smith, perhaps, probably would have
had to go to a Christian retailer. That's no longer the case.
According to a study by the GMA, which is dedicated to educating
the public and music industry about gospel music, as well as
producing the annual Dove Awards telecast, Wal-Mart, the nation's
biggest retailer, devotes more than 20 percent of its selling space
to Christian music.
</P>
<P>
   And those wanting to listen to the music on the radio had an
even tougher time in the '80s, unless they preferred the more
conservative inspirational or Southern gospel genres. A dozen years
ago, the GMA study said, fewer than 200 stations nationwide played
gospel music, but by 1998, that had grown to more than 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of factors have influenced this change. A few are
listed below, as well as a couple other issues or developments that
got a lot of attention in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   1. Big business: Mainstream entertainment conglomerates saw the
potential and they bit, buying Christian music labels and
distributing their products. They've settled into the big three:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaylord Entertainment Co. owns Word, Myrrh, Squint and other
labels, and it distributes for independent labels such as
Maranatha!, Rocketown and B-Rite/Gospo Centric.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zomba Music Group created Provident Music Distribution Inc.
and owns Brentwood, Benson, Reunion and Essential.
</P>
<P>
   _ EMI Christian Music Group counts among its labels Sparrow,
ForeFront, EMI Gospel, and it distributes for smaller labels such
as Gotee, 5 Minute Walk, Springhill and Vineyard Music.
</P>
<P>
   2. SoundScan: When Billboard magazine began counting Christian
retailers in its SoundScan charts in 1995, it had an immediate
impact _ half or more of the sales occur there.
</P>
<P>
   3. Diversity: Christian music is the only genre defined by its
lyrics. Stylistically, you can find just about anything in gospel
that you can in mainstream _ hip-hop, pop, R&AMP;B, country, adult
contemporary, reggae, Latin, modern rock. And, of course, Southern
and black gospel haven't faded away.
</P>
<P>
   4. Worship and praise music: In the beginning, there was the
hymnal. Then came Bill and Gloria Gaither. Then the Maranatha! and
Vineyard labels. In the past two years, virtually every major label
has added praise and worship labels; even Toby McKeehan of dc Talk
and Gaither himself teamed up on a worship label this year. The
guitar- and drum-based music is causing a generational tumult in
the church that hasn't been seen since the beginnings of ``Jesus
music'' 30 years ago. It's too shallow, it's too loud, it's too
emotional. Or, it speaks to the heart, it's relevant, it's bringing
people into the church.
</P>
<P>
   5. Growing pains: Such expansion doesn't come without some worry
and debate. What is Christian music? Can a love song to your spouse
be ``Christian''? Both Sixpence None the Richer and Michael W.
Smith had songs eliminated from Dove competition by the Gospel
Music Association judging last year because the content wasn't
specifically focused on Jesus. (Rules have been relaxed for 2000.)
To be fair, GMA was only reacting to the discussion going on by
those in the industry, including singers Steve Camp and Charlie
Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the decade, great fear was expressed over whether
mainstream corporate owners would pressure artists to tone down
mention of Jesus to sell more records. So far, that doesn't seem to
be a huge concern.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there have been scandals, involving Michael
English's and Sandy Patti's infidelities and broken marriages.
English, one of the most promising artists in the early '90s,
returned his Dove awards and disappeared from public eye for an
extended time. He's been returning gradually, and you can expect to
see more of him in 2000. Patti has not regained her former
prominence either. It remains to be seen what the fallout will be
for Amy Grant, who was divorced from singer Gary Chapman earlier
this year and is now seeing country artist Vince Gill.
</P>
<P>
   _ A trend to watch out for in the '00s: The growing
internationalization of Christian music. The Newsboys, Rebecca St.
James and Michelle Tumes _ all from Australia _ caught on in the
'90s, and Delirious, from England, came on strong at the end.
Expect this to expand in the next 10 years. The Christian Latin
market, with Jaci Velasquez as its poster child, is beginning to
blossom, and Newsboys front man Peter Furler helped launch a new
label, inpop, to focus on artists from outside the States. Its
first band, a fellow Aussie group called beanbag, recently released
its first stateside CD, ``Free Signal.''

 &HT;    Falcons assistant admired for his personality, football
knowledge
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After intercepting a pass in practice, Falcons free
safety Eugene Robinson ran down the sideline. Robinson had one man
to beat, and he figured it would be a cinch. After all, Marvin Bass
is 80 years old, and the last time he played he was wearing a
leather helmet.
</P>
<P>
   As Robinson approached, he yelled, ``You ready for me, coach
Bass?''
</P>
<P>
   The white-haired gentleman, a college All-American 55 years ago
at William &AMP; Mary, assumed a would-be tackling stance, clipboard in
hand, and replied, ``Lemme tell you something; I'm still doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Bass is.
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps the senior member of any NFL staff, Bass has given
the majority of his life to football. Falcons coach Dan Reeves
brought his former college coach to Suwanee soon after he was hired
by the Falcons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the two have been interwoven for more than four
decades; it is a father-son relationship between two people who
aren't related.
</P>
<P>
   When the Broncos hired Reeves in 1981, the coach said, Bass
``was the first person I called about joining my staff, because I
respect him so much.'' Bass had been Reeves' college coach at South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, who has coached throughout North America, said he would
join Reeves, but he wanted to finish his commitment as defensive
coordinator of the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL. So he showed up
in the Mile-High City in 1982. He stayed on Reeves' staff, mostly
as a special assistant, until Reeves was fired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bass could have gone to New York when Reeves was hired as coach
of the Giants in 1993, but he wanted to remain with his wife,
Audrey, who had suffered a stroke. After moving Audrey back to
Columbia, his life revolved around caring for her. Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I needed to spend more time with her,'' Bass said.
``In Denver, I could get home in 10 or 15 minutes. I didn't think
I'd be able to do that in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Bass was crushed in 1996 when his wife died. Reeves
called soon after about joining the Falcons, and Bass had a chance
to turn back the clock. He couldn't get to team headquarters in
Suwanee fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do this as long as I can do it,'' he said. ``It keeps you
young. I don't know what I would be doing if I wasn't messing
around with football in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves doesn't know what he'd do without Bass around. Reeves'
father died years ago, and Bass has become a substitute of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times as a head coach you worry about whether coaches
will tell you what you want to hear, rather than what you need to
hear,'' Reeves said. ``You don't have to worry about that with
coach Bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass is popular with all the Falcons coaches. They love his
stories and have a few of their own. A couple of years ago, the
staff was in Indianapolis for the scouting combine and went to
dinner. The bill came, and Reeves was surprised when he saw the
drinks tally. He went to every coach, more than half sitting at
Bass' table rather than at Reeves', and said, ``Did we have this
much wine?''
</P>
<P>
   After a succession of, ``Nope. Nope. Nope,'' Reeves approached
coach Bass. ``Coach Bass, did we have this much wine?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, I reckon we might have,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   The room erupted in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin has a way of getting you back to reality quickly with
down-to-earth language,'' passing game coordinator Jack Burns said.
``He's a common-sense thinker. When a lot of people overlook the
obvious, Marvin will punch you right in the face with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass charts the practice work of kicker Morten Andersen and
punter Dan Stryzinski. He also sits in on staff meetings,
especially on offense.
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated from William &AMP; Mary in 1945, Bass coached
there, and then stopped at several places. He became an assistant
at South Carolina in 1956. After a one-year stop at Georgia Tech as
Bobby Dodd's defensive coordinator in 1960, he returned to South
Carolina as coach and athletics director, 1961-65 _ one year after
Reeves left. His record was 17-29-4.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, USC named its weight room for him. Former
players raised $100,000 for the facility on the condition that it
be named for Bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy,'' offensive line coach Art Shell said. ``He
gives you the levity when you need it. We can be sitting in a room,
down, and all of the sudden he'll say something, and we'll all
crack up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   He still has the home north of Columbia, and his only son,
52-year-old Randy, and two grandchildren live near there. But he
rarely visits. Instead he stays close to work. Real close.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcon Inn hotel closed 15 months ago, but Bass and Falcons
intern Mark Olson each live in one room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's convenient.'' Bass is laughing now. ``You don't have to
battle traffic. You can sleep a little longer because you don't
have to go very far to get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he does on holidays, Bass chuckled again. ``Nothing.
Every day is a holiday. I stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   After persistent questioning, he said, ``I see my son when I
can, for Christmas. But when I'm here _ like Dan asked me over for
Thanksgiving dinner. I do things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass loves the game, but he says the thrill is helping to find
the winning edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facing a challenge has always been something I liked, and I
hope it will be until my last day on this earth,'' he said.
``Football is a hobby. People ask me why don't I retire, but you
don't retire from hobbies; you retire to hobbies. What else would I
do?''

 &HT;    Setting up shop
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader sent me an e-mail a while back asking for
recommendations and books on setting up a home shop; not so much, I
gather, on what to buy, but how to lay it out.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen various articles on this over the 18 years I've been
in the craft, but I can't recall where they were. The best advice I
can give on books and articles is a trip to a good woodworker's
store.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are certain things that should always be
considered when setting up a shop.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have to play with the hand we have been dealt, by
which I mean we can't afford to construct a shop, or remodel
existing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, I have been very lucky, living in a house with
a full basement, two sides of which have windows. It certainly
beats a windowless one-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   However, it isn't all gravy. While it is a big area, it is
broken into small areas by the positioning of load-bearing posts
under the upstairs walls. This makes power tool and machine
positioning very critical.
</P>
<P>
   The first tool to position is always the table saw, because you
need a lot of room fore and aft, and on one side. For instance, if
you are going to rip an 8-foot plank _ a pretty common occurrence _
you need an absolute minimum of 18 feet, nine in front of and
behind the saw arbor. If you intend to work with manufactured
goods, such as plywood, you'll need more than that, especially in
front of the arbor.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, if you're going to square up the end of an
eight-foot plank, you need about nine feet on one side or another
of the arbor.
</P>
<P>
   We're using 8-foot lengths here simply by example; it's no magic
number. I just want to show you how injudicious positioning can
leave you incapable of dealing with a big board or a piece of
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The jointer and planer need the same kind of space fore and aft,
although they don't need any at all on the off side and just a few
feet on the working side.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen some cramped shops set up so that ripping, planing and
jointing operations are carried out in front of a window that can
be opened so the workpiece can be run through it.
</P>
<P>
   Some newcomers have the idea they'll put the workbench up
against a wall. This isn't a good idea; you'll often want access to
all four sides of the bench for clamping and other operations.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for cramped spaces is to have all the heavy
equipment on rollers so each piece can be brought out into an open
space as needed. It's an option, but a last-ditch one, as far as
I'm concerned. Unisaws are heavy suckers, even on rollers.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to consider is ventilation and dust control.
Young people are a lot more concerned about their environment than
people of my generation, and it's a good thing. It's especially a
good thing in a basement shop, and doubly so in a basement that
also houses the furnace/air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, home shop dust control is an art still in its
infancy. Manufacturers tend to stick vacuum ports on their machines
and then advertise them as ready for dust control, when in fact the
port is just put on wherever possible, without regard to how much
dust it will encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Take my Unisaw, for example. It has a big port on it for a
4-inch hose. But the cabinet is not enclosed, so whatever dust is
sucked out through the port is more or less accidental. One has to
mess around with a roll of duct tape to try to create anything like
a closed space within the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, you get only the dust thrown downward. At least an
equal amount is thrown upward, especially during ripping
operations, and the port on the cabinet isn't going to do anything
about that.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, imposing serious dust control on a home shop is an
expensive proposition, and certainly not one I have even come close
to solving. Just do the best you can, live with what you can't
control, and wear a good dust mask.

 &HT;    Preparing for Y2K: Is it really necessary?
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Waco resident Carole Hague admits the supplies she
and her husband are stockpiling in case Y2K computer foul-ups cause
problems on Jan. 1 look part strategic reserve and part romance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, the Hagues have been putting extra
canned food, flashlights, batteries and bottles of drinking water
in their supply closet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the stack of candles, blankets, firewood and a
radio _ battery powered, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the lights really do go out, I'd like to see how much the
birth rate goes up in September 2000,'' Hague said. ``I think most
people will just light a couple of candles and get under the
blankets to stay warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Already proud grandparents, the Hagues probably wouldn't figure
into any birth-rate figures next fall, but they are part of the
group of Americans who plan to prepare for power outages and other
inconveniences when the millennium hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K glitch could cause computers to misfire when the first
two digits of the year change from ``19'' to ``20.'' It's a problem
most programmers did not foresee years ago when the computer
industry was still in its infancy and systems were hard-coded with
``19'' in datelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagues say they are not ``going nuts.'' Their supplies do
not include piles of ammunition or gas masks. They'll have things
people should have on-hand year-round, Y2K or no Y2K, they say. In
the event that major flooding, tornadoes or some other natural
disaster hits the area, survival and first-aid supplies, along with
a little cash, will come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   As a diabetic, Carole Hague has had to address a more serious
issue than whether the canned beans in her closet are of the baked
or chili variety. She will have three month's worth of insulin on
hand New Year's Eve, something her doctors recommended. Since
insulin and other life-saving drugs are sometimes shipped into the
United States from overseas, medical experts warn that problems
abroad could disrupt supplies even if glitches are minimal
stateside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's life-threatening, doctors say you should have extra
on-hand,'' she said. ``My grandson was asking, but I told him I
don't know that you need to stockpile acne medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Hagues, Woodway resident Dr. F. Clay Weekley will
prepare for potential Y2K problems by taking a few simple
precautions. Weekley has fueled up his motor home with 60 gallons
of gas and filled the truck's 40-gallon water tank. His RV has a
generator that can run the refrigerator and radio. A propane tank
can run the stove and heater. Weekley figures he could survive at
least three weeks if things got chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there'll be any problems, but I'll be
ready just in case,'' Weekley said. ``I'll have the motor home
stocked just like I was going on a trip. I could see some
businesses having problems if their computer systems go down, but
for me, it wouldn't matter too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those storing extra supplies argue that the supplies
they'll have on hand New Year's Eve won't go to waste if no Y2K
problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   Waco resident Barbara Collier has canned fruit, peanut butter,
food for her dog, a camping stove and six gallons of drinking water
for her and her son. Collier also plans to have plenty of gas in
her car.
</P>
<P>
   Collier figures she could last at least a week if utility
services and modern conveniences were interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There don't seem to be too many people who are taking this
seriously,'' she said. ``I think it's a little foolish not to do
something. The things you stock up on you will use eventually. You
can eat canned vegetables later in the year if you don't need them
because of Y2K. And it's not like you're incurring a lot of debt to
buy these extra supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   According to research by the Grocery Manufacturers of America,
the vast majority of Americans are not going on canned-food and
bottled-water shopping sprees.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of respondents to a GMA survey earlier this
year said they don't plan to purchase extra food in anticipation of
Y2K problems. Almost 80 percent said they were not concerned at
all, or only somewhat concerned, about possible food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're urging consumers to be reasonable,'' said Bill James,
senior vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
``While it's never a good idea to have an empty pantry, there's
also no need to overbuy food in preparation for Y2K. We think it's
prudent to have enough food on hand for a long holiday weekend and
not to wait until the last minute to go grocery shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey revealed that 57 percent of shoppers usually have
enough food in their refrigerators, pantries and cupboards to last
about seven days.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year, about 21
percent of Americans think the Y2K computer bug will cause major
foul-ups, 65 percent expect minor problems, and 12 percent expect
no problems at all.
</P>
<P>
   When respondents were asked how the Y2K glitch will affect them
personally, only 9 percent said they expected major problems, and a
third said they expect no problems at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the Heart of Texas Area Chapter of the American Red Cross,
preparations for 12:01 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000, have been made, but Bruce
Bennett, director of emergency services, said his organization is
always ready for disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the Red Cross is approaching it, as you would
any other disaster,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 customers a day come through the doors of Hewitt Guns
'N Gold. Sharif Sidarous of Hewitt Guns 'N Gold said ammunition and
gun sales have picked up slightly in the last three months, but the
upswing in sales has been slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about maybe one person a week who comes in here
and mentions Y2K,'' Sidarous said.
</P>
<P>
   At Waco Army/Navy Supply Store Inc. overall sales are up 20
percent, manager Cliff Emmons said. Water jugs, water purification
tablets, Meals Ready to Eat and flashlights have been selling at a
brisk pace since the beginning of the year, Emmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K business has been good all year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For those concerned about civil unrest, flak jackets sell for
$75 apiece; double mantle propane lanterns cost $24.95; an Army
issue sleeping bag runs $59.95; and a ``chopped beef steak and
components'' MRE or escalloped potatoes with ham meal is about $8.
A 6.5-gallon water jug costs $10.88.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of Mack's Camper Sales Inc., Jerry Harrison figures
he's got at least 50 potential places to stay in his business'
parking lot alone if things go south Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the propane gas, which can run the stove and heater, and
a full tank of gas, you could survive for awhile in an RV,'' he
said. ``But I really don't think there will be that many problems.
I'm sure there will be some minor glitches, but I'm not too
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison does admit to stockpiling propane at his home to ensure
he can still cook if the power goes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be sure we have enough propane for our grill
outside,'' he laughed.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The U.S. Supreme Court has, dangerously, decided

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ What do you get the person who has

suggestion: A can of Dole's Pineapple Chunks and perhaps its
Pine-Orange-Banana juice. You see, you've got to have two UPC bar
code proofs-of-purchase of Dole's products to be eligible to win a

the country.'' (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's 11:59 p.m. on New Year's Eve. Spotlights
illuminate the four faces of Big Ben. Pulsating at one beat a
second, the spotlights count down the end of 1999. Finally, the
clock strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several barges unleash 200-foot flares, which sweep down the
Thames, creating what appears to be a long river of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds of pitch-dark calm are then followed by a 15-minute
fireworks display, one of the largest in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Oohs and aahs erupt from the crowds. More than 2 million people
go home, duly awed and amazed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could be the ``greatest show on earth.'' At least
that's what promoters are hoping. Whether they can pull it off _
after conflicts over everything from the celebration's religious
theme to financing by an American fast-food chain _ remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   But come Dec. 31, just as Rio de Janeiro will have its
beachfront concerts and Edinburgh will have its thousand pipers _
one for every year of the millennium _ Britain will celebrate the
arrival of the millennium with the opening of the $1.2 billion
riverside cupola known as the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   At twice the size of Atlanta's massive Georgia Dome, the
Millennium Dome is designed to accommodate 35,000 people at a time
and will offer all sorts of highly publicized events beginning Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, London is planning its own New Year's celebration
dubbed Big Time. It will include a ``global village'' along the
banks of the Thames, with street fairs for both adults and children
that highlight the city's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames will
open Jan. 1, offering 25-mile views from 32 enclosed capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair has said it is logical that Britain _
which he proclaimed the ``home of time'' _ should host Europe's
largest millennium commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's Greenwich, southeast of London, that's home to
the prime meridian which gave the name to Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   This storied city's plans to ring in the new century has had its
share of skeptics, however.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing has embodied that skepticism more than the
Millennium Dome, designed to showcase Britain in the coming century
and dogged by controversy since its inception five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that such a huge number of architectural teams _
at least 15 _ were brought in to design the dome, making it
difficult to agree on any one plan.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling delays occurred. Worried sponsors pulled out. On at
least five occasions, plans for the dome were nearly ditched.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, press reports were often scathing.
</P>
<P>
   One, in 1998, said that dome organizers had persuaded media
magnate Rupert Murdoch's satellite television firm to divert $20
million of company money earmarked for investment in Britain's
schools into sponsorship of a carnival ride at the Greenwich site.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that McDonald's had announced its own investment of
$20 million in the project, sparking a national debate as to
whether the dome would really represent the ``Best of Britain'' as
promoters had previously claimed.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before The Evening Standard proclaimed it ``the
millennium fiasco.'' The Sun urged Britain to ``dump the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoters boasted that no taxpayer money was being used to build
the dome. The project has been financed with the proceeds of the
national lottery, as well as through private sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to make everyone happy all the time,''
said Fiona Cline, a spokeswoman for the New Millennium Experience
Co., which is running the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, The Faith Zone, one of the dome's 14 themed
pavilions, was renamed because its title was considered ``too
Christian'' and risked offending other religions.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be known as ``Faith Zone,'' with the definite
article removed, because ``the'' was thought to favor one faith,
Christianity, over others.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Frayling, who oversees the content of the zone, said
it's a very sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to offend anyone, but how can you make sure
absolutely everyone in the world is included in a project such as
this one?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, controversy has surrounded the role of Christianity in
the government's millennium celebration from the very beginning.
The name of the Faith Zone, for example, had already been changed
early this year from ``Spirit Zone'' after religious groups groused
that it sounded too vague.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under pressure from church leaders to acknowledge the
religious significance of the millennium, the dome organizers
agreed to allocate a sound-proofed room for prayer and meditation
for people of all beliefs. Organizers also agreed to allow the
Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to lead the nation in the
Lord's Prayer in the run up to the dome's official opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to turn the millennium into a secular event,
but we're not going to let that happen,'' said Colin Hart, the
director of the Christian Institute, which supports traditional
family values. ``People have tried to water down every element of
Christianity that can be found in the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such quibbling, much of the criticism and skepticism
surrounding the dome has now been replaced by anticipation, just
weeks before the dome's gala inauguration by Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   The mood began turning around last September, when dome
organizers were able to sell all 2,000 tickets for opening day
within hours, confounding critics who said no one would ever visit
the structure. It wasn't long before the dome was saturated with
corporate logos representing many of Britain's most-important
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now promoters predict that some 12 million people will visit the
dome during the year 2000, even though the price of an all-day,
adult ticket is a hefty US$32.50.
</P>
<P>
   And they've given the public a clearer idea of what visitors
will find under the dome's 20-acre roof.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will play virtual reality games allowing them to
explore everything from a woman's womb to the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Faith, the names of other themed pavilions at the
dome will include Play, Money, and Self-Portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In the Body Zone, for example, visitors will explore a
12-foot-high heart, complete with lots of blood and pumping veins.
Promoters claim the exhibit's so realistic that it's not being
recommended for young children. Another room within the Body Zone
explores the nature of beauty, and will allow visitors to adjust
the faces of celebrities using interactive video terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The dome will also house 16 bars, the two biggest cinema screens
in Britain, and Europe's largest McDonald's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So these days, much to the cynics' surprise, it appears the dome
could become a lasting, popular tribute to the millennium, as the
government originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like London will be the center of the world on New
Year's Eve, and I'm very excited about ... the dome,'' said Allison
Humphry, who plans to visit the dome in early January. ``I wouldn't
miss seeing such an important monument.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM BOX:
</P>
<P>
   London plans massive celebrations to ring in the new millennium.
And cities across the United Kingdom, including Liverpool,
Manchester and Nottingham, are hosting a variety of concerts, light
shows, and fireworks displays. Here are just a few of the events
planned in London to mark the new year:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The banks of the Thames will be transformed into a giant
``street party,'' with an Elizabethan fair and a huge carnival for
children complete with carousels and other rides. The action starts
at about 11 a.m. on New Year's Eve, leading up to a massive
fireworks display at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The London Eye, a new 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames that
promises 25-mile views over the city from 32 enclosed capsules,
takes its first passengers on New Year's Eve, but then closes again

   LONDON _ It's 11:59 p.m. on New Year's Eve. Spotlights
illuminate the four faces of Big Ben. Pulsating at one beat a
second, the spotlights count down the end of 1999. Finally, the
clock strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several barges unleash 200-foot flares, which sweep down the
Thames, creating what appears to be a long river of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds of pitch-dark calm are then followed by a 15-minute
fireworks display, one of the largest in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Oohs and aahs erupt from the crowds. More than 2 million people
go home, duly awed and amazed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could be the ``greatest show on earth.'' At least
that's what promoters are hoping. Whether they can pull it off _
after conflicts over everything from the celebration's religious
theme to financing by an American fast-food chain _ remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   But come Dec. 31, just as Rio de Janeiro will have its
beachfront concerts and Edinburgh will have its thousand pipers _
one for every year of the millennium _ Britain will celebrate the
arrival of the millennium with the opening of the $1.2 billion
riverside cupola known as the Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   At twice the size of Atlanta's massive Georgia Dome, the
Millennium Dome is designed to accommodate 35,000 people at a time
and will offer all sorts of highly publicized events beginning Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, London is planning its own New Year's celebration
dubbed Big Time. It will include a ``global village'' along the
banks of the Thames, with street fairs for both adults and children
that highlight the city's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames will
open Jan. 1, offering 25-mile views from 32 enclosed capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair has said it is logical that Britain _
which he proclaimed the ``home of time'' _ should host Europe's
largest millennium commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's Greenwich, southeast of London, that's home to
the prime meridian which gave the name to Greenwich Mean Time.
</P>
<P>
   This storied city's plans to ring in the new century has had its
share of skeptics, however.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing has embodied that skepticism more than the
Millennium Dome, designed to showcase Britain in the coming century
and dogged by controversy since its inception five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that such a huge number of architectural teams _
at least 15 _ were brought in to design the dome, making it
difficult to agree on any one plan.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling delays occurred. Worried sponsors pulled out. On at
least five occasions, plans for the dome were nearly ditched.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, press reports were often scathing.
</P>
<P>
   One, in 1998, said that dome organizers had persuaded media
magnate Rupert Murdoch's satellite television firm to divert $20
million of company money earmarked for investment in Britain's
schools into sponsorship of a carnival ride at the Greenwich site.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that McDonald's had announced its own investment of
$20 million in the project, sparking a national debate as to
whether the dome would really represent the ``Best of Britain'' as
promoters had previously claimed.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before The Evening Standard proclaimed it ``the
millennium fiasco.'' The Sun urged Britain to ``dump the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoters boasted that no taxpayer money was being used to build
the dome. The project has been financed with the proceeds of the
national lottery, as well as through private sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to make everyone happy all the time,''
said Fiona Cline, a spokeswoman for the New Millennium Experience
Co., which is running the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, The Faith Zone, one of the dome's 14 themed
pavilions, was renamed because its title was considered ``too
Christian'' and risked offending other religions.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be known as ``Faith Zone,'' with the definite
article removed, because ``the'' was thought to favor one faith,
Christianity, over others.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Frayling, who oversees the content of the zone, said
it's a very sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to offend anyone, but how can you make sure
absolutely everyone in the world is included in a project such as
this one?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, controversy has surrounded the role of Christianity in
the government's millennium celebration from the very beginning.
The name of the Faith Zone, for example, had already been changed
early this year from ``Spirit Zone'' after religious groups groused
that it sounded too vague.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under pressure from church leaders to acknowledge the
religious significance of the millennium, the dome organizers
agreed to allocate a sound-proofed room for prayer and meditation
for people of all beliefs. Organizers also agreed to allow the
Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to lead the nation in the
Lord's Prayer in the run up to the dome's official opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to turn the millennium into a secular event,
but we're not going to let that happen,'' said Colin Hart, the
director of the Christian Institute, which supports traditional
family values. ``People have tried to water down every element of
Christianity that can be found in the dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such quibbling, much of the criticism and skepticism
surrounding the dome has now been replaced by anticipation, just
weeks before the dome's gala inauguration by Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   The mood began turning around last September, when dome
organizers were able to sell all 2,000 tickets for opening day
within hours, confounding critics who said no one would ever visit
the structure. It wasn't long before the dome was saturated with
corporate logos representing many of Britain's most-important
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now promoters predict that some 12 million people will visit the
dome during the year 2000, even though the price of an all-day,
adult ticket is a hefty US$32.50.
</P>
<P>
   And they've given the public a clearer idea of what visitors
will find under the dome's 20-acre roof.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will play virtual reality games allowing them to
explore everything from a woman's womb to the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Faith, the names of other themed pavilions at the
dome will include Play, Money, and Self-Portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In the Body Zone, for example, visitors will explore a
12-foot-high heart, complete with lots of blood and pumping veins.
Promoters claim the exhibit's so realistic that it's not being
recommended for young children. Another room within the Body Zone
explores the nature of beauty, and will allow visitors to adjust
the faces of celebrities using interactive video terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The dome will also house 16 bars, the two biggest cinema screens
in Britain, and Europe's largest McDonald's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So these days, much to the cynics' surprise, it appears the dome
could become a lasting, popular tribute to the millennium, as the
government originally intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like London will be the center of the world on New
Year's Eve, and I'm very excited about ... the dome,'' said Allison
Humphry, who plans to visit the dome in early January. ``I wouldn't
miss seeing such an important monument.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM BOX:
</P>
<P>
   London plans massive celebrations to ring in the new millennium.
And cities across the United Kingdom, including Liverpool,
Manchester and Nottingham, are hosting a variety of concerts, light
shows, and fireworks displays. Here are just a few of the events
planned in London to mark the new year:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The banks of the Thames will be transformed into a giant
``street party,'' with an Elizabethan fair and a huge carnival for
children complete with carousels and other rides. The action starts
at about 11 a.m. on New Year's Eve, leading up to a massive
fireworks display at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The London Eye, a new 450-foot Ferris wheel on the Thames that
promises 25-mile views over the city from 32 enclosed capsules,
takes its first passengers on New Year's Eve, but then closes again
until mid-January so that a ticket office can be built. The ride
will cost US$12 per adult and US$7.50 per child.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Millennium Dome, which includes 14 themed pavilions with

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ One was clad in robes and preached in the streets of
Jerusalem, calling himself the Prophet Elijah. Another came from
upstate New York as Brother David and brought others to worship in
Christ's Bethany.
</P>
<P>
   Another was a successful Detroit chiropractor who came with his
family to live in caves and raise goats in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared harmless, but posed too much of a risk for Israel
at the dawn of a new millennium. All three were either made to
leave or refused re-entry into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous about policing an event unprecedented in the modern age,
Israeli authorities are scrambling to prevent violence in the
millennial ground zero _ the land where Christianity started 2000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They have been accused of both over-reacting and under-reacting.
Experts have predicted everything from a gathering of only
harmless, if eccentric, believers, to violent acts that could start
regional wars.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the danger is difficult. Millennium security is a new
field. But, fears of fanaticism should be kept in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In any year, religious zealots are practically mainstream in
Jerusalem, a holy city for Christians, Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of town where the Christian waitress in a pizza
restaurant will say she moved here from Latin America at God's
command. Or, where a small museum displays replicas of the third
Jewish Temple and tools for sacrificing a red heifer _ the
cleansing ceremony for when God sweeps away the Muslim mosque now
on the temple site.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem mental hospital that treats people suffering
religious delusions, called ``Jerusalem Syndrome,'' was this year
only about 10 patients over its annual average of 40.
</P>
<P>
   But the year 2000 is fraught with extra significance. For many
groups _ including at least one Jewish group _ it is the beginning
of the end of the world, coming of the Messiah or return of Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians see it as the start of the prophecies in the
Book of Revelations. It is the time for the battle between good and
evil, and the final judgement of the end of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think ever in history there has been such a fantastic
staging of a messianic moment,'' said Moshe Halbertal, Israeli
researcher of messianic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, Halbertal said, comes when Jan. 1 passes like any
New Year's Day. While many Jews long for the rebuilding of the
temple and many Christians believe in Revelations, Jerusalem could
host a few fanatics bent on speeding up the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jerusalem in the year 2000, we won't have only one
frustrated mass movement, we'll have two _ one Jewish and one
Christian,'' Halbertal said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Israel's highly reputed security services are faced with
preserving the peace in one of the most hyped and unpredictable
events of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of video cameras and three new police stations are
going up on the narrow stone streets of Jerusalem's walled Old
City, home to the holiest sites. Hundreds of extra police will be
on duty.
</P>
<P>
   And, fueled by information from FBI agents working with the
Israeli Mossad intelligence agency, the deportations began months
ago. They have included about 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic center of concern is the hilltop campus area that
is now home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Al-Aqsa is the third most holy
site in Islam, where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have
prayed before ascending to heaven. More than 400,000 Muslims are
expected there at noon Friday, Dec. 31, in prayer for the Ramadan
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jews also consider the area holy. It was the location of
the ancient Jewish temple where it is believed that God told
Abraham to sacrifice his son.
</P>
<P>
   Police have uncovered dozens of plots over the last 20 years by
Jewish terrorists planning to storm or blow up the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians believe the area must be returned to the Jews,
and the temple rebuilt, before Jesus returns. The fear is that a
fanatic _ Christian or Jewish _ could attack the mosque. The
attacker might hope the assault could be blamed on Israel and touch
off a worldwide confrontation between Judaism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that Al-Aqsa has been attacked before and the
world has not descended into war.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian set it on fire in 1969, saying he sought to speed
up Christ's Second Coming. An American Jew shot four people there
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Neither attacker was activist in any organized group, showing
that it could be difficult to spot troublemakers before they act.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the focus has been on groups.
</P>
<P>
   One group, arrested and deported early this year, apparently
came from a Denver, Colo.-area religious organization called
Concerned Christians. They are headed by Monte Kim Miller, who
authorities speculate intends to die in some sort of violence at
the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less threatening. Brother David, from upstate New
York, had been in Israel for most of 20 years and was a prayer
leader of a band of apparently peaceful, if unorthodox, people.
</P>
<P>
   Police have kept quiet about their moves, but apparently David's
efforts to bring others to the Holy Land, was too much to allow.
</P>
<P>
   The self-styled Elijah had also been here for years but may have
recently drawn too much attention. Someone started an Internet Web
page for his followers, and he was told by authorities to leave
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mark White, the Detroit chiropractor, who brought his family to
live in linen robes and without technology in the rural West Bank,
has not been allowed to return since going home a few weeks ago to
tend to his ill mother.
</P>
<P>
   His wife and children remain. They say Israeli authorities have
offered to let White back if they then all leave the country. They
have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities note many of those deported had let their
visas expire or, apparently in a belief that God forbids the making
of images, destroyed their passports and identification.
</P>
<P>
   But, some fear the police actions might create martyrs for other
zealots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may actually help to verify the fundamentalist beliefs and
biblical prophecies,'' said David Katz, Israeli author on Christian
fundamentalism. ``The Israeli tendency to jump on the bus and kill
all the terrorists might actually prove counterproductive in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Israeli authorities want to eliminate the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take risks and maybe we might make some
mistakes,'' said Israeli Minister of Tourism and Retired Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak. ``I don't think it will always be 100 percent right
or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local Jews are also expecting big things from the
millennium. A Jewish group called Operation Homeward preaches that
2000 is the start of the worldwide persecution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Director Avraham Sheinman, originally from Philadelphia, cites
computer Y2K problems as part of the upheaval that will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinman was a follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was
twice suspected by Israeli security officials of plotting actions
on the Al-Aqsa mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinman said he does not advocate violence. His job, he said,
is only to convince Jews that they will be safer in Israel once
everything falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know one thing,'' Sheinman said. ``We are on the eve of
the end of days and things are very volatile.''

 &HT;    SCHOOL VIOLENCE HURTS THE SURVIVORS TOO
 &HT;    840&AMP;add. With SCHOOL-VIOLENCE-DATA for release Sunday, Dec. 12.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pain from a murder lingers long after the last
scrap of yellow crime-scene tape is gone from the grounds of the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Muhammad and Gregory Carter learned that the hard way.
Muhammad's son was murdered in Atlanta. Carter, a former teacher,
was shot in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   They empathize with the bewildered families of both the victims
and the victimizers whenever a multiple-victim school shooting
dominates the network news.
</P>
<P>
   But they stress that even more students, families and witnesses
suffer physical and emotional damage from the routine, one-on-one
violence that doesn't make headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody died in the much-publicized school shootings in Fort
Gibson, Okla., last week. But since August, at least a dozen people
have died in one-on-one assaults like the ones that transformed
Muhammad and Carter into volunteer crusaders for community-based
anti-violence efforts in schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a school violence seminar this month in a suburban Washington
hotel, Muhammad reminded education writers that families in suburbs
or small towns are not the only ones who ask themselves, ``Why did
it happen here, and to this child?''
</P>
<P>
   She said her 16-year-old son was shot in the back of the head in
1989 by an ``emotionally challenged'' young friend who had argued
with him over a New England Patriots jacket that cost $89. Her son
died two days after he was attacked in front of the school in
southeast Atlanta where Muhammad had been president of the PTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wailing that comes from the parent. Not crying; I'm
talking about something more than that,'' she said. ``It is from
the pit of that parent's stomach. Your knees weaken, your body is
like water. I can't explain it to you. Just hope you never
experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am far beyond the anger I felt in 1989 toward the young man
who committed this crime,'' said Muhammad. ``I hurt for him and
others like him, because we have millions like him out there who
are not receiving the kind of treatment they need if we are going
to lower the level of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally channeled her grief into founding a national support
group, MOMS, an acronym for mothers of murdered sons and daughters.
She also directs a local assistance program for victims and
witnesses and has served on the Atlanta school board since her
election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's troubles began in June 1998, one day before the end of
his 21st school year as a teacher of American history at Armstrong
High School in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   From the window of his second-floor classroom, he spotted two
students whom he once had in class struggling for control of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I ran down to stop them,'' said Carter. He was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say there were 10 shots,'' Carter said. ``I went into the
wrong direction for cover, and as I re-routed myself, that was when
one shot hit me in the side and lodged in my abdomen.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, while he recuperated in a hospital, he
turned on the TV news. That is how he learned that a recent
graduate whom he had coached in basketball had been shot to death
in a similar situation: trying to mediate a fight between two young
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lived,'' he said. ``I felt blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow educators, old students, church members and neighbors
rallied around at first. But several expressed deep disappointment
after he visited his assailant and then helped to have him treated
as a juvenile, rather than prosecuted as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortable at the thought of returning to Armstrong, he began
teaching at a new school last fall. There were occasional
flashbacks, surges of anger, trembling and other signs of
post-trauma stress. But Carter continued doggedly to teach until
</P>
<P>
   he glanced at a TV set one day last April and learned about the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go back to school, but I could not,'' he said. He
is retired now, with a full disability pension. His marriage has
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, the doctor says I'm lucky, and I say I am
blessed,'' Carter said. ``But do you see? This kind of thing can
have an effect on a personal life as well.''
</P>
<P>
   He can see one positive result: ``The Richmond public schools,
hopefully by next year, will have telephones or some signal device
in every classroom from elementary through high school, so teachers
won't have to run to the office for help.''
</P>
<P>
   In this school year, public attention has once again focused
most tightly on a spectacular incident: millions know that at a
middle school in Oklahoma, one student shot four others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that ended pretty quickly because they were 'only'
wounded,'' said Bill Modzeleski, director of the U.S. Education
Department's program for safe and drug-free schools. ``How bizarre
that we are becoming so immune to school violence that we would put
it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, murders, suicides and fights in and near schools
since August have taken the lives of at least eight children and
four adults.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Ten died in one-victim incidents; two others died in a
murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Eight victims shot themselves or others with guns, and one was
stabbed with a screwdriver. The other three were killed without
weapons: a high school sophomore hit his head twice on the
cafeteria floor while involved in and being dragged away from a
fight in Omaha, and two school security officers _ one in East
Point, Ga., and the other in Brooklyn _ had heart attacks after
breaking up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest victims were both 13. A boy was stabbed in the head
as he walked from home room to his first-period class in a middle
school in Houston and a girl was shot in the lobby of her middle
school in Deming, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest were old enough to join the AARP. A 57-year-old
former school bus driver at a high school in Lincoln County, W.Va.,
shot himself after slaying a 66-year-old janitor whom he mistakenly
thought was carrying on with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested another janitor's husband in Dayton, Ohio, after
she was shot as she left a school to go home at the end of her
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Trump of Cleveland, a school security consultant who helped
compile that sample of recent school fatalities, said deaths are
only ``the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the families and victims of the lesser crimes _
assaults, shoving, pushing, extortion, sexual offenses and so on _
which occur in school,'' Trump said. ``Many go unreported by
educators who are afraid that full disclosure will damage their
chances for promotion or for passing a school levy the next year.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential candidate who does well enough to attract
media scrutiny is doomed to have a bad story written about him. Al
Gore? A phony career politician. Bill Bradley? A do-nothing
lecturer. George W. Bush? A Clintonesque playboy. Now John McCain
faces the same ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resist it, McCain has turned it to his advantage. He
has chosen his own bad story: He's an angry Vietnam veteran. It's
an ingenious choice, a good story disguised as a bad one. It
advances McCain's campaign themes--integrity and fearless
independence--while sating reporters who imagine that their
questions about his ``temper'' amount to tough-minded scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's anger is supposed to be bad because he can't control
it--and therefore can't work with Congress and can't be trusted
with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To refute this charge, all he has to do is restrain his temper
in a few highly visible situations. Journalists unwittingly oblige
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bent on making news, they bombard him with questions designed to
provoke an explosion. ``Why is it that those who know you best seem
to like you the least?'' Fox News anchorwoman Karen Brown asked him
at last week's debate in New Hampshire. Responding to such
questions, McCain always smiles, thanks his interrogators, praises
his opponents, and deflects the challenge with a self-mocking joke.
``A comment like that really makes me mad,'' he quipped during the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain understands that while voters want a president who
can control his temper, they also want one with a sense of outrage.
He flaunts his anger at HMOs, trial lawyers, agribusiness
conglomerates, and defense contractors who feed on ``corporate
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have passion and to get angry when you see
injustice,'' he argued on ``Larry King Live.'' On ``Face the
Nation,'' he boasted, ``Sure, I get angry. I get angry at this last
bill that we just passed that [is an outrageous waste of taxpayers'
money.'' In the New Hampshire debate, McCain vowed, ``From time to
time, those of us who stand in an independent fashion are going to
break some china. It is very clear to all the lobbyists and the
special influence people that run Washington now that if John
McCain is president of the United States, things are going to be a
lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's enemies make this spin an easy sell. Who's spreading
the rumor that he's too volatile to be president? Republican Senate
leaders. Newsweek supplies their motive--``Many senators despise
(McCain) for his crusade in favor of campaign-finance reform''--and
McCain's campaign manager affirms that they're out to stop him
because ``John's shaken up the establishment by talking about
strong conservative reform.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Face the Nation,'' panelist Gloria Borger asked McCain,
``The entire Senate leadership (is against you). Is there a sense,
perhaps, that you are too much of a maverick to really become
president and govern?'' Too much of a maverick? The question was
practically a campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, McCain asserts his anger on behalf of soldiers.
This combines two good stories: his principled outrage and his war
record. ``Do I feel passionately about issues? Absolutely,'' he
conceded in the debate. ``When I see wasteful pork-barrel spending
(while) we have 12,000 enlisted families--brave men and women--on
food stamps, yeah, I get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' McCain defended a 1992 shouting match
with a fellow senator over the fate of Vietnam POWs. ``I took
strong exception to his allegations that somehow I was ignoring
important evidence,'' McCain explained. ``We're talking about an
issue of literally life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Such patriotic outbursts have captivated the media. McCain ``is
best when he is angry,'' swoons Time. ``He blazes with indignation
that 12,000 military families are on food stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's cleverest strategy has been to associate the anger
story with his POW ordeal. This week, citing nasty rumors that his
torture and imprisonment in Vietnam had left him emotionally
unbalanced, his campaign released medical records indicating that
he had never been mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The records did more than kill a bad story. They revived a good
one. McCain got to tour the TV studios retelling his heroic saga.
In every interview, he alluded to his wounds, calling his medical
records ``an orthopedic surgeon's dream.'' The New York Times
discussed his ``major fractures'' and ``solitary confinement.'' The
Associated Press recalled his 1973 testimony that he had survived
through ``faith in country, (the) Navy, family and God.'' NBC's
David Bloom, recounting how McCain had been ``brutally and
repeatedly tortured,`` quoted a commander who said of McCain,
``There was no tougher resister among POWs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam angle doesn't just help McCain. It hurts Bush. When
stories about McCain's temper first began to circulate, McCain told
reporters, ``I guess the memo from the Bush campaign has come out
to attack John McCain.'' McCain has since backed away grudgingly
from that allegation
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speaking metaphorically,'' he says, but his aides have
kept it alive by publicly urging the Bush campaign to make sure its
agents aren't spreading the rumors. By framing these rumors in the
context of Vietnam, McCain's surrogates create the impression that
Bush, who joined the National Guard to avoid Vietnam, is using
McCain's war record against him.
</P>
<P>
   There's no evidence to support this insinuation, but since Bush
can't prove the negative--that no one associated with his campaign
has ever said any such thing--the insinuation sticks. Front pages
and Sunday political shows continue to discuss the anti-McCain
``whisper campaign,'' a phrase concocted by McCain's aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be next to impossible to finger anyone in the
Bush campaign for fomenting anti-McCain sentiment,'' lamented
Newsweek. Vietnam veterans in the Senate called the trauma rumors
``disgraceful.'' Pundits called them ``disgusting'' and
``despicable.'' A POW expert told NBC that those who were spreading
the rumors had ``spit in the face of every Vietnam veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McCain is being asked whether he's angry about the rumors
about his anger. Again, he gets to impress everyone by turning the
other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' he shrugged on ``Meet the Press.''
``We need to move forward.'' When asked about reports that Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott had circulated the rumors, McCain
defended him: ``Trent Lott has been a personal friend of mine for
many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has won the fight the best way--invisibly--by framing the
orientation of the questions. Everyone asks him about the ``whisper
campaign'' against him. No one asks him about the pro-McCain
whisper campaign about the ``whisper campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone expects Bush to halt the anti-McCain whispers. No one
expects McCain to halt the whispers that Bush is behind the
anti-McCain whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits can't believe McCain would fan and exploit rumors about
his anger. ``Even if you handle it right, you still don't want this
kind of thing out there,'' argued Susan Estrich on ``Fox News
Sunday.'' ``There's some people who only hear a piece of it and say
to themselves, is something wrong with John McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   Estrich misses the point. Voters are already asking whether
something is wrong with McCain. They approach a presidential
candidate the way a woman approaches a date. First, they want to
know what's attractive about him.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if he passes that test, they want to know what's wrong
with him. They won't be satisfied--and won't relax--until they've
identified his flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Third, they want to observe those flaws, examine them, discuss
them, and figure out whether they're manageable. Every candidate
has many flaws, some of which are worse than others.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's best strategy, therefore, is to show the media and
the voters his most manageable flaw in the hope that they will
focus on that flaw and stop looking for others.
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely what the anger story has accomplished. By
consuming the media, it has overshadowed and smothered more
dangerous anti-McCain stories. With few exceptions, reporters
aren't pressing McCain about his role in the Keating Five
campaign-finance scandal. They aren't asking him to explain to
Republican voters how his crusades for campaign-finance
restrictions and a half-trillion-dollar tobacco tax square with
conservative principles. They aren't asking him to explain to
independents why he opposes the Brady Bill and Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters aren't trying to protect McCain; they just think his
mental stability is a more damaging issue. It ``goes beyond
accusing McCain of hypocrisy'' on campaign finance, says Newsweek.
For McCain, this illusion is felicitous. The anger story has
distracted the media because it looks so much worse than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the story of McCain's anger has obscured what his
quarrels have been about. By focusing attention on tone, it has
deflected attention from content. When reports about McCain's bad
temper first emerged out of Arizona this fall, they indicated that
he had muscled, rebuked, punished, and cowed fellow Republicans in
order to squelch dissent. Those reports could have generated
discussion about whether McCain's tirades against entrenched power
in Washington are hypocritical. Instead, they have been reduced to
discussion about whether he is prone to tirades.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has tried to focus
scrutiny on McCain's tobacco and campaign-finance crusades. ``I
don't think John McCain's personality is the issue,'' McConnell
pleaded on television two weeks ago. ``For me, it's been a policy
difference'' over ``big taxes and [putting the government in charge
of everybody's political speech.'' But the anger story has
overwhelmed McConnell's critique.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters aren't interested in the clash of ideas. They're
interested in the clash of personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Is John McCain too crazy to be president? The question answers
itself. A man who can use that issue to obscure his more serious
weaknesses, underscore his strengths, and besmirch his opponent
can't be accused of showing too little rationality and discipline.
The better question is whether he has shown too much.

   National environmental warrior Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a
Valley business group Wednesday that it needs to fight to preserve
the Western character of the Valley and what's left of the
surrounding Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy is built on tourism and on corporations that want
to move here because the area is so beautiful,'' said Kennedy,
chief lawyer for the National Resources Defense Council. ``It is
worth fighting for and worth preserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the 45-year-old son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, is
an environmental lawyer credited with the cleanup of New York's
Hudson River. He was in the Valley this week to address the 30th
anniversary luncheon of Valley Forward Association, a business
group interested in environmental issues, but one that has rarely
taken stands on controversial issues such as growth.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brossart, president of Valley Forward, said her group's
members knew they might not agree with all of Kennedy's ideas. They
invited him because of his passion for the environment and his
belief that its defense is everyone's responsibility through their
actions on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer urged the group to consider the adoption of strict
urban growth boundaries like those in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who since the 1980s has used lawsuits to stop factories
from dumping wastes, sees urban sprawl and its associated
destruction of community character and locally owned businesses as
a prime environmental challenge for the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether our home is the Hudson Valley or the Valley of the
Sun, what we all want is a community that will enrich our lives,''
he told ``The'' ``Arizona Republic'' during an interview before the
speech at the Wyndham Buttes Resort, overlooking the massive
freeway interchanges between Phoenix and Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came through this part of Arizona when I was 16, and there
were three different towns: Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe. Each had
its own personality. Now, that character is being lost,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, you could drive through this area and have a sense
that you were in the West. Now, communities from East to West are
threatened with the loss of their local character.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said there are parts of Phoenix where a person could be
unblindfolded and they would not know what city they were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyplace is looking like everyplace else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not that hard to change the situation. You have to
implement zoning and planning laws that allow a community to grow
upwards, not outwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he prefers life in his own small town, Mt. Kisco, N.Y.,
population 15,000, he says there are big cities that are enjoyable
to live in because they have preserved their character, like New
York, Portland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said communities should stop subsidizing out-of-state
and out-of-country corporations who develop giant stores and
franchise businesses in mammoth shopping malls. The subsidies, he
explained, come in the form of local tax dollars spent on wider
roads and highways to bring traffic to the malls and developments
on the outskirts of towns, forcing locally owned merchants in the
central city out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy suggested that people should spend their money with
locally owned stores and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend your money there, in the community, it will come
back to benefit you time and time again,'' he said. ``But if you
buy a cheaper Hula Hoop at the local mall, you should realize your
money is leaving town.''
</P>
<P>
   Landscape architect Christine E. Ten Eyck, said Kennedy's speech
reinforced her recent decision to move back to the central city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm someone who learned the hard way that living on the
outskirts is not all that it is cracked up to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In August, she moved to central Phoenix after five years of
living in Carefree. She got tired of all the driving and didn't
feel connected to any community. Now, she's designing the
landscaping for the Steel Indian School Park at Central Avenue and
Indian School Road. The park will be her neighborhood park when it
is finished. She lives just a few blocks away. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - A 6-year-old boy should not have to turn to strangers
to mourn the death of his mother. Not when his father's arms are
waiting to hold him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a heart would tell you that reuniting a grieving
child with his father is simple human decency.
</P>
<P>
   But leaven in some political opportunism, and that child's pain
becomes currency to be spent for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the case of Elian Gonzalez. Fate left him afloat in the
ocean after his mother and stepfather were killed trying to cross
illegally from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was rescued Nov. 25. But his ordeal isn't over yet. He
remains in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning his mother. Without his father.
</P>
<P>
   The adults both in the land of his birth and the land that his
mother died to reach have disgraced themselves in the name of
self-righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities placed the boy with his mother's relatives and
announced that Florida courts would decide where he should live. He
celebrated his sixth birthday in Florida, riding a pony, swinging a
new baseball bat, marveling at the wonders of a plastic Minnie
Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning his mother. Without his father.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relatives who want to prevent his return to Cuba coaxed
this confused, overwhelmed, grieving little boy into making a
public statement that he wants to stay in the land of plenty. He
wants to help fulfill their anti-Castro political aims.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning his mother. Replacing his father with material goods.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuba's government demonstrated its legendary lack of
decency. Fidel Castro put up billboards in Havana with the child's
face, ordered up thousands of protesters and warned of dire
consequences if the boy was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Boy became symbol.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, blistered from the bright light of public
criticism, the Immigration and Naturalization Service told the
father it ``would be interested in hearing from him about the
boy.'' The INS says it will act in the best interests of the child.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time everybody involved started acting in the best
interests of a little boy who faces the tough job of mourning his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   And needs his father. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's smirk has become a hot political story.
</P>
<P>
   On C-Span, Bill Kristol revealed that Bush's ``funny little
grin, almost a smirk, that comes across his face occasionally at
inappropriate times'' had occasioned perplexed discussion among
staffers at the cutting-edge-conservative Weekly Standard, which
Kristol edits.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams and the Boston Globe's David Nyhan also noted the
Smirk Problem on MSNBC and CNN, respectively, prompting a superbly
detailed Dec. 3 article by the Wall Street Journal's Jackie Calmes.
Calmes described the following eerie scene:
</P>
<P>
   ``At a campaign stop in Dubuque, Iowa, Mr. Bush toured a
Christian pregnancy-counseling center to promote his antiabortion
views and support for faith-based social services. As he sat at a
table with two female workers there, he continuously wore a sort of
smile as he listened to each woman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women, a counselor for `post-abortion trauma,' told
how she had become pregnant at 20, helplessly felt she had no
alternative but abortion, `and for 15 years ... suffered in
silence.' Still, the right side of Mr. Bush's mouth seemed frozen
in a half smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The smirk resurfaced at last week's New Hampshire debate,
according to The New Yorker's Joe Klein, who in the Dec. 13 issue
writes that Bush ``will squinny his eyes, raise his chin, lift an
eyebrow, and curl his lip slightly--his face seems to be involved
in a somewhat painful, quasi-involuntary struggle to prevent itself
from erupting into a broad, self-satisfied smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This facial skirmish is often accompanied by a slight forward
bend at the waist and a what-me-worry? shrug, and they often occur
after the Governor has delivered a line particularly well, or
thinks he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The smirk is causing much justifiable worry in Republican
circles. ``I hear some saying that his friendly outgoing
personality on TV is mistaken for a smirk and smugness,'' a
``senior Republican official'' was quoted as saying in the Dec. 8
Boston Globe. ``A few have said to me, 'He has to make sure that
charm is not mistaken for arrogance.'''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably Bush himself got the message; his smirk was not much
in evidence at this week's Arizona debate
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the smirk will return, and when it does,
political spinmeisters will try to define it away as an ``image
problem,'' a mere matter of faulty subjective analysis by pundits
and voters.
</P>
<P>
   A far more interesting question than how Bush's smirk is
interpreted, however, is: What does it mean? Calmes quotes C-Span's
Brian Lamb as saying, in effect, that it's just a cruel trick of
genetic physiognomy: ``His father has the same thing; it's just not
as pronounced as it is with 'W.'''
</P>
<P>
   But since personality is also to some extent genetically based
and, moreover, can be passed environmentally from one generation to
the next--particularly when father and son share not only the same
home but also a few institutional influences (e.g., Andover and
Yale)--it is conceivable that the shared smirk signifies a shared
... arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, quite rightly, warns us not to be too hasty in reaching
this conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to mistake such elaborate body language for
arrogance, as more than a few observers have, whereas the true
meaning of the tic may be the exact opposite. It may just signify
relief--that he has successfully managed to jump another public
hurdle without embarrassing himself. Or it may mean nothing at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluding that the matter of Bush's smirk was too weighty to be
left in the hands of nonscientists, I e-mailed Paul Ekman,
professor of psychology at the University of California at San
Francisco. According to the Orlando Sentinel Tribune, Ekman is the
nation's ``leading smile researcher.''
</P>
<P>
   His academic writings on how to interpret facial expressions
have been used by lawyers to figure out which potential jurors to
eject during voir dire and by gamblers to figure out the giveaway
signs of a card player's bluff. If anyone could explain the meaning
of George W.'s troubling smirk, it was Ekman. But Ekman made it
clear that he wouldn't play:
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch George W. and have many thoughts about it. But I have
a policy about never talking about anyone who is in office or
running for office, or is in litigation. So I can't help you. I
don't know anyone responsible and knowledgeable who can.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, I marched off to a nearby bookstore and purchased
``What the Face Reveals: Basic and Applied Studies of Spontaneous
Expression Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS),'' edited
by Ekman and Erika Rosenberg. I then burrowed in for a long read.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that the science of studying facial expressions is
relatively new: Before the 1960s, apparently, ``it was deemed a
useless enterprise.'' This consensus changed as a result of work
done by Silvan Tomkins, Ekman, and a few others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, for example, Ekman and W.V. Friesen examined the facial
expressions of Japanese and American students as they watched
``stressful films.'' When they watched these films alone, the
Japanese and the Americans had similar, distressed expressions on
their faces. When they watched these films in the presence of an
``authority figure,'' however, the Americans' facial expressions
were essentially the same as when they watched the films alone,
whereas the Japanese ``showed much less negative affect, smiled
sometimes, and actually masked negative emotion with smiling
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: Americans are less guarded in letting facial
expressions show what they're feeling. A reassuring finding in
light of the question before us.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, Ekman developed a method called the Facial
Action Coding System (FACS) to measure ``all visually discernible
facial movement.'' The building blocks of FACS are 46 ``action
units'' (AUs) such as a wrinkling of the nose, a puffing of the
cheeks, dilation of the nostrils, squinting, and so on. These AUs,
usually identified by the facial muscles that perform these various
tasks, are the tools used in ``What the Face Reveals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, there is no chapter on smirking per se in Ekman and
Rosenberg's book. In a 1992 report to the National Science
Foundation, Ekman and several co-authors reject the term ``smirk''
on the grounds that it's too coarse and imprecise, ``ignoring
differences between a variety of different muscular actions to
which [it may refer, and mixing description with inferences about
meaning or the message which [it may convey.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are three chapters in the book that may nonetheless be
relevant to the smirking question:
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a chapter (by Ekman and Joseph G. Hager) titled
``The Asymmetry of Facial Actions.'' George W.'s smirk is
asymmetrical, is it not? The chapter describes an experiment in
which 33 right-handed Caucasian women ages 18 to 53 were exposed to
various mildly unpleasant experiences and asked to smile. Then they
were asked, ``Now that this is done, aren't you glad it's over?''
This inspired spontaneous smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Ekman and Hager found that the smiles-on-demand were less
symmetrical than the spontaneous smiles. This might mean George
W.'s apparent smirk is merely a forced smile, not a smug or mean or
even dishonest one.
</P>
<P>
   Another interpretation is suggested in a chapter (by Ekman and
several others) titled ``Type A Behavior Pattern.'' Here, the
authors argue that the group of people most likely to suffer heart
attacks are more apt than others to glare and show facial signs of
disgust. George W. doesn't glare much, but his smirk may be an
expression of disgust. If that's true, he would seem to face a
heightened risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The most provocative chapter in the book (by Ekman, Wallace V.
Friesen, and Maureen O'Sullivan) is titled ``Smiles When Lying.''
According to Ekman, Friesen, and O'Sullivan, there is a clear
distinction between ``felt happy'' smiles and ``masking'' smiles
intended to hide some other emotion. (The subject doesn't actually
have to be telling a lie; rather, the facial expression itself is
the lie).
</P>
<P>
   Felt happy smiles ``are defined as the action of the zygomatic
major [lip and orbicularis oculi, pars lateralis [eye muscles.''
Masking smiles use a whole bunch of other facial muscles associated
with fear, disgust, contempt, sadness, and anger. One such muscle
is the triangularis, which (judging from an illustrative photograph
on Page 208) pulls the corner of the lip down in an expression that
we would call ... a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   I will refrain from endorsing any of these three
hypotheses--forced smile, susceptibility to heart attack,
falsity--to explain George W.'s smirk. Rather, I call on Ekman or
some other expert to tell us which, if any, is correct.

   National environmental warrior Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a
Valley business group Wednesday that it needs to fight to preserve
the Western character of the Valley and what's left of the
surrounding Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy is built on tourism and on corporations that want
to move here because the area is so beautiful,'' said Kennedy,
chief lawyer for the National Resources Deouncil. ``It is
worth fighting for and worth preserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the 45-year-old son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, is
an environmental lawyer credited with the cleanup of New York's
Hudson River. He was in the Valley this week to address the 30th
anniversary luncheon of Valley Forward Association, a business
group interested in environmental issues, but one that has rarely

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.

</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.

TIM ALLEN, LIGHT YEARS FROM `HOME'

weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Tim Allen
with Robin Sachs in a scene from ``Galaxy Quest.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One of the biggest sci-fi fans on the planet is ... Tim Allen.
 &HT;    Who'd'a thunk it?
 &HT;    The former star of television's ``Home Improvement'' grew up
reading Galaxy magazine. He collects ``Alien'' memorabilia, and can
quote chapter and verse from the works of Larry Niven.
 &HT;    ``It started when I was a kid,'' he says. ``Sci-fi books and
films stimulated my world. I loved space ships and the adventure of
space travel, the technical stuff and the ray guns.
 &HT;    ``What I liked most _ and still like _ is that sci-fi stimulated
my imagination to go to worlds totally different from the one I
lived in.''
 &HT;    Allen boldly goes to one of those fantastic worlds on Christmas
Day, with the release of Dean Parisot's sci-fi comedy ``Galaxy
Quest,'' starring Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman.
 &HT;    Allen plays Jason Nesmith, a cocky actor best known as Commander
Taggart, the Kirk-esque hero of ``Galaxy Quest,'' a sci-fi series
that ran for four years in the 1970s. These days, however, Nesmith
and his co-stars live off the convention circuit, endlessly signing
autographs and recounting their glory years for the ``Galaxy
Quest'' faithful.
 &HT;    One afternoon, real aliens _ who for years have been picking up
reruns of ``Galaxy Quest'' and mistake them for actual events _
draft Nesmith and company for their bona-fide space battles.
 &HT;    ``When I first read it, I said, `This could be really silly and,
no offense to Mel Brooks, it could be `Spaceballs,''' Allen says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``Instead, Dean Parisot set
the story up as a documentary with layers that get peeled away as
you get deeper into the film. It's very clever and so subtle.
 &HT;    ``He lets it run so it feels like you're watching a slice of
life with these people and then, when it gets into high gear, it
becomes a wonderful sci-fi adventure,'' the comedian says. ``But,
all the while, you've got the fake and the real being twisted
around.
 &HT;    ``You've got fake actors acting like real space heroes and
aliens that are obviously real, in a situation that's not real in a
whole movie that's not real,'' he concludes. ``It's essentially a
big sci-fi action movie with humor.''
 &HT;    Allen cracked jokes aplenty on the set, but strove to suppress
his inner comedian when he faced the film's more dramatic moments.
 &HT;    Weaver had her own problems, he notes: She had to keep her
formidable ``Alien'' alter ego out of the way in playing blonde and
buxom Gwen DeMarco _ aka ``Galaxy Quest's'' seductive leading lady,
Tawny Madison.
 &HT;    ``Boy, it was hard for Sigourney, when we were running down
hallways and fighting aliens who were shooting at us, not to grab
the gun from my hand, push me out of the way and go, `I'll take
care of this,''' Allen says, laughing. ``More than once I said,
`You're not Ripley here. I'm the hero.'
 &HT;    ``It eventually became a test of wills,'' he says, ``even as two
people, not really actors, as to who would go first through the
door. But it came out wonderfully.''
 &HT;    Moviegoers can judge for themselves how ``Galaxy Quest'' turned
out, but if the film is half as wonderful as ``Toy Story 2,''
Allen's other December launch, it'll be cause for celebration.
Allen once again provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the
acclaimed sequel to Disney/Pixar's 1995 digitally animated
blockbuster.
 &HT;    This time around Buzz, along with Andy's other playthings,
mounts a rescue mission to save Woody (the voice of Tom Hanks) from
the sweaty clutches of a toy collector (the voice of Wayne Knight).
Along the way, the group encounters the evil Zurg and a new-edition
Buzz (also Allen) who doesn't comprehend that he's merely a toy.
 &HT;    ``I love `Toy Story 2,' but I'm loyal to the first movie,''
Allen says. ``It's like `Aliens' to `Alien': `Aliens' was clearly a
better piece of entertainment, but I won't say it was a better
movie.
 &HT;    ```Toy Story 2' is a much better piece of entertainment than the
first one,'' he says. ``It's not better, though, because the first
one was the first one.''
 &HT;    Allen would welcome a third ``Toy Story'' installment, but in
the meantime he's plenty busy. His line of Tim Allen Signature
Tools helps raise funds for children's-education charities, while
his production company, Boxing Cat, develops film projects.
 &HT;    Truth be told, where Allen would most rather be right now is on
a Hollywood sound stage, starring in a feature entitled
``Graviton.''
 &HT;    ``It's a script I've been writing and tweaking for nine years,''
the comedian says. ``It's a good sci-fi story, but it's not
supposed to be _ nor will I let it become _ a comedy.
 &HT;    ``I want to play the lead,'' Allen says, ``but I'll be the old
man in it if I keep putting it off. I am going to do it, even if I
have to finance it myself.''

MORA'S OFFENSE MAKES COLTS ONE OF THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The day in America's heartland is cool, December
dank, and dark. The Colts are leaving the field after a midweek
practice and the media are seated under a giant old tree, sturdy as
the Midwest. Jim Mora walks over and begins talking about a
phenomenon rarely seen in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Time spinning faster than it does on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   A new rage exploding first in Indiana and only then fanning
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Ctstomping.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is tanned. There is a glint to his eye. His smile is quick.
That image from New Orleans when he fell apart at a news conference
after his Saints lost their sixth game in eight and Mora resigned
after 11 seasons with New Orleans seems long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I hadn't been asked that question before,'' Mora
said when an outsider asked when he realized his Colts were not
just a team on the upswing but one of the best in the National
Football League. ``I don't know if I can say there was any one
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happening so fast. The Colts now have an offense that even
draws in neutral fans for a look at how football should be plyed.
The Colts now have a quarterback, Peyton Manning, and a running
back, Edgerrin James, and a wide receiver, Marvin Harrison, that _
in their potential _ seem capable of being more exciting than, or
as good or even better as, any of the last generation.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know in this business,'' said Mora. ``I've been in
this business long enough to know that crazy things happen. No, I
didn't think we'd win this many games . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mora exhaled a deep breath. ``You saw this potenial in this
team, especially offensively, and yet you never know what's going
to happen next year. You know you're an injury away, a key injury
away, from going the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   So fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that it's happening,'' said Mora, struggling to put
into words this sudden rise from the ashes of the Colts _ and
himself. ``It gives you a nice feeling . . . it's better than not
having it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two games with the Patriots, oh in Foxborough, stand out as
benchmarks on the trek upward. The first, erly in the 1998 season,
was perhaps Manning's worst game in his short career, the rookie
quarterback confused, lost, bewildered, and inept, throwing
interception after interception. ``That was maybe Peyton's worst
game,'' said Mora, as the Colts struggled to a 3-13 year.
</P>
<P>
   But, significantly, Manning was not scarred as so many rookie
quarterbacks are scarred by sudden ineptitude when they take that
last giant step to professional football (``That Patriots game was
tough,'' said Manning. ``I was worried that I might be scarred'').
Late last season, said Mora, ``he made it over the hump'' when he
went out to San Francisco and fired three TD passes against the
49ers in a 34-31 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The next benchmark, early in this season, came when the Colts
scored 28 points against New England in the first half as Manning
checked off at the line scrimmage on play after play, testing Ty
Law as nother QB had tested Ty Law, throwing three TD passes to
Harrison over Law. ``That showed how much I'd learned about
defenses since that other game in Foxborough,'' Manning said of the
audibles at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colts blew that lead, as Mora's teams in New Orleans,
good as they were, so often blew leads and lost games they should
havewon. Mora so often would go conservative with a lead, but a
hard, hard lesson was learned in Foxborough by these young Colts.
They learned their offense was too good to ever be set in neutral,
that their offense could suck all momentum from opposing teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mora also learned that he had a quarterback ``who was a
competitor, one who could hale pressure, one who _ like a Larry
Bird or Michael Jordan _ wants the ball in pressure, critical
situations, one who handles adversity and doesn't let it put him in
the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora has ever been known as a defensive coach, deep in his core
the football truism that defenses win games. But now, as the Colts
defense is still being built, Mora has a true offensive power, one
that can win games now with its sheer explosiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive guru (``Oh, nobody is a guru in this business,''
he countered) was asked to look at his offense from a defensive
coach's eyes. Mora complied, but the essential defensive nature of
his soul told him that no offense, not even his Colts, is
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is unstoppable,'' said Mora. ``We fought for our lives
twice against the Jets. We fought for our lives . . . I mean, we
scored 16 points in one game and 13 in the other. Nobody in
unstoppable; I guarantee that. I coached against the 49ers every
year for many years when they had a great offensive machine and
there were times they had trouble scoring points. Everybody
struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mora knows so well the cycle of NFL football. A team can
spring suddenly upon the scene, but as that team enjoys more and
more success, opposing coaches devote more of their attention, and
their schemes, to stopping it. It is the way of life in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you are doing good in this business, when you
really are doing good on offense, then everybody is really bearing
down to put the clamps on you to stop that offense,'' said Mora.
``It makes it even tougher.''

   But there is one element to this Colts team that makes it so
differe from Mora's New Orleans teams. Beyond the quarterback,
beyond the running back, beyond the wide receiver, there is Tom
Moore. He is 60 years old now, has spent 22 years coaching in the
NFL, and, for most of the years, has been the offensive coordinator
for som very good offenses.
</P>
<P>
   From the Steelers of Terry Bradshaw and Lynn Swann in the late
1970s to the Lions of Barry Sanders in the 1990s, the offense that
led the league and was the first to have two receivers (Herman
Moore and Brett Perriman) catch more than 1,000 yards in passes,
Moore has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Tom Moore more or less called the plays,'' said
Manning. ``As he's gained confidence in me and as I have a better
understanding of what we're doing, it's gotten better. Last year,
I'd just listen to the play. But now I have a pretty good idea of
what he's going to call before he calls it and that's what you want
to have between a quarterback and a coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bond is total between the wise and savvy Moore and
Manning. They think the same _ they think the worst epithet for an
offensive game plan after the last play ``is to be one play away,''
as Manning put it. ``The worst thing is to think, `I just wish we
had the post call when they were in that defense.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (For Patriot fans who no longer remember what a post pattern or
quick slant pass play entails, the receiver cuts diagonally to the
inside. Despite the Patriots' reluctance to use the patterns, they
still are most effective against some blitzes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use that last play,'' Manning said. ``If they're
showing blitz, hey . . . we want the post route and we know we can
get to it. That's ind of a result of how much confidence I have in
Tom and Tom has in me. We never want to leave the field thinking of
that one last play we should have called but we didn't call.''
</P>
<P>
   These Colts of Mora, unlike those Saints of Mora who just
couldn't take the final step, do not think offense is merely what
happens when the defense is not on the field. Blowing that 28-7
lead to the Patriots taught them all a lesson _ keep scoring
points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are now among the best in football, and unlike last
year's Falcons, who also made a sudden rise, it is clear this team
will be very good for several years. And if it happened so fast
that Mora doesn't realize exactly when the Colts went from a team
on the uptick to a team that must be feared, his decades in pro
football have taught him one lesson. Seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take advantage of the opportunity when you've
got it,'' Mora said. ``All coaches learn that. It's really
important. You've got to . . . you've got to . . . you never know
when it's going to come again.''

HEALTH STUDY DATA DEMANDED IN US CHAMBER SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picking a legal fight with universities and
hospitals, a major business group is demanding that researchers at
Harvard University and elsewhere turn over data from health studies
that the researchers say is personal and confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by the US Chamber of Commerce is designed to provoke
a lawsuit that would test a new law that allows anyone to request
data produced under federal research grants. Business groups had
pushed for the law, saying federal agenciese tightening clean air
rules and setting other policies on the basis of research data that
remained secret.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which Congress passed last year with little notice,
allows anyone to obtain ``all data'' produced with federl money by
filing a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The
22-year-old act gives citizens access to government documents, but
until now generally could not be used to reach beyond ederal
agencies to obtain information from individuals or organizations.
</P>
<P>
   University and hospital researchers reacted with alarm to the
new law, saying it would force them to break confidentiality
agreements with research subjects and business partners, stifling
future research.
</P>
<P>
   Many said the real intent of the law was to allow businesses to
harass scientists working in controversial fields, such as air
quality and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were cheered, however, when the White House Office
of Management and Budget ruled in October that the law would apply
to a limited range of research and that sensitive medical and
business records would not be released.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Chamber of Commerce is trying to overturn the White
House ruling, which it said illegally narrowed the scope of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``OMB decimated the congressional intent by limiting the
information that has to be made available,'' William Kovacs, vice
president for environmental and regulatory affairs at the Chamber
of Commerce, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as the Shelby amendment, took effect last month.
</P>
<P>
   The business group Thursday filed three requests under the
Freedom of Information Act, asking the US Environmental Protection
Agency to turn or data produced by university researchers. Kvacs
said he expected the EPA to reject the requests, and that the
chamber would likely respond with a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In two requests, the business group asked for data produced by
the Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge-based Abt Associates
Inc., and other institutions that were later cited by the EPA in
proposing tougher clean-gasoline and clean-air regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs said these requests are designed to challenge the White
House ruling that the Shelby amendment covers only data produced
under new grants, not grants handed out before the law took effect
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In its third request, the Chamber of Commerce asked for any data
the EPA cited in formulating ``environmental justice'' decisions.
These are EPA rulings that block states from issuing permits to
businesses that want to build plants in minority or low-income
areas that already have a disproportionate number of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacs said this request is designed to challenge the White
House ruling that the Shelby amendment covers only research used in
setting federal policies that have the force of law. The chamber
says agencies set many policies that are costly or affect business
practices, but which do not have the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Schwartz, an associate professor at the Harvard School of
Public Health, said the chamber appeared to be requesting data from
him that he had drawn from public sources and was already in the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz said the chamber was also asking for health data
from his colleagues that they collected only afterromising
confidentiality to their research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   If that information is released, ``the biggest problem is that
no one would ever be able to do a study again,'' he said. To
persuade people to join studies, ``you have to convince them that
you're really going to keep (the material) confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very effective way of preventing any future air
pollution research from getting done ... I think industry thinks
that's just fine, because these studies keep coming up with answers
they don't like,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard research concluded that thousands of people die each
year from inhaling soot and other airborne particles. The EPA drew
on those findings in developing tougher air quality standar, which
are awaiting Supreme Court review.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard researchers offered their data to the Health Effects
Institute, which is funded jointly by industry and the EPA. But the
chamber says the data should still be made public.

WHEN PRIDE STILL MATTERED 
A Life of Vince Lombardi 
By David Maraniss 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 541 pp., illustrated, $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,'' Vince
Lombardi's famous (and infamous) credo, was uttered first by an
11-year-old actress in a forgotten 1953 movie. And when Lombardi
did say it, he was talking about the National Football League, not
about life.
</P>
<P>
   He was not an honor student, as profilers suggested, but a C
scholar who dropped out of law school after a semester. Though
Lombardi gave patriotic speeches, he avoided serving in World War
II and pulled strings to keep his star player from being called up
during the 1961 Berlin crisis. And while he preached the importance
of family, he virtually ignored his wife, son, and daughter and
adopted his players as surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   Myth busting is at the core of ``When Pride Still Mattered,'' an
exhaustively researched (and, at times, exhaustively written)
biography of the famed Green Bay Packers coach who still stands as
an American icon three decades after his death from cancer in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   David Maraniss, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the
Washington Post who explicated Bill Clinton in ``First in His
Class,'' grew up in Wisconsin during the '60s, when Lombardi was so
revered by the citizenry that he was dubbed ``The Pope.'' Now,
writes Maraniss, at a time when professional sport's grace has
largely given way to greed, ``Many yearn for Lombardi out of a
sense of longing for something they fear has been irretrievably
lost. . . . Why isn't there anyone like the Old Man out there
anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there wasn't anyone like Lombardi after Lombardi
_ Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins, Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys, and Bill Parcells of
the New York Giants (then the Patriots, and now the New York Jets)
all stressed the same virtues: discipline, consistency,
selflessness, resilience, confidence, pride. But Lombardi, who
coached the Packers from 1959 to 1967, captured the nation's
imagination at a time when pro football was beginning to displace
baseball as the national game and American society was in
transition from conformity to division.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi was demanding, charismatic, energetic, obsessive _ and
his Packers won, five championships in his final seven years. He
was documented in snapshot form during his heyday, by W. C. Heinz
in ``Run to Daylight!'' and (indirectly) by player Jerry Kramer in
``Instant Replay.'' But Maraniss is decidedly more ambitious and
definitive. He traces Lombardi from beginning to end, re-creating
his milieus along the way _ the immigrant Brooklyn of the '20s, the
Fordham of the '30s, the exurban New Jersey of the '40s, the West
Point and New York of the '50s, the Green Bay of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss's research is daunting, with dozens of interviews
(including Lombardi's son, Vince; daughter, Susan; and brother
Harold) supplementing more than 50 books, sheaves of newspaper
clips, even hospital records. And though his writing can be
digressive (the 1951 West Point cribbing scandal which involved
Lombardi only marginally, is given more than a dozen pages), he
gets his man down fully and finally.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi was the oldest son of an Italian-born butcher who had
W-O-R-K and P-L-A-Y tattooed on his fingers. Harry Lombardi taught
his boy about the importance of duty, respect for authority, and
discipline. The Jesuits at Fordham (where Lombardi was one of the
football team's famed Seven Blocks of Granite) taught him the
exercise of free will within a hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In football, Lombardi found one place where all the lessons came
together. Though his short, blockish build kept him from playing
stardom, his relentless perfectionism and his knack for motivation
made him a superb coach. ``There are other coaches who know more
about X's and O's,'' Lombardi conceded. ``But I've got an edge. I
know more about football players than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi knew when to push them and when to back off and how to
keep them off balance by dispensing praise and scorn unpredictably.
He was harsh (``Defy me! Defy me!'' he screamed in practice) yet
fair. Lombardi brooked no prejudice (``If I ever hear'' racial and
ethnic slurs, he told his players, ``you're through with me'') and
quietly rooted for homosexual players (his brother is gay) to make
his team.
</P>
<P>
   His Packers loved him, his Packers hated him. But for the nine
years he coached them, they played _ and won _ for him as no team
did for anyone else. It was, Lombardi preached, a matter of team
love: The Packers were a family. Yet the sad truth, Maraniss
writes, is that Lombardi felt closer to them than he did to his own
family, which pined for his attention.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Marie, who died of cancer in 1982, turned to alcohol
and pills. His son and daughter craved a share of the attention he
lavished on his team. ``You know what?'' Lombardi once confessed to
the team broadcaster. ``I was a terrible father.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was, and to some still is, an American father figure, a
complex and contradictory mix of intimacy and aloofness, rigidity
and compassion. A week into their marriage, Marie Lombardi told
herself it was the biggest mistake of her life. Three decades
later, she sang her torch song to him over cocktails: ``You're
Nobody 'Til Lombardi Loves You.''

BATTLE-TESTED CLINTON MAKES RIVALS LOOK LIKE MINOR LEAGUERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one is big enough to be president of this country right off
the bat. It's all about growing. The time, experience, and scars
are essential ingredients. And the president who traveled to
Worcester Thursday to honor six fallen firefighters grew into the
job these past seven years, crafting a persona and record that his
enemies cannot diminish no matter how much they denounce and deny.
</P>
<P>
   The televised news conference Clinton unrolled the day before,
his summing-up of his seventh year in office, was indisputable
evidence of Clinton's skills, unrivaled on the contemporary
political scene. Put that Clinton into the mix of the six
Republican presidential candidates whose debate was televised from
Arizona this week, and it's no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Vice President Gore or Bill Bradley, the two Democrats
out for the job, match Clinton's ability to deliver a flawless
speech, fence with reporters for an hour of live televised
repartee, and connect with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent's well-advertised moral flaws notwithstanding, his
leadership skills are apparent to all but the ost obtuse critics. A
president with what appears to be an inordinate desire to be loved
flashes his talents before an audience often dulled to his
brilliance. But there remains that huge chasm between Clinton's
performance and the skill level of those who would replace him.
Able men in their different ways, they have yet to commandeer the
public's interest or the critics' esteem in the way Clinton did
before he crashed into disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Running the gauntlet of a presidential campaign is the way we
test the mettle of those who would lead. Every campaign cycle
offers a different combination of quirky coincidences and
developments that cannot be anticipated. Events rush at a candidate
with accelerating speed. The  &UR; morning  &LR; after Paul Tsongas won the
New Hampshire primary over Clinton in 1992, I told Tsongas that he
would feel like an Olympic skier, hurtling down a sheer slope on
the slickest ice, gates slapping him in the face, aware that any
second could bring calamity. No one knows what it's like till he
gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Sizing up his audience and tailoring his remarks, decisions, and
body language to the group is what made Clinton president, and made
him the president he became. He learned. Like Bill Bradley, he's a
Rhodes scholar. No one ever said he wasn't smart. A voracious
reader, still, no one doubts he's devouring all those books on race
relations he's scanning as he writes his own.
</P>
<P>
   Put that up against George W. Bush's clumsy defense of his own
reading habits, and it's no contest. Forging bonds of empathy with
mass audiences is what sustains presidentilleadership. Even before
Clinton landed in Worcester Thursday, I had no oubt he would
connect with the audience, and families left with 17 fatherless
children in a way that would be appropriate to the occasion and
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II told of her annus horribilis in 1992, a
particularly grim year for the Windsor clan. Clinton just survived
his Year of Kenneth Starr. But he keeps on, talking up his
achievements, wooing public opinion with artful asides and sly
strategems. On health insurance, Social Security, economic policy,
Clinton knows what to say, and what not to say.
</P>
<P>
   He is the sole colossus on the world stage, the man who
strong-arms Israel and Syria into renewed peace talks, who brokers
Northern Ireland's grudging, ripening resolution, who tiptoes
nimbly between the two Chinas, who alternately cajoles and ignores
the bumbling Boris Yeltsin, managing the diffcult relationship with
Russia like a worldly wise uncle handling an unruly drunk at the
family gathering. Clinton wins more respect abroad than at home,
where his enemies are dug into impregnable positions in the media
and political office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton fatigue'' is the popular label. ``Clinton
exasperation'' is what his critics suffer. Which is why they give
him zero credit for anything that was done right or well in the
last seven years, the greatest economic boom ever.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of his ``legacy'' preoccupies those in the Republican Party
and news media _ it is often hard to distinguish between them _ who
deem it their role to call Clinton perpetually to account. They
have dogehim and denigrated him to the point of diminishing
returns. If Clinton could run for a third term, there are millions
who would vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals talk of him as though he was already comatose, a big
mistake when the most skillful pol in the land has almost 14 more
months in office. Say what you will, about his priapic
propensities, hairsplitting or truthfulness, he has demonstrated
the capacity to grow in office.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say the same of the man most likely, in the polls, to
succeed him? Is Bush growing in his capacity to lead? John McCain
gets bigger before our eyes, but Bush seems to be shrinking under
the relentless spotlight. All to date is mere fund-raising,
polling, and a couple of patty-cake debates. It gets tougher every
day, and there are 11 long months to the verdict. Despite the worst
hammering any politician has endured since Nixon, Clinton does not
shrink. Let us see which of his would-be successors grows.

SECOND-YEAR COLT QB WILL KEEP PATRIOTS ON THEIR TOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Different week, different game, different
quarterback. From Dan Marino to Troy Aikman to Doug Flutie to
Peyton Manning, the Patriots are getting an up-close look at the
marquee quarterbacks of the National Football League, past,
present, and future.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, the second-year man whose Colts are Sunday's foe, is
the leading passer in the AFC in yards, touchdowns, and completion
percentage. He's got the attention and respect of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton's playing great football,'' said quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, who is not playing great football right now. ``The
attention he is getting is well deserved and I don't begrudge that
with him one bit. He is playing in a good offense and he's the
linchpin. He's making it happen for them. This is a big matchup
with the quarterbacks. He was able to go down to Miami and take a
win from Mrino and the Dolphins, but he hasn't bt me yet and I
don't intend to let them start.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Manning's strengths is his ability on play-action passes
to conceal the ball until the last instant, a talent the Patriots
are well aware of.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful,'' cornerback Ty Law said, ``because he
can hide the ball and all of a sudden set up and go downfield to
(wide receiver Marvin) Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Manning came into the league out of Tennessee as a No. 1 pick,
and after a year of adjustments, he's playing like one. The
difference is clear, said Patriots coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when we played him in the first game we made a
highlight film,'' Carroll said. ``His numbers weren't great in that
game, but in that highlight film we saw 15 to 18 extraordinary
throws that rarely would you see a top-flight quarterback make in
the course of a year. You could see the high end he had, and this
year he's doing it on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says the Colts have fiddled with their offense to take
advantage of Manning's skills. ``I attribute a lot of it to the
style of things that they're doing with him,'' said the coach. ``I
think (offensive coordinator) Tom Moore has done a remarkably good
job of putting together things that he can execute right off the
bat as a first- and second-year guy. They do a very nice job using
their players in ways they can really complement each other. Marvin
running across the field, the play-action stuff with Edgerrin
(James), the style of quick rhythm, that ball is out so fast from
Peyton. Even on the play-actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things added together, with Peyton being able to
control it all in his mind and handle it, it's a tremendous job
coaching. Without Peyton's ability, none of this would be
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has seen the early skepticism around the league about
Manning's arm strength die down. ``There were times when people
would question it,'' he said. ``But coupled with the style and the
release, it's an excellent arm. He can throw the ball on a line
40-50 yards and hit guys in creases. He throws very well on the
move. He throws well when he's in trouble and has to find a second
and third receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning is where Bledsoe was before his slump. A young
quarterback with an offense that can seemingly score points against
any team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots hope they can put the same kind of pressure on
Manning as they did on Aikman Sunday night, when the defense, led
by Willie McGinest, harrassed and hammered the Dallas quarterback
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that Manning is a cut above the rest
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better than anyone,'' said Carroll.

WACKO KEYBOARD HAS TURNED INTO `CONTROL' FREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm using a Microsoft ``ergonomic'' keyboard on
a machine running Windows 98. Occasionally, the keyboard goes into
a ``control mode.'' When you hit the ``E'' key, Windows Explorer is
launched, when you hit the ``R'' key, the Run box is launched, etc.
I seem to be the only person around this office having this
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keyboard Kaper
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KEYBOARD: Don't get all paranoid on me. Microsoft messes
with everybody, not just you. If it's not this keyboard thing, it's
``illegal operations'' or ``fatal exceptions'' or disappearing
cursors or that deal that records every single keystroke and relays
it back to world domination headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Windows tends to get silly at times, especially when it's
keeping track of a lot of stuff going on in the background, and
this keyboard weirdness is a perfect example. Somehow, Win98 thinks
you're pressing one of the two Windows keys, which, when combined
with regular keys, ordinarily provide shortcuts to certain Windows
features. For example, Windows-E starts Explorer and Windows-D
minimizes all open applications.
</P>
<P>
   Many times the culprit confusing Windows is System Agent (or
Task Scheduler, as it's now known). Ordinarily, it's loaded by
default, and most people don't even realize it's running. Try
disabling it: Go to Accessories/System Tools in the Programs menu,
where it's probably listed as ``Scheduled Tasks.'' Open it up and
go to the Advanced menu, where you have the option of turning it
off.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, see which other things you can turn off.
In Windows 98, open the Run dialog from the Start menu (or use
Windows-R) and type in Msconfig (Enter). You'll find a little
utility that lets you control exactly what starts up when you turn
things on.
</P>
<P>
   When none of that works, ask your company's support tech for a
regular keyboard without the extra keys. I only hope you can keep

   DEAR SOUND: Ah, another silly thing Windows does: lose track of
its peripherals. Ordinarily, anything that disappears from the
Device Manager _ but that you know still works _ will be
rediscovered if you run the Add New Hardware Wizard in the Control
Panel. Even if Windows misses it, you'll get the opportunity to
specify exactly what you want reinstalled.

PATRIOTS, THE JAMES VERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig James readily acknowledges that his observation is not a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   But when players quit playing for a coach, said the CBS analyst
and former Patriots running back, a coaching change is bound to
occur. And in his mind, the Patriots fit into that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the Buffalo game and, in my opinion, there were
several plays that could have been made that weren't,'' James said.
``Those plays were purely an effort question.''
</P>
<P>
   James couldn't cite specific plays, but explained that it was a
``general feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   James went on ``The NFL Today'' pregame show last Sunday and
told viewers that the Patriots and New York Giants would be looking
for new coaches if their players quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quitting is not just not running to the ball,'' James
explained. ``N nning to the ball is just the most glaring
observation. But quitting occurs Monday through Friday. The players
are not really into doing all the things that they are supposed to
do. They stop taking care of the personal things. They stop eating
right. They don't get enough sleep. The Patriots are in a tough
division, and every little thing matters. There is not one thing
that they can overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, James added, that the Buffalo Bills and
Indianapolis Colts are taking care of business every day.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, coach Pete Carroll responded by taking a swipe at
James, saying James doesn't know his team or his players.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get James wrong, though. He is one of the Patriots'
biggest fans. The problem, he says, is that he has to tell the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it hard is that I have several friends on the
coaching staff,'' James said. ``Pete Carroll is a good football
coach. But he has known that he would be watched this year. He also
knows that he has to succeed. But I can't be a homer. I have to be
a straight-shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   True, indeed. And that's why he likes the Patriots against the
Colts on Sunday. ``The Pats are in a good position to knock off the
Colts,'' James said. ``The Colts have had to get up two weeks in a
row, first against the Jets, then against Miami. Now they have to
get up again, for the Patriots. The law of averages says they will
not be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But James offered a final warning. ``Thirteen points won't get
it done against the Colts,'' he said. ``The Pats have got to score
21, 24, or 28 points to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Golden opportunity
</P>
<P>
   peaking of the Colts, HBO will air a good feature on Peyton
Manning Tuesday at 10 p.m. on ``Real Sportswith Bryant Gumbel.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Deford asks Manning if he was sick of the image that he
had or if he was irritated when San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf
called him ``the perfect nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden boy?'' Deford asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what that is,'' Manning said. ``I don't
know what a golden boy is. I'm certainly not perfect. I make
mistakes. People are looking at me and I have a chance to send a
good message to kids, and help kids make the right decisions in
life. So I choose to do that. I think as an athlete, people are
looking at you, so you might as well give them something good to
look at.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old college try
</P>
<P>
   Billy Packer has some ideas about how the NCAA should spend some
of the $6.2 billion CBS agreed to pay for rights to the NCAA
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA needs to understand that men's college basketball
accounts for more than 90 percent of its total revenue,'' said
Packer, a CBS analyst. ``Therefore, it needs to have special
attention given to it and should be run as a separate division
within the NCAA. The money should be used to clarify what is a
college player, which should be separate from what is a
professional player. There is a tremendous opportunity for
intercollegiate athletics to provide an avenue where sports fans
can have a real role model, people that represent what they'd like
their sons and daughters to be, instead of trying to emulate what
they have moved towards, which is to be another division of
professional sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kellogg also talked about the potential thet of the CBA to
lure the nation's top 100 high school players. ``The CBA is much
like some other things that have gone on in college basketball
(such as Proposition 48 and allowing athletes to work part time),''
said the analyst and former NBA player. ``In theory, these things
sound like they might be feasible, but in practice you get into all
kinds of crazy dynamics and logistics trying to make them work. How
much the CBA could benefit young kids bypassing college completely
or leaving college after a year or two is open to wide debate. I
don't know if it's a viable alternative.''

EARLY TESTS DON'T MAKE THE GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Ne rvice clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're a college basketball coach. Say you're Tom Brennan at
Vermont. You eagerly await a new season because that is what you
do, other than host a radio show in Burlington, of course.
</P>
<P>
   You look at your team. Middle of the pack, with the chance to
win some games in the mid-major America East Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And then you look at the first four games of your schedule.
Connecticut. Yale. Boston College. Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. What's wrong with that picture?
</P>
<P>
   You're a college basketball coach. Say you're Tom Izzo at
Michigan State. You eagerly await a new season because that is what
you do. And you know you're good. Very good, even when your best
player, point guard Mateen Cleaves, is out with an injury for the
early part of the season. So good that you figure you can do better
than last season's Final Four appearance by winning the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   You look at the early part of your schedule. A tournament in
Puerto Rico that will include a loss to Texas as well as games
against North Carolina, Kansas, Arizona, and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. What's wrong with that picture?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Vermont, everything. In the case of Michigan
State, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   December is the first real month of the college basketball
season, despite the nonsensical creeping up of the beginning of the
season closer to Hlloweeen than Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Those early games constitute the nonconference part of the
schedule, in which top teams either go out and play each other or
don't play each other, as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown, in the heyday of John Thomps,ever played annWhat
Vermont is doing is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not entirely by choice. Vermont needs the money that
can be gained by playing schools such as UConn and Ohio State on
the road. Also, Brennan and his America East coaching brethren are
following a dictum issued by the league office. The schools in
their nonconference schedules must have a minimum Ratings
Percentage Index, which is a key factor in the NCAA and NIT
tournament selection committees' deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that if the schools in America East play a
schedule with a fairly high RPI, they have a better chance of
getting at-large postseason bids.
</P>
<P>
   Nice idea, but totally misguided. America East is what it is, a
good mid-major conference with decent coaches and a fair quality of
basketball. The NCAA and the NIT won't give its teams a second
look, no matter what their RPIs say, no matter who they play.
</P>
<P>
   So the coaches are taking hits for what? All they are doing is
piling up losses, which could affect their job security in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA will fill out its tournament field from among
major-conference also-rans, and the NIT will pick its teams from
among schools with the biggest television markets, e biggest fan
support, and the biggest conferences.
</P>
<P>
   A team such as Boston Univrsity can win 20 games as an America
East runner-up and be virtually assured that it is done for the
season unless it wins the conference tournament. On the other hand,
a team such as Notre Dame or Georgetown can finish a game over .500
and in the second division of the Big East, and be virtually
assured it will get an NIT bid.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for a team su as Michigan State, playing a
toughnonconference schedule makes sense. Nothing is at stake, other
than meaningless spots in the weekly polls.
</P>
<P>
   All Izzo's team has to do is prepare itself for March, when it
will be playing tournament games that count. For the Spartans,
playing a tough nonconference schedule does help, because it
toughens them up. It gives them more exposure for recruiting
purposes and allows Izzo to test his young players, knowing that
even if the team loses a game or two, it will be a no-harm, no-foul
situation, unless it suffers a total colllapse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chemical reaction
</P>
<P>
   BU and Northeastern have gotten off to slow starts, but there is
a difference between the directions the programs are taking. BU was
plagued by bad chemistry last season, a prime reason for the
Terriers' fall from first to eighth in the America East standings.
But Dennis Wolff has brought in some new faces who should freshen
the air, if not the attitude at BU . . . Boston College gave its
best shot at landing 7-foot-6-inch Neil Fingleton. No question
Fingleton would have been the foundation for future hoop success at
the Heights, but when North Carolina put on its full-court
recruiting press, sending up its Lear jet and wining and dining
Fingleton, with the DeanDome as a backdrop, BC had no chance . . .
Gonzaga, which has made a living (and nearly made it to the Final
Four last season) on 3-point shooting, ran into Temple the other
night at the Great Eight in Chicago, and the results were
predictable. The Zags shot 6 of 37 from 3-point land and lost to
the Owls, 64-38. Even with the win, Temple is still struggling
without senior point guard Pepe Sanchez, who habeen out for a
couple weeks with an ankle sprain. Without Sanchez, the Owls lost
to Indiana and Wake Forest and nearly lost to Florida State. ``I'm
praying hard for Sanchez to come back,'' said coach John Chaney.
``If he's not, we're going to struggle a lot.'' . . . Not many
players have had a rougher trip through college than Luke Recker.
He started at Indiana, decided he had had enough of Hoosiers coach
Bobby Knight, and transferred to Arizona. But last summer Recker
was involved in an automobile accident in which he suffered minor
injuries but his girlfriend, Kelly Craig, was left partially
paralyzed. This week Recker decided to transfer again, this time to
Iowa, so he could be closer to Craig, who remains hospitalized in
Chicago. ``I have been contemplating this ever since my arrival in
Tucson,'' said Recker. ``The decision is based soley on personal
reasons.'' Recker will have a new Indiana connection, since Iowa is
coached by former Hoosier star Steve Alford . . . Massachusetts's
win over Villanova Monday was a big boost for Minutemen coach
Bruiser Flint, who is under a lot of pressure to produce this year.
A combination of not winning as many games as in the past and a
suddenly soft fan base s not the best way to maintain job security
. . . With UConn coach Jim Calhoun getting a new contract that puts
him in the $2 million-a-year range, the bar on coaches' salaries
has been raised again. Now that there are no guarantees that the
top high school recruits will even make it to college _ opting
instead for the NBA _ and the best of players stay only a couple of
years in many instances, college basketball has become even more of
a game of coaches . . Kentucky's three-game losing streak last week
has the critics and wolves coming after Wildcats coach Tubby Smith
harder than ever . . . Unless things turn around quickly, the
legacy that Jim Harrick left at Rhode Island will be just what the
critics of the move to hire Harrick three years ago predicted: a
one-year run in the NCAA tournament with Al Skinner's players, and
then a program in turmoil, filled with moody, unpredictable players
who are difficult to control. From their early-season results, the
Rams may be in for a long season unless first-year coach Jerry
DiGregorio can settle things down.

TIME FOR NYYC TO SINK OR SWIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Sunday, the Christmas Crunch will have shred its debris all
over the Aukland waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this weekend, the top six boats inAerica's Cup
trials willtep up to the semifinals while five others will be, as
that old crooner Perry Como says, ``home for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   To say Young America of the New York Yacht Club is making the
Christmas Crunch interesting is understatement in the extreme. It
was just one month ago that Young America hull No. 53 fell off a
pair of steep waves, cracked like an eggsell, and sent 17 sailors
diving for their lives. It's the second time we have seen this
routine, and that we should never see it again would dictate some
new design and construction standards, though that is a column for
another day.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a month ago, the question was whether Young America _
New England's home team, if you will _ could outgun Italy's Prada
campaign and Paul Cayard's AmericaOne from San Francisco to top the
leader board going into the semifinals that begin Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Now, amazingly, Young America fans are going through an
agonizing sort of death watch, as each race in this round has
brought this once lustrous campaign closer to elimination. Who
would have thought in October that Young America would be fighting
in December to make the top six? Home for Christmas might be a
reality _ no, not just for the Swiss and French but for the New
York Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the matchups ahead still seem to favor Young America's
chances to make it into the semis, and yet a subtle shift has taken
place. Rather than where Young America will end up in the top six,
the question is if it'll be there?
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty good,'' said John Marshall, president of Young
America. ``We're still two races ahead in the loss column, and we
have half the races to salhis round. It's still in our hands to
make the semis. We don't need help from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave talk. And still, on paper there's no reason Young America
should not be talking big. They are still a well-heeled, two-boat
(hull No. 53 is ready to sail again), highly evolved racing
campaign with fast boats and good sailors. So why are they below
the top six line on the leader board? No. 8, in fact?
</P>
<P>
   In the November Round, when Young America was rocked on its
heels by the boat breaking, it was understandable that the team
could never quite get itself going again. In fact, it seemed a
remarkable recovery that they (and the boom from Hall spars)
managed to save hull No. 53 at all, then start right up with their
new boat, No. 58. No one would expect that to be a smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
   It was also understandable that windy round when the weather got
rough that skipper Ed Baird decided to sail cautiously and eat a
couple of 4-point races rather than risk breaking the other boat
that, like all this generation of IACC 75-footers, creaks and
groans scarily in the 20-plus-knot range.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. This is now. Time to claw for every 9-pointer
on the board. After all, these $4 million techno-yachts have few
enough useful days in their lives. If there were ever a time to
push the limits, there is _ in that most famous sports cliche _ no
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But for Young America, this round has not been about pushing the
limits in big winds. This has been strange from the very start, the
race in which it led Prada (then leader of the pack) into the
second downwind mark by 20 secnds, then, incredibly, failed to
cover.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealanng analyst Chris Law, once the second-ranked
match racer in the world, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched with amazement as the two boats went off on opposite
tacks. In front of me the instruments read a slight right-hand
shift. And I could only assume Young America was holding onto this
lifting breeze in the hope that it might go back to the left so
they could bank a substantial gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is speculative,'' said Law. ``This is leaving the
keys in your car while it's parked. This is leaving the back door
open. This is invitng someone to steal your well-earned gains. This
is overconfidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird admitted as much, explaining: ``In match racing, you can
either sail on the paranoid side or the overconfidence side. Today,
we chose overconfidence.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, that was one race. But the news for Young America got worse.
They stood still, going from seventh to eighth, while some real
onetime dark horses came on at a gallop.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Cayard holding the No. 1 spot with 90 points is
no surprise, but how about his cross-waterfront rival, Dawn Riley,
standing in second with 83 points (before today's races)?
</P>
<P>
   Prada in third with 82 points is understandable, but Japan
fourth with 75 points? Dennis Conner is never to be counted out of
any regatta, so it's no surprise that he, Ken Read, Tom Whidden, et
al, have Stars &AMP; Stripes in the thick of it, fifth with 55 points.
But Spain in sixth with 44oints?
</P>
<P>
   Behind these top six, Abracadabra from Hawaii is in seventh with
43 points, and Young America is eighth with 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   So the odds still favor NYYC getting into the top six, at least
on paper. But as Cayard was saying before Round Robin 3, the
9-point round is scary because on any given day, luck can pair you
with a boat you should beat, but a weather wrinkle can beat you out
of a 9-point race.
</P>
<P>
   Again, for Young America, this is survival weekend. Who would
ever have thought it would come before Christmas?

A MATTER OF STYLE FOR ALL-DECADE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Miller doesn't hesitate when you ask him to put a finger on
the prevailing investment theme of the spectacular stock market of
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being aggressive is what has worked in the '90s,'' said
Miller, manager of the $21.5 billion Putnam New Opportunities fund.
</P>
<P>
   He's half right from where we sit. The All-Decade Team of
hometown mutual fund managers who stood tallest during the 1990s
fall into two distinct styles: aggressive stockpickers who scored
the biggest gains and managers who gambled less with a mainstream
approach but may have produced the best risk-adjusted results of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, John Ballen of MFS Emerging Growth and Fred Kobrick of
Kobrick Capital have all invested aggressively and made the most of
the decade's technology stock boom.
</P>
<P>
   A foursome of experienced managers at Fidelity Investments took
the mo instream approach: Steven Kaye, Will Danoff, Beth Terrana
and Robert Stansky.
</P>
<P>
   The lone exception was specialist Jim Schmidt of the John
Hancock Regional Bank fund, who capitalized on the nation's huge
banking industry consolidation of the 1990s like no other money
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Our conculsion: there has been more than one way to the top for
managers who excel at their particular style.
</P>
<P>
   All the managers on our team have generated returns of more than
500 percent between the start of the 1990s and Nov. 30 of this
year, according to data prepared for us by Lipper Inc. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index earned 410 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's fund had by far the largest cumulative return, gaining
994 percent. Bill Dougherty of Boston mutual fund consulting firm
Kanon Bloch Carre argues Fidelity Growth &AMP; Income, a fund run by
two of our managers at different points in time, was actually the
best performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the real winner based on unit of return for unit of
risk it took,'' said Dougherty.
</P>
<P>
   A few managers stayed at the helm of one fund through the entire
decade. We tracked others from one fund to another and,
occasionally, from one investment company to the next. We looked
for Boston investors who managed public money through the entire
decade but made a couple of exceptions: Will Danoff took over
Fidelity's Contrafund in June 1990 and Miller began running New
Opportunities in August of that year (a bit of fortuitous timing,
missing most of the drubbing small stocks suffered early in 1990).
</P>
<P>
   We don't attempt to ra the eight members ofour team for several
good reasons, besides the different investment objectives of their
funds. Return figures can be skewed slightly by different methods
of factoring expenses into results. Some managers, particularly
Stansky and his current Fidelity Magellan fund, are investing
vastly larger sums than others and can face market problems caused
specifically by their size.
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, our team of managers repeat a couple
of leading investment themes that helped them make money in the
'90s. They point to innovation and enormous gains in efficiency
through technology and consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The same themes often led them to different stocks. Ask Miller
what stocks worked best for him through the '90s and he will cite
EMC Corp., Clear Channel Communications Inc. and especially America
Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick also rode America Online and EMC, but also cites Cisco
Systems Inc. Ballen'sbest include Cisco, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye used the same themes to buy different kinds of stocks,
including General Electric Co. and Fannie Mae ``I've made multiple
billions on General Electric for my shareholders,'' said Kaye.
``They have improved their margins every year under the Jack Welch
era.''
</P>
<P>
   They all have favorite stocks but most of our managers
emphasized that individiual stories and even sector investments
emerged and often changed through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology sounds pretty obvious today but I'm not sure it was
so obvious in 1990,'' said Miller. ``Microsoft looked alotlike
Lotus. EMC was a turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the 1990s, said Ballen, is not to assume today's
answers will work very far into the future. ``You shouldn't decide
the environment you're in is the paradigm going forward,'' he said.
``Eyeballs are all the rage on the Internet today. But you can wake
up a year from now and that may not even be a factor in people's
investment decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their big scores, many of our managers recall a '90s
mistake or two that sticks in their minds. Ballen bought the
management story at Mentor Graphics Corp. for too long, Kobrick
didn't see problems building at Sunglass Hut International Inc.
Miller should have unloaded some of his health care stocks, like
Total Renal Care Holdings Inc. Kaye wishes he bought more
technology.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the managers who performed best in the 1990s think
about the stock market of the decade ahead? They are cautious about
predicting a repeat of the '90s big years, but most said the solid
growth and low inflation of today's economy combined with other
advantages will make for a strong start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy, (American) leadership in key growth areas and
an increasing amount of money coming into financial growth
instruments,'' said Kobrick. ``That's a decent backdrop, isn't
it?''

INVESTOR NEEDS TO TAKE RISK OUT OF HIS PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 47 and my wife is 45. I've worked for the same company
for 27 years in various positions and now earn $80,000 a year, with
10 percent of this going into my 401(k) plan, which has a $130,000
balance invested in an index fund. My wife operates her own
preschool business and earns $15,000 a year, with $1,500 going ino
SEP-IRA invested in Alger Aggressive Growth fund, and with a $4,000
balance. We also save $1,000 a month in a taxable account invested
in Firstar Equity Index, with a current balance of $30,000. We were
risk averse with our investments for the first 25 years of our
marriage. Now that our daughters are in college -- one a senior and
the other a freshman on a full-tuition scholarship -- we are
looking at retirement. This year we moved our money from CDs into
mutual funds. In addition to the holdings above, we have $20,000 in
common stocks, $20,000 in Hartford Stock fund, Class B, $10,000 in
Putnam Voyager fund, $10,000 in Firstar Special Growth, $20,000 in
Firstar Growth and Retail, $20,000 in Firstar Growth and Income,
$5,000 in Firstar Bond Index, $15,000 of my employers common stock,
representing employer matches for my 401(k) plan, $120,000 in a
pension accumulation, and $10,000 in savings and CDs. We would like
to retire in four to six years. Our house is debt free and we have
no other debts. We anticipate needing $50,000 a year in living
expenses. Can we retire and replace earnings with this mix? I'm
contemplating moving everything to Vanguard, considering its Index
500, Growth Index, Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Indexes, and its
Lifestrategy Moderate Growth funds. What type of mix would you
suggest among these?
</P>
<P>
   D.H., Waunakee, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the short answer is probably yes, but the longer
approach is that you would be taking a lot of chances that you'd
encounter rough times in the later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If we take the mid-point of your four-to-six-year range and if
your total portfolio averaged 10 percent average investment
returned, your current balanceplus your contributions at the
current rate would take you to $804,029. If such a pool were then
invested in fixed-income securities to provide an income stream, it
would indeed supply the $50,000, but not the $59,384 which you
would need to buy what $50,000 buys today if inflation averages 3.5
percent annually. Worse, you would hav no money which would be left
in stock to build a capital pool to protect against the ravages of
inflation on your income stream in the later years of inflation.
Having such a pool is especially important to people who retire
early, and the earlier they retire, the more they need to think
about post-retirement inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The choices, I guess, are three: To step up the savings pace, to
delay your anticipated retirement date for a few years, or to
reduce your expectations of the income your savings pool should
produce.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether you should sell out of your current fund positions
and move to Vanguard, you should first calculate what the tax
implications of the move would be. Certainly it would make sense to
move your ongoing contributions to Vanguard, given that you are not
only paying a sales load of up to 4.5 percent on your investments
in the Firstar Equity Index fund, but it has an expense ratio of
.58 percent, compared to .18 percent for Vanguard Index 500. I'd
suggest a mix of 40 percent in the Index 500 fund and equal
positions in the other four funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I fear that I have too many mutual funds in my retirement
portfolio. I am a 38-year-old single female and a police detective.
I will retire with a pension representing two thirds of my lary of
$60,000. In addition, I add $8,000 a year to my deferred
compensaton plan, which has $22,277 in Janus fund, $15,177 in
Fidelity Contrafund, $15,885 in American Century Ultra fund, $2,608
in Dreyfus Mid Cap fund, $2,866 in Oppenheimer Global, and $3,948
in a money market account. I also have two Roth IRAs, with $17,287
in Fidelity Growth and Income and $8,176 in Scudder European Growth
fund. I add $100 a month to the latter account. I have a 403(b)
account from a previous employer with $6,921 in Scudder Global,
$22,083 in Scudder Large Value, and $3,935 in Scudder European
Growth funds. Finally, I have taxable accounts of $18,083 in
Scudder Young Investors and $14,726 in American Express New
Dimensions. I plan to retire in 2016. What will my retirement
income be? Most important, how should I consolidate and yet
diversify my portfolio? I tend to be toward the aggressive side.
</P>
<P>
   L.A., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. My best estimate is that you can retire comfortably with
about the same buying power as you have now, and with some extra
money put aside to protect you from the effects of inflation in
future years.
</P>
<P>
   If you achieve average 10 percent portfolio returns and maintain
your current saving schedule, you would have a pool of $950,791
after 16 years. If your retirement pension were $40,000 and if you
invested that pool in fixed income securities, you would have an
income stream of $101,801, which would have the buying power of
$56,322 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   But let's approach it a different way -- assuming that you
realize salary increases that match that presumed rate of inflation
during the next 16 years. Thus, you would retire at a $4,039
salary, and be entitled to an annual pension of $68,655. Using the
same approach as before, between the pension and the yield from
your investments, you could bring in an income stream of $130,466,
equivalent to $72,696 in todays money. Rather than doing that,
though, you could leave about $185,000 of your money in stocks at
that point, with that pool designed to provide capital appreciation
to protect you against the inflation of later years of your
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That latter figure may not seem terribly large, given that you
would be retiring at age 54. But if you increase your contributions
to the deferred compensation fund every time you get a raise,
maintaining the contribution at the current 13.3 percent, your
accumulation would be larger. Also, if you could add another $66 a
month to max out your Roth IRA contributions, that also would add
to the likely accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   As for your investments, the only thing I definitely suggest you
do is lose the money market account in your deferred compensation
plan. I would suggest that the balance there and any contributions
going there, be put into the Dreyfus Mid-Cap position. If you want
to consolidate for the sake of simplicity, you could calculate that
Janus, Fidelity Contrafund and American Century Twentieth Century
Ultra are all fishing in the same waters, so you could switch your
core position to any one of the three; on the other hand, I see no
good argument for doing that, and unless tracking three funds
bothers you, I would leave the investments as they are. You could
make much the same argument for consolidating the Stein Roe Young
Investors and American Express IDS New Dimensions hodngs.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an extra incentive not to do so, since both holdings
are taxable accounts, and whichever move you made would doubtless
generate in unpleasant tax bill. So with the exception of getting
rid of the money market account, I see no good reason to make any
change in this nicely balanced portfolio.

 &HT;    This is a test. This is a test. This is a test  (EDS: Repeating
for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE
Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ A
<TEXT>
small group of U.S. and Russian military officers won't be doing
much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium arrives at
midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they will be guarding against the end
of the world. Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe:
Computer glitches causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic
missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix
the potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early
warning defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress
that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote. But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the
risk of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear
superpowers have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air
Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such
an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to
the possibsian military, are due to arrive at the Air Force
facility on Dec. 21 and begin training on the equipment Dec. 23.
The center is expected to be up and running no later than Dec. 30.
The center also has a certain public relations mission. ``The
bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia to show
the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can come
together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund. The warm relations
only extend so far. Partly for security reasons, the Russians won't
be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain, the heart of the U.S.
missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet underneath the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. In an assessment last year of
Russia's potential Y2K problems, the Pentagon singled out for
particular concern the Russian early warning system designed to
detect incoming missiles. But even before Y2K worries took hold,
U.S. officials were worried about the capability of Russia's
missile defense system. In 1995, Russia initially interpreted the
launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S.
nuclear attack. President Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear
briefcase'' in the first stages of preparation to launch a
retaliatory strike before the Russian armed forces realizllion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year. Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the
Air Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining
U.S. missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers. ``We've checked them,
we've rechecked them. They're ready,'' Warren said.  &UR; --- &QL;  &LR;  (Eric

A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER'S COMPELLING JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TUMBLEWEEDS 
Directed by: Gavin O'Connor 
Screenplay by: O'Connor, Angela Shelton (based on Shelton's
memoir) 
Starring: Janet McTeer, Kimberly J. Brown, Jay O. Sanders, Gavin
O'Connor, Michael J. Pollard, Laurel Holloman, Lois Smith 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language, sensuality and a scene of domestic
discord) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds,'' Gavin O'Connor's sweet, embraceable
mother-daughter movie, makes every moment count. It immediately
clarifies the reason for its title when Janet McTeer's earthy Mary
Jo Walker has what you feel isn't her first blowup with a husband.
``Pack yer bags, we're leavin','' she shouts to her 12-year-old
daughter, Ava, named after Mary Jo's fellow North Carolinian and
role model, Ava Gardner. Off they drive in a cloud of road dust.
They are leaving West Virginia, after having come from North
Carolina. They're headed to California, but only after a detour in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   There, Mary Jo discovers to her horror that the onetime suitor
on whom she had pinned her hopes has turned into a fat salesman of
used cars that blur the line between clunkers and junkers. As,
indeed, does he. This time, Mary Jo doesn't need to say a thing.
They don't even get out of the car. Mary Jo just floors it and
heads west. So, tumbleweeds. Until they hit the end of the road at
a quiet California coastal town, where Mary Jo hopes her daughter
doesn't notice the uncertainty in her eyes as she bravely announces
the new game plan. The twist is that Kimberly J. Brown's observant
Ava brings more clarity of vision to the situation than her mother
does.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Mary Jo thinks she's failed, she has only to look at
Ava, and realize that she's done something right. Ava is the
well-adjusted one, rich in self-esteem, bolstered by her mother's
love and belief in her. Ava good-naturedly plays parent to her
warm-hearted but scattered mom who isn't terribly interested in
self-analysis, and just keeps repeating the same old coquettish
Southern belle routines that attract the same initially easygoing
but eventually sullen and controlling men. But even here, the film
reminds us that one of its strengths is that it knows the score
when it comes to human behavior. It allows for uncommon degrees of
texture and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Director O'Connor doubles as an initially gentlemanly truck
driver into whose house they move in San Diego. He's not a bad guy,
or even an abusive one. He's just wrong for Mary Jo, who begins
feeling hemmed in by his insistence that she do things his
conservative way. When the stresses escalate, Mary Jo feels the
same old panic. The question is whether she'll revert to the same
old pattern. Or whether she's going to try to stay put and solve
her problems instead of fleeing from them, factoring into the mix
the fact that her daughter is growing older, becoming more her own
person, and reluctant to uproot the social life she's making for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   You'll care what happens in this film with more than enough
freshness and originality to avoid succumbing to girls-on-the-run
cliches. McTeer is delivering one of the year's richest
performances as a warm woman with little talent for planning and
decision-making, but a strong woman nonetheless whose love for her
equally strong but more self-confident daughter is boundless. If
British actress McTeer's performance as a dislocated Southern earth
mother weren't as appealing and compelling as it is, Brown would
steal the film utterly as the precocious Ava, who thrives in the
slight degree of stability she feels, quickly takes root and
breezes through school. It doesn't occur to her that she can't try
out for _ and get _ the role of Romeo in her school play.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again ``Tumbleweeds'' impresses with its freshly
considered action and total avoidance of the stale and routine,
even in lives that are largely unexamined. O'Connor brings
dimension to the role of the truck driver. Jay Sanders convincingly
occupies what for him is new filmic territory as a nice guy with
whom Mary Jo just might make a go of it. And as the boss of the
security company where they both work, Michael J. Pollard convinces
us he's not just caricaturing paranoiac weirdness, but living it.
Based on a memoir by O'Connor's onetime wife and current
scriptwriting colleague, Angela Shelton, the unassuming, homespun,
large-hearted ``Tumbleweeds'' is going to make a lot of friends.

RINGING IN Y2K _ AND GETTING GOUGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stories of greed dominate the New Year's Eve pop scene, with
some stars asking up to $1,500 a ticket for shows that usually sell
for a fraction of that. The Eagles and Jimmy Buffett in separate
Los Angeles sites, Barbara Streisand in Las Vegas, and a package of
Andrea Bocelli, Sting, and Aretha Franklin in New York. All with
stratospheric ticketprices.
</P>
<P>
   Others are keeping prices low _ such as Vermont's Phish in an
unlikely date at the Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation
in &UR;  &LR; Florida; and Boston's Godsmack at the ``Smackfest.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other entertainers, like the general public, have mixed
feelings about going out at all this New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks is staying home and ``ordering a pizza.'' Yoko Ono
is staying home because ``it's the safest place to be . . . I just
said no to everything.'' Melissa Etheridge is spending the night at
her New Mexico ranch with friends and family. And Tori Amos expects
her husband to ``cook something delicious for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The FleetCenter in Boston will be dark, partly because of
skepticism that audiences would pay high ticket prices. There may
be a public skate that afternoon, but that's all, says FleetCenter
president Richard Krezwick, who expects to be home with a TV
controller in his hand when the clock strikes midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The FleetCenter had its chances for a concert, but nothing
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli was offered a reported $2.5 million to headline, but
took $3 million instead to play the Jacob Javits Center in New York
with Sting and Franklin. And Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin was
offered $1.5 million to reprise ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' at the
Fleet, but reportedly insisted on $2 million, so no deal. At the
moment, Martin doesn't have any New Year's Eve gig, according to a
spokeswoman who says ``he'll stay home unless he finds something
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't the right act at the right time at the right
price,'' says Dave Marsden, vice president of the Don Law Company,
which tried to find an act for the FleetCenter. ``And when you look
at what's going on with First Night and look at the high guarantees
that artists want, those are difficult things to overcome. We also
believe that a lot of people will have private New Year's Eves and
aren't even going to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Boston-identified acts are going elsewhere. Aerosmith will
play in Osaka, Japan, the J. Geils Band in Detroit, and James
Taylor in North Carolina. But most shows, no matter who is playing
where, are not selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did right by the ticket-buying public to not have a
show,'' says Krezwick. ``A lot of promoters are losing tons of
money. . . . Hey, the Eagles aren't sold out. And neither is Barbra
Streisand in Las Vegas, Gloria Estefan in Miami, or even Billy Joel
at Madison Square Garden in New York. Many people are looking at
these New Year's shows as stiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop entertainers often call New Year's Eve ``amateur night,''
but this one is ``the ultimate amateur night,'' says Buffett. He's
playing the Universal Amphitheatre in LA for up to $1,500 a ticket,
but promises ``the most bang for the millennium dollar,'' even
planning to give videos of the show to people who buy the
top-priced tickets. But he admits that the show is not sold out and
says one reason he's playing it is because his wife wanted to visit
friends in LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to a lot of people who have no clue as to what they're
going to do on New Year's Eve,'' says Buffett. ``I just decided to
go play. I was offered one gig in Guam, where I'd then be put on an
Air Force jet to go play in Hawaii. That way I'd be playing the
first and last place on American soil of the millennium. . . . But
then the Universal Amphitheater made me an offer that I couldn't
refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians, however, view the high-priced New Year's Eve
shows with the same disdain as some fans do. Grateful Dead veteran
Bob Weir, who is playing San Francisco's Warfield Theater with his
band Ratdog for a modest ticket price, is pleased to see the more
expensive shows struggling. ``As well they should,'' he says.
``They're cases of impossibly ugly opportunism. It looks bad and
smells bad and I don't want to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most high-powered, but not highest-priced, rock show that
night is a triple bill with Metallica, Kid Rock, and Ted Nugent at
the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. It's nearly sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Many acts are playing more low-key shows _ away from the glare
of arenas. Bonnie Raitt, Huey Lewis and the News, and Asleep at the
Wheel are booked to play in a tent in San Rafael, Calif., as a
benefit for that town. Shawn Colvin and Lyle Lovett are playing
outdoors in front of the state house in Austin, Texas, not far from
where Colvin lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to be near home in case Y2K hits,'' Colvin
says, adding in jest, ``We'll just drive home in the SUV and drive
over the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondie, which reunited in the past year, is set to play on
South Beach in Miami. ``The millennium actually had something to do
with us getting back together,'' says Blondie drummer Clem Burke.
``We didn't want to let our music go by the wayside, so playing on
New Year's Eve means something to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing the opposite extreme is Chrissie Hynde and the
Pretenders. They're in San Francisco that night, but Hynde can't
tell you where. ``I don't know anything except that we're part of a
show with a bunch of artists and that we're going on at 12:15. But
I thought the band would rather be playing than getting drunk,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists who feel that audiences might not go out that night
are instead being lured to MTV's New Year's Eve bash, which will be
broadcast from MTV's Manhattan studios. Playing two songs apiece
that night for the country's couch potatoes are Bush, Christina
Aquilera, and the Goo Goo Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for sandwiches,'' jokes Bush singer Gavin
Rossdale.
</P>
<P>
   The Chieftains have an unlikely New Year's Eve lined up. Along
with Art Garfunkel and Diana Krall, they're playing on a cruise
ship headed to the South Pole. Talk about your Y2K paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flying to Chile and then taking a cruise to
Antarctica,'' says Chieftains leader Paddy Moloney. ``The cruise is
being booked by a bunch of multimillionaires who wanted to get
away, but we're able to bring our families, so that should be
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite so many performing options, many acts are still
sitting it out. ``I hope I don't have a gig. I hope I just get to
have a party or something,'' says singer Fiona Apple. ``I'm just
going to hang at a friend's house and have some hors d'oeuvres,''
adds Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   As for Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes, he's headed to
Jamaica for three weeks to hide out from all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just play dominoes and catch up on reading some novels,''
he says. ``I don't need kids doing Jell-O shots. I need Thomas
Wolfe's `Look Homeward Angel.' ''

STEREOLAB MIXES IT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of Stereolab's latest CD doesn't exactly trip off the
tongue: ``Cobra And Phases Group Play Voltage In the Milky Night.''
Does the linkage of these words make any sense?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means whatever you want it to mean,'' says Stereolab
singer, lyricist, and synthesist Laetitia Sadier. ``You have to
make it mean something. (To me) it has got a very subtle meaning
inside, which I associate with the music but it's something that
can probably be destroyed by words.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the cryptic but enchanting retro-futurist world of
Stereolab, a band formed by the French-born Sadier and English
guitarist-songwriter Tim Gane in 1991. Various players have passed
through the group, including the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagen. The
current lineup includes guitarist-singer Mary Hansen, keyboardist
Morgane Lhote, bassist Simon Johns, and drummer Andrew Ramsay. For
``Cobra . . .'' the London-based band relocated to Chicago, as it
did with its previous CD, ``Dots and Loops,'' and recorded with
Tortoise's John McEntire and producer Jim O'Rourke.
</P>
<P>
   Stereolab started out playing what might be called drone-rock _
layers of hypnotic guitars, synthesizers, and vocals climbing to
glorious plateaus. Minimalist but adventurous pop that was neatly
summed up by the title of an early song, ``John Cage Bubblegum.''
``It served a purpose at the time,'' explains Sadier, of that
sound, ``but it was sort of limiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, you'll hear in Stereolab an exotic lounge-and-beyond music,
airy pop, jagged time signatures, an ever-shifting mix of
mellifluous and dissonant sounds. Stereolab is both easy on the
ears and challenging _ a rare combination. If, however, you're
looking for linearity, you'd do well to look elsewhere. Same thing
if you're looking for lyrics that tell a story or have a clear,
emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   You get the impression that the members of Stereolab, and their
guest musicians, are these mad musical alchemists, busying about
the studio searching in search of new sonic ingredients, every now
and then yelling ``Eureka!'' (Their moniker, of course, suggests as
much.) Sadier doesn't look at it quite that way, but admits there
is ``a mathematical playfulness'' to their sound. She adds, ``You
don't have to be completely out there to do something new; it is
about connecting ideas that have never been connected before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still rooted in the same areas,'' she continues. ``We've
just developed. I don't feel it's a radical taking off in different
directions. The melodic pop _ you still hear some Brazilian
influences; some people think jazz is most accentuated on this
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadier is happy to answer questions about Stereolab's music, but
she often takes off from a discussion of music and ventures into a
politicized real-world context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's music is about breaking ground,'' Sadier says, ``being
exploratory, taking a few risks in the sense that it is going to go
off the deep end and no one gets hurt. I think people are happy
with that. And my lyrics also, I think, are about exploring. Yes,
you may fall or make a mistake or you may come across an obstacle,
but when one has a brain we usually can overcome obstacles.
Humanity always has. We live in times that are very alarming, the
greenhouse effect, mad cow disease. I can confront it and engage in
the outside world, coming (to terms) with the private fear and
personal fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she adds, the attempt to be strong is undermined by
authorities who ``see us as children, as potential dangers to
society and therefore are not to be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Stereolab has become noted for its pro-socialist
leanings and lyrics. But Sadier sings in French, English, and what
might be her own made-up language of sound. The band hardly
emphasizes polemics in song.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is best is something that is subtle and open-ended,''
Sadier suggests, of words and music, ``but at the same time not
completely abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Sadier does get polemical is during interviews. She
believes America regards England as its toy poodle; she's angry at
attempts to censor the Internet; she's fearful of Big Brother
watching.
</P>
<P>
   So, after all of this, is Stereolab a rock band?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say more of a pop band,'' says Sadier, adding that one
of the last terms she'd use to describe Stereolab is ``rock band.''
``Maybe, I have an issue with that,'' Sadier says, because of the
macho connotations of rock. ``I think sometimes we `rock' and it is
kind of nice to rock, but we kind of turn our back on that.'' As to
the equal mix of women and men, she says, ``It is very clear, to
everyone in the band at least, that this band would not sound like
this band if it was six guys playing.''

   MEXICO-VIRGIN _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans' firm Catholic faith is
taking a beating just as they gear up to celebrate their national
patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe, on Dec. 12. The country is
in an uproar over a letter signed this month by three priests who
have objected to making Juan Diego, a 16th century Aztec Indian, a
saint. Adding insult to injury is the fact that one priest served
in the Virgin's basilica here in the past and another is currently
posted there. The priests say that Diego - who is said to have seen
an apparition of a brown-skinned Virgin in the 1500s _ probably
didn't exist. Those are fighting words to Mexicans of varying
degrees of faith who unite in their reverence for Mexico's Virgin
of Guadalupe. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

`GREEN MILE' GOES THE DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GREEN MILE 
Written and directed by: Frank Darabont (based on Stephen King's
novel) 
Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Clarke
Duncan, James Cromwell, Michael EJeter, Graham Greene, Doug
Hutchison, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Patricia
Clarkson, Harry Dean Stanton, Dabbs Greer, Gary Sinise 
Running time: 187 minutes 
Rated: R (violence, language and some sex-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a filmmaker, Frank Darabont may have staked out a pretty
specialized patch of turf _ Stephen King prison novels. But with
``The Shawshank Redemption'' and now ``The Green Mile,'' he's got
them covered. The title of the new film, from a novel King
serialized in six parts, refers to the linoleum floor of a
Louisiana prison's death row in 1935, when most of the story
unfolds. There's almost too much there, but the three-hour-plus
film permits the kind of detailing that not only brings the
storytelling to life, but sometimes persuades us we're breathing to
its rhythms. The performances _ especially the Oscar-nomination
caliber work of Tom Hanks as a death row guard and Michael Clarke
Duncan as a remarkable prisoner _ mesh handsomely. Only the fact
that the film contains several horrific electrocution scenes keeps
one from overstressing the point that for Darabont, lightning, at
least of the filmic variety, has struck twice.
</P>
<P>
   While the film could have benefited from tightening, it must be
said that Darabont knows how to fill the time with the kind of
absorbing detail that specifies a world and populates it vividly
with mostly decent prison guards keeping things as calm as possible
among mostly reasonable condemned men. The perhaps predictably
colorful prisoners are allowed human dignity with the exception of
Sam Rockwell's psychopathic loose cannon, who must be restrained at
regular intervals. His counterpart among the guards is Doug
Hutchison's newcomer. In a performance that gets under your skin
and stays there, he loses no opportunity for sadistic
power-tripping, convinced he can abuse prisoners with impunity
because he's related to the governor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in movie history, Hanks is as much an icon of
American decency as Jimmy Stewart was. His top-ranking prison
guard, Paul Edgecomb, is determined to run the cell block in as
humane and civilized a fashion as possible. He tries to do the
right thing. Star though Hanks may be as regulator of a small
corner of the prison, the job of Hanks's character essentially is
to react to the figure who serves as the film's heart, Duncan's
muscular black giant. He's on death row to be electrocuted for the
murder of two little girls. But Hanks and the others find it hard
to reconcile his purity, gentleness, and spirituality with murder,
especially when events pose the question of whether he might
possess some unusual powers.
</P>
<P>
   The film is certain to attract criticism for putting at its
center a black man who is strong and so immense that his cell can
barely contain him, but also submissive and afraid of the dark.
Even though it's difficult to imagine a black prisoner behaving in
anything like a defiant manner in a Southern prison in 1935, the
man named John Coffey (obvious initials and all) will be perceived
as too infuriatingly childlike and even slavelike in his
unquestioning acceptance of white authority, even though it may be
tied to a massive injustice. But politically incorrect as he may
be, he's enormously moving all the same, and seems a shoo-in for a
controversial Oscar nomination. The racism that includes black
presence as a sort of cure-all for white ills is soft-pedaled, yet
still horrifying, just as the film's electrocutions are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' doesn't shrink from portraying several
executions in grisly detail. Except for vengeful relatives of
murder victims and the sadistic guard, nobody enjoys them. The fact
that their savagery is so much a part of the film can leave no
doubt of the film's anti-capital-punishment sentiments long before
Hanks's guard denounces it as an old man we see at the film's
beginning and end. In the context of the film, racism seems merely
one facet of the psychopathic killing that plays no small part in
the story. Yet Hanks's guard isn't the only one trying his best to
make moral choices in a bad situation. His fellow prison guards
played by David Morse, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Barry Pepper, are
well-motivated, too. So is the prison's warden, nicely
dimensionalized and humanized by James Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at complexity and human dimension is the big job here.
Hanks and the others achieve it. So does gentle giant Duncan, who
does an astonishing job of slipping out from under a pall of
sentimental beatification to seem a benevolent force of nature with
a healing touch _ and then some. They and Darabont hang in there,
overcoming the story's tendency to move from character to
caricature as it aligns itself along opposing but too often
conveniently schematic poles of good and evil. You can't help
noticing certain parallels between ``The Green Mile'' and ``Of Mice
and Men,'' especially between Duncan's sensitive hulk and
Steinbeck's Lenny and between the two sawed-off power-tripping
sadists. Cast and director override the structural and conceptual
shortfall of ``The Green Mile,'' but you're never unaware that the
shortcomings are there, even as you feel yourself being hooked by
the film and you exit feeling that all the holiday releases should
_ but won't _ be as absorbing.

GREGG ALLMAN KEEPS HIS FOCUS ON THE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregg Allman used to be addicted to drugs and alcohol. He left
those behind three years ago, but there's one addiction he can't
kick _ and that's having a side band to go along with his main
occupation as singer/keyboardist with the Allman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost my whole career I've had another band on the
side,'' he says. ``And you can cover all the bases you want to
cover. I just feel a certain freedom from that. We sort of do
things my way, you know? Let me put it a different way _ there's
only one leader.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Allman Brothers are known for their wide-open,
democratic jams, Allman runs a tighter ship as his own bandleader.
``I'm more into (song) arrangements than anybody else in the Allman
Brothers is,'' he says, noting that tighter arrangements will be in
evidence at his Orpheum Theatre engagement in Boston. He'll again
be backed by the Alameda All-Stars (with whom he toured two years
ago), as well as Floyd Miles and Danny Chauncey of 38 Special.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for keyboardists to like their arrangements more
defined _ and Allman is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, (keyboardists) wind up being a litle more concerned
about everybody's else's parts and how they fit together. I'm a
real stickler about what's being played behind a solo, for
instance,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The repertoire will include tunes from his solo discs, as well
as some Allman Brothers songs _ ``but only the stuff I wrote,'' he
says. ``You'll hear some Brothers' tracks rewritten and redone,
like `Midnight Rider' and `Whipping Post' are two examples of that.
The way `Whipping Post' was on the last record, and the way
`Midnight Rider' was, is the way they were written.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Allman isn't enjoying his enduring relationship with
the Allman Brothers, who tour every summer (with two annual dates
at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield). He particularly enjoyed the
way Derek Trucks _ the 20-year-old nephew of Allmans drummer Butch
Trucks _ joined the Allmans last summer and boosted the energy
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got us kind of straightened up,'' says Allman. ``You know,
certain people, as they get older, tend to get a little sloppy. In
the event that happens, then bring on some new lightning, dude.''
</P>
<P>
   That new lightning (Trucks) has also just been touring with Phil
Lesh and Friends _ a gig that Allman didn't even know about. ``Was
he just in town with Phil? Wow,'' he says. ``He's a glutton for
punishment, but I was, too, at his age. . . . He's really dedicated
to music . . . and who ever had chops that good at that age?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Allman is a very contented man, after turning his
life around thanks to AA. Next year, he plans to marry the woman
he's been dating for five years. He's even moved back from
California to a waterfront pad in Georgia not long ago. ``I got a
big dock that goes out and there's moss hanging off these huge
300-year-old oaks in my yard. It's beautiful. I'm in the Deep South
now. I love it down there, man.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Amusia a band to watch: The Boston scene has spun out some
terrific records this year, not least of which is Amusia's recent
CD, ``Forever Ends.'' It revels in dreamy, hypnotic music sung by
Nashville emigre Ruth Peterson, who sounds like a soul sister to
Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a fan of hers since 1979,'' admits Peterson, who
works as a legal secretary when she's not working the clubs with
Amusia.
</P>
<P>
   The band's album showcases acoustic-driven rock-pop with
Peterson elegantly singing about the subtleties of relationships,
backed intoxicatingly by Todd Russell and David Sella on guitars,
Matthew Russell on drums, and Johnny Rosenfeld on bass. Peterson, a
'80s fan of the Smiths and Cocteau Twins, originally came to Boston
to attend Emerson College. Her dad teaches sociology and pop
culture at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   Amusia started two years ago and is just coming into its own
now. And, oh yes, the name Amusia means the inability to produce or
comprehend music. ``If you're not a fan of irony, you're not a fan
of us,'' Peterson says with a laugh.

`DEUCE BIGELOW' A NOT-SO-BAD SANDLER CLONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DEUCE BIGELOW: MALE GIGOLO 
Directed by: Mike Mitchell 
Screenplay by: Harris Goldberg and Rob Schneider 
Starring: Rob Schneider, Oded Fehr, William Forsythe, Arija
Bareikis, Eddie Griffin 
Running Time: 85 minutes 
Rated R (language, crude humor, strong sexual innuendo) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Admit it: just saying the name of this movie makes you feel
stupid. I suspect that's the desired effect. This movie is stupid _
the sort of aggressively brainless cinema that honors the inherent
humor in flatulence, falling down the bus steps, and
rhinestone-studded men's briefs. Adam Sandler executive-produced;
need more be said?
</P>
<P>
   But ``Deuce Bigelow...'' is something more, too. There's a
sweetness to both the characters and the plot that fleshes out the
film's stock antics. SNL alum Rob Schneider plays the title
character, a hapless, horny fish-tank cleaner who dreams of moving
to the beach and living near his finned ``friends.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing his job at the Los Angeles Aquarium for cleaning a
public tank naked (exactly why Deuce elects to squeegee in his
birthday suit is inexplicable, as are most of the plot
developments), Deuce finds work cleaning a koi pond at a luxury
Malibu apartment complex. One of the residents is world-class
gigolo Antoine Laconte (the dashing Oded Fehr), who is also the
proud owner of a state-of-the art aquarium. When Antoine's Chinese
tailbar lionfish comes down with a potentially fatal gill disorder
on the eve of Antoine's European ``business'' trip, Deuce is
persuaded to fish-sit.
</P>
<P>
   And we're off. A grilled-cheese incident sets off a chain of
events that virtually destroys Antoine's apartment, aquarium
included. To raise funds for the repairs Deuce is forced to launch
a 3-week career as replacement gigolo _ or man-whore, as newly
acquired pimp-with-a-heart-of gold T.J. (Eddie Griffin) calls him.
First-time feature film director Mike Mitchell's previous
experience on the animated series ``Ren and Stimpy'' serves the
film well. He sprints, sketch-like, through scenes that a leisurely
pace would have rendered painful: Deuce services (not, however, in
the way you might expect) clients who include a giantess, women
with narcolepsy and Tourette syndrome, and _ in an unbilled cameo _
Marlo Thomas as a fetishist who dresses Deuce as a German tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds pretty tasteless and exploitive. And yes, they want you
to laugh when the woman with narcolepsy falls asleep mid-throw at
the bowling alley. On top of that, there's a heap of gross-out
humor that seems geared toward adolescent males who theoretically
aren't this R-rated movie's target audience, plus a romance that's
nearly derailed, predictably, by Deuce's temp job.
</P>
<P>
   But Schneider's mild-mannered fish-lover is genuinely likable,
and a good-natured foil to the crude jokes. Deuce massages the
giant woman's aching feet, and takes the girl with Tourette's to a
baseball game, where her profane outbursts fit right in. And, of
course, Deuce makes everything come out right in the end. It's not
a new story: dim, fumbling nebbish winds up as the moral center in
an unfair, mean-spirited universe. Neither is the
nice-guy-who-sugarcoats-the-bathroom-humor device. One need only
refer back to the latest Adam Sandler movie.

ISRAELIS DEBATE PROSPECT OF PEACE WITH SYRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Israelis woke up Thursday to the prospect of peace
with Syria, perhaps their most bitter enemy, and quickly began
debating the price they are willing to a fr it.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafes and crowded streets of downtown Tel Aviv, people
read morning papers headlined with Wednesday night's announcement
that Israel and Syria would reopen talks for the first time in
three years by holding unprecedented high-level, face-to-face talks
in Washington next week aimed at clinching a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an insane risk. It's not worth it,'' said Shai Krel, 28,
who during his three years in the Israeli Defense Forces was
stationed along the border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping espresso outside the tobacco store he owns on Ibn Givrol
Street, he added, ``Peace is not in the land, it is in the mind. .
. . I've never been convinced that Syria really wants peace with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Odelia Arad, a 28-year-old law student, pulling hard on a
Marlboro Light before taking a set of final exams, was thrilled
about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be having humus in Damascus,'' she said, adding that
she trusted Barak to ensure Israel's safety in any possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel feels safe in his hands,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   How Israelis feel about Wednesday's stunning diplomatic
breakthrough is more than just an excercise in gauging public
opinion. The whole process could hinge on a unique voter referendum
in Israel which will be held in the aftermath of any agreement that
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to an agreement will not be easy. Even if all the
generals and all the heads of state work out every technical aspect
of security and demilitarization of the border. Even if Israe gives
up the strategic Golan Heights which it captured from Syria in 1967
and held onto in bloody fighting in 1973. It will still all come
down to a vote iIsrael.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Miister Ehud Barak was elected in prt on the
promise that he would bring to a vote any final agreements on the
Syrian track and on the for-now bogged down Palestinian track, and
he says he is going to stick by it.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, quoted Thursday in Israel's mass-market daily Yediot
Ahronot, said a ``decisive and sweeping'' majority of Israelis
would back him up in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum would be the first of its kind in Israel's 50
years, and is an experimental form of of diplomacy by consensus
that has only rarely been tested before in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the architects of the
original peace process begun six years ago with the Palestinians
and five years ago with Syria, said at a meeting with reporters
Thursday, ``We will have to deal now very intensively with
preparations for a referendum. Without a referendum there won't be
any implementation of an agreement between Syiria and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yehuda Ben Meir, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center and an expert on public opinion and the peace
process, said the result of the referendum would depend on more
than just the final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to technical security measures, the Israeli people
will be looking for gestures from Syria that convince them there is
a genuine change. When (slain Egyptian President Anwar) Sadat came
to Ben Gurion Ariport and then the Knessett, Israelis saw that he
was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a dramatic gesture like this,'' said Ben Meir,
referring to Sadat's historic visit which paved the way fothe
historic 1979 Camp David agreement between Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin said that if an agreement is reached, ``This will be the
end of slogans. We have to give up something and they have to give
up something. And that is our test. This is again subject to the
referendum, with both the Syrians and the Palestinians, we will
have to go back to the people and get them to allow us to sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Syrian President Hafez Assad has long insisted
that any agreement is impossible without Israel's return of the
Golan Heights to borders that existed before the 1967 war when
Irael seized the military high ground that looms over much of
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18,000 Israelis live in the Golan, where wineries and
cattle ranches dot the countryside. The heights are a crucial water
resource in a region where water is as precious as life. It is the
main source of the Jordan River and borders the Sea of Galilee, two
sources which provide more than one-third of Israel's drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said since he was elected five months ago that he was
willing to consider returning Golan territory, but with strict
security conditions, a dismantling of Syria's massive military
presence along the border, and control over water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Already the political lobbying for the referendum has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary hawk and opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon
scoffed at Barak's assertion that he is going into the talks
without any agreements on what it would give up to Syria, saying
the talks were a ``total surrender'' to rian demands.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Heitner, a spokesman for the Golan Residents Commitee, said
giving back the heights would be bowing to the ``the dictates of a
Syrian tyrant'' and said the right-leaning members of Barak's
coalition government would battle him tooth and nail on any
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At the talks in Washington Assad will be represented by his
foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, and Barak will himself attend.
The meeting between a prime minister and foreign minister would
seem diplomatically awkward, but Israeli and US officials Thursday
insisted that Sharaa was handling the talks because of the
practical concerns over the health of the ailing 69-year-old Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's regime was busy doing its own shoring up of public
opinion Thursday. Syrian newspapers carried banner headlines and
large photographs of Assad and Clinton, with Barak noticeably not
featured. A commentary in the official Tishrin daily said Syria
would not give up ``one iota'' of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   How the reopening of the Syrian track of negotiations could
affect the stalled talks between Palestinians and Israelis was an
issue of concern on the streets of Palestinian areas in East
Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made public pronouncements of
his pleasure at the opening of the talks with Syria. But privately
Palestinian officials confirmed that the bad blood between Arafat
and Assad, which dates back to Lebanon's long civil war, is no
secret. And one Palestinian official said that there are private
concerns that Barak will ignore the more difficult stages of he
Palestinian talks, which are staled on the issue of settlement
expansion, to focus on Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former military chief of staff and
current tourism minister in Barak's cabinet, has played key roles
in earlier negotiations on both the Palestinian and Syrian tracks.
He dismissed the notion that the two tracks could not progress in
unison and offered the negotiations with neighboring Jordan which
were clinched in 1996 while the Palestinian peace process also
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it then and we can do it now,'' he said.

HOW BIG SHOULD ATTIC VENTS BE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What's the formula for the size of vents in an attic to
assure adequate ventilation?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES CARTER, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The vent formula for an attic is: One square foot of free air
space (no screens or louvers) for every 300 square feet of attic
floor area. If you put in vents, add 20 percent to the size to
compensate for the screens and louvers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 100-year-old house has storm windows that seem as old as
the house. They are triple track, and many are missing screens. I
was thinking of replacing the windows (and getting rid of the
storms). A company suggested vinyl, but my father said to use
vinyl-clad wood windows or wood windows that are clad on the
outside. What kind should I get?
</P>
<P>
   M.R., Medway, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm with Dad. If you replace the main windows, get only the
movable sash, not the entire window, which will be a lot more
expensive, and use the vinyl-clad or clad on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   And, you might not even have to do that, if the windows are in
good shape, fairly tight and well-weatherstripped. Keep them,
weatherstrip them if necessary to make them tighter, and put in new
storms. You can buy a high-quality, airtight storm for about $100
installed. One such storm is True Channel, made by Harvey
Industries and generally contractor installed. With those tight
windows, plus the storms, you will have virtually the same thing
you would get if you installed the new sash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 15-year-old Gibson washing machine makes a terrible racket
on the spin cycle. It sounds as if a couple of lead balls are in
there, clattering away. I thought it might be an unbalanced load.
Is it worth checking?
</P>
<P>
   F.Q., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is worth checking with an appliance repair shop. These
shops are all over, and I have found them very helpful with all my
problems. But don't expect too much because the handyman's list of
the expected life spans of appliances shows that a washing machine
has a life expectancy of 11 years. That means that your machine is
way over its life limit. But go ahead with the appliance repairman.
If the fix is over $100, it is time to buy a new washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My bathroom floor is covered by sheet vinyl. I'd like to put
in ceramic tile. Is it OK to put mortar over the vinyl?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SEYMOUR, Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can mortar over the vinyl; but you have to put down
steel mesh first; this will act as a reinforcement for the mortar,
which should be fairly thick ( 1/2 to 1 inch). After this bed sets,
tiles are set with thin-set mortar. This is a true mud job, which
is the best way to handle ceramic tile.
</P>
<P>
   As for setting tile directly on the vinyl with thin-set mortar,
I don't think it is a good idea because the thin-set might not
stick to the vinyl very well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Etha Indeck of Beverly, Mass. had trouble with rust that
would not come off her Spring Ram plastic sink, the handyman
suggested several ways to try to remove the rust, and suggested
that the sink might be at fault, and that the company might be out
of business since she could not locate the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Elizabeth A. Genisol of Charlotte, N.C. responded by
e-mail: ``Shame on you for trashing a good product which you
obviously know nothing about! I am writing this letter as an
enraged reader because I Love my Spring Ram sink and think that you
owe Spring Ram an apology. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a Spring Ram sink for seven years and it looks as
good as it did the day I got it, so I don't know what your reader's
problem is other than the way they take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your reader may have a special problem with rust. I don't know
how they got the rust there unless they didn't use the recommended
drain parts &AMP; covers, or they're leaving rusting cans and/or pots
in the sink overnight. Hardly any product/material can be resistant
to rust without staining, so I think you're harsh in assuming it's
the product's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company can be reached at www.springram.co.uk and I found
their American distributor to be at www.astracastusa.com. I'm sure
they can be more helpful in solving the problem than you were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this has educated you on a product that I will
certainly buy again and look for in my next home. I have no
connection with the company, I'm just a loyal fan who usually
thinks you have good advice and a good column which I read weekly.
This time you were just way off base! Thanks for listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! Thanks for telling me. I stand corrected, and will put
your information in my file for future use.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking further, I wonder if the rust occurred on metal pipes
coming through the sink and the drain cover, due to faulty
materials and/or installation. At any rate, Etha Indeck, the owner
of the sink in question, can contact the manufacturer or
distributor through its Internet address you so thoughtfully
provided.

SHUTTLE AMERICA LOOKS FOR NEW LOW-FARE ROUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Carolyn Robbins, Springfield Union-News)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. - The irreverence of the start-up compay
isplain to see at the front door of Shuttle America's corporate
offices near Bradley International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The painted lettering on the glass door to the nondescript
building reads ``Shuttle America World Headquarters.'' Welcome to
the world of the upstart start-up that has ruffled feathers in some
of Boston's toniest suburbs by flying out of Hanscom Airfield in
Bedford, Mass. to worldly destinations like Hartford, Buffalo,
N.Y., Trenton, N.J., and Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   in Massachusett, elected officials and some residents of
Bedford, Concord, Lexington, and Lincoln have fought to keep
Hanscom free of scheduled commercial service.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on Sept. 27, the day before Shuttle America was to begin
service from Hanscom, company officials did not know whether they
had the right to do so, even though the airline had a schedule and
had sold tickets for the low-fare flights.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge was to rule on a temporary restraining
order to prohibit the Massachusetts Port Authority from letting a
commercial carrier use Hanscom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thought the judge was was going to make a decision four
days before we were to fly,'' recalled Shuttle America president
Barry S. Lutin. ``We had sold our schedule and still not heard
anything, and then the tnoon before Garvey at 8:45 that evening to
sign the certificate.'' Since then, Hanscom has become the
airline's busiest station, and the four daily flights out of the
airport quickly became 10 flights. Vice president Mark Cestari is
quick to point out that 22 percent of the people flying out of
Hanscom come from the four towns that tried to stop the airline
from flying to suburban Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the trials of starting a company, particularly one as
difficult as an airline, where in the age of deregulation failures
are the rule.
</P>
<P>
   David F. Hackett, a founder and chief executive of Shuttle
America, said the airline began operations with more than $8
million in venture capital and $500,000 in seed money from the
founders, many of whom were former Continental Airlines officials.
Nearly two years of study ccurred before the first flight took off.
While the Shuttle America strategy could be employed anywhere, the
company decided the densely populated Northeast provided the best
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In one year, operating costs dropped significantly, as planes
were added to the fleet. In November 1998, when it began flying,
costs were just under 31 cents per available seat mile; now, they
are about 14.7 cents. The average for regional carriers is 21
cents. Because the equation is a function of airplane size and
distance traveled, major carriers have even lower costs per seat
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Currently flying at about 52 percent capacity, Shuttle America
is reaching the break-even point and must decide how quickly to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company will early next year go for a second
round of financing of about $5 million to $7 millin, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Each new market and airplane costs about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of growth opportunities; we get calls
from cities nearly every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has not committed itself to any new routes, but
markets that it's carefully eyeing are Detroit and Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using giant Detroit Metro Wayne County airport,
which is a Northwest Airlines hub, Shuttle America would use the
smaller Detroit City airport.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said US Department of Transportation figures indicate 50
to 60 passengers go between Buffalo and Detroit each day, but the
airline believes there is a pent-up demand for travel between the
two cities, which are heavily dependent on the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   A possible destination for Shuttle America flights from Hanscom
is LaGuardia Airport in New York City - one of the few at which
landing slots are restricted. The airline is lobbying the
Department of Transportation for access.
</P>
<P>
   One Massport official, when told of Shuttle America's effort to
offer low-cost flights to New York from the Boston area, was
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! That would be really significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A low-fare carrier operating from Boston to New York could
challenge not only major airlines' shuttle operations, but Amtrak,
too.
</P>
<P>
   That's easier said than done, though: Shuttle America must still
win approval to fly to LaGuardia, and it needs to make certainit
can operate efficiently there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging low fares is easy; making sure you can do it with low
costs is the challenge,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the airline leases $10 million turboprop aircraft
instead of regionalet aircraft, which have acquisition costs that
are twice as high.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Shuttle America issues no tickets, has a simple
reservation and fare system, does not overbook, and attracts
employees who want to work around airplanes and pilots who enoy
being able to fly and live in New England.
</P>
<P>
   And while the choice of aircraft may be risky in terms of
passenger acceptance - jets will usually win out over propeller
airplanes - company officials defend their aircraft. The planes,
they say, are quieter and cheaper to operate, and given their route
structure - most flights are 200 to 300 miles - more efficient,
because they cruise at lower altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle America also chooses airports that are underserved or
ignored by major airlines but are near major population centers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanscom is a perfect example. No other scheduled airline flies
there, it's within 30 minutes of Boston, and parking is free.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent flight to Hartford, passengers were greeted by two
protesters outside the civil aviation terminal, where Shuttle
America spent $50,000 to modernize a small waiting area and bring
in security equipment. There were six passengers on the flight,
which continued on to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pidgeon was returning to Buffalo on Tuesday after visiting
his son, a Northeastern student. ``I drove down because he needed a
car, and I called up Sunday and got a one-way ticket for $99,
compared to $314 on US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this,'' he said.''It reminds me of the old People
Express.'' People Express had low fares but no leather seats, and
they didn't offer free drinks and Pepperidge Farm cookies, as
Shuttle America did - even on the 30mute flight to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rocky relationship with Hanscom's neighbors, Shuttle
America is making an effort to be a good corporate citizen. When
six firefighters died in Worcester last week, Shuttle America
executives called Worcester officials and fire chiefs in every city
it serves and offered to fly any firefighter to today's memorial
service for $100, round trp.
</P>
<P>
   Because the airline is so small, regular fliers are greeted by
name, and when one plane was taken out of service for repairs when
a piece of ground equipment accidentally banged into it,
reservation agents were able to call all passengers affected to
alert them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terrific when the flight attendant knows your name, but
it's bad when a piece of ground equipment backs into one of the
airline's planes and knocks it out of commission for a few days,''
Cestari said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no anonymity in a 280-employee company. Perhaps
that's why the manager at Wilmington (which won station of the year
honors at the airline's one-year-birthday party in Buffalo last
weekend) sent out a memo, apologizing for the accident.

SHY, SWEET, AND NEARLY DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Seth Trickey fit no popular profile for destruction. He had been
a straight-A student in Fort Gibson, Okla. He was in a Christian
youth group. Schoolmates said of Trickey:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a normal kid. He's smart, always on the honor roll,
very polite. I've known him sice preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of cool, never acting weird or being a threat to
anyone. He is a nice guy. He loves the outdoors and playing soccer
and basketball. He loves Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth is my friend. He's got lots of friends 'cause he's cool,
funny, friendly, and smar   One friend called Trickey ``the perfect student.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the perfect 13-year-old student went to his
middle school with a backpack loaded with a 9mm handgun and scores
of bullets. Almost immediately upon reaching the grounds, he
randomly fired away, emptying a 15-round clip. He wounded four
people. Since Trickey fit no profile, everyone was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even know who it was he shot,'' said Muskogee
County Sheriff's Deputy Terry Cragg. ``This was not a hate thing. I
asked him why. He said, `I don't know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, no one was killed. Unfortunately, the fact that no
one was killed means that the school shooting in Fort Gibson can
easily be put aie s a reason to roil the nation's conscience. By
the numbers, Trickey's act was less tragic than the April massacre
at Columbine High School or the rampage last year at Thurston High
School in Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting by this child should be of particular note.
Trickey did not seem haunted by the Hitleresque demons that drove
the killers at Columbine or ``voices'' that Kip Kinkel claimed told
him to fire awy in Springfield. Trickey did not seem to be enraged
by lost love or by a teacher he hated.
</P>
<P>
   He had no criminal history of violence, although in the
aftermath some students now realize that Trickey had a temper. When
he lost at arcade paint ball, Trickey apparently splattered the
winners in the back with paint. One student recalls that his sister
told him that Trickey ``joked around in class about shooting
people. He acted like he had a gun, but no one took him
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, few in power take Trickey seriously. President Clinton
_ not thinking for a moment how it was only through dumb luck that
no one was killed _ made just a brief mention of the shooting,
saying, ``There are no fatalities, only people who are wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma, a robot for the National
Rifle Association, said: ``Obviously, the debate will always turn
to guns. But guns are not the issue.'' He also said: ``This could
have been committed . . . with a rock, with a knife. If a child is
hellbent on an act of evil, that child will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is rock-headed, since it is nearly impossible for a student
to duplicate the mass carnage of our school shootings with a bag of
rocks or a knife. Such politicians ignore the facthat Trickey
actually does fit the profile of a school shooter more than one
would think.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 15 school shootings since 1993, James McGee,
director of psychology and forensic services at Baltimore's
Sheppard Pratt Hospital, found the assailants to be ``usually good
students, maybe on the honor roll, and are not well-known to school
officials. They're able to blend in with the woodwork until they
actually go ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee, who wrote the study with Caren DeBernardo, said school
shooters are usually white, male, 11 to 17 years old, come from a
blue-collar or middle-class background, and are from families that
seem normal but are ``subtly dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee said guns are part of the family culture of school
shooters, and the weapons used in the shootings are usually
family-owned. The gun Trickey allegedly used was purchased by his
father at Wal-Mart in 1993, the year before the laggard chain
joined other mass merchandisers in halting such sales.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Seth Trickey and, to some degree, Trickey himself
are so far receiving the benefit of the doubt in Fort Gibson, even
though Trickey's parents have refused to let police grill their son
in depth. ``Those are good kids,'' said neighbor Karen Hobbs. ``I
can't imagine what was going through his mind, but I just know it
wasn't to murder someone. He's just a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   America will go nowhere on youth violence if we can't imagine
our ``good kids'' doing wrong. Seth Trickey reminds us that
violence is not due solely to guns or values, nor is it isolated in
black ghettos or among white suburban ``goths.'' He reminds us that
a culture that glorifies violence and continues to make ns so
readily available can tempt any child with the least bit of temper
to make a tragic choice.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about Seth Trickey's neighborhood, the Tulsa World
wrote: ``Seth Trickey lived in one of the newer, bigger houses, in
a little valley where deer graze at dawn and the setting sun
silhouettes the water ower. Oklahoma has thousands of Seth
Trickeys. Shy. Friendly. Sweet.'' We should always try to view our
children as sweet babies. We also must remember how easy we have
made it for them to turn into sour adolescents.

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

<HEADLINE>
`A CIVIL ACTION'; TAKE TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Schlichtmann, the lawyer who litigated the Woburn, Mass.
toxic wells trial depicted in the best-selling book ``A Civil
Action,'' is back in court _ this time as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann has spent the past few days in front of a jury
arguing Cadle Co. v. Schlichtmann, a complex suit arising from his
old law firm's declaration of bankruptcy after the eight-year-long
Woburn case. Cadle, an Ohio-based company that buys up bad debt,
says Schlichtmann owes it a portion of his post-Woburn earnings. He
disagrees. The case has dragged on for several years, and motions
for summary judgment from both sides have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   They say Schlichtmann has mellowed, but I didn't get that
impression when I bumped into him in the corridor of the new
federal courthouse. (Architectural note: Henry Cobb's buildings
sure look nice from the inside . . .) He has retained the energy,
the charm, and the penchant for rhetorical excess aptly imitated by
John Travolta in the ``Civil Action'' movie. ``These people are
trying to destroy me,'' he said. ``They're notorious for pursuing
these cases all over the country.'' Later, he congratulated himself
on his own ``brilliant'' cross-examination of a Cadle executive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the post-Wobur emns still seem to haunt him. When I
registered surprise that he was back in front of a jury, he shot
back: ``Do you think I'd put my fate in the hands of a federal
judge?'' Ghost from the Past 1: The trial judge, George O'Toole, is
a former colleague of Jerome Facher, the Hale and Dorr lawyer who
represented W.R. Grace in the Woburn trial. Ghost from the Past 2:
Retired Judge Walter J. Skinner, who bedeviled Schlichtmann during
the Woburn trial, was conducting a mediation just two floors above
where we were standing.
</P>
<P>
   Thus informed, Schlichtmann just rolled his eyeballs. ``New
building, same old story,'' he sighed.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Gift idea
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   What is the worst movie ever made? I always thought it was a
tossup between John Sayles's ``Piranha'' and the insufferably
precious ``Vanya on 42nd Street.'' But a new candidate has emerged:
``Dinosaur Valley Girls,'' a 1997 release from B-movie genius
``Dinosaur'' Don Glut, who has nurtured such memorable celluloid
outings as ``Bikini Drive-in'' and 1971's ``Schlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Glut is a hard man to pigeonhole. He is the co-author of a
well-regarded dinosaur encyclopedia, a dinosaur dictionary, and
``novelizations'' of the Star Wars movies. ``Valley Girls,''
occasionally featured on USA Network's ``Up All Night'' show,
remains his magnum opus. He tells me he is now raising money for
two movie projects, ``Dinosaur Valley Girls II'' and a vampire
movie called ``Blood Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad is ``DVG''? So bad that it circles the categoryand
almost reemerges as wonderful. The plot, such as it is, contrives
for Hollywood action sr Tony Markham to be transported back in time
to Dinosaur Valley, where scantily clad starlets wander around
chucking spears and mumbling ``for sure.'' Think: ``Quest for
Fire'' meets ``The Vixen,'' minus Anthony Burgess, who penned the
caveman grunts for ``Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   B-stars abound: William Marshall of ``Blacula'' fame, has a
small role, as does onetime Oscar nominee Karen Black. Glut filmed
the lush outdoor scenes near Devil's Punch Bowl in Pearblossom,
Calif., and at Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles. Does the cave mouth
where Bam-Bee and Bar-Bee disport themselves look familiar? It
should; it was used in John Ford's ``The Searchers,'' ``Mighty
Morphin' Power Rangers,'' the Batman TV series, and countless
movies and shows in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVG'' is available from frontlinefilms.com. I recommend the
Family Edition, not the mildly spicy ``Director's Cut.''

   Sightings of ``arguably'' in its current usage, as a synonym for
``not'': The New Yorker calls Al Gore ``arguably the most active
and influential Vice-President in history.'' The New Times of
Phoenix writes of John McCain: ``His connections to the banker
arguably ran deeper than those of any other member of the Keating
Five.'' And a Globe colleague recently wrote: ``The Public Garden
is arguably the most beautiful, most open park in the nation.''

SIMPLE EXERCISES MAKE THE SKI SEASON MORE RELAXING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUZZ GRAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Only a fool believes he or she can ski themselves
into shape. It doesn't happen in the real world without creating
sore muscles, pulled ones or even worse.
</P>
<P>
   So take the advice of such experts as Harold Habra, coach and
trainer of the U.S. National Demonstration Team, author of ``Anyone
Can Be An Expert Skier'' and columnist on the popular web site
www.OnTheSnow.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely does anyone I know ski longer than a minute or two
before stopping,'' Habra said. ``Judging from that, ski muscles
need to be conditioned for many repetitions in short bursts.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hare's basic exercises for would-be skiers who already
are in relatively good shape is the one-legged squat.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, which should be started at least two weeks before
you hit the slopes, builds quad strength (muscles on the front of
the upper leg) and endurance. It also increases balance and can be
done anywhere without equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to do: Stand sideways to the back of a chair. Hold
the top of the chair with your right hand for balance. Pick your
right leg off the floor and try to hold it out straight.
</P>
<P>
   Flex your left leg until you lower your rear end to
approximately two inches above a sitting position.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat this movement as many times as possible and record the
number. Turn around and exercise the other leg. Ten repetitions is
a starting number.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of flex (how far you bend the leg for each rep)
should depend on your level of present fitness. If you rarely
exercise, it is recommended you bend to only half the amount of
flex it takes to come to a full seated position. This range of flex
is minimal and will allow you to do more reps. The deeper you flex,
the fewer repetitions you'll be able to perform.
</P>
<P>
   If you are at the beginning phases of physical conditioning, use
the chair for support. As you become comfortable with the exercise,
try to be less dependent on the chair. Use only a finger to touch
the chair lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sore butt, not from falling but from pulling yourself over
your skis and maintaining your balance, is one of the consequences
for not being in shape,'' Habra said.
</P>
<P>
   A way to avoid such discomfort is to try split squats. Step
forward with one leg. Move and stretch the back leg behind your
body until your legs are split. Now you are in the starting
position.
</P>
<P>
   From here, lower the back knee until it touches the floor by
flexing the front leg. In your lowest position, the front shin
should be at a 90-degree angle to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat this movement 10 or more times.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to use a chair for support. As balance and strength
increase, you can hold hand weights for added resistance.

NEW YORK RACING ASSOCIATION BOOSTS PRIZE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT GRAVES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The New York Racing Association is
delivering some early Christmas presents to horsemen, unveiling its
richest stakes program in history.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Race Course will be the site of some of the largest
increases as the historic Whitney will be bumped up to $750,000
this summer from last year's mark of $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the record stakes purse total for Saratoga's 35
added-money events will be $8,725,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitney has always been one of Saratoga's greatest
attractions, and it seems to get better each year,'' NYRA racing
secretary Mike Lakow said Wednesday. ``Victory Gallop's nose win
over Behrens in 1999 is regarded by many as the race of the year.
The year before Awesome Again won the Whitney en route to winning
the Breeders' Cup Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend for larger purses has increased steeply for the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   For the first meet of the new millennium, eleven of the Spa
stakes have been boosted by a total of $1,125,000, including the
Alabama ($750,000 up from $400,000), the Diana Handicap ($500,000
up from $300,000), the Sword Dancer ($500,000 up from $400,000) and
the Jim Dandy ($400,000 up from $300,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alabama has long been one of the most important races in
the country,'' Lakow said. ``With a $350,000 boost in its purse, it
will take its place as the richest race for 3-year-old fillies in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga's showpiece event ... the Travers ... will remain one
of NYRA's three $1 million stakes along with the Belmont Stakes and
the Jockey Club Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In all, NYRA will feature 180 stakes worth $34.1 million at its
three tracks (Belmont, Aqueduct) for the year 2000. Thirty-six of
those stakes are Grade I events, including a dozen at Saratoga in
its meeting from Wednesday, July 24, through Monday, Sept. 4 (Labor
Day).

SHORTAGE OF BELL RINGERS HURTS SOME SALVATION ARMY CHAPTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THEOLA S. LABBE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The jingle of Salvation Army bells has become a
ubiquitous reminder of the holiday season, but a shortage of
volunteers at Salvation Army corps this year has left outposts
silent and has raised concerns about meeting fund-raising goals.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Cohoes, where a dearth of downtown businesses has
curbed foot traffic from shoppers, Salvation Army administrator
Glenda Larcombe has had to redeploy her four workers. While
normally they might be found on downtown street corners, she has
sent her troops this season to malls in other communities and still
fears she may miss her $28,000 fund-raising goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Salvation Army of Schenectady seems to be
doing better, with 10 volunteers for 10 stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the average during bell-ringing season is 20 workers, said
Maj. Clyde Jones, supplying a cadre of replacement workers to fill
in as needed. Since Nov. 18, when volunteers in Schenectady donned
their blue ``I am a Bell Ringer'' vests and stood next to the red
kettles, shaking hand bells, absent volunteers have left some spots
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone out to help out,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   With volunteers coming forward in droves to help other agencies
or to serve meals at holiday events, the Salvation Army has been
struggling here and in other regions of the country. The problem is
more acute during the week than on weekends, officials say. But
beyond that, they cannot say what is driving the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even pay people to help me,'' said Capt. Luva Blakely
of the Albany Temple corps. She is responsible for 10 stands in
Albany County, including the world's largest kettle at Crossgates
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to make at least $60,000,'' she said of the
agency's goal, ``but that's become a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual bell-ringing campaign from Thanksgiving to Christmas
is lucrative for the organization, an evangelical Protestant church
best known for its charity work. Last year bell ringers collected
about $79 million in 20,000 kettles nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Ronald Lee, the Salvation Army coordinator in the Albany
area, said finding competent volunteers is always a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   `'There's a lot of people who want to do it, but they're there
for the wrong reasons, and instead of helping they're turning
people off,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Salvation Army Corps in the region, 12 in total,
are in such dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   The Troy Salvation Army actually has a waiting list for bell
ringers, said Capt. Raymond Patrick. A group of 19 Bible students
has helped boost volunteers to staff the 24 kettles throughout
Rensselaer County, and the group expects to meet its $70,000 goal,
Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Some chapters supplement volunteers with paid bell ringers. That
may have helped in Saratoga Springs, where Capt. Mary Fitch said
she was unaware that other corps were struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing very well this year,'' said Fitch, who is
coordinating shifts at 14 stands throughout Saratoga County. Eight
workers are paid $5.15 per hour, and six are volunteer, but the
corps averages about 9 to 10 stand workers every day.
</P>
<P>
   Even without full coverage, the corps is $7,000 ahead compared
to last year and expects to meet its $60,000 goal. As a result, she
expects the corps will be able to beef up its programs next year.
</P>
<P>
   The kettle campaigns are almost as old as the Army itself.
Salvationists arrived in New York from Britain in 1880 and the
kettles appeared 11 years later at a San Francisco Christmas dinner
for needy people.
</P>
<P>
   Nickels, dimes and quarters fed 1,000 people that first year.
</P>
<P>
   The kettles, in the Army's well-planned strategy to provide
``soup, soap and salvation,'' were a deliberate attempt to
capitalize on the commercialization of the Christmas season.
Historians say kettles were placed outside department stores and
were meant to evoke warm feelings of hearth and home.

BATTLE OVER TARGET RANGE RAISES FEAR OF UNREST IN PUERTO RICO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Weary but determined protesters have
weathered isolation, uncertainty and lashing hurricanes to thwart
resumption of 58 years of naval bombardment on a remote target
range at the eastern tip of this impoverished island.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after eight months of peaceful civil disobedience that
forced an aircraft carrier battle fleet to divert elsewhere for
amphibious warfare training, encamped trespassers and Puerto Rico's
political leaders are bracing for their greatest challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Sen. Ruben Berrios, head of the Puerto Rico
Independence Party and the party's candidate for governor in 2000,
has lived a Robinson Crusoe life of civil disobedience on Vieques'
Yellow Beach since May 8.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarly lawmaker _ who has degrees from Georgetown, Yale
Law School and Oxford University _ sees signs that Washington is
waging a more determined offensive to undercut a people-power
campaign to oust the Navy from Vieques after a Marine warplane
accidentally bombed a range observation post in April, killing a
Navy contract security guard from the island and wounding four
other civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our unity will hold,'' Berrios said in an interview in
his beach-front encampment, one of eight protest camps located
about an hour's boat ride from the civilian sector of the island.
``The Clinton administration must break us apart if they hope to
prevail in this struggle. I just hope they don't succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from the beach, ensconced in the majestic fortress-style
governor's mansion in San Juan that dates back to the Spanish
colonial era, Gov. Pedro Rossello expresses related concerns.
Strains are beginning to develop over strategy and tactics within
the improbable coalition of rivals that united to demand an end to
Navy bombardment and fixed-date withdrawal from Vieques while
continuing to disagree about statehood, commonwealth or
independence for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is based on peace _ any sort of demonstration
within the boundaries of nonaggression and no violence,'' Rossello
said in an interview in La Fortaleza, a stronghold built in 1540 to
cement Spain's hold in the Caribbean. Some factions in the
coalition now ``have in their interest changing this into a
confrontation and into violence,'' Rossello warned. ``That is the
one thing that I think we have to be very careful about.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan outlined by Clinton 10 days ago failed to resolve a
bitter dispute between Puerto Rico and the Navy over the future of
the target range. Clinton bought time for additional negotiations,
by diverting the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower battle group from
scheduled training on the island before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The commander-in-chief ordered an end to live-fire combat
training on Vieques, requiring the Navy and Marines to use inert,
non-explosive weapons during the amphibious assault exercises that
are scheduled here in March, led by the aircraft carrier USS George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Navy to return 8,000 acres of Navy land that
has been used as an ammunition storage site; withdraw completely in
five years; and provide $40 million in economic development
assistance to Vieques, which has 9,300 civilian residents.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, the popular pro-statehood Democrat with close
political ties to Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, rejected the president's blueprint because
it failed to set a firm date for Navy withdrawal, lacked legal
enforcement to bind future presidents and held open the possibility
of the Navy negotiating resumption of live-fire training.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to reach an agreement after widespread
expectations that Puerto Rico would be able to protect its
territory from unwanted Navy training has dramatically changed the
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Navy demonstrators have defiantly expanded their peaceful
occupation of the target range in the wake of Clinton's
announcement to impose a contentious, round-the-clock blockade at
the entrance to Camp Garcia. Demonstrators have prevented supplies
from entering the Navy reservation that contains an 11,000-acre
maneuver and buffer zone, the hilltop range observation post and
the 899-acre shell-impact area.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican authorities have helicoptered a team of riot police
to stand by on Vieques. Navy authorities have beefed up security on
the Navy-side of the gate, with U.S. Marshals.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a former school who leads the Committee for the
Rescue and Development of Vieques, said the blockade is designed to
``send a message to Washington that the people of Vieques are
standing firm.'' Rabin added: `We will not tire of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters living on the impact area are now talking tough.
Jorge Farinacci, of the Socialist Front, says that ``any type of
resistance is legitimate'' to protect Vieques from resumption of
Navy bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Fugitive Puerto Rican guerrilla leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios used
a television interview from a clandestine location to warn that his
Macheteros, or Cane Cutters, may resume terrorist attacks if the
Navy resumes operations on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Navy Puerto Rican sympathizers in New York staged a
demonstration at the United Nations that led to 10 arrests last
Tuesday, including former world boxing champion Jose ``Chegui''
Torres. Singer Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican heartthrob,
electrified his receipt of an honor at the Billboard Awards
ceremony on Wednesday by dedicating his award to the ``children of
all militarized zones,'' before adding in Spanish: ``Vieques, I'm
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the beach, Berrios vows to remain encamped on the target
range until the Navy permanently ends amphibious combat training or
until he is arrested to make way for resumption of training with
inert ammunition next spring. The thoughtful, white-bearded scholar
savors the potential political clout offered by Puerto Rican voters
in the New York Senate race being waged by Mrs. Clinton and by
Hispanic voters who are influential in large electoral states
crucial to Vice President Al Gore, including, California, Florida,
New York and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Navy leaves without one more bomb, we win,'' said
Berrios, whose civil disobedience on Navy-owned Culebra and
imprisonment in 1971 helped set the stage for the Navy's turnover
of the nearby island in the mid-1970s. ``If they arrest us, they
lose. If they imprison us, you can jot down the defeat of the
Democratic Party in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said Thursday that he expects to resume personal
negotiations with Clinton before Christmas, either by telephone or
during a trip to Washington, in a continuing effort to reach a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossello warned that as a compromise nears, other
participants in the political partnership of convenience may harbor
other goals. Rossello, who favors statehood, said that Berrios was
``begging to be arrested'' to bolster his campaign to win Puerto
Rico independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's one of his goals, he will do anything to accept
nothing,'' Rossello said. ``But again, that's his goal. That's not
our goal.''

</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, the dispute lives side-by-side with a fledgling
tourist trade that lures mainland Americans to a quiet Caribbean
getaway and islanders who are largely dependent on a social safety
net financed by San Juan and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment exceeds 50 percent on a wind-swept island where the
Navy has owned two-thirds of the 52 square miles since buying up
sugar cane fields and residents' small plots for $47 an acre in
1941 to make way for combat training for World War II. Today, many
families rely on food stamps, part of the $11 billion in federal
payments to Puerto Rico's 3.8 million U.S. citizens who reside in
the commonwealth, which lacks the clout of a state or a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many homes and businesses are dilapidated, built from cinder
block, wood and corrugated metal sheeting that have been torn and
tattered by passing hurricanes. Packs of dogs roam overgrown sugar
cane fields. Limited air and ferry services contribute to an air of
isolation on the island 8 miles from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Carmelo Belardo, 60, a retired high school Spanish teacher who
served in the U.S. Army in Alaska, blames Navy occupation for
stemming economic development and sowing chronic dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not receive something for nothing,'' Belardo
said, as he chats with a half dozen friends on the beachfront.
``But people have no hope. Why finish school, the wonder, if their
only choice is to go on the dole or leave the island they love.''
</P>
<P>
   For the family of David Sanes Rodriguez, the 35-year-old Navy
security guard who died in the errant bombing on April 19, the
Christmas season approaches with an air of dread.
</P>
<P>
   Sanes, devoted to his well-paying job with the Navy, died one
month before his planned wedding as he stood on an observation
platform watching Navy and Marine aircraft drop bombs from 10,000
feet. Two 500 pound bombs exploded nearby, inflicting mortal
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The incident became a rallying point for islanders' frustration
with the Navy. But the Sanes family has shunned the limelight and
the crusade that his death inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulate that negotiations are under way between the
Sanes' lawyer and the Navy on a compensation package in excess of
$1 million. But no one is talking.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Ortiz, a cabinet maker who has two brothers married to
sisters of the victim, said the family ``doesn't want to take part
in the protests,'' adding: ``They have suffered a loss. They have a
lot to deal with.''

FROZEN BAKED GOODS DON'T LAST FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most common inquiry I had this season is, ``Can I
freeze (enter any baked good here)?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to the National Food Safety Database and
the University of Georgia Extension Service, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any food can be safely frozen. However, the quality might not
be acceptable when thawed,'' writes the extension service's Carolyn
J. Lackey.
</P>
<P>
   For best results, use packaging materials that are made for use
in the freezer to minimize changes. Also, package everything in the
freezer airtight so flavors and odors don't travel from food to
food.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the foods are frozen, the more likely the quality
will diminish, but since the holidays are close, that shouldn't be
a problem. Just in case you don't use them all this Christmas, date
the packaging and use within three months for best results.
</P>
<P>
   Thaw precooked breads, cakes and cookies in their wrapping at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Unbaked yeast breads are best if they are frozen before the
final rising period. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Let the
dough then stand at room temperature about 15 minutes to warm
slightly before shaping. Bake as directed in recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Even choux pastry, which is used for making cream puffs and
eclairs, can be frozen. Bake as usual, cool and remove the moist,
inner parts, but do not fill. Package and freeze. Thaw at room
temperature.

   JAPAN-ROYAL-PREGNANCY (Tokyo) _ After more than six years of a

`MY OWN BROTHER PASSED AWAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The procession and memorial service for six Worcester
firefighters who died last Friday in a ghastly blaze was, at heart,
a family gathering. If a banner could be sewn large enough to
stretch over these public servants, it would best depict a passage
from the Book of Proverbs: ``A brother helped by a brother is like
a fortified city.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters began to muster at dawn on Grove Street. Within a
few hours an estimated 30,000 of them formed a human lifeline
almost 3 miles long. It was meant to reunite them with their six
brethren, four of whom are still buried beneath the rubble of the
Worcester Cold Stog and Warehouse building.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters, who traveled here from as far away as
Australia, accept the dangers of their profession. Each is equipped
to deal with the harshest realities. Yet each also knows how
quickly one or more of their number can succumb to the deadly
caprices of fire. Only light smoke was showing on the upper floors
of the warehouse when Worcester firefighters searched for homeless
men and women. Within a few seconds, cork paneling and polyurethane
coating ignited, turning the building's cubicles into crypts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my own brother passed away,'' said firefighter
Nick Fahs of the Mehlville Fire Department District near St. Louis.
It was an oft-repeated sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester firefighters, in their time of sorrow and exhaustion,
needed every member of the family there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our extended family, and it extends around the
world,'' said Jim Cassidy, a Worcester firefighter who was
bleary-eyed from the previous night's efforts to recover bodies.
``And it's a good thing, too, given this devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper the sorrow of these men, the less they had words to
describe it. Before the procession stepped off, it appeared that
one member of the Worcester Fire Department's honor guard, Steven
Raffa, would collapse if he had not been able to lean on his M1
carbine. Yet when a fire officer called hoarsely for ``Rescue One,
Ladder Two, and Engine Three'' _ the first responders to the blaze
_ to take up the lead position, Raffa led them ramrod straight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the firefighters wanted the public to understand that it
is not just the shared peril of the job that unites them.
</P>
<P>
   Martin O'Reilly, who travel to Worcester with five other members
of the Dublin Fire Brigade, was almost dismissive of the dangers of
a job where a flickering glow can suddenly turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always dangerous,'' he said. ``That's just what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The real point, said the Irish firefighters, is the profession's
abiding belief in ``humanitarian service'' and ``preservation of
human life.'' That sense of common obligation and value binds the
firefighters together, regardless of geography or department
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Even the youngest Worcester residents who lined the march route
seemed to understand that sentiment. Hardly a sound could be heard
along the way other than pipes and drums. Schoolchildren, many
teary-eyed, held signs with the hand-drawn message, ``May God
protect our heroes, always.'' The message would be taken up later
by Bishop Daniel Reilly, who told thousands of assembled mourners:
``We ust recognize the transcending goodness of their actions. Love
like theirs, heroism like theirs, sacrifice like theirs, cannot go
unrewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people came to Worcester on is day of lamentation
to say that noble purpose defined the lives and times of Worcester
firefighters Paul Brotherton, Timothy Jackson, Jeremiah Lucey,
James Lyons, Joseph McGuirk, and Thomas Spencer.

RAYTHEON'S PICARD A SELF-MADE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Picard was not born with a silver spoon anywhere handy.
</P>
<P>
   More like a brass screwdriver. As a working class kid in North
Providence, R.I., he arrived at the Christian Brothers' doorstep at
LaSalle Academy. ``I was a punk kid, and the Christian Brothers let
me know I was a punk kid,'' said the retired Raytheon CEO, now 67.
``They straightened me right out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Air Force got hold of him. As an 18-year-old airman
with a knack for electronics, he began as a Korean-era radioman,
and began lapping up correspondence courses. Until he became
bedazzled by electronic gizmos, he'd been pointing to a career in
wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force turned me around from running a duck marsh,'' he
said, though a lifelong interest in fishing finds him still heading
out for deep water on his fishing boat based on Cape Cod. ``I
learned a great deal about leadership in the Air Force, about the
kind of people who should be leaders, and the people who should not
be inedership positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Discharged, he set up shop in his father's cellar, fixing broken
TV sets. By the time he had the first two of his five children,
``my wife was telling me to go get a real job, so I got in my car
and drove from Rhode Island to Waltham,'' looking for the Sylvania
plant to file a job application.
</P>
<P>
   ``This very gruff, tough Irish cop pulled me over near Route 20
in Waltham, asking me what the hell I was doing holding up traffic.
I was trying to read the map. I didn't know where I was.'' The cop
wanted him to move his car, and pointed him toward a nearby
Raytheon factory. Following the hand of fate, and the stern finger
of that flatfoot, Picard got hired at Raytheon, in the lowest-level
engineering job the company offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to Northeastern three nights a week and some
weekends, and moved the family to Oak Square in Brighton. We lived
there till the ceiling caved in. The trolley went right by the
house, and over the years, it loosened the plaster, till the whole
thing came down. So we moved.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't stop moving until he became the boss, an engineer
who rose through all the technical ranks till a stubborn mentor
overcame Picard's reluctance and shoved him onto the management
track. There he presided over the aggressive acquisition strategy
that turned Raytheon into the number three defense contractor. But
after Picard turned the CEO job over to Daniel Burnham, the current
chief, Raytheon stock was hammered, triggering a critical article
in Business Week that challenged Picard's management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . the accusation fromanonymous sources that (Picard) had
`not just a hot temper but was unpredictable' is simply untrue and
obviously a venomous accusation by someone with an ax to grind,''
replied former US Senator Warren Rudman, a Picard booster who
points out that many defense companies have had problems digesting
the acquisitions that Pentagon downshifting forced them into.
Burnham also leaped to the defense of his predecessor, as did
former CIA chief John Deutch, another Raytheon board member, who
called Picard ``one of the most impressive leaders I have ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the consolidation in the defense industry is a
short-term problem; to Picard the long-term problem is getting a
higher quality of public education. America's economic strength
rests ultimately on the quality of public education. ``I've been
active in charter schools, to get the public schools to work in
competitive ways. Bill Bulger got me started _ his roots and my
roots were similar. We're not doingall that well with public school
kids, particularly in math and science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All these engineering and Internet companies are having
trouble getting the right kind of people,'' Picard said over lunch
Monday. ``The problem really begins in secondary school. That's
where you can lose the work intensity, the desire, for the hard
subjects like math and science.'' He says too many bright young
people believe that ``other kids seem to have more fun than those
taking math and science, where they're doing twice as much
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Picard put in 44 years aRaytheon, Massaachusetts' largest
employer. ``I've worked with great engineers over the years, and
the greater they are, the more pronounced they are.'' He says you
can't lead a giant corporation without facing tough decisions.
``I'm not a bully, but I'll agree with you that I'm a tough guy, a
forceful guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Picard saw the handwriting on the wall about defense spending
cutbacks at a now-famous dinner in Washington in 1993, dubbed ``The
Last Supper,'' where top officials of the US government informed
contractors the fall of the Berlin Wall would mean severe slicing
in some kinds of military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no panic, no frenzy,'' claims Picard of Raytheon's
reaction to the news. In the race to adapt to changing conditions,
he said, ``Lockheed Martin went forward quickly, we hung back.''
There were other corporations ``that came in and wanted to buy
Raytheon'' in the merger derby that unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   He described the Raytheon merger with Hughes as an example of
two cultures clashing. ``Hughes was tough. They were our
arch-rivals. It was like the Red Sox and Yankees suddenly having to
work together.'' Experiences like that convinced him America needs
business leaders who can bridge gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a need for a better mix of business and liberal
education with technology skills,'' he said. ``With the Internet
and the amount of information flow, you can't be just a technocrat
anymore. You're not allowed to be just a technocrat.''

INDIA'S DEMOGRAPHIC FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Renee Loth  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KERALA, India  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are so dizzying in the world's second-most-populous
country that demographers have borrowed words from Hindi to help
express their vastness: ``lakh'' for 10,0; ``crore'' for 10
million. So, for example, India's teeming population of 1 billion
is increasing by 1.6 crore (16 million) every year.
</P>
<P>
   Government programs to manage the population, especially in the
cities, where the slums are a dispiriting sink of pollution,
squalor, and disease, have not been successful. In the mid-1970s,
Indira Gandhi imposed emergency restrictions on civil liberties
that included a coercive two-child policy for each family.
Vasectomies were forced upon men. Women found to have reached their
limit were packed off to hospitals for sterilization, then sent
home with a transistor radio as an ``incentive.'' In 1996 India
officially dropped birth-control quotas in favor of a more holistic
approach to reproductive health care, but government efforts at
family planning remain deeply suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by the pitifully low status of most
women in India. Sixty-three percent of the female population is
illiterate. Girl children are not valued, and many are abandoned as
infants. Although the Qutb Minar tower in Old Delhi is closed now
for security reasons, women without dowries routinely flung
themselves off it rather than face a life of ostracism, begging, or
marrying beneath their caste. Women who fail to produce sons can be
banished from their homes. Widows in some areas still immolate
themselves upon their husbands' funeral pyres in the Hindu ritual
of suttee. All of these practices are officially banned but seldom
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Further impeding progress is the nation's diversity: Indians
speak 18 languages and belong to at least six major religions, each
with its own civil code. India is, of course, theorld's largest
democracy, but it is also the most chaotic. Each sprawling state is
barely manageable. In Uttar Pradesh (population 157 million), the
impression is of disorder bordering on anarchy: Fires for cooking
or incinerating garbage burn everywhere; pigs, dogs, and the
ubiquitous cows root about in the streets, picking through trash
with men who have little to do but squat on their heels and trace
idly in the dirt with sticks. The most optimistic UN projection
does not foresee India's population stabilizing until it nearly
doubles, to 1.8 billion. To consider that prospect is to court
despair.
</P>
<P>
   Just visible through the gloom is Kerala, a green and languid
state on the southwest coast, where literacy even among females is
90 percent, education is compulsory, health care is free, and
infant mortality rates are 12 per 1,000, compared with 85 per 1,000
in Uttar Pradesh. Since 1957, with some interruptions, Kerala has
had a democratically elected communist state government that
nonetheless exists with vigorous religious expression, especially
among Christians, and a bustling economy of rubber, cashews, coir,
and, increasingly, tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that nearly a third of educated Keralites are
working abroad, mostly in Kuwait and Dubai. So-called ``Gulf
houses'' are springing up amid the palms and jasmine thanks to the
wealth returning to Inia from the Gulf states. Kerala reached zero
population growth 15 years before the target date set by the UN.
</P>
<P>
   Kerala is thus a laboratory for the thesis that family size
naturally decreases when women are educated, children survive
infancy,ad economic opportunity nurtures hope for a better life.
During a visit to the Vadavucode Community Health Center organized
by the Population Institute, a US-based nongovernmental
organization, we met Leela Yohannan, who explained that she had a
tubal ligation at the center after her second child and already
tells her daughters about the benefits of a small family.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to tell in this stew of factors which holds the
secret for Kerala: Is it the religious or political differences,
the fact that the state is a traditional matriarchy, or the system
of industry cooperatives and strong local ``panchayats,'' or
district councils, that make Kerala easier to organize? Officials
cannot hope to replicate Kerala's success until they figre this
out, but free compulsory education for boys and girls alike would
be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   There is a political conundrum as well; in a democracy, states
like Kerala that have stable populations lose out against the
growing states. And India itself is not above rattling one billion
sabers against its enemies. In recent border clashes with Pakistan
the government in New Delhi ran patriotic ads saluting India as
``100 Crore strong.''
</P>
<P>
   India will need to reconcile these competing imperatives in
favor of a sustainable population or it will lose power in the
world despite its nuclear capacity and its growing middle class.
Mohandas Gandhi said poverty is the worst form of violence. Surely
the father of his country would not support creating more savagery
on such a scale.

 &HT;    MOSCOW BACKS OFF FLEE-OR-DIE DEADLINE, BUT WAR GRINDS ON
 &HT;    (600 &AMP;ADD).
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government appeared to ease a flee-or-die
deadline Saturday for residents of the besieged Chechen capital,
Grozny, but vowed to pursue its punishing military offensive in the
breakaway republic despite intense international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Russia offered to negotiate safe passage for the thousands of
civilians trapped in Grozny, said a senior Russian official,
Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu. He denied that a target date
existed for the city's annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deadline. Everything will be all right. What
deadline? Is it the end of the world tomorrow?'' Shoigu asked
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russian forces dropped leaflets over the Chechen
capital warning residents that they had until Saturday to escape
through a designated military corridor or face death from a Russian
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others condemned the threat. President
Clinton said Russia risked international isolation and Germany
called the ultimatum ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates as many as
40,000 people _ many of them elderly and disabled _ are pinned down
in Grozny amid Russia's ongoing artillery and air bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   Russia forces have occupied the northern two-thirds of Chechnya
and are poised to overrun Grozny, as the remaining pocket of
resistance from Islamic guerillas in the central plains appears to
be evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin revealed Friday that he has
conducted secret, and thus far fruitless, contacts with an envoy of
the Chechen president in an effort to seek a peaceful settlement of
the three-month-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But with broad support for the war from the Russian people,
there seems little motivation for Russia to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen campaign is causing diplomatic strains with the
United States and the European Union, but the offensive is a
political winner at home for the Kremlin as Russia prepares for
national parliamentary elections one week from Sunday. The election
will signal the political mood in advance of the race to replace
President Boris Yeltsin. The vote for a new president is scheduled
for June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The war is widely popular among Russians, who blame Chechen
guerrillas for a series of fatal apartment-building bombings that
killed about 300 people in Moscow and other cities last summer.
Putin, virtually unknown when he was appointed by Yeltsin in
August, is now the country's most popular politician because of the
war he has waged.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Grozny would be an important symbolic victory,
coming three years after Russian troops, bloodied and humiliated,
retreated from the city following a war with Chechen rebels from
1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   When the capital may fall is uncertain. Analysts suggest that
the Kremlin is weighing the political dividends of securing Grozny
before the Dec. 19 elections versus the political fallout should
Russian ground forces face fierce resistance and suffer casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But there appears to be little standing in the way of the
100,000 Russian troops now amassed in Chechnya and the border
regions. The current Russian campaign, and the damage left from the
1994-96 war, have decimated about 80 percent of Grozny, according
to media and eyewitness reports.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu, the Russian Emergencies Minister, said Friday that the
military would temporarily halt its siege and establish six
corridors to allow civilians to leave Grozny for Russian-controlled
territory in northern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said in Geneva that ``confusion
reigned'' over the Russian offer for safe passage and that few had
fled via using the single route suggested Monday after the military
dropped its do-or-die leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia has displaced the guerrillas, but has not
conquered them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, some 5,000 Chechen guerrillas held positions
in Grozny and its southern outskirts, according to reports. But
wire services quoted Chechen guerrilla commanders Friday saying
that many fighters have now retreated to the southern mountainous
region to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vowed to pursue the rebels into the highlands and
destroy them there. Yet the ground forces would be vulnerable to
hit-and-run attacks, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Putin need a swift, successful conclusion to the
conflict, or risk becoming mired in a war of attrition like that of
'94-'96, said a political commentator in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradox. The Russian economy remains weak; people's
lives have not changed. And the outcome of this war is unclear. But
for now the nation feels good,'' said Boris Makarenko of the Center
for Political Technologies, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has demanded that Chechen authorities
hand over the ``terrorists'' and disarm warlords and armed groups
in the lawless province. Shoigu, who is running at the head of the
Kremlin-backed list of candidates for parliament, said he would be
willing to meet and negotiate with Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin said later on Friday that Maskhadov ``keeps sending
new people (to negotiate) but we have not been given clear answers
to our questions.''

OPERA AND RADIO LOVERS REJOICE AT TEXACO TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For opera fans across America, Texaco means more than big oil.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to one of the country's most enduring and far-reaching
cultural institutions _ the weekly Texaco Metropolitan Opera
broadcasts _ thousands who could only dream of going to New York to
see a live performance at the Metropolitan Opera have experienced
opera in their own living rooms, becoming familiar with the
masterpieces of the repertoire and with the unique qualities of the
great singers of the century. As of 1999, opera is more popular
across America than ever, and the Texaco Metropolitan Opera
broadcasts can take at least part of the credit for making America
an opera-friendly nation.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition begins its 60th season Saturday, with broadcasts
that will be aired on more than 600 stations in the United States
and Canada _ from Nome, Alaska, to Miami _ and on almost 60
stations overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ongoing success of the Saturday-afternoon broadcasts
is due to the intelligent, but adamantly nonsnobby intermission
commentary of Peter Allen, who often includes quizzes and trivia
questions from listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who had his first radio experience while majoring in
English at Ohio State University, will celebrate his 25th
anniversary as host of the program Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal is to communicate,'' he said in a recent
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has hosted over 500 broadcasts and says that only three
were operas he doesn't like. He declines to say which three operas,
but says he strove to help the audience enjoy those works anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every opera has a fascinating background,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That fact helped Allen through one of the most difficult moments
in his career early on, when, during a performance of Verdi's
``Macbeth,'' a man committed suicide by jumping from a balcony.
Allen and his guest commentators had to improvise two hours of
intermission features while the situation in the Metropolitan Opera
House was cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   This year's broadcast schedule has an unusually rich variety of
repertoire, including _ along with the Met's usual heavy dose of
standard Franco-Italian repertoire _ a complete performance of
Wagner's monumental four-opera ``Ring'' cycle, Shostakovich's
``Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk'' and a broadcast of the premiere
production of American composer John Harbison's ``The Great
Gatsby.''

MORA'S OFFENSE MAKES COLTS ONE OF THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The day in America's heartland is cool, December
dank, and dark. The Colts are leaving the field after a midweek
practice and the media are seated under a giant old tree, sturdy as
the Midwest. Jim Mora walks over and begins talking about a
phenomenon rarely seen in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Time spinning faster than it does on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   A new rage exploding first in Indiana and only then fanning
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts stomping.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is tanned. There is a glint to his eye. His smile is quick.
That image from New Orleans when he fell apart at a news conference
after his Saints lost their sixth game in eight and Mora resigned
after 11 seasons with New Orleans seems long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I hadn't been asked that question before,'' Mora
said when an outsider asked when he realized his Colts were not
just a team on the upswing but one of the best in the National
Football League. ``I don't know if I can say there was any one
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happening so fast. The Colts now have an offense that even
draws in neutral fans for a look at how football should be played.
The Colts now have a quarterback, Peyton Manning, and a running
back, Edgerrin James, and a wide receiver, Marvin Harrison, that _
in their potential _ seem capable of being more exciting than, or
as good or even better as, any of the last generation.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know in this business,'' said Mora. ``I've been in
this business long enough to know that crazy things happen. No, I
didn't think we'd win this many games . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mora exhaled a deep breath. ``You saw this potenial in this
team, especially offensively, and yet you never know what's going
to happen next year. You know you're an injury away, a key injury
away, from going the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   So fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that it's happening,'' said Mora, struggling to put
into words this sudden rise from the ashes of the Colts _ and
himself. ``It gives you a nice feeling . . . it's better than not
having it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two games with the Patriots, both in Foxborough, stand out as
benchmarks on the trek upward. The first, early in the 1998 season,
was perhaps Manning's worst game in his short career, the rookie
quarterback confused, lost, bewildered, and inept, throwing
interception after interception. ``That was maybe Peyton's worst
game,'' said Mora, as the Colts struggled to a 3-13 year.
</P>
<P>
   But, significantly, Manning was not scarred as so many rookie
quarterbacks are scarred by sudden ineptitude when they take that
last giant step to professional football (``That Patriots game was
tough,'' said Manning. ``I was worried that I might be scarred'').
Late last season, said Mora, ``he made it over the hump'' when he
went out to San Francisco and fired three TD passes against the
49ers in a 34-31 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The next benchmark, early in this season, came when the Colts
scored 28 points against New England in the first half as Manning
checked off at the line scrimmage on play after play, testing Ty
Law as no other QB had tested Ty Law, throwing three TD passes to
Harrison over Law. ``That showed how much I'd learned about
defenses since that other game in Foxborough,'' Manning said of the
audibles at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colts blew that lead, as Mora's teams in New Orleans,
good as they were, so often blew leads and lost games they should
have won. Mora so often would go conservative with a lead, but a
hard, hard lesson was learned in Foxborough by these young Colts.
They learned their offense was too good to ever be set in neutral,
that their offense could suck all momentum from opposing teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mora also learned that he had a quarterback ``who was a
competitor, one who could handle pressure, one who _ like a Larry
Bird or Michael Jordan _ wants the ball in pressure, critical
situations, one who handles adversity and doesn't let it put him in
the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora has ever been known as a defensive coach, deep in his core
the football truism that defenses win games. But now, as the Colts
defense is still being built, Mora has a true offensive power, one
that can win games now with its sheer explosiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive guru (``Oh, nobody is a guru in this business,''
he countered) was asked to look at his offense from a defensive
coach's eyes. Mora complied, but the essential defensive nature of
his soul told him that no offense, not even his Colts, is
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is unstoppable,'' said Mora. ``We fought for our lives
twice against the Jets. We fought for our lives . . . I mean, we
scored 16 points in one game and 13 in the other. Nobody in
unstoppable; I guarantee that. I coached against the 49ers every
year for many years when they had a great offensive machine and
there were times they had trouble scoring points. Everybody
struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mora knows so well the cycle of NFL football. A team can
spring suddenly upon the scene, but as that team enjoys more and
more success, opposing coaches devote more of their attention, and
their schemes, to stopping it. It is the way of life in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you are doing good in this business, when you
really are doing good on offense, then everybody is really bearing
down to put the clamps on you to stop that offense,'' said Mora.
``It makes it even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there is one element to this Colts team that makes it so
different from Mora's New Orleans teams. Beyond the quarterback,
beyond the running back, beyond the wide receiver, there is Tom
Moore. He is 60 years old now, has spent 22 years coaching in the
NFL, and, for most of the years, has been the offensive coordinator
for some very good offenses.
</P>
<P>
   From the Steelers of Terry Bradshaw and Lynn Swann in the late
1970s to the Lions of Barry Sanders in the 1990s, the offense that
led the league and was the first to have two receivers (Herman
Moore and Brett Perriman) catch more than 1,000 yards in passes,
Moore has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Tom Moore more or less called the plays,'' said
Manning. ``As he's gained confidence in me and as I have a better
understanding of what we're doing, it's gotten better. Last year,
I'd just listen to the play. But now I have a pretty good idea of
what he's going to call before he calls it and that's what you want
to have between a quarterback and a coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bond is total between the wise and savvy Moore and
Manning. They think the same _ they think the worst epithet for an
offensive game plan after the last play ``is to be one play away,''
as Manning put it. ``The worst thing is to think, `I just wish we
had the post call when they were in that defense.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (For Patriot fans who no longer remember what a post pattern or
quick slant pass play entails, the receiver cuts diagonally to the
inside. Despite the Patriots' reluctance to use the patterns, they
still are most effective against some blitzes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use that last play,'' Manning said. ``If they're
showing blitz, hey . . . we want the post route and we know we can
get to it. That's kind of a result of how much confidence I have in
Tom and Tom has in me. We never want to leave the field thinking of
that one last play we should have called but we didn't call.''
</P>
<P>
   These Colts of Mora, unlike those Saints of Mora who just
couldn't take the final step, do not think offense is merely what
happens when the defense is not on the field. Blowing that 28-7
lead to the Patriots taught them all a lesson _ keep scoring
points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are now among the best in football, and unlike last
year's Falcons, who also made a sudden rise, it is clear this team
will be very good for several years. And if it happened so fast
that Mora doesn't realize exactly when the Colts went from a team
on the uptick to a team that must be feared, his decades in pro
football have taught him one lesson. Seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take advantage of the opportunity when you've
got it,'' Mora said. ``All coaches learn that. It's really
important. You've got to . . . you've got to . . . you never know
when it's going to come again.''

MORA'S OFFENSE MAKES COLTS ONE OF THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The day in America's heartland is cool, December
dank, and dark. The Colts are leaving the field after a midweek
practice and the media are seated under a giant old tree, sturdy as
the Midwest. Jim Mora walks over and begins talking about a
phenomenon rarely seen in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Time spinning faster than it does on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   A new rage exploding first in Indiana and only then fanning
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts stomping.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is tanned. There is a glint to his eye. His smile is quick.
That image from New Orleans when he fell apart at a news conference
after his Saints lost their sixth game in eight and Mora resigned
after 11 seasons with New Orleans seems long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I hadn't been asked that question before,'' Mora
said when an outsider asked when he realized his Colts were not
just a team on the upswing but one of the best in the National
Football League. ``I don't know if I can say there was any one
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happening so fast. The Colts now have an offense that even
draws in neutral fans for a look at how football should be played.
The Colts now have a quarterback, Peyton Manning, and a running
back,drrin James, and a wide receiver, Marvin Harrison, that _ in
their potential _ seem capable of being more exciting than, or as
good or even better as, any of the last generation.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know in this business,'' said Mora. ``I've been in
this business long enough to know that crazy things happen. No, I
didn't think we'd win this many games . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mora exhaled a deep breath. ``You saw this potenial in this
team, especially offensively, and yet you never know what's going
to happen next year. You know you're an injury away, a key injury
away, from going the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   So fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that it's happening,'' said Mora, struggling to put
into words this sudden rise from the ashes of the Colts _ and
himself. ``It gives you a nice feeling . . . it's better than not
having it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two games with the Patriots, both in Foxborough, stand out as
benchmarks on the trek upward. The first, early in the 1998 season,
was perhaps Manning's worst game in his short career, the rookie
quarterback confused, lost, bewildered, and inept, throwing
interception after interception. ``That was maybe Peyton's worst
game,'' said Mora, as the Colts struggled to a 3-13 year.
</P>
<P>
   But, significantly, Manning was not scarred as so many rookie
quarterbacks are scarred by sudden ineptitude when they take that
last giant step to professional football (``That Patriots game was
tough,'' said Manning. ``I was worried that I might be scarred'').
Late last season, said Mora, ``he made it over the hump'' when he
went out to San Francisco and fired three TDasses against the 49ers
in a 34-31 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The next bnchmark, early in this season, came when the Colts
scored 28 points against New England in the first half as Manning
checked off at the line scrimmage on play after play testing Ty Law
as no other QB had tested Ty Law, throwing three TD passes to
Harrison over Law. ``That showed how much I'd learned about
defenses since that other game in Foxborough,'' Manning said of the
audibles at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colts blew that lead, as Mora's teams in New Orleans,
good as they were, so often blew leads and lost games they should
have won. Mora so often would go conservative with a lead, but a
hard, hard lesson was learned in Foxborough by these young Colts.

that their offense could suck all momentum from opposing teams.
</P>
<P>

situations, one who handles adversity and doesn't let it put him in

`MY OWN BROTHER PASSED AWAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The procession and memorial service for six Worcester
firefighters who died last Friday in a ghastly blaze was, at heart,
a family gathering. If a banner could be sewn large enough to
stretch over these public servants, it would best depict a passage
from the Book of Proverbs: ``A brother helped by a brother is like
a fortified city.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiefighters began to muster at dawn on Grove Street. Within a
few hours an estimated 30,000 of them formed a human lifelinelst 3
miles long. It was meant to reunite them with their six brethren,
four of whom are still buried beneath the rubble of the Worcester
Cold Storage and Warehouse building.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters, who traveled here from as far away as
Australia, accept the dangers of their profession. Each is equipped
to deal with the harshest realities. Yet each also knows how
quickly one or more of their number can succumb to the deadly
caprices of fire. Only light smoke was showing on the upper floors
of the warehouse when Worcester firefighters searched for homeless
men and women. Within a few seconds, cork paneling and polyurethane
coating ignited, turning the building's cubicles into crypts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my own brother passed away,'' said firefighter
Nick Fahs of the Mehlville Fire Department District near St. Louis.
It was an oft-repeated sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester firefighters, in their time of sorrow and exhaustion,
needed every member of the family there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our extended family, and it extends around the
world,'' said Jim Cassidy, a Worcester firefighter who was
bleary-eyed from the previous night's efforts to recover bodies.
``And it's a good thing, too, given this devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper the sorrow of these men, the less they had words to
describe it. Before the procession stepped off, it appeared that
one member of the Worcester Fire Department's honor guard, Steven
Raffa, would collapse if he had not been able to lean on his M1
carbine. Yet when a fire officer called hoarsely for ``Rescue One,
Ladder Two, and Engine Three'' _ the first responders to the blaze
_ to take up the lead position, Raffa led them raod straight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the firefighters wanted the public to understand that it
is not just the shared peril of the job that unites them.
</P>
<P>
   Martin O'Reilly, who traveled to Worcester with five other
members of the Dublin Fire Brigade, was almost dismissive of the
dangers of a job where a flickering glow can suddenly turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always dangerous,'' he said. ``That's just what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The real point, said the Irish firefighters, is the profession's
abiding beief in ``humanitarian service'' and ``preservation of
human life.'' That sense of common obligation and value binds the
firefighters together, regardless of geography or department
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Even the youngest Worcester residents who lined the march route
seemed to understand that sentiment. Hardly a sound could be heard
along the way other than pipes and drums. Schoolchildren, many
teary-eyed, held signs with the hand-drawn message, ``May God
protect our heroes, always.'' The message would be taken up later
by Bishop Daniel Reilly, who told thousands of assembled mourners:
``We must recognize the transcending goodness of their actions.
Love like theirs, heroism like theirs, sacrifice like theirs,
cannot go unrewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people came to Worcester on its day of lamentation
to say that noble purpose defined the lives and times of Worcester
firefighters Paul Brotherton, Timothy Jackson, Jeremiah Lucey,
James Lyons, Joseph McGuirk, and Thomas Spencer.

INDIA'S DEMOGRAPHIC FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Renee Loth  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KERALA, India  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are so dizzying in the world's second-most-populous
country that demographers have borrowed words from Hindi to help
express their vastness: ``lakh'' for 100,000; ``crore'' for 10
million. So, for example, India's teeming population of 1 billion
is increasing by 1.6 crore (16 million) every year.
</P>
<P>
   Gement programs to manage the population, especially in the
cities, where the slums are a dispiriting sink of pollution,
squalor, and disease, have not been successful. In the mid-1970s,
Indira Gandhi imposed emergency restrictions on civil liberties
that included a coercive two-child policy for each family.
Vasectomies were forced upon men. Women found to have reached their
limit were packed off to hospitals for sterilization, then sent
home with a transistor radio as an ``incentive.'' In 1996 India
officially dropped birth-control quotas in favor of a more holistic
approach to reproductive health care, but government efforts at
family planning remain deeply suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by the pitifully low status of most
women in India. Sixty-three percent of the female population is
illiterate. Girl children are not valued, and many are abandoned as
infants. Although the Qutb Minar tower in Old Delhi is closed now
for security reasons, women without dowries routinely flung
themselves off it rather than face a life of ostracism, begging, or
marrying beneath their caste. Women who fail to produce sons can be
banished from their homes. Widows in some areas still immolate
themselves upon their husbands' funeral pyres in the Hindu ritual
of suttee. All of these practices are officially banned but seldom
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Further impeding progress is the nation's diversity: Indians
speak 18 languages and belong to at least six major religions, each
with its own civil code. India is, of course, the world's larget
democracy, but it is also the most chaotic. Each sprawling state is
barely manageable. In Uttar Pradesh (population 157 million), the
impression is of disorder bordering on anarchy: Fires for cooking
or incinerating garbage burn everywhere; pigs, dogs, and the
ubiquitous cows root about in the streets, picking through trash
with men who have little to do but squat on their heels and trace
idly in the dirt with sticks. The most optimistic UN projection
does not foresee India's population stabilizing until it
nearlydoubles, to 1.8 billion. To consider that prospect is to
court despair.
</P>
<P>
   Just visible through the gloom is Kerala, a green and languid
state on the southwest coast, where literacy even among females is
90 percent, education is compulsory, health care is free, and
infant mortality rates are 12 per 1,000, compared with 85 per 1,000
in Uttar Pradesh. Since 1957, with some interruptions, Kerala has
had a democratically elected communist state government that
nonetheless exists with vigorous religious expression, especially
among Christians, and a bustling economy of rubber, cashews, coir,
and, increasingly, tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that nearly a third of educated Keralites are
working abroad, mostly in Kuwait and Dubai. So-called ``Gulf
houses'' are springing up amid the palms and jasmine thanks to the
wealth returning to India from the Gulf states. Kerala reached zero
population growth 15 years before the target date set by the UN.
</P>
<P>
   Kerala is thus a laborory for the thesis that family size
naturally decreases when women are educated, children survive
infancy, and economic opportunity nurtures hope for a better life.
During a visit to the Vadavucode Community Health Center organized
by the Population Institute, a US-based nongovernmental
organization, we met Leela Yohannan, who explained that she had a
tubal ligation at the center after her second child and already
tells her daughters about the benefits of a small family.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to tell in this stew of factors which holds the
secret for Kerala: Is it the religious or political differences,
the fact that the state is a traditional matriarchy, or the system
of industry cooperatives and strong local ``panchayats,'' or
district councils, that make Kerala easier to organize? Officials
cannot hope to replicate Kerala's success until they figure this
out, but free compulsory education for boys and girls alike would
be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   There is a political conundrum as well; in a democracy, states
like Kerala that have stable populations lose out against the
growing states. And India itself is not above rattling one billion
sabers against its enemies. In recent border clashes with Pakistan
the government in New Delhi ran patriotic ads saluting India as
``100 Crore strong.''
</P>
<P>
   India will need to reconcile these competing imperatives in
favor of a sustainable population or it will lose power in the
world despite its nuclear capacity and its grwg middle class.
Mohandas Gandhi said poverty is the worst form of violence. Surely
the father of his country would not support creating more savagery
on such a scale.

   In addition to Head, the authors of the Science paper are Harald
Hiesinger, Mikhail Ivanov, Mikhail Kreslavsky, Stephen Pratt and
Bradley Thomson. Ivanov and Kreslavsky also have posts at,
respectively, the Vernadsky Institute of the Russian Academy of
Sciences and the Kharkov Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, while praising the new findings, said further
evidence was needed. Michael Carr, a planetary geologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey and author of ``Water on Mars'' (Oxford,
1996), said he particularly admired the evidence of wave-pounded
terraces, which he called very convincing. But he questioned some
of the team's imagery interpretations, like their conclusions about
the depth of ground ice or water, and the proposed edges of the
putative sea.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that further searches for ocean terraces, based on
the surveyor's altimetry data, could prove conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Head suggested that further research might also include an
analysis of meteorites from Mars and samples from landing sites on
the red planet, which could be checked for the presence of salts
that might be related to an ancient ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy,'' he said, ``is that something this important
is worth a lot of my research time.''  &QL;

 &HT;    ROGUE NATIONS SAID TO RECRUIT FORMER SOVIET WEAPONS EXPERTS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Developed countries have failed to block efforts by
rogue nations and terrorists to recruit chemical and biological
warfare scientists in the former Soviet Union, a weapons
proliferation expert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than seven years after the Soviet collapse, no one in the
U.S. or Russian governments seems to even know the identities of
scientists whose brains hold key information on how to build and
use chemical and biological weapons, said Amy E. Smithson.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``conservatively'' estimated to number more than 10,000
persons, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on a recent tour of the sprawling network of chemical
and biological weapons labs in Russia and other former Soviet
states, Smithson said scientists confirmed to her that some of
their former colleagues had left to work in Iran, Iraq and North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   She added that no one knows if others are ``moonlighting by
modem'' _ using computer networks to transfer critical facts across
borders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. leaders have known since the collapse of the Soviet Union
that suddenly impoverished weapons scientists likely would be
recruited for their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festering concerns of U.S. leaders have not yet translated
into meaningful resources to address the chemical and biological
brain drain threat,'' said Smithson, who works for the Stimson
Center, a national security analysis group.
</P>
<P>
   Financial research support and joint commercial ventures with
U.S. companies have been the chief means of keeping the chemical
and biological weapons experts in their laboratories, working on
peaceful projects.
</P>
<P>
   But these grants -- from the United States, the European Union
and Japan _ have been ``glaringly insufficient,'' Smithson said.
</P>
<P>
   She recommended ``at least doubling'' funding of collaborative
research grants for former biological weaponeers and ``at least
tripling'' the grant support of former chemical weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cost of those increased expenditures, about $19
million year, would be only about seven one-thousandths of 1
percent of the annual Pentagon budget, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, Russia must ``clean its own house'' and
get rid of those who are determined to maintain the Cold War
practice of developing these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ounce of prevention, applied via collaborative research
grants, security enhancements and training programs to steer the
weapons institutes toward commercial self-sufficiency, could
short-circuit biological and chemical weapons proliferation,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Smithson's report, entitled ``Toxic Archipelago:
Preventing Proliferation from Former Soviet Chemical and Biological
Weapons Complexes,'' can be downloaded from the Stimson Center's
Internet site, www.stimson.org.

   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign poliesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RELIGIOUS FAITHFUL STUNNED AT PRIESTS' QUESTIONING
EXISTENCE OF INDIAN MESSENGER OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE
 &HT;    (1200&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's one of the most fundamental, beloved stories
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1531, during the Spanish Conquest, a brown-skinned,
Aztec-speaking Virgin Mary is said to have appeared before an
Indian peasant named Juan Diego. The Virgin who became known as
Guadalupe asked Diego to build a church on the site where she
appeared, and to prove her miraculous apparition she left an
imprint of herself on Diego's cloak for him to show to Spanish
priests.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, this story has nurtured Mexicans' strong faith in
the Catholic Church as well as Mexican and Mexican-American pride
in their indigenous heritage. But just as Mexicans prepared to
celebrate the apparition of their patron saint 468 years ago this
Sunday, the country was stunned to discover some of their own
priests doubt the miracle ever occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the three Mexican priests _ all of whom have worked at
the Virgin's basilica here _ wrote a letter to the Vatican in
September objecting to an effort to make Juan Diego a saint. They
say that so far no requisite proof has been produced to confirm
that the Indian was a real person.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has thrown canonization for Diego into question and
is testing the strength of faith in Mexico, the second largest
Catholic country in the world and a naiton vital to the Vatican's
influence in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said anything about this to the people before, and we
never intended to hurt anyone,'' said Carlos Warnholtz, who
ministers at the Virgin of Guadalupe Basilica and signed the
letter, which was supposed to be confidential but was leaked to a
reporter in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Upset because some top church officials have ordered the three
to repent, Warnholtz said the dissident priests embrace the
``tender, beautiful and very Indian story'' of the Virgin's
appearance. But without proof of Juan Diego's existence they regard
the encounter as a symbolic legend that helped convert Mexico's
Indians, who _ not coincidently _ worshipped the Aztec mother
goddess Tonanztin on the same hill where the Virgin appeared to
Juan Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The legend was fueled by priests eager to win converts and
evolved over the centuries into a cult of worship for the Virgin
that is valid, Warnholtz said. But that doesn't mean it merits
canonization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have doubts in the tradition,'' he said. ``But where
is the proof? Where are Juan Diego's remains? Where is his tomb?
</P>
<P>
   At Mexico City's massive Virgin of Guadalupe Basilica, where as
many as 6 million were expected to pour in from all parts of Mexico
for Sunday's fiesta, pilgrims appeared disturbed by the priests'
doubts but unshaken in their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, the second most visited shrine in the
Catholic world, they gazed with reverence at the cactus fiber cloak
Diego supposedly wore with the miraculous image of the Virgin. The
cloak hangs high on a wall inside a glass case.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Medina, a 30-year-old Mexico City mother, carried her own
statue of the Virgin to the church to be blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to believe until Juan Diego and the Virgin
come and tell us not to believe,'' she said indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Soriano, 23, who sells corn cakes outside the church, said
of the priests, ``If they don't believe, why do they work here?''
</P>
<P>
   Candida Portilla, a Veracruz state construction worker, was
equally firm in his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He existed and he still exists in our hearts,'' Portilla said
of Juan Diego, grimacing and sweating with pain as he showed his
devotion by hobbling toward the church on his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Believer Antonia Garcia, a Mexico City housewife who visits the
shrine whenever she needs comfort, said, ``Juan Diego was very
important. The Virgin doesn't just appear to just anyone. She chose
him because he was one of the humble. That was a message.''
</P>
<P>
   When the story about the internal church squabble over Juan
Diego surfaced in Mexico last week, the press and radio shows
gobbled it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope last visited Mexico in January and repeatedly expressed
veneration for the dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe, announcing
that she should be a symbol for evangelization throughout the
Americas. The pope beatified Diego in 1990, a step that must be
taken before a candidate can be considered for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Top church officials here, who reportedly hope to see Diego
canonized next year, were swift and harsh in their condemnation of
the dissident priests' opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The letter's primary author was Guillermo Schulenburg, 83, who
is now retired but for 33 years served as abbot of the Virgin's
basilica. Three years ago, Schulenburg angered Catholics here when
he called the apparition of the Virgin ``a symbol, not reality'' in
a Catholic publication. He was retired shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Norberto Rivera, Cardinal Primate of Mexico, said
Schulenburg was effectively excommunicating himself by questioning
the canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Onesimo Cepeda, a church spokesman, told a newspaper,
``This is what you might expect of someone older than 80. Logically
all old people become a bit capricious and lose lucidity in their
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Papal Nuncio Justo Muller, the Vatican's ambassador here, called
for Schulenburg to ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Muller also said Schulenburg had ``no right''
to his opinion because he owns several houses and lives in
excessive luxury. The retired Mexican priest has avoided the press
since the squabble erupted into the public light.
</P>
<P>
   Warnholtz said he and another priest who also works at the
basilica haven't been fired or pressured so far to leave their
posts. ``We didn't commit a crime or a sin by expressing our
doubts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church allows for confidential debate over naming saints,
Warnholtz said, and since it requires ``scientific'' proof of a
candidate's existence the priests felt it was their duty to point
out shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Warnholtz said his doubts were heightened when he saw the image
of the Virgin on Juan Diego's cloak up close in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it's supernatural. But I've seen it and it is a
painting,'' he said. ``We agree, though, that it is mystical
because it remains so well-preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnholtz acknowledged that many saints in the Middle Ages were
named without sufficient proof they existed, including Saint
George, the legendary dragon slayer and patron saint of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the modern world is more critical,'' he said and the
church should protect its reputation by following its own more
modern, strict standards.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Guerrero, a priest who spent four years in Rome
promoting sainthood for Diego, said worshippers he knows burst into
tears and were deeply wounded when they heard about the priests'
letter.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, too, that hundreds of pounds of documents he
presented to the Vatican add up to adequate historical record of
Diego's existence. Not long ago, he said, a piece of paper was
discovered in an archive with Diego's Aztec name on it and a
certification of his death in 1548.
</P>
<P>
   The document bears the authenticated signature of a famous
priest who ministered to Indians at the time, Guerrero said.
Apparently, however, there are disagreements over the authenticity
of the document, the cloak and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero said he fully accepts that it was no accident that the
Virgin supposedly appeared on the same site where the Indians
worshipped their mother goddess.
</P>
<P>
   ``God adapted to that by sending his mother to be the
evangelizer,'' he said. ``It was an indispensable way to show the
Indians that the Christian faith was for them.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Vietmeier, director of the Center for Religious Studies
here, said he thinks that the dispute over Juan Diego is rooted in
power struggles within the Mexican church and the Vatican. Someone
leaked the priests' confidential letter to the press, but no one is
saying who or exactly why, except to suggest it was to harm
Schulenburg.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain, Vietmeier said. The fight has touched
a popular nerve because of the Virgin of Guadalupe's powerful image
unifying Mexico's European and Indian heritage, which violently
collided with the Spanish Conquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of Mexico is of a people conquered, violated,''
Vietmeier said. ``Yet they recovered their dignity through their
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence fighters in the 19th century went to battle against
the Spanish carrying banners of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants
marched for the rights of Hispanic farmworkers in the 1960s
carrying images of the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Juan Diego in plays celebrating the Virgin is an honored
role for little Mexican boys, who paint on mustaches and don cloaks
like Juan Diego's.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mexican rock musicians have penned odes to the Virgin
because she is a symbol of national hope as much as religious
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Warnholtz, ``We don't have to believe in
private apparitions of the Virgin until the Pope says we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Pope canonizes Juan Diego,'' he said, ``then we will
have to accept it. He will be giving us the gift of an Indian saint
whose example we can follow.''

LAWLESS IN SEATTLE: A TALE FROM THE FRONT LINES
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Ann Lockhart never in her 53 years imagined that she would
one day find herself in the middle of one of the biggest news
stories to hit the United States in the waning days of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A grandmother of 12 who cares for an 80-year-old mother-in-law
in her home in Yakima, Wash., Lockhart volunteers what free time
she has to help glean local orchards and farms for area food banks
and assist in Habitat for Humanity and Union Gospel Mission
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there she was on Nov. 30, standing at Pike Street and Third
Avenue in downtown Seattle, when the black-hooded anarchists
arrived to disrupt what had been peaceful civil disobedience
against the World Trade Organization conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's reason for being among the throng of protesters
raising a din outside the city's convention center wasn't sea
turtles or labor standards or worldwide minimum wages, although she
said the stories about working conditions for children in some
countries had tears streaming down the face of her 26-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, Lockhart's issue was U.S. sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a wife, mother and grandmother, Lockhart is
a captain in the Yakima County Militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really involved in world or global relationships
until I read about Bob Dole saying back in '94 or '95 that he did
everything he possibly could to save this nation's sovereignty
during GATT negotiations,'' Lockhart said in a telephone interview
last week. ``That got my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``militia'' in Washington state apparently isn't the
indictment for lunacy that it has become in other parts of the
country. Lockhart said her group works in cooperation with the
local parks and recreation department to hold public awareness
classes on preparedness, constitutional rights and firearm safety.
They have a good working relationship with the Sheriff's Department
_ one deputy is even a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love our country and want to help keep it free,'' Lockhart
said. ``It's a shame the term has become so negative. After all,
our founding fathers were militiamen.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail from like-minded people alerted Lockhart to the planned
protests during the WTO convention, so, gas mask in hand, she and
eight members of the militia loaded up in a van and headed into
town that Tuesday morning. What better way to exercise one's First
Amendment rights than to peaceably protest what they believe is
America trading away its rights?
</P>
<P>
   ``The gathering at the stadium was made up of a broad spectrum
of people,'' she said. ``The Communist party, China Out of Tibet
protesters, the Farmers Union and labor groups. For two hours we
listened to speakers from Europe, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Africa and
Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Around noon, more than 50,000 protesters began their march
downtown. Lockhart said she was unaware that other people were
already at the convention center, linked arm in arm around the
building to block entry by delegates from the WTO's 135 member
nations.
</P>
<P>
   As they neared Pike Place Market, Lockhart said she could hear
concussion grenades several blocks away. Once at the market, the
newly arrived protesters saw windows bashed out and shattered eggs
covering the exterior of the Nike building. Things had turned
nasty.
</P>
<P>
   About 2:30 p.m. _ with nary a police officer in sight, Lockhart
said _ a group of athletically built men marched up Pike in
formation, banging on drums. Their heads covered in black hoods,
the men turned over garbage bins and set the spilled contents on
fire, all the while shouting profanities.
</P>
<P>
   The anarchists had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't about to intervene because we didn't know what they
might do to us,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after the masked men had left the area that the
police showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All around me were college-aged students sitting and talking
about people power,'' she said. ``Without provocation, with no
signs of trouble, the police used concussion grenades, rubber
bullets and tear gas on the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There were no acts of
vandalism, no stealing. Just young people with no protection being
fired on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart admits that the street cops were caught in a hot spot,
having to follow orders from ``higher up,'' but the use of pepper
spray, tear gas and rubber bullets on citizens horrified her.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my position, what I saw, there was no attempt to make
peaceable arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement this week that Seattle Police Chief Norm
Stamper plans to step down from the job in March underscores
Lockhart's assessment of the situation: His department did not
handle the demonstrations well at all.
</P>
<P>
   So what will Lockhart do now that the gas has drifted away from
Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those dangerous militia activities,'' she said with a
chuckle, ``cracking nuts.''

SOCIAL SECURITY AND CLINTON: HE'S AT IT AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no end to Bill Clinton's chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that after all this time, Clinton would occasionally
lapse into forthrightness _ for variety's sake, if nothing else. No
such luck. The president's aversion to the truth _ and his audacity
in disseminating deception _ is constant and consuming.
</P>
<P>
   It should not have come as a surprise, then, when Clinton looked
America straight in its collective eye Wednesday and declared
himself ``profoundly disappointed'' that nothing was done this year
to secure the long-term viability of Social Security. He said this
as if the preservation of Social Security were an issue floating
somewhere in the stratosphere, far beyond the reach of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The comment came at the end of his response to a question posed
by a reporter during a rare presidential news conference:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're ending a tumultuous year that began with impeachment
and that closed with tear gas in Seattle; could you tell us what
you're proudest of this year and what events or accomplishments of
yours that you're the least proud of?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nearly broke his arm patting himself on the back for
legislative and foreign policy achievements ranging from money for
teachers and cops to his war in Kosovo. When he got to the ``least
proud'' part of the question, needless to say, he broke the other
arm tossing blame at Republican members of Congress for failing to
embrace his entire domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Last, but not least, he got around to Social Security:
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm profoundly disappointed that we still haven't done
anything to take the life of Social Security out beyond the baby
boom generation and extend the life of Medicare and add a
prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter immediately saw that something was awry in
Clinton's assessment of the Social Security problem. She reminded
the president that he hadn't even offered a proposal for protecting
the nation's most cherished entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   His response to the follow-up question was classic:
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them ... first of all, I asked them ... there's no
point in putting forward ... look, I tried it the other way; with
health care. I put forward a plan. And everybody said you put
forward a ... I remember Sen. Dole saying you put forward your plan
and I'll put forward my plan and we'll get together and we'll agree
and we'll pass a plan ... and, uh, so, you know, I've had
experience with that ... that didn't work out too well. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, he did put forward a plan to use interest
savings from paying down the national debt to bolster Social
Security, and the Republicans wouldn't go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   So. Clinton didn't offer a comprehensive plan to save Social
Security because Congress shot down the health-care plan he
proposed way back in 1993. Is this the guy who is famous for his
perseverance?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that legendary persistence only comes into play when
Clinton's personal political survival is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempt to wash his hands of the Social Security
problem is infuriating for the obvious reason that his lack of
involvement ensures that the problem won't be solved any time soon.
Adding insult to injury, though, is the mind-boggling hypocrisy of
a politician who portrays himself as the guardian of Social
Security when he's running for election and then makes no effort
whatsoever to guard it once the election is over.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, too, because Clinton really could have been the
savior of Social Security if he'd been willing to expend some
political capital after winning re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving Social Security, as Clinton and every other
politician knows, will require unpopular choices and considerable
sacrifice by the American people. A Democratic president who
claimed to feel our pain might have been able to sell those choices
and sacrifices to the public.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't the first president to shrink from the challenge, of
course, and he probably won't be the last. But he at least ought to
have the decency to tell the truth about his failure.
</P>

TOM HANKS, OUR GENERATION'S JIMMY STEWART IS STILL BEST WHEN HE
SURPRISES US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Tom Hanks this generation's Jimmy Stewart? When he was
younger, he had a lean ranginess like Stewart; he was as slender as
a question mark. Like Stewart, audiences seem to be eager to
overlook his failures, movies like ``Bonfire of the Vanities,''
where he's so miscast that he disappears. Or a whole stretch of
movies such as ``Every Time We Say Goodbye'' and ``Nothing in
Common'' and ``Dragnet.'' And like Stewart did for most of his
career, Hanks is now settling into the role of elder statesman
whose core of common-sense decency can be seen in everything he
does.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was younger, he threw off sparks in a way that
Stewart never did. One of Hanks' best performances came in the 1984
raunch-comedy ``Bachelor Party,'' where he does everything _
including burst into song _ to keep the movie alive. It's hard to
imagine Stewart, even in his youngest days, triumphing over an
underwritten ``Animal House'' rip-off by peppering the picture with
gleeful riffs. It's as if he's surviving the cinematic equivalent
of a hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hanks' charm is that he may be the most generous actor
of his generation. He may be more engaging when he has to work off
another actor _ or, as in the case of ``Turner &AMP; Hooch,'' another
species _ than any other performer. Often, stars either tend to
look for a way to upstage other actors when doing ensemble work, or
submerge themselves so deeply that they no longer exist. In the
big-cast dramas ``Apollo 13,'' ``Saving Private Ryan'' and his
newest, ``The Green Mile,'' Hanks underplays and yet clearly pays
attention to the other actors.
</P>
<P>
   The boy/man phase of his career, when his whiny voice spiraled
into the high registers, was tremendously enjoyable. His work
during this period includes his stint on the TV series ``Bosom
Buddies'' as well the fantasy comedy ``Splash'' and, of course, the
definition of boy/man roles, ``Big,'' for which he won his first
Oscar nomination in 1988. And his gift for playing off other actors
was first realized in ``Splash,'' in which he and the late John
Candy play brothers. Candy is all appetite and Hanks the calmer,
more rational of the two until he meets his dream mermaid. Then,
he's transformed into a pleasure machine himself, bouncing off the
walls with happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks was so likable during this period because he got the
chance to show off an almost lethal smart-aleck quickness. In fact,
Bob Hope comes to mind more than Jimmy Stewart. Hanks, with his
long jaw and suggestion of a ski-jump nose, even resembles Hope a
bit. And he's moved into a relaxed self-confidence very close to
Hope, though with a commitment to acting that Hope never showed an
interest in developing.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' smart-mouthed impetuousness is gone now. And it would
probably be rather untoward for him to continue along that line.
Comedy releases something in him, though. In ``Punchline,'' where
he plays a struggling stand-up comedian with a restless, angry
streak, he mutters a throwaway line about a bouncer with one of
those carved-out-of-stone pompadours _ ``Nice hair'' _ that sums up
the character perfectly. Even more so than when he pours on the
juice for the rest of the picture. His real talent is for the
gesture, the moment that gives an insight into his character. Hanks
can provide the small, telling moment that lingers after the rest
of the picture has drifted out of your memory.
</P>
<P>
   He's not as insubstantial physically anymore, and he uses his
presence judiciously. In the only high point of the forgettable
``You've Got Mail,'' he turns on the charm to seduce a hostile
cashier into letting Meg Ryan through an express line. He's all
polish and masterful cool here; this is a grown man showing that he
knows exactly what his place is in the world, and when to employ
the resources at his command.
</P>
<P>
   He's similarly composed in ``Ryan'' and ``Apollo 13,'' hunkering
down to give adult, movie-star performances. In his more
well-regarded dramatic roles, his need to please can make him come
off as bland, although he still shows enough skill to move an
audience in the way he wants.
</P>
<P>
   He has cut back on the energy, which he now works up for
talk-show appearances. When he isn't acting like he's running for
office, his comic reflexes can still get the best of him _
thankfully. On a recent ``Today'' show appearance, he was asked
about the beard he's grooming for an upcoming movie. ``Just
something I'm working up for all the Stonewall Jackson movies
they're doing for TNT,'' he said, a remark that even seemed to
surprise him slightly. And that's still when Tom Hanks has the most
to offer, when he has caught others _ and himself _ off-guard.

GIVING THE HORROR KING HIS DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casual readers who associate Stephen King only with the grisly
likes of ``The Shining'' and ``Cujo'' will be surprised when they
see ``The Green Mile,'' which is based on a King novella.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile's'' emphasis is on people _ warmblooded
characters drive the story instead of lurking, scaly monsters
dribbling blood from munching on recent victims. In fact, ``The
Green Mile,'' and a surprising number of other King titles,
represents a softer, more humane approach to storytelling that may
well identify King to future generations far more than his gorier
tales.
</P>
<P>
   This trend really began in 1982, when Viking published
``Different Seasons,'' a collection of four King novellas. Since
1974, when ``Carrie'' hit bookstore shelves, King had established
himself as America's favorite horror writer, although not a writer
of ``quality'' literature.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in ``Different Seasons,'' story emphasis shifted from the
stomach-churning occult to more human quirks. There were still
bodies discovered in strange places, but story protagonists were
identifiable as real people in a way Carrie, for instance, never
was. In fact, a popular movie, ``Stand by Me,'' was based on ``The
Body'' from ``Different Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Stephen King has defied categorization. Since
``Carrie,'' he has written 27 novels under his real name, another
six as ``Richard Bachman,'' and 19 collections of short stories,
essays or singly published novellas. Such feverish output
guarantees a certain literary unevenness, and when King is sloppy
(''Insomnia,'' especially) the results can be atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   The signal King sent with ``Different Seasons,'' though, has
been followed by several books that, along with telling good
stories, capture a sense of modern-day America. Perhaps better than
any other mega-selling author, many of King's characters genuinely
reflect ``us.'' In ``Hearts in Atlantis,'' for instance, his latest
novel, King uses wonderfully tiny elements of ordinary American
lives _ silly top 10 songs like ``Incense and Peppermints,'' a
boy's natural nervousness reading ``The Lord of the Flies'' for the
first time _ as well as epochal events like the Vietnam War _ to
create a sense of time and place that is dead-on. ``The Green
Mile,'' in both print and on film, is more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   King will never win a Pulitzer Prize _ critics still harbor too
many ``Carrie''-era grudges for that. But his overall body of work,
considered objectively by scholars of the next generation, may well
be evaluated as a lot more important, and lasting, than most of us
currently realize.

INSURER OFFERS DISCOUNT PROGRAM FOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Michael Wayne of the Center for Natural Wellness
in Albany has a growing acupuncture practice but he could always
use more business.
</P>
<P>
   So he is willing to pay for the privilege of participating in a
new program by Blue Shield of Northeastern New York that will offer
member discounts on everything from acupuncture to personal
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the discount will be picked up by the providers
themselves in exchange for the benefit of being part of Blue
Shield's network with access to more than 100,000 members in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of acupuncture, the discount amounts to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That means Wayne will reduce the cost of a regular visit from
$60 to $45 for any Blue Shield members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure it can't hurt to be part of it,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Shield unveiled details of its new program earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the health insurance company hope the new
discounts will appeal to a growing number of people who are
interested in alternative therapies. According to recent survey by
the Journal of American Medicine, 42 percent of adults used some
form of alternative medicine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it would be a very positive incentive for people,''
said Dr. Cynthia Ambrese, Blue Shield's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Shield members who want to take advantage of the discounts
will make appointments directly with practitioners. The savings
include 25 percent for acupuncture and massage therapies, 15
percent for personal trainers, fitness clubs and on healthy meals
from certain restaurants.

POLL GIVES SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR EDGE OVER CHALLENGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown has a comfortable lead over
Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano heading into Tuesday's
run-off election, according to a poll released Friday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brown's message that he is the best leader to shepherd San
Francisco's red-hot economy seems to be trumping his opponent's
message of open, honest government.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV survey showed that 48
percent of likely voters support the incumbent, while 34 percent
favor Ammiano, who staged an electoral coup last month by finishing
second with a write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed that more people who supported Brown's
opponents in the Nov. 2 general election _ former Mayor Frank
Jordan and Clint Reilly _ now will vote for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and Ammiano's supporters say the election could be
much closer because the poll did not reach some of the groups drawn
to the supervisor's maverick campaign _ new, young and occasional
voters.
</P>
<P>
   While those surveyed see Ammiano as honest, principled and more
understanding of their everyday concerns, they question his
leadership and ability to sustain the economy and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano ``is seen as a kind of rabble-rouser, a man of great
integrity, but someone who could rock the boat in good economic
times,'' said Del Ali, pollster with Research 2000 of Rockville,
Md., which conducted the random telephone poll of 630 registered
city voters Monday through Wednesday. The margin of error is plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor won about 39 percent of the vote in the Nov. 2 general
election. Ammiano, who joined the race as a write-in candidate
three weeks before the election, finished second with more than 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though a recent Newsweek article described Brown as ``in the
race of his life,'' the new poll shows the powerful former state
Assembly speaker with solid support in the race. An Examiner/KTVU
survey of 627 people conducted Nov. 9-11 showed Brown with a
10-percentage point advantage, at 43 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although both men are Democrats, Brown is viewed as more
moderate and more pro-business than Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   The new Examiner/KTVU poll shows more than half of those
surveyed view Brown as arrogant, but the mayor has gained leverage
over his opponent in what have become the key issues of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed were much more likely to trust Brown to manage
the city's economy and budget, spur development and create jobs.
Forty-four percent said Brown would provide the ``best leadership''
for San Francisco, compared with 30 percent for Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues of public transportation, homelessness and
affordable housing _ problems Ammiano had hoped would fuel his
effort to topple Brown's bid for a second four-year term _
respondents were largely split over which candidate would do a
better job.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano had the edge on integrity, which he has made a top
issue. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed said they believe
Ammiano would do a better job of instilling honesty and integrity
at City Hall, compared with 34 percent for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents also thought the challenger would do a better job in
generating affordable housing than the mayor would, by a margin of
39 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner/KTVU poll surveyed registered voters who said they
vote ``always'' or ``most of the time'' in city elections. About 94
percent of those surveyed said they had voted in the Nov. 2
election.

Falcons media guide as head coach Dan Reeves' ``special''
assistant. In fact, he has been that since the 1950s, when he
coached the young Reeves at the University of South Carolina. It
began a relationship that would last a lifetime. Bass, who also
coached in the WFL, spent 10 years with Reeves in Denver, then
returned home to South Carolina to ``play out the string.'' He was
floundering three years ago, when Reeves asked him to come work
with the Falcons in Suwanee. So each football season, Bass moves
into the Suwanee Inn and follows Reeves around the Falcons training
facility, charting plays and doing odd jobs. And both men are
better off because of it. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta

BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR IN `THE RUBINSTEIN COLLECTION' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A caress can sometimes accompany the chill of death. Or at least
so it seemed when I first heard Arthur Rubinstein play. It was some
30 years ago; the pianist was in his 80s and said to be frail. And
the presence of Chopin's Sonata No. 2 on the program, with its
familiar ``Funeral March,'' did not lighten concerns that he might
never be heard again. In fact when he began that often hackneyed
march (linked by popular culture with the words ``pray for the dead
and the dead will pray for you''), it seemed as if a shroud had
been cast over the audience. A swift, silent intake of breath was
held almost without exhale until the movement's final dying chord.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of that dirge still remains in the porches of my ears.
Rubinstein was sitting upright, his face stonily impassive. But his
hands, having lived with the nuances of hammers and felt and ivory
as long as any human ever had, molded each chord's overtones,
creating otherworldly vibrations. The sound was like death's shadow
passing overhead, its cold breath somehow mixed with sensuous
affection. I have not heard its like since.
</P>
<P>
   But that sound has been coming to mind again as I have immersed
myself in ``The Rubinstein Collection,'' the pianist's complete
recorded legacy, just released by BMG classics in a sumptuously
produced set of 94 compact discs containing 706 recordings of 347
compositions (retailing at about $1,300). They range from the first
78s he made in the 1920s when he was already in his 40s, to his
final, nearly nonagenarian meditations. It is an extraordinary
testament, its remastered sound bringing Rubinstein's own sonic
mastery to life. And now that recording companies have abandoned
such long-term commitments and have finished plundering their
vaults of such riches, this set may also be one of the last
testaments to an era of Old Worldly pianism, cultivated and
confident in its mastery.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting, in fact, to linger over each achievement: the
Franck Violin Sonata, perhaps, recorded in 1937 with Heifetz, or an
electrifying Chopin Polonaise recorded live at a 1964 Moscow
concert and never before released; the two lilting sets of Chopin's
Mazurkas, perhaps, or the autumnal grace of late Rubinstein playing
late Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   Such detail, though, can wait for another time. Right now, I am
swept away by the set's preternatural energy. The quantity, sonic
beauty and grandeur of these recordings (and even their occasional
sloppiness, fragmentation and frailty) are expressions of a life
force. The playing can seem so natural that it is startling how
different it is from much of this century's pianism. Rubinstein was
not preoccupied with structural drama (like Rudolf Serkin or Artur
Schnabel), or limpid tone color (like Walter Gieseking), or poetic
rubato (like Alfred Cortot) or ecstatic excavation (like Glenn
Gould).
</P>
<P>
   He was, instead, preoccupied with the sensuous power of lived
experience. For Rubinstein, music was lived through, not observed
or dissected. It was as if he were himself always startled and
entranced at the course of its unfolding. This is why his concert
performances, however flawed, have long seemed the apotheosis of
his art (some are offered in this set). Music comes, it speaks and
then is gone, relished in its presence, honored in its passing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk, of course, in this kind of immediacy.
Rubinstein had an almost childlike devotion to the pursuit of
pleasure. ``I loved women, cards and brandy too much,'' he once
said of his youth, ``and I almost never practiced.'' This might
have turned Rubinstein into a salon pianist, a highbrow version of
Eddie Duchin, which is what his memoirs suggest with their tales of
love affairs and formal dinners with faded European royalty. ``Do
you know what I like best?'' he said to a Madrid interviewer in
1919. ``To make a collection of happy moments, eternities, without
ever stopping, so that they could replace the moments of
disappointment...I would like to take leave of every woman and of
every friend at the highest moment of affection, and never wait
until the disenchantment comes.''
</P>
<P>
   But if his music had remained at this level _ a collection of
happy moments punctuated by abandonments _ it would hardly be worth
hearing. Is it possible instead that the power of Rubinstein's
playing later in his life comes from his having tempered this
devotion to sensation with an almost tragic understanding of its
limitations? For how can a string of happy eternities ever satisfy
if they are always scarred by transience? Yet how can they be
abandoned when the desire for them is so strong? Perhaps it is only
in music that the pleasures of experience and the sorrows over
their passing can be fully reconciled: the sybarite is also a
tragedian. This spirit haunts Rubinstein's best Chopin recordings,
which mix immediacy and regret, pleasure and melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   That tension is also intertwined with another memory I cherish
of Rubinstein, this one from his last New York concert, in March
1976 at Carnegie Hall. The nearly blind 89-year-old strode
purposefully to the keyboard and played with voluptuous intensity.
But there was no doubt that he would never be seen on stage again.
After a series of encores, Rubinstein, declining demands for more,
shook his head at the cheering audience and, with a sigh of
resignation, held up his hands as if displaying their frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Still no one left, and a roar erupted from the hall's belly.
Rubinstein raised yet again his broad hands and spread his fingers.
Silence fell. ``You listened with marvelous affection for me,'' he
said of his decades of concerts at the hall. ``I love you.'' And
the cries came back, ``We love you!'' Rubinstein put his hands to
his heart, sadly smiled and extended them to his listeners, the
instruments of his music-making offered in a gesture of farewell.
Then he left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   And thus did mortality merge with pleasure and the shadow of
death pass with a caress.

Most of their students are in their 20s and 30s, a few of them men.

either. Membership in the Knitting Guild of America has increased

   MRSCLINTON-GALA (New York) _ One of the week's big gala was the

which was a benefit for the Municipal Art Society of New York, a
preservation group whose patrons _ Anne Bass, Veronica Hearst,
Cecile Zilkha and Marie-Josee Kravis, among others _ are hardly
what anyone would call slouches. But with so much else going on,
the rich food, couture dresses that cost $50,000 and then some, not

READY TO HANG YOURSELF WITH CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounded like a great idea at the time: We could put up a
Christmas tree and not have to deal with all those lights.
Stringing Christmas lights, as you probably know, is the reason
some people are hopeful Y2K disasters DO occur. It means we won't
have to worry about taking them down.
</P>
<P>
   In many houses, Christmas lights are responsible for provoking
colorful phrases, with ``Bah humbug'' being about the only one that
can be printed in a newspaper. They are the acid test of a
marriage: Often, the children are crying, the phone is ringing, the
dog is barking and the Cowboys are driving for the game-winning
touchdown when the lights are being strung. Joy to the world,
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   If your Christmas lights are like mine (and I believe all lights
are created equal), they either magically tangle during the summer
or become entwined when you're stringing them on the tree, which
itself requires contorting your body like a 12-year-old gymnast.
When the ordeal is over, you flip a switch and invariably one of
the strands that worked when they were tested earlier has suffered
a catastrophic malfunction. Honey, I fried the tree.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine my euphoria upon learning that our local
Christmas store (which sells pool supplies and flotation devices
most of the year), would string the lights on our new 9-foot
artificial tree for a mere sum of $294. Now, it did occur to me
that this was cheating (not to mention expensive) and not exactly
in the spirit of the season, but I felt more in tune with the times
after learning this store alone had pre-lighted more than 100
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I also remember ranting one morning after spying a small
homemade sign at an intersection that read, ``Will hang X-Mas
lights. Call ...'' And I was troubled watching a neighbor direct
two men who are not members of his immediate family setting up his
elaborate light display, which took the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the revelation that students at Martin High
School in Arlington, Texas _ members of the Key Club _ rent
themselves out to hang lights and decorate trees, with proceeds
going to charity.
</P>
<P>
   That's very noble, but I began wondering, what's up with that?
Does anyone do anything themselves during the holiday season? Are
all those shoppers in the malls on retainer?
</P>
<P>
   This trend may be the single biggest reason why it looks as if
there are more and more lights on people's houses this season. They
are simply hiring others to live their nightmare. There are entire
neighborhoods glowing like Chernobyl. And while icicle lights are
the rage, some people are lining their driveways and lawns with
runway lights, lending an aesthetically nonpleasing D/FW Airport
aura to the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   This next bit of information also explains the phenomenon.
According to Ray Granado, a spokesman for TXU, Christmas lights are
more energy-efficient than ever. A string of 100 miniature lights
is the equivalent of a 50-watt light bulb and costs only 45 cents a
month on your utility bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, you can run four times as many lights at half the
cost,'' Granado says.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is great news for would-be Clark Griswolds. You can
celebrate the holiday tradition without actually taking part in any
of it. And Ray Granado's words echoed in my ears when the
Christmas-store guy says that we need 28 sets of lights on our new
artificial 9-foot tree; more lights, I'm guessing, than are strung
on the tree in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But why not go for it? A complete stranger is doing all the
work. It took him 10 hours, he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Another complete stranger from the Christmas storewill come to your house to ``set up your tree'' for another mere
sum of between $50 and $75. And you don't even have to leave him
cookies and milk, like you do the big fella in the red suit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't recommend that people with small children abandon
the time-honored tradition of this festive season: Go ahead and
decorate the tree and the house yourself and by all means, let the
kids help. Stress is as much a part of the holiday season as
eggnog, sugar cookies and mistletoe.
</P>
<P>
   But with two boys in college, I felt we could be cut some slack.
Until, that is, we arrived home with our new artificial 9-foot
tree. It came in four sections _ like an Atlas booster _ each
weighing more than I really cared to lift. There were three
extension cords leading from those 28 sets of pre-strung lights,
but no written instructions about how they were to be plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   So we did it by trial and error. And blew out two fuses in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   There must be someone I can hire to figure this out.
</P>

POLL GIVES SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR EDGE OVER CHALLENGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Subs 3rd graf, The San Francisco Examiner, to add undecided
vote; pickup: The poll.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown has a comfortable lead over
Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano heading into Tuesday's
run-off election, according to a poll released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's message that he is the best leader to shepherd San
Francisco's red-hot economy seems to be trumping his opponent's
message of open, honest government.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV survey showed that 48
percent of likely voters support the incumbent, while 34 percent
favor Ammiano, who staged an electoral coup last month by finishing
second with a write-in campaign. Eighteen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed that more people who supported Brown's
opponents in the Nov. 2 general election _ former Mayor Frank
Jordan and Clint Reilly _ now will vote for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and Ammiano's supporters say the election could be
much closer because the poll did not reach some of the groups drawn
to the supervisor's maverick campaign _ new, young and occasional
voters.
</P>
<P>
   While those surveyed see Ammiano as honest, principled and more
understanding of their everyday concerns, they question his
leadership and ability to sustain the economy and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano ``is seen as a kind of rabble-rouser, a man of great
integrity, but someone who could rock the boat in good economic
times,'' said Del Ali, pollster with Research 2000 of Rockville,
Md., which conducted the random telephone poll of 630 registered
city voters Monday through Wednesday. The margin of error is plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor won about 39 percent of the vote in the Nov. 2 general
election. Ammiano, who joined the race as a write-in candidate
three weeks before the election, finished second with more than 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though a recent Newsweek article described Brown as ``in the
race of his life,'' the new poll shows the powerful former state
Assembly speaker with solid support in the race. An Examiner/KTVU
survey of 627 people conducted Nov. 9-11 showed Brown with a
10-percentage point advantage, at 43 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although both men are Democrats, Brown is viewed as more
moderate and more pro-business than Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   The new Examiner/KTVU poll shows more than half of those
surveyed view Brown as arrogant, but the mayor has gained leverage
over his opponent in what have become the key issues of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed were much more likely to trust Brown to manage
the city's economy and budget, spur development and create jobs.
Forty-four percent said Brown would provide the ``best leadership''
for San Francisco, compared with 30 percent for Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues of public transportation, homelessness and
affordable housing _ problems Ammiano had hoped would fuel his
effort to topple Brown's bid for a second four-year term _
respondents were largely split over which candidate would do a
better job.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano had the edge on integrity, which he has made a top
issue. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed said they believe
Ammiano would do a better job of instilling honesty and integrity
at City Hall, compared with 34 percent for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents also thought the challenger would do a better job in
generating affordable housing than the mayor would, by a margin of
39 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner/KTVU poll surveyed registered voters who said they
vote ``always'' or ``most of the time'' in city elections. About 94
percent of those surveyed said they had voted in the Nov. 2
election.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the lobby of the Westside Theater the other night,
Mei Kai Chin, the chairwoman of the New York chapter of the
American College of Nurse-Midwives, smiled in greeting 17 midwives
who'd come to see ``The Vagina Monologues.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurit Kahane, 50, in a red shearling, waited in the lobby for 19
friends gathering for what she called ``a night out for married
women.''
</P>
<P>
   And 35 Hunter College students in a Sexuality Across the Life
Cycle class clustered, denim clad, in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   All three parties had come to see an off-Broadway hit that,
since it opened on Oct. 3, has acquired something of a cult
following among groups of women, who come with friends or
professional colleagues. The delegations range in size from two or
three to as many as three dozen, and they have included parties
from the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, Geraldine
Laybourne's women-oriented Oxygen Media and a bachelorette party at
which the bride-to-be was blindfolded and didn't know what she was
being taken to. (When the show's title was announced, there was a
scream.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your usual Broadway tour-bus affair,'' said Eric
Schnall, who arranges group sales at the theater, on West 43rd
Street. ``Each group is attracted to the word vagina.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluntly stated, perhaps. But that, in simplest terms, is what
the evening is about _ candid talk about a body part that is a
source of sexual pleasure as well as an object of sexual violence
and whose mere naming causes many people embarrassment. The show is
written and performed by Eve Ensler and is based on her interviews
with more than 200 women. The dozen or so monologues are by turns
humorous _ corporate lawyer turns dominatrix _ and disturbing _ a
Bosnian rape victim speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show was first performed, in 1996 at Here, a Soho
theater, it has run in Washington, London and Athens, and it was
staged by A-list celebrities at a Manhattan fund-raiser on
Valentine's Day 1998. Though not everyone falls under its spell, it
often stirs up strong reactions. Ms. Ensler is often asked to stay
and lead group discussions after performances.
</P>
<P>
   The run at the 250-seat Westside Theater, extended twice, until
Jan. 23, is selling at 96 percent of capacity _ and some nights,
the other obstructed-view 4 percent sells out as well. Group sales
generally make up 10 percent of all ticket purchases, said David
Stone, the show's producer. Other groups that have booked blocks of
seats this month include a support group for incest survivors and
women from a White Plains synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dec. 2 show, in addition to the midwives, ``married
women'' and students, there were two famous actresses, Amy Irving
and Heather Locklear, looking like sisters, both blonde and
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Dozoretz, who had organized the 19 married women, had
earlier brought a group to see Ms. Ensler's performance in
Washington. ``Eve says what we all feel but are unable to
articulate,'' said Ms. Dozoretz, a former finance chairwoman of the
Democratic National Committee. ``She touches a chord that's deep,
private and that needs to be voiced _ that's why it's so
compelling. It raises a woman's consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of my friends,'' she predicted, ``it will be
shocking, for others moving and for others eye opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kahane, an executive who lives in Manhattan, found it
daring. Taking her front-row seat, she said, ``I told my 5-year-old
daughter that I was going to see a play called `The Vagina
Monologues' and she said, `Mommy, don't be silly, they don't show
that on the stage.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lights dimmed. Ms. Ensler, 46, appeared barefoot in a black
spaghetti-strap dress, her dark hair cut in a bob. ``I was worried
about vaginas,'' she began, acknowledging the sqeamishness that she
too felt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ensler clearly sees herself on a crusade to banish the shame
some women feel about their bodies and sexuality, as well as to
raise awareness about the effects of sexual abuse. If in interviews
she talks of the show in terms that are reminiscent of '60s-era
consciousness-raising, her view of performing also has a bit of the
old Living Theater utopianism. ``From the beginning, `The Vagina
Monologues' happened to me,'' she said in an interview. ``If it
were about me, I'd get nervous. It's about us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She described passing groups of women in Le Madeleine, a nearby
restaurant, all wearing the ``Vagina Friendly'' buttons sold in the
lobby and discussing the show. ``To have people translate your art
into changing consciousness is the most exciting thing possible,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her dour-sounding theme of sisterhood-is-powerful, much
of Ms. Ensler's message onstage is conveyed through humor. There
are monologues sending up the indignity of pelvic exams and the
silliness of workshops teaching women to navigate their genitalia.
Several of Ms. Dozoretz's friends laughed during Ms. Ensler's
demonstration of sexual moans, a bit that is reminiscent of Meg
Ryan's deli orgasm in ``When Harry Met Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the graduate students sniffled during the rape
monologue. Most of the midwives were silent, neither laughing nor
tearful.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Rolland, an associate professor at Hunter College, who
had invited the 35 students and graduates of the Urban Public
Health program, later said: ``The next day, the overwhelming
response was: `I'm bringing my sister! I'm bringing my friend!' I
spoke with one graduate who went out with a friend until the early
hours of the morning because they couldn't stop talking about it.
That's what I hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Ensler led a discussion for the three groups. The
midwives seemed the least impressed. One, Jeanette Breen, who
specializes in home births in Baldwin, N.Y., said that the final
monologue, describing a hospital birth Ms. Ensler had witnessed,
``missed truth and beauty about birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ensler said she was simply recounting her own experience. A
woman next to Ms. Breen whispered, ``She should've had a midwife.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman thanked Ms. Ensler: ``My mother died in childbirth and
had a stillborn son. In a way, you gave my mother back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Adele Mora di Puma, one of the Hunter students, raised her hand
and said, ``Where I come from, in Spanish Harlem, the word vagina
is taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Others had lighter reactions. Swept up, apparently, in the mood
of giddy sisterhood evoked by the evening, Ms. Irving pointed to
Ms. Locklear as both left the theater and said, ``My vagina was
talking to her vagina throughout the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Locklear pronounced the show ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, the midwives gathered at Le Madeleine. Few had
found the monologues funny. Pixie Cram Elsberry, the director of
midwifery at the North Bronx Health Care Network, explained, ``We
didn't laugh because we could relate everything she said to someone
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, it seemed, had been embarrassed or shocked. Ms. Chin
said, ``We talk about vaginas all day long.''

 &HT;    Engineering faculty doubted bonfire's stability
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    and Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Several faculty members in structural
engineering at Texas A&AMP;M University regarded the design of the
Aggie Bonfire as unstable but did not speak up because warnings by
one of their most highly regarded colleagues were ignored for
years, according to records released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose we all have some regrets now that we kept quiet,
even though we thought it futile to speak up,'' Loren Lutes, a
professor of civil engineering and associate head of the civil
engineering department, said in an e-mail to Ray Bowen, president
of the university.
</P>
<P>
   Lutes e-mailed Bowen on Nov. 19, one day after the four-story
stack of logs for the annual bonfire collapsed, killing 11 students
and one recent graduate and injuring 27 students. The university
released about 1,400 e-mails to or from Bowen in response to
requests under the Texas Open Records Act.
</P>
<P>
   A special commission has been appointed to investigate the
collapse, and questions about the design and stability of the giant
woodpile are expected to be central to the inquiry. Several
engineers unaffiliated with A&AMP;M or the investigation have suggested
that the layers of logs might have become unbalanced, causing the
structure to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Lutes told Bowen that T.J. ``Teddy'' Hirsch, formerly head of
the structural engineering section of the civil engineering
department, had expressed the view ``for years'' that the stack
design was fundamentally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch took his concerns to the university's Office of the Vice
President for Student Affairs, probably before 1994, and proposed a
more stable design, but the university administration ignored the
recommendations, Lutes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, who holds bachelor's and doctoral degrees in mechanical
engineering from A&AMP;M, said in an interview Thursday evening that
such information could be important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep at arm's length of the necessary analysis
that is taking place,'' Bowen said. ``I hope that professor will
provide that information to the commission and they will decide
whether it's relevant or not. I have a lot of confidence in their
ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutes was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for
comment. Hirsch, who is retired, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite A&AMP;M's reputation as a leading engineering school, the
A&AMP;M engineering staff has no responsibility for the bonfire. A
faculty adviser, who is not an engineer, helps students, but the
Aggie tradition is for students to take the lead in building the
structure. No blueprint for the structure exists; each class is
expected to teach the next one how to build the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many structural engineering faculty members are well aware of
Teddy's unsuccessful attempt to have the design of the stack
altered,'' Lutes told Bowen in the e-mail. ``I think there has been
a widespread feeling that if he couldn't do it, none of the rest of
us had a chance of having any effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutes also said he had spoken with several faculty members and
found ``general agreement'' that the stack had been built in an
unstable way in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation it does not really matter whether the
immediate triggering effect on Thursday (Nov. 18) was due to soil
problems, the splice in the center pole or some other detail. As
evidence of instability, I point out the fact that the stack has
fallen very quickly in recent years. ... To me this is a clear
indication that the structure was only marginally stable before it
was lit.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the bonfire collapsed, there were questions.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the midnight shift change, some students thought
something was wrong with the stack _ and it was a topic of
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't look sturdy at all,'' said a sophomore crew
chief who asked that his name not be used. ``When I looked at it,
it looked a little shifted. It didn't look quite right.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew chief, who was responsible for a student crew wiring
logs in place, said he thought the stack leaned slightly in the
direction it eventually fell. Although each log in the 40-foot
stack must be wired to three other logs with heavy baling wire, the
crew chief said there were too many loose logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tightening loose logs all night,'' the chief said of
his crew.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who had worked on the bonfire the year before,
blamed a lack of training for the loose wiring. Unlike cutting or
loading the logs, he said, there is no class to teach wiring. Each
crew chief teaches his group on the stack. He said there were just
too many workers _ A&AMP;M has estimated 70 students on the stack that
night _ to train adequately. A&AMP;M officials also have admitted that
many freshmen and sophomores were on the upper stacks, a violation
of university policy.
</P>
<P>
   The crew chief said a majority of the workers from his dorm
``just went out there and just started wiring'' this year. He
added, however, ``Most of them caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   Under A&AMP;M's military-style organization for building the
bonfire, 18 seniors and juniors _ called ``red pots'' for their
helmets _ are responsible for safety. But they work in shifts, so
only a few were there that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The red pots check for sturdiness,'' the crew chief said of
the wiring. ``I don't think there is any way you can check every
single log, especially when the stack gets really big. People just
need to learn how to wire.'' Another student with experience on
past bonfires is Bill Theissen, 22, a senior management major from
Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the first stack, the base for the structure,
was narrower than in previous years: ``There wasn't much room to
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Theissen said he climbed up to the top at one point and thought
the structure seemed fine. But he said others complained that the
stack did not have enough cables supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago when Theissen was a bonfire leader from his dorm,
he said, they cinched the first two stacks with cables, much like a
belt, at least twice before the stack was completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were talking about how they didn't do that this year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Theissen and the crew chief escaped injury when the bonfire
collapsed.

FOR ACCIDENT THEORISTS, Y2K MAKES ALL THE WORLD A LABORATORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Perrow plans to rise early on Dec. 31 to see what
happens as the calendar turns over to the year 2000, first in New
Zealand and then, hour by hour, across the globe. It will be an
unusual activity for the Yale sociologist, who says he rarely
watches television.
</P>
<P>
   But Perrow sees the planet on New Year's Day as a giant
laboratory for the influential theory he formulated in the early
1980s about the nature of catastrophic accidents. ``This is going
to be very exciting, to see just how interdependent we are,'' he
said of the date change, which could disable computers around the
world that have been programmed to read the year as two digits
rather than four.
</P>
<P>
   The varied and unpredictable ways in which systems interact with
one another is at the heart of the theory that Perrow described in
his seminal 1984 book ``Normal Accidents: Living With High-Risk
Technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrow found that the organizations designed to run and
safeguard modern technology were so complex and so tightly
integrated that accidents are inevitable, or ``normal,'' even when
all the proper safety procedures are followed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, disasters like the near-meltdown of the nuclear reactor at
Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the explosion of the Space
Shuttle Challenger cannot be traced to discrete errors or blamed
solely on ``operator error,'' as has been the typical approach in
the past. They are the natural result of the systems themselves.
They are accidents that are inconceivable _ until they happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal Accidents,'' which was reissued by Princeton University
Press this year, was originally published at a time when
organizational theory was beginning to catch on with many social
scientists. The book helped inspire a small cadre of what Lee
Clarke, a Rutgers University professor who studied with Perrow,
calls ``social ambulance chasers'' who examine the nature of
high-profile accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, normal-accident theory and its intellectual cousins
have begun to spread from engineering into other fields like
medicine and finance, where researchers are using it to try to
better understand the nature of such potential disasters as a stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an idea whose time had come,'' Perrow said of his
theory. ``The field was ready for it, which is not surprising
because we have just revved up the technology so far and run into
these catastrophes one after the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is hard to open a newspaper these days without seeing
an article related to normal-accident theory. Last week alone there
were four prominent examples.
</P>
<P>
   The small cadre of accident theorists in the medical profession
received a huge boost when President Clinton endorsed a new report
by the National Academy of Sciences calling for a systemic approach
to decreasing lethal medical accidents that kill more people each
year than AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the National Institutes of Health held a
meeting to debate whether greater regulation was needed after the
death in September of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, the first
fatality directly connected to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Florida jury acquitted two employees of an airplane
maintenance company charged with deliberately causing the 1996
crash of ValuJet Flight 562, which killed 110 people. The verdict
appeared to endorse the view of some analysts and journalists that
the crash was a normal accident rather than the result of criminal
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the disappearance of the Mars Polar Lander last week
after entering the Martian atmosphere resulted in a searching
examination of what might have gone wrong with the lander and
NASA's management of the entire program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a world we keep developing more and more complicated
technologies that require more and more complicated
organizations,'' said Karlene Roberts, an organizational safety
expert at the Haas School of Business of the University of
California at Berkeley, ``and nobody understands how those
organizations work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Ms. Roberts and several colleagues at
Berkeley were asking many of the same questions Perrow was. They
decided to look at three organizations that manage high-risk
technologies with low rates of accidents _ aircraft carriers in the
U.S. Navy, the air traffic control system in Oakland, Calif., and
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California _ to see what
made them successful.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Perrow's followers have drawn sharp distinctions between
this so-called high-reliability theory and normal-accident theory.
But Ms. Roberts and Todd LaPorte, Berkeley political scientists,
argue that the two schools are complementary. Some social
scientists say they combine both schools in their work.
</P>
<P>
   Given the range of views on both sides, the differences are
sometimes hard to divine. But the normal-accident theorists appear
to be much more pessimistic about society's ability to manage
hazardous technologies and much more skeptical about the nature of
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Perrow, who developed his ideas after serving on a panel that
examined what went wrong at Three Mile Island, argues that some
technologies, like nuclear power, should simply be abandoned
because they are not worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The high-reliability theorists do not for the most part ask such
searching questions, preferring instead to accept the existence of
hazardous technologies and to focus on ways to manage them more
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the high-reliability theorists believe that many backup
systems can enhance safety, normal-accident theorists argue that
the increased complexity resulting from redundancy actually
increases the likelihood of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more trust in management and safety procedures and
so on than I have,'' said Perrow, who added that he had always been
fearful of large organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts calls ``Normal Accidents'' a ``beacon'' and warmly
refers to Perrow as a curmudgeon. But she says that his extreme
views have prevented him from spending time inside organizations
actually learning how they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be too rough on management,'' she said,
``then you get into the sabotage question, and they won't tell you
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like the high-reliability theorists, Perrow does think about
what makes certain organizations safer than others. For example, he
argues that commercial aviation is a highly reliable system, even
though flying would itself appear to be extremely risky.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the riskiest activities involved in flying _
taking off and landing _ occur frequently, keeping the skills of
pilots and air traffic controllers sharp. Moreover, the nation's
air transport system is surrounded by organizations _ the National
Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation
Administration, for example _ that are committed to preventing
failures. Some, like the airlines and airplane manufacturers, will
suffer directly if confidence in the system declines.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and this is where Perrow's political perspective is at
its most potent, he argues that because jet travel is frequented by
society's elite, they have a vested interest in keeping it safe. On
the other hand, chemical plants are often in poor districts, far
away from the elite, and therefore, he says, they have a lower
safety threshold.
</P>
<P>
   To those already fearful of modern technology, the saving grace
of both normal accident theory and high-reliability theory is that
while both assume that organizational breakdowns are inevitable,
they agree that such incidents only rarely translate into major
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to have a catastrophe. Everything has to come
together just right (or wrong),'' Perrow writes in a new afterword
to ``Normal Accidents.'' (No one died as a result of the Three Mile
Island accident, he points out.)
</P>
<P>
   He calls this phenomenon the ``Union Carbide factor,'' after the
company that operated the chemical plant in Bhopal, India, where a
deadly gas leak in 1984 killed 4,000 and injured 200,000. In that
case, so many mistakes were made by the company and so many things
went wrong at once that what might have been a minor accident was
transformed into a major disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Carbide factor is one reason Perrow and other accident
theorists are not seriously concerned about the arrival of the year
2000. Perrow believes that there will be some disruptions but that
they will result in only minor inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, he is not entirely certain.
</P>
<P>
   While billions of dollars have been spent to fix computers at
individual companies and organizations, there has been less focus
on what will happen when these computers interact across networks.
A computer that is considered ``year-2000 compliant'' at one
company may cripple a compliant computer at another because
software writers in the two organizations took different approaches
to fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Perrow and the other accident anbility
theorists are eagerly waiting to see just how tightly knit the
world is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have mental maps about how their systems work,'' said
Clarke, the Rutgers professor whose most recent book examines the
``fantasy plans'' that organizations create to justify high-risk
technologies. ``To the extent things break, it will give us insight
into how those mental maps work.''

E-COMMERCE BRINGS AN END TO THE CHICKEN-SCRATCH CHRISTMAS LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 12) 
(mk) 
 By DANY LEVY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call me a sap. But one of my favorite Christmas presents was a
purple velour sweat suit my father gave me from Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   It was ugly, almost aggressively so. I don't think Richard
Simmons would have touched the thing. Of course I returned it, got
a store credit and bought myself some pretty underpants and a
woolly scarf.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ritual of Christmas. I almost kept the thing _ and
maybe I should have, because I will always smile at the thought of
my father darting around Saks, mauled by the barrage of other
holiday shoppers, trying to pick a Christmas gift for his
14-year-old daughter, who, admittedly, changed her style every
other week.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, when I flipped open the business section of the
paper recently and read about the new thing going on in the mad
world of e-commerce _ a series of online registry sites designed to
allow users to post their holiday gift wish lists online _ I got a
bit sad.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I got really sad. There is OhIWish.com, Wishlist.com,
Wishclick.com, Wishbox.com, even IveBeenGood.com. My curiosity was
piqued. I logged onto Domains.com, a site that records all
registered domain names, and did a search. I plugged in Gimme.com.
Taken. GimmeGimme.com. Taken. MineAllMine.com, CoughItUp.com,
ForkItOver.com. All taken.
</P>
<P>
   Was the little chicken-scratch Christmas list really dead? Is
this what my future children will be using to inform me what they
want? (Or, from the sound of it, expect.) The downright demanding
nature of it made me uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong; I like to have my wishes granted as much as
the next person, but the materialistic, matter-of-factness of this
format made me squirm. I could already see my mother and sister
haggling on Priceline.com over who would get the best price to
satisfy my request for a Hanro undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   I had always thought this product-specific ``I want it!''
brattiness was supposed to be confined to a bride and bridegroom
setting up house. Did anyone and everyone now deserve a personal
registry?
</P>
<P>
   And, if you had a registry at age 10, what would be the use of
rejiggering one for your nuptials?
</P>
<P>
   I started poking around some of these sites, much surprised by
the fact that I didn't need a password of any sort to view the
contents of, say, a little girl named Ally's wishbox in Ohio. Each
time I perused some unsuspecting child's list of wishes, I felt
vaguely as though I were lurking around a schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it made me queasy to behold all the things
these children wanted. One 13-year-old wanted a Jaguar. Another
teenager had composed a list of no fewer than 110 items, including
a Hewlett-Packard flatbed scanner, Bye Bye Blemish drying lotion, a
Mir space station model, multicolored hair butterflies, a hand-held
color television set with a TFT Active matrix screen and a Fisher
slim stereo.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't stop there. She wanted English Cheddar cheese, the
new Limp Bizkit album, a Thinkpad 240 computer, Emotion Potion, a
clear-brain yo-yo and Mega cargo pants from the Gap. The first item
on her list? The Cosmo magazine makeover software. These kids were
asking for it, and for a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   Which seems, as it turns out, the general concept that much of
this trend hinges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from Generation Y are much more comfortable asking for
exactly what they want,'' explained Lou Weiss, a founder of
Wishbox.com, a site that specifically targets the ages 10 to 20
demographic (and heavily promotes charity donations). ``They are
meant as a place where you can put something in that you might not
otherwise have the guts to ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Birnbaum, a chirpy fifth-grader at the Dalton School in
New York, confirmed this theory. ``I feel OK asking for more in my
Wishbox because that way I don't have to really ask and get an
answer,'' she said. ``My mommy and daddy can just look in there and
know, and they don't have to say `no' to my face. I don't think
there is anything I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Emily would like, among other things, some ``Polar
tech feety pajamas'' (read: pajamas with feet) and ``for Daddy to
set up the Nintendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of cute, no? There's another twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This other weird thing goes on,'' Weiss said. ``Parents are
warning their kids not to have a lot of things in their Wishbox
because they think it will make them look greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if I am getting the gist of this correctly, you can ask for
a lot, just as long as you do it under a pseudonym. Mindy Birnbaum,
Emily's mother, considers the need for anonymity more of a safety
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents don't want their kids using their real names. It's too
much exposure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad point, when you note the teasers written by the sites
on these sites, for example: ``So you want to peek in someone
else's Wishbox? Why not? It's fun...it's even legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, I made the leap. I embraced my inner brat and got myself a
Wishbox, filled it with some fairly by-the-book items (``a CD
player that won't skip when I run,'' ``a Polaroid I-Zone sticker
camera.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then, I decided to go to town. I asked to have six calla lilies
delivered to my house once a month (I almost asked for them
weekly). I commanded a Vespa, an antique pocket watch, ``free reign
at Agnes B.'' And anything else over the top I could come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Web-site address in hand, I went to Thanksgiving dinner, where
much of the wish-list bartering goes down in my family.
</P>
<P>
   I announced to the table that I had gotten myself a Wishbox
online, and if anyone had any questions about what to get me for
the holidays, they could just check www.getthere.com. There was a
moment of silence and some clinking of forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves trees?'' asked one guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know how to use my computer,'' my mother
protested.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Rodger, perched at the head of the table, was quite taken
with the concept. ``It's simple,'' he said. ``It makes the whole
thing really easy.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother persisted. ``It certainly takes the romance out of
Christmas,'' she said as she pushed her sweet potatoes around her
plate. She mulled the concept a bit further and piped up: ``I guess
it's a good idea, because every year I ask you and your sister what
you want and you both are always like, `I don't know.' I find that
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``In any event, it certainly is a good excuse to not
have to talk to your mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these sites really do understand their customer.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RELIGIOUS FAITHFUL STUNNED AT PRIESTS' QUESTIONING
EXISTENCE OF INDIAN MESSENGER OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE
 &HT;    (1200&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's one of the most fundamental, beloved stories
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1531, during the Spanish Conquest, a brown-skinned,
Aztec-speaking Virgin Mary is said to have appeared before an
Indian peasant named Juan Diego. The Virgin who became known as
Guadalupe asked Diego to build a church on the site where she
appeared, and to prove her miraculous apparition she left an
imprint of herself on Diego's cloak for him to show to Spanish
priests.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, this story has nurtured Mexicans' strong faith in
the Catholic Church as well as Mexican and Mexican-American pride
in their indigenous heritage. But just as Mexicans prepared to
celebrate the apparition of their patron saint 468 years ago this
Sunday, the country was stunned to discover some of their own
priests doubt the miracle ever occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the three Mexican priests _ all of whom have worked at
the Virgin's basilica here _ wrote a letter to the Vatican in
September objecting to an effort to make Juan Diego a saint. They
say that so far no requisite proof has been produced to confirm
that the Indian was a real person.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has thrown canonization for Diego into question and
is testing the strength of faith in Mexico, the second largest
Catholic country in the world and a naiton vital to the Vatican's
influence in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said anything about this to the people before, and we
never intended to hurt anyone,'' said Carlos Warnholtz, who
ministers at the Virgin of Guadalupe Basilica and signed the
letter, which was supposed to be confidential but was leaked to a
reporter in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Upset because some top church officials have ordered the three
to repent, Warnholtz said the dissident priests embrace the
``tender, beautiful and very Indian story'' of the Virgin's
appearance. But without proof of Juan Diego's existence they regard
the encounter as a symbolic legend that helped convert Mexico's
Indians, who _ not coincidently _ worshipped the Aztec mother
goddess Tonanztin on the same hill where the Virgin appeared to
Juan Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The legend was fueled by priests eager to win converts and
evolved over the centuries into a cult of worship for the Virgin
that is valid, Warnholtz said. But that doesn't mean it merits
canonization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have doubts in the tradition,'' he said. ``But where
is the proof? Where are Juan Diego's remains? Where is his tomb?
</P>
<P>
   At Mexico City's massive Virgin of Guadalupe Basilica, where as
many as 6 million were expected to pour in from all parts of Mexico
for Sunday's fiesta, pilgrims appeared disturbed by the priests'
doubts but unshaken in their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, the second most visited shrine in the
Catholic world, they gazed with reverence at the cactus fiber cloak
Diego supposedly wore with the miraculous image of the Virgin. The
cloak hangs high on a wall inside a glass case.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Medina, a 30-year-old Mexico City mother, carried her own
statue of the Virgin to the church to be blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to believe until Juan Diego and the Virgin
come and tell us not to believe,'' she said indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Soriano, 23, who sells corn cakes outside the church, said
of the priests, ``If they don't believe, why do they work here?''
</P>
<P>
   Candida Portilla, a Veracruz state construction worker, was
equally firm in his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He existed and he still exists in our hearts,'' Portilla said
of Juan Diego, grimacing and sweating with pain as he showed his
devotion by hobbling toward the church on his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Believer Antonia Garcia, a Mexico City housewife who visits the
shrine whenever she needs comfort, said, ``Juan Diego was very
important. The Virgin doesn't just appear to just anyone. She chose
him because he was one of the humble. That was a message.''
</P>
<P>
   When the story about the internal church squabble over Juan
Diego surfaced in Mexico last week, the press and radio shows
gobbled it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope last visited Mexico in January and repeatedly expressed
veneration for the dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe, announcing
that she should be a symbol for evangelization throughout the
Americas. The pope beatified Diego in 1990, a step that must be
taken before a candidate can be considered for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Top church officials here, who reportedly hope to see Diego
canonized next year, were swift and harsh in their condemnation of
the dissident priests' opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The letter's primary author was Guillermo Schulenburg, 83, who
is now retired but for 33 years served as abbot of the Virgin's
basilica. Three years ago, Schulenburg angered Catholics here when
he called the apparition of the Virgin ``a symbol, not reality'' in
a Catholic publication. He was retired shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Norberto Rivera, Cardinal Primate of Mexico, said
Schulenburg was effectively excommunicating himself by questioning
the canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Onesimo Cepeda, a church spokesman, told a newspaper,
``This is what you might expect of someone older than 80. Logically
all old people become a bit capricious and lose lucidity in their
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Papal Nuncio Justo Muller, the Vatican's ambassador here, called
for Schulenburg to ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Muller also said Schulenburg had ``no right''
to his opinion because he owns several houses and lives in
excessive luxury. The retired Mexican priest has avoided the press
since the squabble erupted into the public light.
</P>
<P>
   Warnholtz said he and another priest who also works at the
basilica haven't been fired or pressured so far to leave their
posts. ``We didn't commit a crime or a sin by expressing our
doubts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church allows for confidential debate over naming saints,
Warnholtz said, and since it requires ``scientific'' proof of a
candidate's existence the priests felt it was their duty to point
out shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Warnholtz said his doubts were heightened when he saw the image
of the Virgin on Juan Diego's cloak up close in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it's supernatural. But I've seen it and it is a
painting,'' he said. ``We agree, though, that it is mystical
because it remains so well-preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnholtz acknowledged that many saints in the Middle Ages were
named without sufficient proof they existed, including Saint
George, the legendary dragon slayer and patron saint of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the modern world is more critical,'' he said and the
church should protect its reputation by following its own more
modern, strict standards.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Guerrero, a priest who spent four years in Rome
promoting sainthood for Diego, said worshippers he knows burst into
tears and were deeply wounded when they heard about the priests'
letter.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, too, that hundreds of pounds of documents he
presented to the Vatican add up to adequate historical record of
Diego's existence. Not long ago, he said, a piece of paper was
discovered in an archive with Diego's Aztec name on it and a
certification of his death in 1548.
</P>
<P>
   The document bears the authenticated signature of a famous
priest who ministered to Indians at the time, Guerrero said.
Apparently, however, there are disagreements over the authenticity
of the document, the cloak and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero said he fully accepts that it was no accident that the
Virgin supposedly appeared on the same site where the Indians
worshipped their mother goddess.
</P>
<P>
   ``God adapted to that by sending his mother to be the
evangelizer,'' he said. ``It was an indispensable way to show the
Indians that the Christian faith was for them.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Vietmeier, director of the Center for Religious Studies
here, said he thinks that the dispute over Juan Diego is rooted in
power struggles within the Mexican church and the Vatican. Someone
leaked the priests' confidential letter to the press, but no one is
saying who or exactly why, except to suggest it was to harm
Schulenburg.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain, Vietmeier said. The fight has touched
a popular nerve because of the Virgin of Guadalupe's powerful image
unifying Mexico's European and Indian heritage, which violently
collided with the Spanish Conquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of Mexico is of a people conquered, violated,''
Vietmeier said. ``Yet they recovered their dignity through their
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence fighters in the 19th century went to battle against
the Spanish carrying banners of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants
marched for the rights of Hispanic farmworkers in the 1960s
carrying images of the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Juan Diego in plays celebrating the Virgin is an honored
role for little Mexican boys, who paint on mustaches and don cloaks
like Juan Diego's.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mexican rock musicians have penned odes to the Virgin
because she is a symbol of national hope as much as religious
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Warnholtz, ``We don't have to believe in
private apparitions of the Virgin until the Pope says we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Pope canonizes Juan Diego,'' he said, ``then we will
have to accept it. He will be giving us the gift of an Indian saint
whose example we can follow.''

 A NIGHT OUT WITH STELLA McCARTNEY   By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the dark streets of the meatpacking district, a
fleet of town cars were parked three deep in front of Pastis, Keith
McNally's hopping new bistro. With all eyes on the famous faces of
Minnie Driver and Puff Daddy, no eyebrows were raised by Stella
McCartney's entrance on a recent Saturday night. Slipping into a
corner banquette in the back, Ms. McCartney, 28, the designer for
Chloe, seemed unimpressed by the marquee crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't that inspirational to me,'' she said, smoking a
cigarette and chewing gum at the same time. ``I'm not famous, but I
know a lot of famous people because of my upbringing.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Paul and Linda McCartney may not elicit the same
stares and elbow nudges as the stars who grace the covers of In
Style magazine. But as far as those stars are concerned, she is one
of them. As Jerry Seinfeld was escorted to a nearby table, he
recognized Ms. McCartney and offered a familiar, ``How ya doin'?''
Charlie Rose and Amanda Burden took their places at the banquette
alongside Ms. McCartney. ``How long will you be in town for?'' Rose
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who divides her time between London and Paris, was
visiting for the VH1/Vogue fashion awards and the Costume
Institute's gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to rummage
in vintage clothing shops for inspiration for her next collection.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off her jacket _ a used denim embellished with
rhinestones and a Black Sabbath logo found in the East Village
earlier in the day _ Ms. McCartney unwound a colorful wool crochet
scarf from her neck. It looked like something her grandmother might
have crocheted but was in fact designed by Ms. McCartney for
Chloe's fall 1999 collection. Underneath, she wore a black
strapless jump suit with jet black beads, also her design. The
entire outfit, along with her unstyled hair, had a thrown-together
feeling, an eclectic mix of glamour and grunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never believed in the philosophy of the outfit,'' Ms.
McCartney said. ``I have always believed in one beautiful piece,
and then you build around it with, let's say, something
secondhand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's unbuttoned shirt cuffs caught Ms. McCartney's eye. ``I
like that,'' she whispered. ``It proves he's either too lazy or
he's got vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   She was picking at a plate of potatoes and carrots. Ms.
McCartney is a vegetarian, as her mother was. Calvin Klein, whose
sleek, minimal aesthetic couldn't be more different from the
frilly, vintage-inspired Chloe look, worked his way to the back of
the restaurant. ``You are doing such creative things!'' Klein said.
``Look at you!'' he added, admiring the granny scarf. ``Who
wouldn't want to look like you!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Ms. McCartney was just 25, the Vendome Group,
Chloe's parent company, named her to succeed Karl Lagerfeld at the
venerable French label. Her legendary last name, coupled with her
inexperience, raised doubts that talent was the reason she was
offered such a plum job.
</P>
<P>
   As a student in London at Central St. Martin's College of Art
and Design, where she studied fashion, Ms. McCartney had enlisted
her supermodel pals, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, to model her
1995 graduation collection. Her parents applauded from the front
row. The hype made it easy to dismiss her as a
spoiled-little-rich-girl.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, that student collection, which Ms. McCartney
sewed in her garage in Notting Hill, foreshadowed the style that
has made Chloe hot again, especially with younger women. Customers
have snapped up her sexy dresses and tops adorned with antique
buttons and lace. The feminine touches are in step with today's
antiminimalist moment. The rumor du jour in fashion is that Ms.
McCartney's rapid rise will be capped by her appointment to take
over from Tom Ford as Gucci's designer. With Gucci's recent
acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent, the speculation has been that
Ford will be elevated to creative director overseeing both houses,
leaving the Gucci post open.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCartney refused to comment directly, confirming only that
she and Ford had discussed the matter, after first meeting at a
party given by Madonna several months ago. ``Don't you think I want
to tell the whole world the job offers I've had?'' she said. ``But
I can't. It's unprofessional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's a Virgo,'' she added. ``I'm a Virgo. And we both drink
vodka.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ladies room at Pastis, Ms. McCartney disapprovingly eyed
a reporter dressed in a Chloe gray herringbone skirt with a ruffled
hem. The designer was unhappy that the skirt didn't fit as snugly
as she had shown it on the runway, and she grabbed a handful of
fabric at the seat. ``This is a woman's best part,'' she
instructed. ``A skirt has to scoop under the booty.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30, she was ready to make a break for her town car waiting
outside the restaurant, declaring she wanted to make a quick stop
at Double Happiness, a basement bar in Chinatown, to meet a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The friend turned out to be the actress Liv Tyler. ``You're
wearing a good T-shirt,'' Ms. McCartney said, snuggling up to the
actress, who flaunted her Chloe top emblazoned with a gold Playboy
bunny. Marveling at Ms. Tyler's kooky ensemble _ which included
fuzzy red earmuffs, a red beaded choker, a long red skirt over a
pair of khaki jeans and black Jack Purcell sneakers _ Ms. McCartney
said, ``She has great style!''
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 11 o'clock, Ms. McCartney was joined by a childhood
friend with no star pedigree: Hope Webster, who works in
communications at Estee Lauder, and her husband, Rob Robles, a
musician. Everyone piled into the car and, sounding like a female
Austin Powers, Ms. McCartney prodded the driver, ``Put the pedal to
the metal, baby!'' They headed to Rockefeller Center to take in a
performance of ``Saturday Night Live,'' which was to have Christina
Ricci as the host.
</P>
<P>
   En route, Ms. McCartney accepted a Jolly Rancher candy from Ms.
Webster and spit her gum out the window. ``Spitting gum out the
window is a good feeling,'' she said. ``It's just like sneezing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Studio 8H in the GE Building at Rockefeller Plaza, where
``Saturday Night Live'' is broadcast, Ms. McCartney and her
entourage were escorted through various smoke-filled rooms, where
dozens of VIPs lounged, drank and watched the show on television.
Ms. McCartney took a few minutes to flirt with Chevy Chase.
``You're looking very dashing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCartney spent most of the evening at the side of Lorne
Michaels, the show's producer. But when Beck, the musical guest
that night, performed, she dashed to join the audience. ``He's
fly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 2 a.m. when Ms. McCartney left the set to head
back downtown for the ritual afterparty. As she was leaving the
building, a photographer snapped her picture. The usual swarm of
fans outside the show descended upon her, asking for autographs,
pictures, assuming she was famous even if they weren't quite sure
how.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good garden tool doesn't strain the body. It does the job
right. It is easy to clean and sharpen. It endures, even improves
with age. Such a tool engenders loyalty, not as fierce as the love
of a dog but about as close as an inanimate object can get.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are thinking of giving a tool as a holiday gift,
choose a high-quality one _ with the return slip in case it doesn't
suit the person's hand or height, is too heavy or too light. Like
all tools, pruning shears are intensely personal items.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my hands, I like the No. 2 Felcos,'' said Mike Ruggiero, a
senior curator of the New York Botanical Garden. ``They're flexible
and they give a nice sharp cut for the rose canes. The rotating
ones slip in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   I swear by Felco No. 7, with the rotating handle, which eases
the twinges in my wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I prune about 2,000 roses in the spring, I like to start
the year with a new blade,'' Ruggiero said. ``But I don't throw the
old one away; I use it on dead wood, which can nick any blade.''
</P>
<P>
   When the blades get dull, sharpen them on the bevel side, using
a stone and a bit of oil. ``But don't use motor oil, which is toxic
to plants,'' Ruggiero said. ``I use olive oil. But it doesn't have
to be extra virgin.'' I found Felco No. 2, for $39, and Felco No.
7, for $56, in the Smith &AMP; Hawken catalog: (800) 776-3336 or
www.smith-hawken.com
</P>
<P>
   As for pruning knives, Wayne Cahilly, a venerable pruner at the
botanical garden, has an old Victorinox, with a rosewood handle and
a slightly curved three-inch blade. ``It has a bit of a reverse
curve to the handle and fits your hand nicely,'' he said. ``I like
a wooden handle, because you can take sandpaper and make it fit
your hand, so you don't get blisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The blade should be high-carbon steel, not stainless steel,
which doesn't hold an edge. Victorinox knives, for $22, are sold by
A.M. Leonard, which has great tools; (800) 543-8955 or
www.amleo.com.
</P>
<P>
   As for saws, I'm partial to my Japanese pruning saw, which has
an eight-inch blade that slips into a slim oak carrying case that
attaches to my belt. The curved handle fits nicely in my hand.
Smith &AMP; Hawken sells it for $26.
</P>
<P>
   Cahilly prefers the folding Felco saw, with a six-inch blade,
that is 14 inches long when open and only 8 inches when closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a nice locking mechanism that doesn't come loose,'' he
said. ``And everything is replaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The diamond-shaped tooth design, excellent for cutting, makes it
difficult to sharpen, so when the blade gets dull, he just throws
it away and buys a new one, for about $12. Stillbrook Horticultural
Supplies sells the saw for $20; (800) 414-4468.
</P>
<P>
   As for loppers, Felco and Sandvik are old standbys. And I'm
intrigued by a pair of loppers made by Fiskars, which has a gear
design that increases leverage and reduces stress, as well as
lightweight aluminum handles (about $30 at retail centers); for
information, (800) 500-4849 or www.fiskars.com.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tools sells lightweight hedge shears with cushion grips
and high-carbon steel blades, and other ergonomically designed
tools, though I can't attest to how they wear; for information,
(800) 782-6539 or www.stanleytools.com.
</P>
<P>
   And spades? Ruggiero has two, one 30 years old, the other 15,
and he keeps them razor-sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have stainless steel blades, which don't pit or rust,''
he said. ``I sharpen them with a file, just the bevel side. You
don't have to use oil with stainless, but I do because it keeps
them clean.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite spade is an English-made Bulldog forged-steel spade
with a 44-inch D-handle, which is now $49. It's four inches longer
than the regular model and easier on my back. You have to try on
your spade. Seeds of Change sells it; (800) 762-7333 or
www.seedsofchange.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ames makes good spades, too, especially the Iowa Pattern, which
has a slightly tapering 11-inch blade and weighs about five pounds.
It sells for $53 at A.M. Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a handle socket that's been wrapped around the
handle,'' Cahilly said. ``When you pull back on it, you're pulling
against the weak spot.'' So look for a handle that's one piece of
steel _ or a half-strap spade, which has a handle strap that's part
of the blade. It comes up the front and back and is riveted through
the handle.
</P>
<P>
   As for trowels, Ruggiero treasures his $30 Wilkinson's stainless
steel trowel with the wooden handle. ``The blade is one piece
that's welded into the handle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I love my Ho-Mi tool, a curved hand digger that can weed, plow
or scare burglars. The label says Ho-mi means ``little ground
spear'' in Korean, and it feels like one. Available at Womanswork,
for $18; www.womanswork.com or (800) 639-2709.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find most of these tools in the average hardware
store, so order the catalogs or look up the Web sites, and choose
carefully.

 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What with all the white-gloved waiters, the caviar,
the lobster and truffled veal for 650 guests, the cases of Chateau
Cheval Blanc (at $135 a bottle), and last, but by no means least,
all the women decked out in haute couture feathers and silk,
Wednesday night's gala to open the new LVMH Tower in Manhattan was
certainly a French affair.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was served across the street in the atrium of the IBM
Building, which was big enough to hold it. The musicians in the
orchestra, who kept flailing away despite the poor acoustics, also
lent a distinctly French note of surrealism to the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you can see them, but you can't hear them,'' Kenneth
Jay Lane, the fake-jewelry king, said. ``It's very French, a rather
nice antidote to rock and roll,'' he added, alluding to the week's
other big gala, the rollicking Costume Institute party at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   It was debatable just how many billionaires were at the gala,
which was a benefit for the Municipal Art Society of New York, a
preservation group whose patrons _ Anne Bass, Veronica Hearst,
Cecile Zilkha and Marie-Josee Kravis, among others _ are hardly
what anyone would call slouches. Bernard Arnault, the chairman of
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury conglomerate, which
owns Christian Dior, Celine and a lot of wine and spirits brands,
as well as the auction house Phillips, sat between Mrs. Bass and
Mrs. Hearst. John Richardson, the writer and Picasso biographer,
was also at the main table, and so was Henry Kravis, the financier.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Arnault, the chairman's wife, who was wearing a black
Dior dress with leather straps, did her best at her table to
entertain Gwyneth Paltrow, who arrived in a clingy, plum-color Dior
slip dress, which matched her lipstick; the designer John Galliano;
and Judy Taubman, a chairwoman of the evening, who wore an Yves
Saint Laurent dress with a diamond broach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have one billionaire at our table,'' Lane
said, not sounding the least bit sulky. ``But we've had fun.'' His
dinner partners were Deeda Blair, the Washington couture stalwart
and fund-raiser, and Aileen Mehle, the gossip columnist. The
novelist and Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne was at their table,
too.
</P>
<P>
   If the Costume Institute party was about looseness and rap stars
with half-moon slivers of dollar bills lacquered on their
fingernails, the LVMH gala was about grandeur. And the French know
how to pile it on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the claret and Champagne, which mostly came from
Arnault's vineyards, all the embroidered table linen was brought
from France, and so were the 5,000 meters of white fabric used by
the building's architect, Christian de Portzamparc, to drape the
walls of the dinner area. De Portzamparc also staged a light show,
involving, among other things, images of the French and American
flags fluttering on the LVMH Tower and a parachuting dress with a
60-foot train.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much else going on, the rich food, couture dresses
that cost $50,000 and then some, not to leave out an appearance by
Hillary Rodham Clinton, well, it seemed a case of exquisite
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, wearing a black pantsuit, arrived shortly after 7
p.m. and stayed for about an hour before going on to another
engagement at the Plaza. Ms. and Mrs. Arnault held a private
cocktail reception for her, with about 50 VIPs, nearly all of whom,
in surreal contrast to Mrs. Clinton, were sensationally attired in
haute couture. Mrs. Hearst's Dior gown resembled a filigree of red
cobwebs on a nude lining. ``It feels like nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couture-clad Ms. Paltrow entered the reception looking as if
she were desperately trying to dislodge a caramel or something from
her teeth and then glowed as she greeted Mrs. Clinton and the
Arnaults.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Astor was the ever-unflappable Mrs. Astor. She had on a
long white silk suit, many emeralds at her throat and ears and
white kid gloves. The crowd seemed to part when she entered, and
Mrs. Clinton stepped forward to greet her.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Suzy Menkes of The International Herald Tribune
fell into a discussion with Mouna Ayoub, probably the world's most
acquisitive couture client, about her latest jewels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold $26 million worth of jewelry, and I bought $10
million,'' Ms. Ayoub explained in her straightforward manner. ``I
wanted something younger.''
</P>
<P>
   From a social point of view, the night was certainly a success
for Arnault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He scored even more points at dinner when, sensing the acoustics
problem, he stuffed into his pocket the two-page speech he had
planned to give and spoke briefly off the cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel heard Arnault while sitting at Marc Jacobs' table.
It wasn't clear what the tough-guy actor's connection was to the
glamorous evening, but he seemed to be enjoying himself. He took
out a cigar and was lighting it as the model Giselle was brought
over to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone remarked that he seemed to be the kind of guy who never
let a good cigar wait for a beautiful woman, and he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got that right,'' he said. Then he looked up at the
towering Giselle.

IOWA DEBATE MAY PROVE CRUCIAL TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
 ADV12-HNS  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 12)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (News analysis)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a little less sure of
his front-runner status in the Republican presidential field after
two debates with his challengers, needs a solid showing _ maybe
even a clear victory _ in the final debate of the year Monday night
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The debate at the Des Moines Civic Center before an expected
2,400 Republicans will be televised on local stations in Iowa and
nationally on the MSNBC cable channel. It gives Bush yet another
forum to battle a question that has bedeviled his campaign lately:
Does he have what it takes to be a world leader or is he an ``empty
suit,'' as late-night TV comics Jay Leno and David Letterman have
suggested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has to prove he's as good as his (poll and campaign
contribution) numbers tell us he is,'' says Charles O. Jones, a
political scientist who recently retired from the University of
Wisconsin. ``He has to show he lives up to what those numbers
represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bush's greatest challenge may be the numbers rather
than any individual GOP opponent. Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based
Republican pollster unaffiliated with any candidate, says, ``The
only damage (Bush sustained in the two prior debates) is the
comparison to sky-high expectations. I'm not sure anybody could
have met such expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than $60 million in the bank and the lead in most
national polls, Bush has been the front-runner and presumptive GOP
nominee since well before declaring his candidacy this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But lately he has seen a surge in New Hampshire of his closest
rival, Sen. Charles McCain, R-Ariz., plus a rising chorus of
questions about his own intellect.
</P>
<P>
   After the first Republican presidential debate Dec. 2 in
Manchester, N.H. and a second in Phoenix, Ariz. on Dec. 6, Bush is
dead-even with McCain or behind him in several polls in New
Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of New Hampshire is open to a debate of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is way ahead in Iowa, which holds its caucuses Jan. 24, and
McCain is bypassing that state altogether. Bush is well-organized
in larger states such as California and New York, which are among
the 16 states holding primaries on March 7, ``Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, because its primary is the traditional starting gate for
presidential candidates, New Hampshire maintains an aura of
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the earmarks of a possible McCain landslide in
New Hampshire,'' says pollster John Zogby, whose latest poll in the
state reflects the impact of the Dec. 2 debate there. Asked who won
the debate, 30 percent said McCain and 16 percent said Bush. Asked
whose performance impressed them, 79 percent said McCain and 44
said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Hampshire debate, Bush defanged his most ardent
attacker, publisher Steve Forbes, by serving up a Forbes magazine
column from 1977 in which he suggested a rise in the Social
Security retirement age of 65 might be the only way to save the
beleaguered system.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had just begun airing commercials accusing Bush of a
``betrayal'' for saying he would consider a rise in the retirement
age to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate intellectual heft, Bush said he was reading a
biography of Dean Acheson, an architect of U.S. Cold War policy as
secretary of state under President Truman.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Bush raised some eyebrows on the intellect question
when he was asked what lessons he drew from reading the Acheson
biography. His response in large measure was lifted from his
foreign policy speech: ``Our nation's greatest export to the world
has been, is and always will be the incredible freedoms we
understand in America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a retired Navy flier and former POW in Vietnam, offered
his own unscripted comments about Acheson a little later and won
praise from several pundits. Post-debate commentary compared the
two responses in ways that were unflattering to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Fields, director of the American studies program at
Washington University in St. Louis and author of a 1996 book,
``Union of Words: A History of Presidential Eloquence,'' said he
doubts Bush is the kind of candidate who can ever thrive amid the
verbal jousting of a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is on glibness, and he's the target of everyone
else,'' Fields said. ``What he needs is a one-on-one with a major
television interviewer, where he can sustain a discussion for some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts discount the idea that Bush is in any danger. As
the front-runner, they say, he needs more to avoid a devastating
gaffe than to win a clear victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others with little to lose can go for the grand slam every
time they step to the plate,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution, a think tank here. ``Bush can afford
to strike out a few times and not lose anything.''

MOST POTENTIAL Y2K GLITCHES ALREADY UNDER CONTROL, BUT NEW YEAR
WILL TELL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proud owners of 2000 model cars in Maine got a big surprise in
the mail last spring when they opened the title and discovered
their brand-new wheels had been declared ``horseless carriages.''
</P>
<P>
   That designation is usually given to vehicles built in that New
England state before 1916. While it made no sense to those who'd
just plopped down modern-day prices for state-of-the-art
automobiles, it made all the sense in the world to the computer
that printed it out.
</P>
<P>
   The computer saw 00 as the year 1900, right?
</P>
<P>
   Those new car owners got a glimpse into the future, experiencing
the kind of problem experts now think is the most that will happen
as a result of the Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people saw this as funny _ we took it a little more
seriously,'' said Domna Giatas, director of communications for the
Maine Secretary of State's office, which oversees vehicle titling.
``This was not an issue that would deprive someone of power or
water, and if this kind of thing is the worst that will happen,
we'll be pretty well off.''
</P>
<P>
   As the New Year approaches, uncertainty about the effects of the
Y2K bug remain. However, most experts believe that _ in the United
States at least _ the major problems likely have been fixed. The
major catastrophes and collapses of infrastructure heard in the
most dire Y2K predictions appear unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   However, smaller glitches, and ripple effects from problems in
countries that have not been as diligent as this one could create
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study released by the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion indicates that most governments and businesses have, as
of October, made significant headway in fixing their Y2K problems.
Some industries, such as banking and finance, appear to be close to
100 percent complete. Most sectors still have work to do, but
expect to meet what is the ultimate, nonnegotiable deadline.
Others, such as education and trade, appear to still be lagging and
may not have even major systems fixed by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based technology research
firm, estimates that $300 billion to $600 billion will be spent
across all sectors to fix the Y2K bug. Matt Hodel, a vice president
with Gartner, concedes that's a wide range.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we really don't know exactly how much will be spent, and
we may never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the problem is a familiar one. Older computers were
programmed with only two digits in the date field, with the
expectation that the machines and their software would be replaced
well before 2000. In some cases, only two digits were used to save
on computer memory, which in earlier systems was a precious
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some embedded systems _ essentially computers on a
chip installed in a device, such as a motor _ use two digits when
working with dates.
</P>
<P>
   In personal computers, the problem is a little different. It
mostly affects PCs sold before 1997, and in most cases the computer
turns the year 2000 into 1980 _ considered Year 1 for the
IBM-compatible computer. Operating system and application software
programs may have their own, specific Y2K-related failings.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, a Y2K expert who has been sounding alarms on the
issue since 1990, initially was considered a doomsayer, warning of
dire consequences of ignoring the bug. He has mellowed in the last
two years so that he's now considered something of a moderate.
That's because, he says, ``companies finally got through the denial
and resistance and are treating this problem with the respect it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   De Jager and others now say that Y2K problems are likely to be a
series of rolling glitches that won't happen necessarily at the
stroke of midnight, but rather will continue throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some problems may be discovered when a business
goes to close out its books at the end of the month. Others may be
found when quarterly reports are compared, or when a switchover is
made to a new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them will be things handled internally to
organizations without anyone knowing they happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Jager pointed to a recent study that showed 80 percent of
U.S. companies already had experienced _ and fixed _ some kind of
Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except in cases like the Maine horseless carriage incident,
most people haven't heard about these things,'' he said. ``That's
because they are usually fixed in a few minutes, or a few days at
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the Maine case, the problem was found and discovered
in 15 minutes, Giatas said. It then took several days to print and
redistribute corrected titles to the owners of the 2000-model-year
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the more catastrophic possibilities _ planes
falling out of the sky, power outages, fortunes disappearing
electronically from bank accounts and telephones going silent _
largely have been put to rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation industry all along has pooh-poohed the notion that
air travel would not be safe. Nevertheless, Frontier Air Lines of
Denver announced it would ground its entire fleet of planes during
a period just before and after the Jan. 1 rollover. Besides safety
concerns, the airline also cited low passenger demand _ not a lot
of people want to fly on New Year's Eve, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The electric utility industry claims to be ready, and de Jager
said fears of power outages may have been overblown in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to people in the power industry, and they tell me
that, when they went in and checked, they actually found nothing
that would have disrupted power,'' de Jager said.
</P>
<P>
   Banking and finance has been ready for some time _ ``I quit
worrying about them a year ago,'' de Jager said.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications sector also has been ahead of the game,
with the President's Council estimating that 96 percent of
long-distance and local phone companies are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   As with the electric companies, phone executives say there is
nothing about the phone network itself that is date-reliant.
However, ancillary components _ such as billing, ordering service
and payroll _ do rely on dates, and those have been fixed, said
Janet Rainford, communications director for the Y2K effort for SBC
Communications, Southwestern Bell's parent.
</P>
<P>
   However, telecommunications executives now face a different
dilemma: people picking up the phone at midnight on Jan. 1 to see
if the phone system is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you pick up a phone and get dial tone, you use a
circuit,'' said Rainford. ``The phone network is designed presuming
that not every customer is going to be using the phone at the same
time. It doesn't have that capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   If enough people check for dial tone at the same time, some
people will hear only silence and presume that it's a Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also are concerned about human behavior and
reactions to perceived problems that may or may not be Y2K related.
The Houston Police Department, for example, said it is planning for
potential reactions to Y2K problems, along with the general
partying that occurs every New Year's Eve. And, banks will make
more cash available in the week before New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   While forecasts for the United States have improved, that's not
the case for some parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to the President's Council, most developed nations
with whom the United States trades are in decent shape. However,
others still are questionable. In October, the government issued
travel warnings for some Eastern European countries _ including
Russia and the Ukraine _ and will allow government employees
stationed there to leave if they choose to avoid Y2K-related
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic events are more likely overseas _ but catastrophes
happen there all the time, said Leon Kappelman, associate professor
of business computer information systems at the University of North
Texas and co-chairman of the Society for Information Management's
Year 2000 Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will we know if it's Y2K-related?'' he said. ``We need to
be careful about how information is interpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 1, 2000, will happen first in the island nations near the
International Date Line, and move west. The first large nations to
feel the effects will be those in Asia and the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry that unrest, kicked off by problems there,
will spread as people in Western time zones anticipate problems.
Sensational news coverage of those events could cause panic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that most experts predict relatively smooth
sailing in the United States, they still recommend that people take
some precautions.
</P>
<P>
   De Jager suggests having at least two to three weeks of food and
water on hand. Others have suggested having enough cash or
travelers' checks _ which are more secure and do not stress bank
supplies of cash _ to last through the long holiday weekend.

CONGRESS EXPECTS AMTRAK ON TRACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amtrak, the government-owned rail passenger service, has a
drop-dead date in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the system is required by Congress to meet its
operational costs. That doesn't mean Amtrak would have the same
burden as your business or mine.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government would still pay for Amtrak's capital
costs _ locomotives, cars and all the other physical objects it
needs to operate. Amtrak will be allowed to survive, according to
Congress, if it can simply take in enough revenues to pay its
operating costs _ fuel, rail rental, salaries, maintenance and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has made substantial progress toward that goal, says the
General Accounting Office _ the nonpartisan investigative and
accounting office that audits government entities. But there's no
assurance that it's going to actually make that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Since Amtrak took over intercity rail passenger service from the
private railroads in 1971, taxpayers have picked up $23 billion of
its costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 federal fiscal year that just ended, Amtrak's net
loss was $907 million _ $23 million less than projected and down
from $930 million the year before. That $930 million was, however,
the highest operating net loss in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EXPRESS TRAIN COULD HELP _ FAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet the 2002 deadline, in the next two years it
must cut costs five times as much as it has done in the prior four
years, the GAO reports. And part of the savings looks awfully
suspect. For example, the rail corporation says it plans to save
$160 million a year in productivity gains and other reforms that
will be explained at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The rail passenger corporation says it can meet its goals
primarily by increasing revenues. It has two main programs to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a series of high-speed trains that Amtrak is
calling Acela Express. The trains, capable of reaching 150 mph, are
due to start first on the Washington, D.C.-New York-Boston route.
Other Acela routes are planned south from Washington to Virginia,
North and South Carolina and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, high-speed routes are planned between California
cities and Las Vegas and a nine-state hub and spoke train system in
the Midwest centered on Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak believes these routes will pull people from airplanes
since _ adding in the time it takes to go to and from airports and
mandatory airline check-in time _ they will take less time than
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the hyped Acela service, due to start in December
on the East Coast, has been pushed back to next spring. Tests of
the train found excessive wheel wear. Amtrak won't be able to use
the trains until that problem is solved.
</P>
<P>
   The rail company also is counting on increased revenues from
attaching freight cars to its passenger trains to haul high-value
goods, such as fresh fruit and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEADLINE MAY BE PUSHED BACK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to enter that kind of freight business, Amtrak is going to
have to buy specialized equipment that has yet to be tested in the
marketplace, the GAO says. Even if the system works, the GAO adds,
Amtrak is going to have trouble finding the money to buy that
equipment. Congress has given Amtrak $1.6 billion for equipment in
the next three years. But Amtrak has already announced it will wind
up using $1 billion of that money for routine maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going to happen if Amtrak doesn't reach break-even by
the deadline? The best answer comes from a recent hearing before
the U.S. House ground transportation subcommittee. After hearing
the gloomy report from the GAO about Amtrak's finances, much of the
questioning of Amtrak representatives was along the lines of how
soon could the rail corporation start running trains in their
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   If Amtrak doesn't meet its deadline, then in all probability new
deadlines will be set.
</P>
<P>
   What Congress doesn't want to face is that none of the 42
national rail services worldwide breaks even. All are subsidized by
their governments.
</P>
<P>
   The private railroads couldn't compete head-to-head with the
airlines for passengers and not lose money. Neither can a
government rail corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, airports and air traffic control systems also receive
money from taxes. But there is a great difference. The air system's
subsidy comes overwhelmingly from taxes paid by airline passengers
and on aviation fuel. Amtrak's subsidy comes out of the general
fund _ primarily made up of income taxes paid by individual
taxpayers.

FRAGGING BRAGGING RIGHTS GO TO QUAKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of the Death Match _ and we're talking computer games here,
not professional wrestling _ are in heaven this Christmas season.
They've got not one, but two highly anticipated titles that focus
on multiplayer mayhem: id Software's Quake III Arena and Epic
Games' Unreal Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that there are two also means that the
hard-core gaming community, which can be more partisan than
Republicans and Democrats, now has something new to argue about.
Which is the better game?
</P>
<P>
   This seems to happen every year that id puts out a title in its
vaunted Quake franchise, generally considered the pinnacle of the
3-D, first-person shooter genre. In 1996, the challenger to the
original Quake was Duke Nukem 3D. And in 1998, it was Quake II vs.
the original Unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these new games have the goal of bringing new blood _ so
to speak _ into the ranks of death-match players. In a death-match
game, combatants hunt each other down in surreal environments using
over-the-top weapons, trying to score the most kills, or frags, and
avoid being fragged themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these games are violent, and yes, they're politically
incorrect. But they're also a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are similar. Each has a
single-player component that uses computer-generated enemies _
called bots _ to simulate an online competition between human
players. This gives newcomers to the genre a chance to get used to
its conventions and develop some skills before hopping online and
taking on the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Both games also make it easier to find free Internet servers on
which to play, considered crucial if online gaming _ regardless of
the type of game _ is to grow. In the past, it's been frustratingly
difficult for novices to figure out how to get into a contest.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over which game is better has been playing out for
weeks in chat rooms and Internet discussion forums since the games
were released. It's time to add my voice to the cacophony.
</P>
<P>
   _ Graphics: Advantage, Quake III. If you've got a powerful
enough graphics card, nothing will prepare you for the visual
beauty of Quake III. The artists and 3-D modelers at id Software
have done an astounding job, creating worlds that will make your
jaw drop. In fact, the game is so beautiful, you're tempted to quit
fighting and just wander around, gawking. That, of course, would be
a fatal mistake.
</P>
<P>
   John Carmack, the genius programmer at id who creates the main
3-D software, or engine, for the company's titles has outdone
himself. Quake III Arena is filled with rich, organic textures that
pulse and throb. Gone are the dull reds, browns, yellows and greens
that characterized the past Quake games _ the levels here are
filled with color and detail. The engine allows for curved
surfaces, which make a remarkable difference in how realistic its
environments appear.
</P>
<P>
   Unreal Tournament, while also visually impressive, just doesn't
match up. It still looks like a Quake II-era game, boxy and static,
with relatively muted colors. Programmer Tim Sweeney has done some
interesting things with lighting and texture, but overall it pales
in comparison. Unreal Tournament does have one leg up on Quake III
_ it doesn't require as powerful a graphics card to look good.
</P>
<P>
   _ User-friendliness. Advantage, Unreal Tournament. In the past,
you've had to be a knowledgeable computer user to set up
first-person shooters. Although some configuration choices have
been available in menus, most of the ``good stuff'' has been hidden
in arcane commands you must type in manually at a hidden command
prompt known as the console.
</P>
<P>
   Unreal Tournament changes all that. It uses a slick,
Windows-style menu that lets you tweak almost every aspect
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   While Quake III does have a much better interface than previous
games in the series, there are still dozens of commands that must
be entered via the console. Even worse, id doesn't document these
commands _ users are left to search for them on fan Web sites. If
the company isn't going to tie them to a menu, it should at least
include a detailed list in the box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newbie-friendliness. Advantage, Unreal Tournament. Both games
are trying to appeal to two audiences: longtime fans of death
matches and novices. This is not easy to do, since what works for
one often frustrates the other. Unreal Tournament does a better job
of walking the line.
</P>
<P>
   Both games have an initial training area, but Unreal
Tournament's provides much more information, and in fact spreads it
out over four levels. It presumes the player knows nothing, even
explaining the term ``frag.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, I think id made a big error by forcing all players to use
what's known as freelook, in which mouse movement is used to look
around, as opposed to moving back and forth. This can be
disorienting for those who've never played a first-person, 3-D
game. In older Quake games, and in Unreal Tournament, you can turn
this off with a menu item, but in Quake III Arena it requires the
aforementioned, arcane console commands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playability _ Advantage, Quake III. This is the category of
most dispute among fans of these games, but I have to come down
squarely on the side of Quake III Arena.
</P>
<P>
   I define playability as the feel of the game _ its smoothness,
3-D ease of movement and how well its worlds are designed. These
factors, combined with graphics, contribute to immersion _ whether
you can truly get lost in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Quake III's movement is silky, whether you're playing online or
in single-player mode, and its physics very realistic. Its 30
levels are smartly laid out and full of surprises. Although you
could fault the levels for sameness _ there are plenty of
castle-like mazes and platforms suspended in space _ they have
become id's signature. It's what players expect and want in a Quake
game.
</P>
<P>
   Although Unreal Tournament's 50 levels have more variety _
players compete in environments ranging from a ship at sea to an
asteroid _ they're difficult to navigate, and the game's overall
movement seems choppy and harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bots. Tie. In both games, you can adjust the skill level of
the computer-generated players. At the lowest level, the bots in
Quake III and Unreal Tournament are ridiculously bad opponents. As
you move up the skill ladder, they become tougher, and the top
level for both games is a serious challenge even for the best human
players. In fact, at the highest settings, the bots almost never
miss, making them less realistic.
</P>
<P>
   I think the bots in Quake III behave more realistically in
general death-match play, while the bots in Unreal Tournament
really shine when playing cooperative games, such as Capture the
Flag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Variety. Advantage, Unreal Tournament. While I'm more a fan of
simple free-for-all and one-on-one death-match games, I have to
hand it to Unreal Tournament in this category. Its developers have
included many kinds of game types, from the familiar Capture the
Flag to cooperative variants such as Assault and Domination.
Besides free-for-all and one-on-one, Quake III Arena only offers
team death-match and Capture the Flag. And for the latter, there
are only four levels included.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I find myself favoring Quake III Arena just for its
sheer eye candy and smooth play. I like my death-match games simple
and uncomplicated, and Quake III is the ultimate death-match game.
However, Unreal Tournament may be a better choice for newcomers, or
for those who have grown weary of the simplicity of just shooting
everything that moves.
</P>
<P>
   You can try out both for free and decide for yourself. Both are
available in playable demo versions. Get Quake III Arena's demo for
Windows, Macintosh and Linux machines at www.quake3arena.com.
Unreal Tournament's Windows-only demo is at

GETTING ALL ICONS WHERE YOU WANT THEM IS POSSIBLE, BUT IT MIGHT
SLOW YOU DOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've managed to put all my icons on the Windows 98
toolbars/trays at the bottom of the screen except My Computer and
the Norton Recycle Bin. I've tried without success to remove them
from the wallpaper portion on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A: It never fails to amaze me the lengths some folks will go to
get their desktops just the way they like them.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine your taskbar is quite cluttered with icons, something
I can't stand. My desktop is covered with icons, which you
obviously dislike. This is why they're called ``personal''
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I have bad news for you. Some icons have to stay
where they are, and those are two of them. However, there is a
virtual sleight-of-hand you can try if you're willing to put up
with a more sluggish machine.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Windows 98, or are running Internet Explorer 4.0 or
later on top of Windows 95, you can have the Windows desktop
displayed as a Web page. Among other things, this lets you use
HTML, the language in which Web pages are written, to display
useful things on your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   This is how some PC makers create some of the fancy desktop
effects often seen when you first bring home a computer from the
store.
</P>
<P>
   You can turn on the feature by right-clicking on the Windows
desktop and clicking on Active Desktop from the menu that appears.
Next, click ``View as Web page.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make your remaining desktop icons vanish, open
any folder, click View and then Folder Options. Click the View tab,
and scroll down to the Visual Settings category. You'll see ``Hide
icons when desktop is viewed as Web page.'' Check it, click Apply
and OK, and presto! Your remaining icons will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   However, so will the zippy performance of your computer. Viewing
the desktop as a Web page slows down your display, particularly if
you run at a high resolution _ say, 1,024-by-768 or above _ and
with a high color depth, such as 32-bit color.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've just discovered the Usenet news groups, and I am really
hooked! There's a lot of junk in a lot of the groups I'm reading,
and someone suggested to me I can clean some of it out with my
``killfile.'' What is a killfile? I use Netscape Messenger to read
Usenet, and I don't see anything in the menus or in the Help file
that mentions anything about a killfile.
</P>
<P>
   A: A killfile is a term derived from Unix software used to read
Usenet groups in the early days of the Internet. Although most
modern-day Windows and Macintosh news group readers have the
ability to do what it does, few of them call it that.
</P>
<P>
   A killfile is basically a filter. When your news reader sorts
the messages in a Usenet group, the filter can hide messages you
don't want to see. When you're going through the list, trying to
pick out messages to read, you don't see messages that fit the
criteria in your filter.
</P>
<P>
   In Messenger, you can get to the filters through the Edit menu
item. In Outlook Express, look under Tools, then Message Rules,
then News.
</P>
<P>
   Why would you want to do this? You might not want to read the
posts of a particularly obnoxious individual _ and, unfortunately,
Usenet is full of 'em _ or you might want to try to filter out the
spam that clogs many of the groups. You could probably avoid half
the spam on Usenet by filtering for the phrase ``make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know of a program that can move a Windows 95
application from one drive letter to another, and make all the
necessary registry changes, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Symantec's CleanSweep (originally developed by Quarterdeck)
has a transport option that will do this, but I've found it doesn't
always work as it should. It often misses a registry entry or two.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the original installation disks for the program, the
best thing to do is back up the data generated by the software,
uninstall it and then reinstall it on the new drive.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few Saturdays ago, the Yarn Co. on the Upper West
Side, a small, cramped store covered wall to wall with yarn, was
packed with people, most of them in their 20s and 30s and a few of
them men. Some were feeling their way through the shelves of soft
skeins of cashmere and mohair, some were knitting busily at a big
table in the middle of the room.
</P>
<P>
   The place felt like the Barneys New York warehouse, not a yarn
store. Where were the ugly acrylic yarns? Where was the gray-haired
lady pushing bad sweater patterns?
</P>
<P>
   These days, you won't find either in the handful of yarn stores
around the city. They are selling out of gorgeous, luxury yarns and
their classes are filled weeks in advance _ mostly by young
professionals, with a surprising number of men.
</P>
<P>
   When the Craft Yarn Council of America sponsored a ``Knit Out''
in Union Square this past October, 7,000 people showed up.
Charlotte Quiggle, the former program chairwoman of the Big Apple
Knitters Guild, who helped put on the event, said the instructors
in the teaching area literally had to push people back. ``I don't
want to say knitting is in vogue,'' she said, ``but it's sort of
the `it' craft right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Women dressed in business clothing can be seen knitting away on
the subway and in airports, and even at Starbucks, lost in their
work as others juggle coffee and books. It is not unique to New
York, either. Membership in the Knitting Guild of America has
increased by 10 percent in three years, said its founder, Carol
Wigginton. Actresses such as Julia Roberts and models such as Amber
Valletta and Stella Tennant, whose jobs are laden with downtime to
fill, have become hooked on knitting. At L'Atelier, a yarn store in
Santa Monica, Calif., Leslie Stormon, an owner, said: ``It's
getting busier and busier as the years have gone on. And younger
and younger.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her clients is Monica Lewinsky. She knitted through
President Clinton's impeachment hearings, staying out of sight of
the press and public, and has since designed a knitting bag for
sale to hold skeins and needles. College students are taking up
knitting with fervor. Knitting circles have been formed at Southern
Oregon University and Sarah Lawrence College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people knit while they're studying,'' Catherine Shu, a
freshman at Sarah Lawrence, said. ``I knit while watching `The
Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   I have been fascinated by the idea of taking two sticks to loop
yarn into a sturdy fabric since I was in 4H, when I was 10. Like
cooking and building, knitting is a survival craft: it is tactile
and has the same magical qualities as rubbing two sticks together
to make a fire. Three months ago I decided to finally learn and
signed up for a class at the Yarn Co. Jordana Merlis, an owner, 30,
wearing smart glasses and great clothing, took my name and said
there was a monthlong wait.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to pick up the craft now because I thought knitting
would be a way to escape and a way to work a little peace into my
life. Besides, I wanted one of those of-the-moment knit ponchos and
wasn't going to pay $300 at a NoLIta boutique for it. Fashion has
largely driven the resurgence of knitting. It began two seasons
ago, said Ann Regis, an owner of Gotta Knit in Greenwich Village,
when Yohji Yamamoto showed big chunky knits. Alexander McQueen
weighed in, too, with a huge, exaggerated knit sweater that looked
like a stretched out sock made for a giant.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers have followed. From Barneys to downtown
boutiques, shelves are crammed with expensive hand knits this
season. Claire Blaydon, a designer on Mott Street, reconstructs old
sweaters to give them new innovative shapes. Down the block at
Janet Russo, they commission a home knitter to make hats for the
store. Catherine Malandrino, a designer and an owner of Catherine
on Broome Street, carries knit accessories like bags, hats and
scarves and specializes in oversize knit shawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are tired of looking like they're cloned,''
said Ms. Malandrino, who contracts 50 knitters here and in Europe
to make her designs. Buying a unique hand-knit sweater is an act of
defiance against companies like the Gap and Banana Republic, who
some feel have essentially reduced the fashion of the masses to
seasonal uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the mass merchants have caught onto the trend. Many
chain stores and catalogs sell funking-looking knits, and this fall
even the Gap sold sweaters with the label ``Knit by Hand.'' Only
the fine print revealed that all the quaint knitting actually takes
place in China. When the buying public got the message that
knitwear didn't have to mean another boring sweater, but could be
more creative, amateur knitters surfaced in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing knits in stores everywhere, but they're too
expensive,'' said Thyrza Meulens, 31, who got started knitting at
the ``Knit Out'' in Union Square. Knitting has given her an
artistic outlet, she said, and a way to duplicate what she sees in
the stores. She has almost finished a sweater and a gray mohair
scarf.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I took my lesson at the Yarn Co. in October. Within five
minutes, Ms. Merlis had me and three other young women knitting. It
wasn't pretty. My hands were rigid, and the needles felt like fat
paintbrushes that I had to use to paint a coin-size portrait. That
poncho seemed far in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   But yarn stores know how to soften the frustrations of new
knitters and get us past that first typically deformed sweater.
``We steer them toward instant gratification projects,'' Ms. Regis
said. That means scarves, baby sweaters and sweaters made with
needles the size of turkey basters.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of my class, I was started on a sweater. A baby
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   As original as taking up knitting seemed, it turns out I am just
a typical young urban knitter. We come to the craft with ambition
and expensive taste. Those acrylic Kleenex cozies of yore are not
on the project list; nor are ordinary wool scarves. Rebecca Rosen,
the creative director at Stacy Charles Collection, a maker and
importer of luxury yarns, said the surprisingly big sales of its
large gauge cashmere yarns this season caught her off guard. ``We
can't fill the orders basically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Knitters have also been snapping up hand-painted yarns in
variegated colors. At Cherry Tree Hill Yarn in East Montpelier,
Vt., a maker of these yarns, sales have more than doubled in the
last year. Cheryl Potter, the owner of the company, said she
expects the same growth next year. Malo, an Italian cashmere
company, introduced a knitting kit this year called
``Thesweaterthatisn't.'' It contains eight skeins of white
cashmere, a pair of needles, a drawstring cashmere bag _ and no
pattern _ for $979.
</P>
<P>
   For that much, you'd better hope you don't drop a stitch.
</P>
<P>
   Today's knitters, especially novices, ``want something real
luxurious and something that knits quickly,'' Ms. Potter said.
``They want to make sure that their time is well spent.'' Those
chunky sweaters are like writing with crayons: the fatter the yarn,
the fewer stitches per inch.
</P>
<P>
   The Yarn Co., which has been open for about 20 years, was bought
two years ago by Ms. Merlis and Julie Israel, 31. Gotta Knit opened
last year. These and others, including the Yarn Connection on
Madison Avenue, have done away with outdated patterns. They now
stock ones for the latest fashions, and if they don't have one,
they will write patterns for you. At Gotta Knit, so many customers
requested patterns for a chunky turtleneck vest by BCBG advertised
in fashion magazines that store employees even knitted a mock-up
for display.
</P>
<P>
   The last time knitting enjoyed a boom was nearly 20 years ago,
when earthy bohemian clothing was in style the first time around.
Before that, knitting was just another household skill, like
cooking and sewing. Not all women knitted, but most knew how. In
the 1990s, it has become a means of balancing our hectic lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw this Zen thing happening and gardening and staying
home and being quiet,'' said Melanie Falick, the editor of
Interweave Knits, a knitting magazine. ``You can see a correlation
between knitting and things like gardening. Everything is so fast,
and there has to be something in our lives that goes slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   My sweater was definitely going slowly. There were moments where
I felt I had fallen into a state of meditation, but mostly I was
concentrating on keeping the sweater from turning into a sock.
Knitting requires fine, precise, quite beautiful movements. They
don't come immediately to everyone, but good knitters tell me it
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Its relaxing qualities have been drawing men to the craft, as
well. John Buscaglia, a psychotherapist in Manhattan, learned to
knit some years ago. Now, it is his method of relaxation. He knits
between sessions with patients to clear his mind. ``The repetitive
motion is trance inducing,'' he said. ``It's like meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Rosensweig, an art director in Manhattan, also knits,
but like many male knitters, he does it only in the privacy of his
home. ``I've been asked to go to these knitting circles,'' he said,
``but somehow _ it was probably convenience _ I've never been able
to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buscaglia, on the other hand, thinks nothing of whipping out his
knitting bag on the airplane. ``It raises some eyebrows,'' he said,
``The women will stop and will chat and will talk about their
experiences knitting or crocheting. The men just get stiff and
uptight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a woman, I feel a little uncomfortable bringing my
knitting on the train. Knitting still seems asocial and nerdy. But
I plan to get over that. Part of the reason I took it up was
because it is such a portable hobby. It can be carried in a small
bag and worked on in spurts, on the subway, in the car, even in the
movie theater _ anywhere that you are sitting down and don't need
to make eye contact. I also like that you can knit and do something
else at the same time _ though at this point, if I tried to read
and knit at once I might lose an eye.
</P>
<P>
   I have half a sleeve to go on that little green sweater I
started five weeks ago. I hope to give it to my baby niece, if she
still can fit into it. At this point she's growing faster than I'm
knitting.

LOVE THE WORKERS? SAY IT WITH CASH

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Employees at the Tate Agency expected to spend Monday
afternoon coming up with a new design of the public relations
firm's sales brochure. After ordering lunch, they settled into the
conference room with their notepads and sharp pencils.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone got too intent on strategizing, Judy Katrana, the
firm's president, announced the brainstorming story was just a ruse
and they were going to a mall for the next two hours. A limousine
was downstairs ready to whisk everyone away. And then Katrana
passed out $200 in cash to each employee with the directive: Spend
it on yourselves. No gifts for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The seven employees looked as surprised as if a naked man had
lept into the conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' several stunned employees said.
</P>
<P>
   They tucked their new stash of $20s into their purses and
pockets and filed into the waiting limo, which was complete with
champagne. It was a bit like suddenly winning big on the hit TV
show ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies reward their employees for hard work at this time
of year. But some employers such as Katrana are going beyond the
traditional holiday party.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday parties are often stressful, Katrana said. Instead, she
wanted to be creative in the way she rewarded her hard-working
employees by getting them something that they normally wouldn't buy
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt that the employees feel special _ which
tends to happen when you're cruising through Houston in a stretch
limo drinking French champagne.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A CHEAP LUNCH BEFORE THE SPREE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a quick lunch at Chick-Fil-A _ after all, they were out of
the office to shop, not to eat _ the group fanned out to buy shoes,
leather jackets and a food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Wenske wasn't having any of that _ she was on the hunt
for major jewelry. She started at Tiffany's, Wenske's favorite
store, where she perused the mid-range jewelry collection. Nothing
struck her fancy, so she pulled out her cell phone and called her
friend _ an accountant with a fabulous jewelry collection _ and
asked where to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to find a totally lasting piece of jewelry, not just a
shirt or anything,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend suggested a jewelry line at Neiman-Marcus, so Wenske
was off in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a $595 necklace, nothing caught her eye, so Wenske
called another friend, who suggested a trip to Saks Fifth Avenue.
Forty-five minutes later, Wenske was agonizing again in front of
the jewelry counter at Saks.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be surprised how stressful _ and how hard _ it is to spend
$200 cash in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   With the money burning a hole in her pocket and with only 30
minutes remaining, Wenske chased back to Neimans and finally found
the ring she had been looking for: a blue topaz creation. Wenske
kicked in an extra $95 and it was hers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`BETTER THAN A TRADITIONAL PARTY' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shopping extravaganza was a little easier for Darren K.
Craig, the only man in the group. After he discovered it would take
two weeks before he would receive a $195 stereo from the Sharper
Image (``I want instant gratification''), Craig went to J. Crew,
where he chose a suede jacket and wool sweater.

   ``This is much better than a traditional party,'' said Craig, as
he slipped on the jacket in the dressing room. ``Everybody has done

   Lou Moore, manager of marketing, bought the Raymond Weil watch
she has had her eye on for quite some time. It cost more than
$1,000, so the $200 helped quite a bit. The remainder will come
from family gifts that she expects to receive this Christmas.

   The group collapsed in the white stretch limo, where there was
another bottle of champagne waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time in a limo,'' said account supervisor
Dottie Roark, who ran her hand across the leather upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros and the others modeled their new ensembles when the
group got back to the office. Everyone oohed and aahed as they
dived into a plate of Christmas cookies and showed off their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Judy,'' they shouted. ``You're welcome, kids,'' said
the Santa in the business suit.

2000 FERRARI 36 MODENA: INSIDE, ROOM TO MOVE, (AND, YES, IT
MOVES)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAN NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were a Nobel Prize for sports cars, the motor heads who
designed the Ferrari 360 Modena could start packing their bags for
Stockholm right now.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there is no such award, despite the fact that the Modena _
named for the central Italian city where Enzo Ferrari, the
company's late founder, was born 101 years ago _ will spread
infinitely more joy around the world than the latest hermetic
dissertation on economics. After all, what teen-ager puts a poster
of Milton Friedman on the wall?
</P>
<P>
   Annually, only about 2,000 souls worldwide will be allowed to
pony up $150,000 to enjoy the Modena firsthand. That sounds like a
lot up to the moment you twist the aluminum key in the ignition.
The first contralto strains of the 395-horsepower engine set loose
butterflies in your stomach and you think, ``Ah, that's why it's so
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Running through the gears at full throttle, the Modena slams you
back like a great ocean wave, squeezes you breathless in corners
taken flat out, jams you against the shoulder belt with its mighty
brakes. Alighting passengers are reduced to dumbfounded utterances
like ``wow'' and ``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Modena replaces the F355 as the company's midengine
V8-powered supercar, and it surpasses the F355 in all the
predictable ways. The Modena accelerates, brakes and corners harder
than the F355.It is even more savagely beautiful, more sullen and
sloe-eyed, menacing and concupiscent _ qualities the more
surprising if you consider that the styling was largely dictated by
the blind eye of aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   The 360 also advances the trend of user-friendliness established
by Ferrari's chairman, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, in the last
decade. With a longer wheelbase and body, the 360 is much better
packaged than the F355. The cabin is larger, even spacious, with
excellent outward visibility _ the better to see yourself being
envied.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in and out is far easier than in the broad-silled F355.
The thickly padded steering wheel is adjustable for reach and rake;
the Connolly leather seats adjust to accommodate even Bill
Bradley-sized drivers. The controls and instruments are simple and
elegant, trimmed in brushed, anodized aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is there a generous trunk (in the nose), there is a
shelf behind the seats to accommodate the Connolly golf bag (a
$1,500 option). For a midengine car, this is the ergonomic
equivalent of the triple lutz.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest improvement in functionality is the F-1 gearbox,
a $9,500 option. Introduced on the F355 three years ago and since
refined, it uses paddles mounted behind the steering wheel at the 6
and 9 o'clock positions to shift gears. To upshift, the driver tugs
on the right paddle; to downshift, on the left. There is no clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Porsche's Tiptronic transmission (and its many
imitators), which is essentially an advanced automatic transmission
that can be shifted manually, the F-1 gearbox uses Ferrari's
standard six-speed synchromesh fitted with an electronic
gear-changing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   To engage neutral, the driver pulls back on both paddles; a
luminescent ``N'' appears on the tachometer's gear selection
window. Under way, the paddles engage gears sequentially, the
crispness of the shift determined by the throttle position. Under
hard throttle, the car upshifts at the 8,500 rpm red line with a
sudden jarring BANG! _ which under certain conditions can upset the
balance of the car. For this reason, the paddles do not move with
the steering wheel, to discourage shifting in midcorner.
</P>
<P>
   In performance driving, the main advantage of the F-1 box is
that the driver can downshift quickly under hard braking, and the
car's central computer _ controlling the throttle with electronic
drive-by-wire technology _ will instantly match the engine speed
with the selected gear faster than the best drivers can. This
technology was perfected in Formula One racing, and Ferrari plans
to license it to unidentified American companies next year.
</P>
<P>
   For those not in the mood to shift gears, there is a fully
automatic mode, activated by a switch on the console; a T-shaped
switch nearby engages reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension underneath consists of all-aluminum A-arms, hubs
and anti-roll bars. Keeping the wheels steady are aluminum shocks
and springs with an electronic damping control.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferrari knows when you are pitching it into a hard corner
and will stiffen the damping to reduce body roll. When you are
cruising in sixth gear on the interstate, it will automatically
relax the suspension for a smoother ride.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension has two settings: normal and sport, which is
stiffer; various other functions, like the degree of intervention
in the traction control and antilock brakes, also respond to the
choice of modes.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the supercar trend, the Modena has relatively narrow
tires (215/45 ZR 18 in front, 275/40 ZR 18 in back). Smaller tires
improve driving quality _ great slabs of rubber tend to hunt along
every crack and crevice in the road and will cause a low-slung car
to hydroplane like a low-slung boat. Smaller tires also enhance
fuel economy _ still a profligate 14 miles per gallon in mixed
city-highway driving _ reduce aerodynamic resistance and hush road
noise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in corners, smaller tires don't hang on quite as long as big
ones. To compensate, Ferrari again dipped into its bag of Formula
One racing tricks. The body shape of the Modena generates what is
known as down force. The bottom of the car is flat, like a Hot
Wheels car, with twin cavities at the rear channeling air that
would otherwise get trapped under the car, causing it to lift and
become unstable at speed.
</P>
<P>
   This is ground-effects technology straight out of racing. At
around 120 mph, the Modena's body shape generates 400 pounds of
down force, clamping the car to the track with an invisible
aerodynamic hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferrari's steering is laser sharp and telepathically quick.
If you can think your way through a hairpin, the Modena will stay
with you like Deion Sanders covering a deep pass. When the limits
of tire adhesion are finally reached, the car gives up traction
with gently progressive oversteer, rotating the rear toward the
outside of the turn. The Modena dashes from zero to 60 in just 4.3
seconds, and is a very safe car to drive hard.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be the quickest-stopping road car on the market: the
nearly 12-inch Brembo disc brakes bring the Modena to a chattering
stop in an incredible 110 feet from 60 miles an hour, according to
Road and Track magazine.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you can credit the car's fairly light weight, around
3,000 pounds. The porpoise-tight skin of the Ferrari is fashioned
out of aluminum. The chassis, a high-tech confection of extruded
and welded aluminum beams and cast aluminum joints, is light and
enormously stiff _ no rattles or squeaks and no untoward shaking of
body parts when you hit those forgotten railroad tracks at 70 mph.
This thing feels as if it were built by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of any Ferrari is the engine, and this
all-aluminum V8 is gloriously displayed under the broad rear
window. The engine bay is dominated by huge intake tubing connected
to two manifolds painted in the traditional red wrinkle finish.
</P>
<P>
   This 3.6-liter, 40-valve V8 reaches its peak horsepower at 8,500
rpm and 275 foot-pounds of torque at 4,750 rpm. Equipped with
variable valve timing and variable geometry intake _ all fairly
high-tech means to improve power and driveability _ the Ferrari
motor is tractable enough around town to satisfy a loafing Sunday
driver.
</P>
<P>
   While relatively mellow at lower rpm, when the valves open up
and the throttle throat clears, the Ferrari engine barks out a
spine-tingling song of naked force.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the joys of a six-figure sports car. Yet the 360's
greatest pleasure isn't limited to its owners or even to the
tifosi, the company's fans. Ferraris are important additions to the
visual world. Unlike ordinary cars, whose destiny lies in the
cubism of the car-crusher, Ferraris are perpetual, living to
advanced age in museums and collectors' garages. The 360's styling
is appropriately timeless, a lovely way to mark the end of the
Century of the Automobile. &QL;

A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR IN MICROSOFT'S BITTER PILL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a second round of secrecy-cloaked settlement talks
between Microsoft and the government last week in Chicago. The only
sure thing about these meetings, presided over by Richard A.
Posner, a federal appeals court judge, is that they are hardly
social gatherings; there is no love lost, and a common ground for
compromise will not be easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will not voluntarily agree to the harsher sanctions
being considered by the Justice Department and 19 states _ a
breakup of the company or forced licensing of the programming code
for Windows _ unless Posner proves to be a sorcerer instead of
mediator. And the government will not accept a sin-no-more solution
in which Microsoft signs a settlement that prohibits certain kinds
of conduct or contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any sensible middle ground? That remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California at
Berkeley, has an intriguing proposal. Varian is a leading ``new
economy'' academic who studies the workings of high-technology
markets. He was co-author of a widely praised 1998 book,
``Information Rules,'' with his Berkeley colleague Carl Shapiro,
who was the Justice Department's chief antitrust economist in 1995
and 1996 and is now advising the states on remedies in the
Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement or in court-ordered remedies, Varian says, it is
a foregone conclusion that Microsoft will be swallowing some strong
medicine, considering Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's blunt
findings last month that the company was a monopolist whose tactics
had thwarted competition and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Varian says two measures will be ``an absolute minimum.'' The
first is to make Microsoft publish prices it charges
personal-computer makers for its Windows operating system and to
open up its marketing contracts with PC makers, Internet service
providers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Varian says such pricing and contract ``transparency,''
monitored by a third-party watchdog, would inhibit Microsoft from
using price and other incentives to reward companies that gave its
products favored treatment and punish those that did not _ a key
allegation in the antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The second minimal step, according to Varian, would be to
require Microsoft to publish Windows application program interfaces
and explain how they work. These interfaces, known as APIs, are the
software hooks that enable other companies' programs, from word
processors to games, to run properly on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some software developers contend that Microsoft has ``hidden
APIs'' in Windows that give a leg up to its own applications
business and favored partners. Microsoft dismisses that assertion
as the equivalent of an urban legend. Other developers say the real
problem is that the API documentation from Microsoft is often
misleading or erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   Both steps would help achieve the government's main policy goal
in the antitrust case: to limit Microsoft's ability in new markets
to use Windows monopoly power to its advantage, from server
software to e-commerce. ``But the real issue is what you do beyond
documented APIs and transparent contracts,'' Varian said.
</P>
<P>
   His next step is his innovative contribution to the Microsoft
debate. Varian recommends compulsory licensing of Windows at a deep
discount after a set period. Say the license price for Windows 98
is $55 a copy. After two or three years, the price would drop by
perhaps $30. The timing and discount could be negotiated in a
settlement or determined by a court.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the case, Microsoft has said that it is simply
fighting for the right to innovate and add whatever it wants to its
operating system. ``This plan would really give them an incentive
to innovate, because in two or three years the existing version of
Windows is going to get a lot cheaper,'' Varian explained.
</P>
<P>
   Today, new versions of Windows face competition of sorts from
the old versions, but Microsoft makes sure that PC makers have
every incentive to upgrade at the pace that suits Microsoft. Under
the Varian option, however, manufacturers like Dell Computer,
Gateway and Compaq could offer both and permit consumers to choose
the older, cheaper version if they preferred.
</P>
<P>
   The economic incentives for Microsoft might also change, so that
bundling ever more features into a bloated operating system stops
making sense. Instead, it might see greater overall profits in
making Windows a leaner, faster, more reliable core operating
system and in marketing new features like voice-recognition
software as a separate product.
</P>
<P>
   The Varian solution is not simple, since it requires a form of
policing and regulation. But there are only complex answers to the
Microsoft problem. Varian's mirrors the logic of patents and
copyrights: the inventor is rewarded with exclusive rights for a
while, but the duration is limited to avoid the social losses from
monopolization.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, the software passes into the compulsory licensing
phase, not into the public domain,'' Varian said. ``But the result
is the same. You would get a temporary monopoly in the intellectual
property that provides a balancing of private incentives and the
public good.''

PANAMA SEES A COLD SHOULDER IN SHUFFLE OF U.S. DELEGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ With the symbolic hand-over of the Panama
Canal just days away, Panamanian officials were given a
disheartening preview of their rapidly changing relationship with
the United States when they learned that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would skip Tuesday's ceremony in order to attend
Mideast peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials were told Thursday of the change. U.S.
officials said the U.S. delegation will instead be headed by former
President Jimmy Carter, who signed the canal treaty with Panamanian
leader Gen. Omar Torrijos. He will be accompanied by some 40
others, including Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, are they going to send us a messenger from the
White House?'' said Roberto Eisenmann, an adviser to President
Mireya Moscoso. ``What a way to mess up something beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright was named the head of the U.S. delegation last
week, after President Clinton had said that scheduling conflicts
prevented him from attending the concluding acts of the 1977
treaties that gave Panama control over the canal and thousands of
acres of military bases. But the perception among many here and in
Washington was that the administration was loathe to revive
conservative resentment over the handover during the presidential
campaign next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. officials were trying to downplay any slight to
Panama, political leaders and commentators here were pained to see
their nation's most historic event be eclipsed by campaign worries
and more pressing foreign policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the United States has lowered their estimation
of us even more,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, a Christian
Democrat and former vice president in the administration of
Guillermo Endara. ``And it evidently reveals the low priority not
only of Panama, but Latin America. The special relationship between
Panama and the United States is disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute change was just the latest in a series of
delayed decisions surrounding the handover ceremonies. Panamanian
officials had moved the original date of the diplomatic ceremony
from December 31, when they will actually receive the canal, to
December 14 at the urging of U.S. officials who said that few
high-ranking officials would be able to attend because of
millennium parties and Y2K fears.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite Panamanian entreaties, Panama was not told until
last month that Clinton would be unable to attend. It was only last
week that Ms. Albright was officially named to lead the delegation,
triggering a scramble to make arrangements in keeping with
protocol. Throughout, the Panamanians accommodated a wearying
series of requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this,'' said one person involved in planning the aborted
visit. ``This is going to leave a bad taste in everybody's mouth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While U.S. officials were said to have tried to make some
hurried replacements to the delegation Friday morning, they did not
have much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``No big names, no midlevel, nothing,'' said one person involved
in the planning. ``No rock stars. Madeleine Albright is the Bruce
Springsteen of foreign affairs. It looks like we're ending up with
Barry Manilow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Panamanians have wondered whether or not the change of
plans was payback for their government's lack of progress in
reaching a security and intelligence sharing agreement with the
United States. Efforts last year to establish a multinational
counterintelligence center failed in the wake of Panamanian
opposition to keeping U.S. troops on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University, who
was unsuccessfully nominated as ambassador to Panama by Clinton,
said the handling of recent events was typical of the
administration's failure to forge new partnerships in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   And Miguel Antonio Bernal, a political scientist, said of
Washington, ``Their attitude is absurd. Fine. Until the 31st of
December, they are the boss. But after that, no.''

WAY MORE THAN MR. BURNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Shearer _ actor, radio host, political commentator _ may
be a little bit of everywhere these days but one place he won't be
on New Year's Eve is out on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel about the millennium the way I do about New Year's Eve
generally _ it's a holiday for civilians,'' he said. ``Like most
people in show business, if I'm not working that night, I'll be
home. In this case, entertaining my in-laws.''
</P>
<P>
   You may not immediately recognize the name, but you will the
voice and maybe the face. Shearer, you see, is one of those
ubiquitous talents who gets around.
</P>
<P>
   Creator and star of the seminal fake rockumentary ``This Is
Spinal Tap,'' Shearer voices Mr. Burns and 19 other characters on
TV's ``The Simpsons,'' hosts public radio's weekly ``Le Show'' and
has appeared in such feature films as ``Godzilla,'' ``The Truman
Show,'' ``edTV'' and ``The Right Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he find the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder that myself sometimes,'' he says. ``It's a pretty
full week. But with the radio show, I've always believed I could do
it way into the future, as long as I can make room for it in the
rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   A former writer and cast member on ``Saturday Night Live,''
Shearer unbuckles the Beltway in ``It's the Stupidity, Stupid''
(Random House; $16.95), a shrewd look at the Clinton administration
and why it has inspired such fervent hatred in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Shearer debunks Hillary Clinton's ``vast right-wing
conspiracy,'' arguing that ``a conspiracy by its nature should be a
fairly tightly controlled operation, like the Mafia or
Scientology.''

   Shearer _ whose long-running ``Le Show'' airs on KCRW-FM (89.9)
at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Sundays _ will appear in conversation with
humorist and fellow curmudgeon Fran Lebowitz tonight at UCLA's
Royce Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be Fran and Harry having a good old-fashioned
conversation,'' Shearer explained the other day. ``When Fran gets
into town, we'll have a pre-chat about what bees are under our
particular bonnets. Life is preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebowitz is author of two collections of humorous essays,
``Metropolitan Life'' and ``Social Studies,'' which have recently
been collected in the ``Fran Lebowitz Reader'' (Vintage Books;
$14).
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Mirabella, the irascible Lebowitz was
at her mordant best. On Bill Clinton: ``He's a prom king. He's a
boy. He wants to be really popular, in a teen-aged sense. ... And
this is not what you'd call presidential material. You don't want a
president who liked high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The short, soft-spoken Shearer, too, frequently targets the
Clintons on his weekly radio program, currently in its 15th year on
KCRW. A recurring ``Le Show'' feature is the slickly produced
``Clinton-something,'' a ``Friends''-type takeoff of daily life at
the White House, which alternates with readings from obscure trade
journals and New Orleans r&AMP;b music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get many things out of the show,'' says the Santa
Monica-based Shearer, who turns 56 on Dec. 23. ``It scratches an
itch. It's a place where I have access to a large audience each
week without any interference or censorship. That's rare and
valuable, even though I sometimes curse the fact I have to do it
every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearer's radio days actually began in the mid-'60s at KRLA-AM,
where he was part of the Credibility Gap comedy troupe, which
offered an irreverent daily look at current events. A child actor
in ``Abbott and Costello Go to Mars'' (1953), Shearer also played
the role of Eddie Haskell in the pilot episode of ``Leave It to
Beaver.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shearer _ who has been dubbed a calmer James Carville or a
liberal P.J. O'Rourke _ has long been involved in parody. He quit
``Saturday Night Live'' twice because his skits were getting
produced less frequently, and he played dim-bulb bassist Derek
Smalls in the classic ``Spinal Tap'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Shearer is working on another book and plans
to shoot a digital film.
</P>
<P>
   ``With digital cameras, it's possible to do a movie for much
lower cost,'' the humorist explained. ``It tends to be more
actor-friendly. Plus, you can shoot in smaller spaces and be more
flexible.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
Who: Harry Shearer and Fran Lebowitz. &QL; 
Where: Royce Hall, UCLA campus, Westwood. &QL; 
When: 8 p.m. Saturday. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans, who have always looked at supermarkets as cornucopias
of calories, are increasingly finding fare of a different kind in
the grocery aisles. Stacked in the rows of margarines, breakfast
cereals, salad dressings and snacks are elixirs that promise to
fight heart disease, osteoporosis and other ailments. And in some
cases, the products are billed as alternatives to medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about cholesterol? McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a
division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, recently introduced a margarine that
contains an ingredient shown to lower it by about 10 percent with
two weeks of use.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about bacteria that can upset your digestive system?
Snap up a ``digestive biscuit'' or hot chocolate drink that
Novartis plans to introduce in the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   And how about your aging bones? For them, Mead Johnson &AMP; Co., a
subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb, has a little caramel (or
chocolate) candy snack fortified with calcium and Vitamins D and K.
</P>
<P>
   Children, too, will soon have their choice of health-promoting
treats. The Gerber Baby Food Co. plans to introduce a snack for
preschoolers with a compound that is supposed to improve their
concentration. The agent, docosa hexaenoic acid, is already being
fed to Japanese schoolchildren to improve their grades.
</P>
<P>
   After some initial stumbles, the world's largest drug and
consumer-goods companies are back with plans to introduce a growing
number of these products, known as functional foods.
</P>
<P>
   Defined broadly as items that provide an enhanced health
benefit, functional foods go far beyond the low-fat, no-fat,
organic and sugar-free products that have been sold for years as
healthier alternatives to regular food. With claims to remedy some
widespread ailments and ward off others, functional foods are seen
by their makers as natural grub for aging baby boomers intent on
living long, robust lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are linked now by one common interest,'' said John
Troup, the head of worldwide nutritional research and development
at Novartis. ``Everybody wants to live longer but nobody wants to
grow older.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, functional foods have raised far more
controversy than they have lowered cholesterol levels. Critics
contend that some manufacturers exaggerate the products' health
benefits, especially when the brand may contain ingredients that do
as much harm as good. For example, some products intended to lower
cholesterol can reduce the body's vitamins, according to some
nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of quackery,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive
director of Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer
group in Washington. ``Some companies are making outrageous claims
that probably don't provide any benefit other than to their
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices are another issue. The functional foods that have come to
market are so expensive _ sometimes five or six times more than
their nonfortified competitors _ that they may not be worth the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers are having a difficult time rousing sales for
their brands. After selling Benecol brand cholesterol-reducing
margarine, snack bars and salad dressings in the United States for
only seven months, Johnson &AMP; Johnson backtracked this month,
trimming consumer ad spending for the line by two-thirds, according
to analysts' estimates. The analysts attributed the cutback to poor
sales, perhaps a result of high prices _ the Benecol spread sells
for $7.29 for 5.9 ounces at a Food Emporium in New York _ but the
company said the cutback figure was ``way off base,'' adding that
it wanted to redirect its resources to promoting Benecol to
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the functional-food offensive is just beginning. Drug makers
see the foods as a way to parlay their laboratory discoveries
beyond the pharmacy and into grocery stores, while packaged-goods
companies see hot-selling, high-margin products that can foment
stagnant food sales and improve their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has bought into the idea. Consumer-goods analysts
estimate that sales of functional foods in the United States should
top $3 billion this year, or 1 percent of the country's annual
expenditures on food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits are very strong in our grocery segment,'' said Al
Piergallini, the head of worldwide consumer health at Novartis,
which owns Gerber Baby Food and the Ovaltine brand and sells
Sunkist products. ``It's a high-margin business, so it's inviting
to expand our product offerings. We think we can do very well
against our competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence in the market may be wishful thinking, though,
given the market obstacles that loom _ even aside from price.
</P>
<P>
   Though many functional foods are still being sold in test
markets, some brands that have already been introduced have come
without much explanation of how they work, leaving consumers
without an understanding of how to use them. In general, they are
not simply foods. Like pills that treat a chronic illness, most
functional foods have to be used several times a day for weeks to
get the promised benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol, for example, must be taken three times a day as a
spread, snack bar or salad dressing for about two weeks to reduce
cholesterol levels by 10 percent; a sporadic user has little chance
of reducing cholesterol by that amount. The same goes for Take
Control, a similarly fortified spread from Unilever that costs a
little less than Benecol. A prescription drug, meanwhile, like
Lipitor, has been proven to lower cholesterol by 40 percent within
a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Other functional foods have similar problems. EnfaGrow, a Mead
Johnson snack for toddlers, provides a battery of vitamins not
found in some cereals. The EnfaGrow box boasts that zinc is
necessary for cell function, but toddlers had best be pretty hungry
to get their recommended daily allowance of the vitamin. They have
to eat about 3.5 cookies a day to get the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of health-fortified products has baffled
federal regulators. Any company can make a reasonable claim about
the structure or function of a product's ingredients _ that fiber,
for example, promotes digestive health. But if a manufacturer wants
to assert that its product prevents stomach infections, it would
need approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the FDA review for foods is far less thorough than its
approval process for new drugs. There are no requirements for
clinical trials, except for some food additives like sweeteners,
and many compounds used in functional foods do not require
pre-approval from the agency. Usually, makers of functional foods
have to prove to the FDA only that an ingredient is ``generally
recognized as safe.'' That typically means that it has been
consumed without incident or is widely known among scientists.
</P>
<P>
   To set market criteria for functional foods, the FDA has
established 12 ``health claims,'' based on the ingredients, that
manufacturers can use in marketing their products as potential ways
to reduce the risk of diseases. Products high in calcium, for
example, can state that they help reduce the risk of osteoporosis,
while others rich in folic acid can say that they can help reduce
the risks of brain or spinal-cord birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a legal definition of functional food, the FDA has
acknowledged having trouble weighing the nutritional benefits of
some new products. ``We were all once sure what food was,'' said
Dr. Christine Lewis, assistant to the director of the Office for
Special Nutritionals at the FDA. ``Now we're just not sure when a
food becomes functional. It's not anyone's fault. It's a reflection
of the times.''

   MEXICO-VIRGIN _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans' firm Catholic faith is

in an uproar over a letter signed this month by three priests who
have objected to making Juan Diego, a 16th century Aztec Indian, a
saint. Adding insult to injury is the fact that one priest served
in the Virgin's basilica here in the past and another is currently
posted there. The priests say that Diego - who is said to have seen
an apparition of a brown-skinned Virgin in the 1500s _ probably
didn't exist. Those are fighting words to Mexicans of varying
degrees of faith who unite in their reverence for Mexico's Virgin
of Guadalupe. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTO.

 UNDATED: the times.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the manufacturers' rush toward functional foods is becoming
intense. Some established products are being recast, even to
include some unlikely brands. Campbell's Pork &AMP; Beans, hardly
healthy cuisine, carries a label stating that it meets American
Heart Association guidelines for low saturated fat and cholesterol.
Yet one half-cup serving of the product contains 8 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Any new functional foods, meanwhile, from yogurt to breakfast
bars to milk shakes, will soon be trundling down the assembly lines
and into grocery delivery trucks. ``Functional food is becoming a
sort of fad,'' said Bill Leach, a food analyst at Donaldson Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette. ``I'm not sure people are just going to go out and
start eating soybeans.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past is a good predictor, Leach may well be right. Last
year, Campbell Soup dropped its Intelligent Quisine line of frozen
foods _ aimed at people with diabetes and heart conditions _ after
test-marketing it for 15 months in Ohio. Kellogg, meanwhile, had
planned to sell Ensemble, a line of 22 health-fortified products,
including cereals and pastas, that purported to lower cholesterol,
but scrapped the line in November because of poor sales in a
southwest Michigan test market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Campbell Soup and Kellogg had invested millions of
dollars developing functional foods but did not know how to sell
them. Kellogg had boasted that Ensemble was rich in fiber, an
ingredient so familiar to consumers, critics said, that many were
unimpressed. Intelligent Quisine was a marketing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with Intelligent Quisine was that these frozen
meals would be delivered to someone's home,'' said Dr. Paul
Lachance, executive director of the Neutraceutical Institute at
Rutgers University. ``The problem was that most people didn't have
enough freezer space to store the meals. People just didn't know
what to do with it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, makers of functional foods believe that they have
developed a successful formula. Instead of selling full meals,
manufacturers are devising single products. They are basing their
product assertions not on common things like fiber but on more
unusual ingredients like plant stanols, the ingredient in Benecol
that is said to lower cholesterol, and acid compounds said to
address particular ailments (and thereby warrant premium prices).
And manufacturers are also stressing the products' taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want positive things in their diet, but taste is No.
1,'' said Guy Johnson, vice president of nutrition at Kellogg USA,
which plans to introduce a soybean cereal next year. ``Functional
foods will prosper because they are convenient and taste good. Our
soy cereal will taste so great people will want to eat it just for
that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, companies plan to spread the risk, selling functional
foods in many forms, including beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, a pharmaceutical company best known for cyclosporin, a
drug used in organ transplants, took that approach last month in
introducing Aviva, its functional food line, in Switzerland and
Britain. The line includes muesli, juice drinks, cereal bars,
biscuits and hot chocolate to provide heart, bone and digestive
benefits. And the company said it would soon license several of its
compounds for functional foods to makers of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   The potential profit from the new brands is exciting the
manufacturers. Novartis expects Aviva's worldwide sales to reach
$500 million in five years, including fees from licensees.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's competitors have heavily
criticized Benecol _ usually for its lofty price _ most have noted
the brand's sales. In its first months on the market, ending Sept.
26, Benecol spread had $12.3 million in sales in the United States
and a 2 percent share of the margarine market, according to
Information Resources, which tracks sales in supermarkets. Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, however, heavily promoted Benecol with coupons and ads.
</P>
<P>
   While that 2 percent share may seem small _ the leading
margarine, Shedds Country Crock, had a 15.8 percent share _
Benecol, made for Johnson &AMP; Johnson by a Finnish company, the
Raisio Group, has been available only since May. The packaged-goods
market in the United States is so mature _ margarine sales have
increased just 2 percent so far this year and cereals 1 percent _
that companies must ``steal'' share from their competitors to
bolster sales.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis executives have watched Benecol's introduction closely,
trying with its Aviva line to sidestep Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
marketing mistakes. Several Novartis executives have publicly
chided Johnson &AMP; Johnson for placing Benecol in the refrigerated
section of the supermarket alongside other margarines. Consumers
had little trouble comparing prices _ and being shocked by the
multidollar difference. That pound of Benecol spread at a Food
Emporium in Manhattan costs $17.22 a pound, while Shedds Country
Crock goes for $1.79.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we plan to do with Aviva in Europe is to group the
products together on one shelf,'' said Thomas Ebeling, the chief
operating officer of Novartis' drug unit. ``That way, we can
maintain our price premium. In Europe, products that are on a
special shelf always sell at a premium. Consumers can't compare
products if they aren't side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Novartis said it planned to use the same game plan for Aviva in
American supermarkets, but analysts have expressed doubts. To get
separate shelf space in the United States, they calculated,
Novartis could have to pay up to $20 million in fees _ eroding the
brand's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts believe the expense might be worth it. If
the Aviva orange drink were placed in the refrigerated section, for
example, it would compete with Tropicana and Minute Maid and their
titan corporate parents, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.

 UNDATED: and Coca-Cola. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But executives at Novartis do not appear too concerned. Like
other manufacturers of functional foods, the company is confident
that its products will dazzle consumers. To market Aviva in the
United States, Novartis will rely heavily on its Gerber Baby Food
subsidiary, which will soon introduce functional foods under its
own label.
</P>
<P>
   Piergallini, who is on a pound-shedding diet that he proudly
announced includes martinis and steak, is especially excited about
a Gerber snack for preschoolers that will contain the compound
docosa hexaenoic acid, or DHA. The Japanese routinely feed DHA, in
pill form and as an ingredient in snacks, to school-aged children
so they will get better grades. Recent studies in Japan have also
shown that the compound may improve eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science with these products will be sound,'' Piergallini
said. ``But with any of them, they have to taste good and be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviva will be marketed mostly to women, who tend to spend more
than men on preventive health care. But Novartis may also make a
subtle pitch to anyone eager to balance their overindulgences. One
Novartis executive said he thought prime users would be people who
regularly devour chocolate sundaes and would reach for Aviva
chocolate drinks to help balance out their snacks.
</P>
<P>
   While the market research for Aviva appears to be thorough, it
is not known how closely the brand's managers will follow it. The
company recently began a regional introduction in 114 Boots
drugstores and 30 Safeway stores in Britain, but preliminary
results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sinclair, Safeway's commercial director, who is conducting
the test for Novartis, gave Aviva only a 30 percent chance of
success. An Aviva orange drink, which provides bone benefits, is
being sold at Safeway for about $5.25 for a liter. By contrast,
that amount of Tropicana orange juice sells for about $3.65, a
Novartis executive said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say that it costs too much,'' Sinclair said,
adding that people will not pay enormous premiums. ``Aviva would be
far more successful if it were priced at about 10 percent to 20
percent above what it costs for similar items.''
</P>
<P>
   Novartis executives disagreed. ``We're talking about a food
category that nobody has been in before,'' said Alastair Paton,
marketing director in Britain for Novartis' health and functional
foods. ``Jack has experience with low-fat products, but Aviva goes
well beyond that by supplying a health benefit. People will pay
more to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sinclair had other reservations about Aviva. Novartis, he
noted, has hinged the line's success largely on the company's
ability to sell Aviva separately from similar items. Essentially,
it hopes that consumers will go automatically to the Aviva shelf in
the store, bypassing all competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that selling Aviva together in one place in the
store will work,'' Sinclair said. ``The women who buy the
groceries, they know how much everything they want costs,
regardless of where it is in the store. With Aviva, they're going
to know that they're paying a lot. And if they pay six times as
much for a margarine, they're only going to use it on special
occasions. That's not a way to get to the mass market.''
</P>
<P>
   After Benecol's stumbles during its introduction, some
packaged-goods experts say they think functional foods will never
enjoy widespread appeal. When Benecol and Take Control are measured
in unit sales, not dollars, each has less than a 1 percent share of
the market. Take Control has only a 1 percent share of margarine
sales, measured in dollars, according to the report by Information
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods also do little to countermand trends that have
stymied the packaged-goods market for decades. Americans are eating
out more than ever before, hurting sales of groceries and consumer
goods products in general.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers have begun to think of functional food as
medicine, abandoning it once the benefit is achieved, several
packaged-foods analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Many makers of functional foods are counting on doctors'
recommendations to drive sales. But that strategy is showing signs
of backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benecol is a nice way to add something positive to your
diet,'' said Dr. Tu Nguyen, director of the cholesterol disorder
program at the Mayo Clinic and a researcher in plant stanols. ``But
people who only use it occasionally may not receive any of the
effects.'' Doctors and health professionals also know that the
wonder biscuits and drinks are not substitutes for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Benecol is a good product but I wouldn't go out and
tell someone to eatall the Benecol they could,'' said Deena Fox, a
clinical dietitian at New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``Anyone can
go anywhere and get an apple and orange and pop it in their mouth.
And they're much less expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   And there may be outright resistance. The Center for Science in
the Public Interest is known for crusading against controversial
foods, though Jacobson said it was too soon to say how it would
react to functional foods. Meanwhile, he said, consumers should
carefully scrutinize the ingredients in these foods, since some
compounds are not tested by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said that consumers may not bite, anyway. Many
already eat large amounts of fiber and calcium to reduce their risk
of colon cancer and osteoporosis. Why pay extra for more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers do have an interest in eating healthier foods,''
said David Schmidt, the senior vice president of food safety at the
International Food Information Council, a Washington-based advocate
for nutritional safety. ``But Americans are just so
price-conscious. When it comes to buying packaged foods, they
always seem to go for the cheaper price as long as the item meets
their standard of quality.''

<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Pervomaiskoye, Russia) _ After more than two
months of thunderous bombardments, a small trickle of desperate
residents straggled Friday through the Russian military checkpoint
here. But for Khasan Dakayev, 25, the corridor is more like a
gantlet. He spent weeks worrying that his family might be shot by
Russian soldiers if they left, only to find that the greatest
danger came from gangs of marauders who cruise around Grozny and
its outskirts, brandishing automatic weapons and stealing food with
impunity. By Michael R. Gordon.

WRITER'S STORE GIVES SCRIBES A PLACE TO COMPUTE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column on the intersection of
entertainment and technology.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Way back when, nearly two decades ago, musician Dan Douma and
his wife, Gabriele Meiringer, decided to open a computer store in
West Los Angeles. To bring in more money, Meiringer also
transcribed scripts and other documents on the computer for
writers, while Douma was tinkering with Wordstar, an early word
processor, to ease the script-writing process.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all that work came the Writer's Computer Store, selling
both computers and all the software that screenwriters and other
scribes might want, along with classes to explain how to use all
this newfangled tech.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the Doumas and their son, Jesse Douma, left the
low-margin hardware end of the business to concentrate on selling
the software and other goodies writers need.
</P>
<P>
   Now they've moved to a bigger space on Westwood Boulevard, about
a mile south of UCLA, and renamed their company the Writer's Store.
They've also built a thriving online business (at
www.writersstore.com), with thousands of customers all over the
world, the younger Douma said.
</P>
<P>
   And they've got an array of cool gift packages for the budding,
or fully flowering writer in your clan. The gift packages include
books and software that will help hone the work of script writers,
comedy writers, novelists and filmmakers. Check 'em out between the
bricks, or with your clicks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GADGETS WE LIKE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I first saw Ellie's Enchanted Garden and Redbeard's Pirate Quest
in gee-whiz demonstrations by maker Zowie Intertainment at the
Electronic Entertainment Expo.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, I like these hybrid computer-based playsets now
more than ever, despite minor quibbles about their need to hog two
connections to your Windows-based PC.
</P>
<P>
   The set itself and several included toys have sensors that tell
the set when they're moved or manipulated, making the on-screen
CD-ROM adventure react. My 8-year-old daughter worked over Ellie's
Garden delightedly for several hours, and Redbeard seems just as
good.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend these sets highly for the wonderful and different
way they let even young children easily harness the computer's
graphic and interactive power.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Media has its own peripheral/CD-ROM combination in the
Matchbox Construction Zone set.
</P>
<P>
   You strap a special device that looks like the controls of heavy
machinery onto your PC's keyboard and use it to run a CD-ROM of fun
3-D projects involving equipment such as bulldozers and backhoes.
It should keep your little forehuman-to-be occupied for hours.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation gamers should check out the Tiltforce2 controller
from Pelican Accessories. The nifty, batwing-shaped gizmo uses
internal sensors that use your body English with the controller to
steer. The elongated shape takes some getting used to, as does the
tilt steering. But it can make a big difference in some games.
</P>
<P>
   And lately I've also been trying out a second-generation MP-3
player, the Nomad from Creative Technologies. It's tiny, with a
sleek, brushed-magnesium case, and not only plays MP-3 computer
audio files but also FM radio, and it makes voice memos.
</P>
<P>
   Top-notch MusicMatch software is included that makes it easy to
transfer MP-3 songs between your PC and Nomad using an equally
attractive cradle that also recharges the player.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nomad isn't perfect, especially the connection between
PC and cradle. Not only is it balky, but it uses the parallel port
many computers use for their printer. Happily, Creative's newer
Nomad 2 uses a USB connection for far greater flexibility and
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   And like all current MP-3 players, it suffers from capacity
limitations, with 32 megabytes of internal memory and another 32 of
removable space, letting you carry around about an hour of music. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAMES TO GET &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dino Crisis (Konami) _ In this good-looking PlayStation entry in
the horror survival sub-genre of adventure games, you play a female
operative dropped onto an island where something has gone very
wrong with the existing top-secret facility there. Creepy, with a
surfeit of hungry dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Story 2 Action Game (Disney Interactive/Activision) _ This
3-D adventure game is roughly the same on PC, Nintendo 64 and
PlayStation _ and just plain well done, from the same developers
who did the excellent game for ``A Bug's Life.'' Buzz has to rescue
everything from Woody to Bo Peep's sheep and Mr. Potatohead's ear
in a game that requires a lot of cleverness to succeed. Looks
great, too.
</P>
<P>
   And while I'm at it, let me endorse Disney Interactive's other
two ``Toy Story 2'' titles: an Activity Center with games and other
fun for children between 4 and 8 (the Action Game is for 8 and up
and is tough) and another well-done Print Studio title with lots of
``Toy Story'' projects to create, customize and print out.
</P>
<P>
   Donkey Kong 64 (Nintendo) _ The wizards at Nintendo's Rare
Studios have delivered another great hit with the big ape, though
it's probably going to be best-loved by slightly older children who
can handle some of the game's tougher challenges (say, 8 and up).
</P>
<P>
   Ray Man 2 (Ubi Soft) _ The man without limbs strikes again, with
another really good-looking adventure for Nintendo 64. It's
probably a wash whether you like this one or Donkey Kong more.
They're both well done, good looking and long-lasting fun. &QL;

WAY MORE THAN MR. BURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: inserts dropped comma in lede; removes embargo) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Shearer _ actor, radio host, political commentator _ may
be a little bit of everywhere these days, but one place he won't be
on New Year's Eve is out on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel about the millennium the way I do about New Year's Eve
generally _ it's a holiday for civilians,'' he said. ``Like most
people in show business, if I'm not working that night, I'll be
home. In this case, entertaining my in-laws.''
</P>
<P>
   You may not immediately recognize the name, but you will the
voice and maybe the face. Shearer, you see, is one of those
ubiquitous talents who gets around.
</P>
<P>
   Creator and star of the seminal fake rockumentary ``This Is
Spinal Tap,'' Shearer voices Mr. Burns and 19 other characters on
TV's ``The Simpsons,'' hosts public radio's weekly ``Le Show'' and
has appeared in such feature films as ``Godzilla,'' ``The Truman
Show,'' ``edTV'' and ``The Right Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he find the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder that myself sometimes,'' he says. ``It's a pretty
full week. But with the radio show, I've always believed I could do
it way into the future, as long as I can make room for it in the
rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   A former writer and cast member on ``Saturday Night Live,''
Shearer unbuckles the Beltway in ``It's the Stupidity, Stupid''
(Random House; $16.95), a shrewd look at the Clinton administration
and why it has inspired such fervent hatred in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Shearer debunks Hillary Clinton's ``vast right-wing
conspiracy,'' arguing that ``a conspiracy by its nature should be a
fairly tightly controlled operation, like the Mafia or
Scientology.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearer _ whose long-running ``Le Show'' airs on KCRW-FM (89.9)
at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Sundays _ will appear in conversation with
humorist and fellow curmudgeon Fran Lebowitz tonight at UCLA's
Royce Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be Fran and Harry having a good old-fashioned
conversation,'' Shearer explained the other day. ``When Fran gets
into town, we'll have a pre-chat about what bees are under our
particular bonnets. Life is preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebowitz is author of two collections of humorous essays,
``Metropolitan Life'' and ``Social Studies,'' which have recently
been collected in the ``Fran Lebowitz Reader'' (Vintage Books;
$14).
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Mirabella, the irascible Lebowitz was
at her mordant best. On Bill Clinton: ``He's a prom king. He's a
boy. He wants to be really popular, in a teen-aged sense. ... And
this is not what you'd call presidential material. You don't want a
president who liked high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The short, soft-spoken Shearer, too, frequently targets the
Clintons on his weekly radio program, currently in its 15th year on
KCRW. A recurring ``Le Show'' feature is the slickly produced
``Clinton-something,'' a ``Friends''-type takeoff of daily life at
the White House, which alternates with readings from obscure trade
journals and New Orleans r&AMP;b music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get many things out of the show,'' says the Santa
Monica-based Shearer, who turns 56 on Dec. 23. ``It scratches an
itch. It's a place where I have access to a large audience each
week without any interference or censorship. That's rare and
valuable, even though I sometimes curse the fact I have to do it
every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearer's radio days actually began in the mid-'60s at KRLA-AM,
where he was part of the Credibility Gap comedy troupe, which
offered an irreverent daily look at current events. A child actor
in ``Abbott and Costello Go to Mars'' (1953), Shearer also played
the role of Eddie Haskell in the pilot episode of ``Leave It to
Beaver.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shearer _ who has been dubbed a calmer James Carville or a
liberal P.J. O'Rourke _ has long been involved in parody. He quit
``Saturday Night Live'' twice because his skits were getting
produced less frequently, and he played dim-bulb bassist Derek
Smalls in the classic ``Spinal Tap'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Shearer is working on another book and plans
to shoot a digital film.
</P>
<P>
   ``With digital cameras, it's possible to do a movie for much
lower cost,'' the humorist explained. ``It tends to be more
actor-friendly. Plus, you can shoot in smaller spaces and be more
flexible.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
Who: Harry Shearer and Fran Lebowitz. &QL; 
Where: Royce Hall, UCLA campus, Westwood. &QL; 
When: 8 p.m. Saturday. &QL; 
Tickets: $15 to $25. &QL; 
Information: (310) 825-2101.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hollywood star power will meet Washington political
power on New Year's Eve as some of the world's biggest celebrities
join President and Mrs. Clinton for a glitzy, patriotic celebration
to usher in the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create something worthy of the ringing in the Year
2000 in the nation's capital,'' said Toby Graf, a spokeswoman for
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose office is spearheading the
planning for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady will open a three-day festival entitled
``America's Millennium,'' at 11 a.m. eastern time on Friday, Dec.
31, with the unveiling of a time capsule, which will be stored at
the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a different kind of time capsule in that
we're trying to find things that define the whole 20th century as
well as what life is like right now,'' said Graf. But she declined
to reveal what will be in the capsule.
</P>
<P>
   While the three days will include parades, dozens of parties and
an array of exhibitions highlighting American history, the focus of
the celebration will be on CBS's nationally televised New Year's
Eve show at the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Actor and rapper Will Smith will host a three-hour show, which
starts at 10 p.m. eastern time. Joining Smith will be fellow actors
Robert Duvall, Sam Waterson and Diane Keaton, opera stars Jessye
Norman and Kathleen Battle, along with gospel singer Bebe Winans,
country singer Trisha Yearwood and 25 New York cast members of the
musical hit ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCarthy, executive director of America's Millennium, the
organization coordinating the celebration for the White House,
promised that other celebrities would be at the event but would not
identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the program, entitled ``America's Millennium
Gala,'' will offer more than just ``another celebrity special.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the show, created by musician Quincy Jones and
producer-director George Stevens Jr., will be a ``thoughtful
melange'' of 20th century America. ``The show is meant to be moving
rather than just another musical show,'' he said, adding that the
Lincoln Memorial was chosen because it has been the site of many
key moments in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady will begin celebrating around 7
p.m. with a black-tie ``Creators Dinner'' at the White House to
honor some of the country's most prominent figures in sports, arts
and sciences. Playwrights Edward Albee, August Wilson, Arthur
Miller and Neil Simon will be among the attendees, as well as
musicians Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zuckerman and Marilyn Horn.
Others include dancers Edward Villella and Arthur Mitchell; artist
Robert Rauschenberg; architect Maya Lin; Olympian runner Carl Lewis
and Internet pionier Vinton Cerf.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:30 p.m., a motorcade of limousines accompanied by dozens
of Secret Service vehicles and Washington, D.C. police cars will
take the Clintons and their guests to the Lincoln Memorial, where
they will join a Mall crowd that _ depending on the weather _ is
expected to reach 250,000 people. Last year's temperatures on Dec.
31 ranged from 19 to 28 degrees. Normal temperatures for the day
range from 18 to 36.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:30 p.m., as the so-called ``Midnight Moment''
approaches, a 100-piece orchestra, along with the combined bands,
choirs and marching units of the U.S. Armed Forces, will premiere a
score by award-winning composer John Williams. The music will
accompany an 18-minute movie on America in the 20th century by
academy award-winning director Steven Spielberg that will play on
giant screens on three sides of the Reflecting Pool in front of the
Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Then U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky and his predecessors Rita
Dove and Maya Angelou will read from their new works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be able to see and hear what this country is
about and what makes it so special,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, organizers say, the Mall will explode into a
spectacular sound-light-and-fireworks show between the Lincoln
Memorial and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The show will end with a group of American children _ joined by
the stars of the gala and choruses _ asking the crowd to join in a
sing-along of traditional American songs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials are expecting that during the day Dec. 31
as many as 750,000 people will use the city's public transit
system, more than twice as many as last Dec. 31 and easily more
than record crowd of 541,000 on last July 4.
</P>
<P>
   City spokesman Ray Feldmann said bus and train service will be
provided throughout the day. Usually on New Year's Eve, the city
runs trains until 2 a.m. and buses until 3 a.m., but this year, the
city will keep both going an extra hour.
</P>
<P>
   According to Graf, the Clintons plan to leave the Lincoln
Memorial before the ``Midnight Moment'' show ends at 1 a.m. ``The
president and the first lady are still deciding how to spend the
rest of the evening,'' she said. ``They may just decide to go home
and spend some time alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether this New Year's celebration will be the largest
under President Clinton, Graf hedged, saying: ``Well, the
millennium doesn't actually start until 2001, and next year's New
Year's Eve will be the last one under the administration. So we'll
see.''

   The luxury-vehicle sales race is coming down to the wire, and
based on the latest figures, it may be a photo finish. Plus, for
the first time ever, the top two contenders are not American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   gh November, Mercedes-Benz led Toyota's Lexus Division by
just 1,294 vehicles. General Motors' Cadillac Division was in third
place, just ahead of Lincoln, which is part of the Ford Motor Co.
Lincoln won the sales race last year for the first time in six
decades, after GM auditors determined that Cadillac had improperly
inflated its figures.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of luxury cars and sport utilities are booming. In 11
months, several brands have surpassed their full-year sales for
1998. &QL;

COURTSHIP OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Ohio, Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Paul Petersen was 21, he had bought 5 new houses, 20
cars and 30 television sets. One of the cars, a stunning gold
Cadillac convertible with a black leather interior, still makes him
sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen made a small fortune as a teenage star on a hit TV
series of the 1960s, ``The Donna Reed Show.'' But when it ended its
eight-year run, he had trouble finding roles. He kept spending,
though, and within four years he was broke.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, Petersen, who lives in a modest home in
south-central Los Angeles, one of the city's poorer neighborhoods,
is making financial misfortune work for him. For the last several
months, he and two other former child TV stars who had trouble
managing their money _ Brandon Cruz, who played Eddie in ``The
Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' and Jon Provost, who played Timmy on
``Lassie'' _ have been traveling the talk show circuit for
SunAmerica, a unit of American International Group.
</P>
<P>
   SunAmerica is a leader in the thriving business of variable
annuities, an investment that combines features of mutual funds and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In their talk-show appearances, the three are living examples
for SunAmerica's national advertising campaign, which flashes
images of glamorous cars and jewelry on television screens and,
without actually saying so, urges Americans to resist filling their
lives with toys today so that they can build comfortable nest eggs
for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   That fancy sports car with the $70,000 price tag? The money,
invested instead at a not-too-hard-to-attain 8 percent, could grow
to a staggering $326,267 in 20 years, SunAmerica says, exclusive of
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The message about saving is good, financial experts say. But
they are not so sure about SunAmerica's main product, the variable
annuity, a controversial and somewhat complicated investment that
is never mentioned by name in the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me if convincing people to save money in variable
annuities is better than wasting money, the answer is, of course,''
said J. Michael Martin, president of Financial Advantage Inc., a
fee-only financial planning company in Columbia, Md. ``But if you
ask me if I'd advise most people to put their money in a variable
annuity, the answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities may make sense for some investors, but they
are not for everyone. Their fees, for one thing, are often nearly
double those for comparable mutual funds. Moreover, many financial
planners say the features that make annuities more costly are often
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   One feature is a guarantee that money put into a variable
annuity will be preserved for the investor's heirs, regardless of
market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   SunAmerica and other variable annuity companies say this is a
confidence builder for timid investors who might otherwise never
leave bank certificates of deposit to take a chance on stocks,
fearing that they could lose money. But those fears have generally
been unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners like David Foster, of Foster &AMP; Motley in
Cincinnati, say there have been few periods even as short as five
years in which a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds has lost
money.
</P>
<P>
   Many people looking to make their money grow find it difficult
to tell the difference between a variable annuity and a mutual
fund. Both are most often investments in stocks and bonds. Despite
the higher fees for variable annuities, investors are often steered
to them by sales representatives, who can earn higher commissions
on them than on mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, long before SunAmerica hired Petersen to promote
its retirement savings theme, his wife, Rana, who runs the medical
department at a CBS production center, opened an investment account
with the company. When they spoke about the investment the other
day, neither Petersen, who now spends most of his time running a
foundation called A Minor Consideration, which helps young actors
take care of financial matters, nor Mrs. Petersen was sure whether
it was in variable annuities or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Petersen remembered that she had called SunAmerica and said
she was ``interested in saving for my future.'' They sent her some
brochures. ``I just kind of said, `OK, I'll pick this one,' and
mailed in a check to open the account,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After checking her records recently, she found that they were
invested in two mutual funds. The Petersens, who also both have
pension funds through their work, say that knowing just what they
had invested in through SunAmerica was less important than knowing
that they were getting steady returns. That, they say, is good
enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   It's also good enough for SunAmerica, which emphasizes variable
annuities but also sells mutual funds. Like other specialists in
variable annuities, SunAmerica contends that partly because of tax
advantages and trading patterns, annuities can be a much better
investment than critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial experts say variable annuities work best for
people with high incomes. But the National Association for Variable
Annuities, an industry trade group, says the average customer makes
less than $75,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities carry hefty penalties for early withdrawals
and there is an Internal Revenue Service penalty of 10 percent for
withdrawals before the age of 60. The possibility of penalties can
be a plus, financial experts say, for people who would otherwise be
unable to resist squandering money.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Waring Greer, president for marketing at SunAmerica, agreed
that the penalties could have a good effect, but said SunAmerica
did not emphasize them in its promotion. ``You can't lecture to the
baby boomers,'' she said. ``You have to show them that if they
defer spending they're going to have a lot more money to spend in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is where Petersen's soft sell, harking back to his
youth, comes in. ``If I had just picked up the phone and called any
company _ (italics)any company(end italics) _ and asked for their
advice in planning my future,'' he said in an interview the other
day, ``I'd be miles ahead today.''

 &HT;    On Holy Land sites, don't waste your faith
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marketing Christ is as old as Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, tour guides and churches have cashed in on Jesus
since soldiers threw dice for his clothing after the crucifixion.
That may not be pious, but it's profitable _ and ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most pilgrims are tourists spending the coin of
one realm to find a more spiritual kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The latest gimmick is to let the faithful walk on water _ for
$5.
</P>
<P>
   Some brilliant huckster plans to build a prayer walk on the Sea
of Galilee so pilgrims can reenact the biblical story of Jesus
walking on water. The midway-like attraction will be built near
Capernaum in northern Israel on the Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   The silly business _ virtually certain to be widely popular _ is
a private venture tacked onto the Israeli government's development
of Capernaum in anticipation of a horde of pilgrims expected in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim boats _ another moneymaker _ sail from Tiberias, on the
western shore of the Galilee, across the lake to Capernaum,
bringing the curious to this archaeologically marvelous but
abandoned ancient town.
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake destroyed Capernaum in the 8th century, but the
little village is known as the place where Jesus spent an
inordinate amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently stayed at Peter's house, healed the sick and,
Scripture tells us, preached with authority in the synagogue there.
</P>
<P>
   That synagogue was in ruins by the 4th century when Christianity
became the religion of the Roman Empire and the first great rush of
Christian pilgrims flooded the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Since the faithful wanted to see the synagogue where Jesus
preached, the pilgrim industry built one and peddled it as the
first-century original, according to scholars at St. George's
College in Jerusalem. The ruins of that tourist trap stand today.
</P>
<P>
   Holy sites created for the pilgrim trade are big business in
Israel. The Via Dolorosa, Jesus' route to the cross in Jerusalem,
was redesigned repeatedly until the stations were finally settled
in the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants disliked the Catholic, Orthodox control of the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre at or near the likely place of Jesus'
burial. So, in the late 19th century, they created another burial
ground outside the 16th-century walls of Jerusalem. The garden tomb
is a very popular and completely bogus holy place.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th century, Muslims would not allow Christians near the
north wall of Jerusalem, where defenses were weak. But that did not
deter the pilgrim industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local guides simply moved to the Kidron Valley certain
holy places, notably the Church of St. Stephen, which were in
reality north of the city, and business went on as before,'' wrote
the Rev. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor in The Holy Land (Oxford Press,
1992).
</P>
<P>
   Most pilgrims to the Holy Land have an extraordinary spiritual
experience. For many Christians and Jews, it is, spiritually, the
center of the universe. But they need beware of claims that all
holy sites are genuine and be conscious of the powerful profit
motive in the religious enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   During the anniversary of the birth of Christ in the year 2000,
cash registers will ring as loudly as church bells.

THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD WAS THE INTERNET OF 1869 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind. Ill., Tenn., Ky., Britain)  (dw) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a freezing May night in 1869 at an isolated Utah
settlement called Promontory Summit, a crowd gathered to watch as a
final iron spike was driven into an unfinished railroad track. The
spike and silver hammer, both wired to a telegraph line, made an
electrical connection that sent a signal through the nation's
network. It proclaimed the completion of the transcontinental
railroad whose tracks wound through the Sierra Nevada, thrust
across the central plains and splayed across the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of that rail line on American life was foreshadowed
in the pulse of electrical current surging through a web of wires,
easily overcoming distance and weather. It set off the first
simultaneous, nationwide celebration; in San Francisco and New
York, at the moment of contact, two cannons facing the Pacific and
Atlantic fired shots, proclaiming that the United States was also
prepared to extend its newly united presence outward.
</P>
<P>
   Over a century later, that transcontinental project, completed
after decades of disease, accident, Indian attacks, bribery, stock
fraud and utopian dreams, still seems unusually resonant. For this
too is a period of technological transformation. Today's changes
don't require hammers and spikes or immigrant work crews chiseling
through rock or forges turning out thousands of miles of rail.
Today's networks are extensions of that telegraphic signal, not of
the tracks beneath it. They involve telecommunications companies
and television cable companies, wireless telephones and computer
networks, electronic transfers of cash and stock and commodities _
the exploding world of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If the transcontinental railroad inspired grandiose hopes for
social transformation, the prospects for e-commerce, e-mail and
e-fraud have raised similar expectations and worries. An 1846
Cincinnati newspaper mocked the utopian claims that a railroad
could ``create settlements, commerce and wealth;'' the project's
supporters, the paper suggested, might as well be promising ``to
unite neighboring planets in our solar system and make them better
acquainted with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Do Internet visionaries predict anything less?
</P>
<P>
   This may be why building railroads is getting some unusual
attention, including a large new 797-page chronicle of the
construction of America's transcontinental railroad, ``Empire
Express'' (Viking) by David Haward Bain. Railroads have always
attracted hobbyists and specialists. Historians have also had a
strong interest in the railroad's impact on regional cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But the attention has recently broadened, echoing the energies
now being poured into proliferating books about the Internet. A
special series devoted to railroads published by Indiana University
Press, deals with such arcana as the Chicago South Shore Railroad
and the now extinct ``ghost railroads'' of Tennessee and Kentucky;
the publisher is offering railroad histories that have been
unavailable for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Current rail obsessions go even further: it is not just the
objects that entrance, it is the way that _ with Internet swiftness
_ they altered the surrounding cultural universe. In England,
argues an Oxford lecturer, Michael Freeman, in a new book,
``Railways and the Victorian Imagination'' (Yale), the railroad
weakened the aristocracy, changed the geography and populations of
the cities, led to the beginnings of an organized stock market and
inspired a half century of art with its sublime energies
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, with fewer established institutions to
change, Bain's account suggests that the construction of the tracks
may have had as much impact as the trains running on them. A new
kind of American business took shape, ambitious in its scale and
demands, dealing with the government as both supplicant and
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a newly ``connected'' country was not unrelated
to the Civil War that raged as construction began. Materials may
have been scarce and the government was often in crisis, but
Lincoln (who had worked as an attorney for a railroad), saw the
transcontinental as a way of binding East and West, just as the war
was fought to bind North and South.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad was a new technology, an industrial version of the
``information superhighway'' requiring continuous innovation.
Railroads spurred extraordinary feats of engineering, as William D.
Middleton's recent book, ``Landmarks on the Iron Road'' (Indiana)
shows. Nature had to be resculptured; tunnels had to be dug and
bridges mounted over precipices. The transcontinental required an
800-foot-long, 63-foot-deep cut through a pass in the Sierra
Nevada; it was blasted through at the pace of a foot a day. The
tracks also passed along the edges of the rocky walls of a cliff
2,500 feet above a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The culture changed to accommodate the technology. There was a
new, specialized language (the rails introduced technical words
like ``junction'' and ``buffer''), a new kind of literacy (reading
timetables) and a new sense of space and connection (in England
train tracks became the first examples of perfectly straight
roads).
</P>
<P>
   Today we cheer the wiring of schools and libraries, but in the
1840s in England, railroad ABC's became common. (``S is the
Station, with bustle and din,/Where some folks get out, and others
get in.'')
</P>
<P>
   The speed of these changes was also dizzying. In 1830 England
had just 100 miles of track; by 1852 it had 6,600 miles. Between
1844 and 1847, Parliament authorized 250 million pounds to be spent
on railroads; within 20 years the landscape and urban life of the
country were overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this there were also concerns (familiar to
computer users) about the creation of industry standards. Different
rail systems, built at different times by different companies to
different specifications, were not always compatible; passengers
often had to switch trains at midjourney. In the transcontinental
railroad, for example, existing lines were stitched together as the
network expanded; but the track's gauge _ the distance between the
rails _ had to be consistent (it was finally set at 4 feet 8.5
inches).
</P>
<P>
   In England, Parliament adopted the same standard, but some
railroads had 7-foot gauges, and many more sizes in between had
strong advocates. Freeman cites one 19th-century commentator (who
could seem to be arguing about computer operating systems) who
noted that even if a train line had a better standard in mind, ``it
could never hold its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Commerce bullishly charged forward, accompanied by
extraordinarily volatile stock prices. Rail expenses were enormous:
it cost $640,000 (in 1860s dollars; about $13 million in today's
terms) to lay just one 20-mile segment of track for the
transcontinental. But the payoffs were as great as the risks.
Railroad stocks were sold cheaply _ and widely distributed as
bribes in Congress _ but they also created a new class of
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In England the greatest number of stock dealings in the 1840s
was in the trading of railway stocks; the frenzy was known as
``Railway Mania.'' In 1853, Charles Dickens described England's
North Western Railway Co. in terms that are now reserved for a
certain software company in Redmond, Wash. The company, he wrote,
``is wealthier than any other corporation in the world,'' conveying
more people in a year than inhabit all of Scotland, and carrying
goods that exceed the annual trade of Belgium and Portugal
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since there were fewer regulations then, there was
also more overt stock manipulation. One of Bain's more chilling
stories is how Thomas C. Durant, one of the masterminds of the
American transcontinental railroad, floated a rumor that the new
tracks would connect to a railroad line he owned. The stock soared.
Durant sold his shares and quietly bought interests in another rail
line, then made a similar announcement. The first stock plummeted,
the second shot up. Durant sold yet again, bought back his old
stock, reasserted its value, and netted $5 million for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Out of such machinations and their more noble counterparts the
modern world took shape in a shockingly short time: stock markets
were formalized, time zones were created, trade multiplied, cities
expanded, distances shrank, impatience grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was quick is now slow,'' a British observer commented
about the railroads in 1830, ``what was distant is now near.''
Sounds familiar.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, the soft drink, is based on a closely-guarded secret
formula. But the arithmetic that results when Coca-Cola, the
company, decides to squeeze more profit from its complex
relationships with its bottlers was laid bare last week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, in which Coca-Cola
holds a 39 percent stake, closed at $18.375 a share, less than half
their 52-week high of $37.50. The share price of Coca-Cola
Consolidated, the No. 2 Coke bottler in the United States, closed
at $49.75, down 13.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This had been a bad year for the bottling stocks, but it became
worse last month. That was when an executive of Coca-Cola
Enterprises disclosed that Coca-Cola was raising the price it
charges for concentrate _ the powder or syrup that is mixed with
water and carbon dioxide to become soft drinks _ by 7 percent,
twice the usual rate. The move was seen as Coke's attempt to
capture some of the profit that the bottlers were anticipating from
a price increase they initiated earlier this year at the wholesale
level.
</P>
<P>
   For Summerfield Johnston Jr., the chairman and second-largest
shareholder of Coca-Cola Enterprises, a result has been this: In
early June, his 28.6 million shares were worth about $1.07 billion;
the value of that stake has been whittled down to about $525
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he's not a happy camper on this whole thing,''
said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. The unhappiness
of bottlers like Johnston _ whose opinions carry some weight at
Coca-Cola _ may have been a factor in the departure of M. Douglas
Ivester, Coca-Cola's chief executive. Ivester stunned investors
last week with the news that he was stepping down in April.
</P>
<P>
   The concentrate price increase was imitated over at Pepsi-Cola a
short time later. For the Pepsi system, it has been the same story:
shares in Pepsi Bottling, the company spun off from PepsiCo earlier
this year, are now at $16, after trading as high as $25.25. The
Whitman Corp., another major Pepsi bottler, now trades at $13.125,
down 48 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock prices of the concentrate companies, however, have
fared better. Coca-Cola closed on Friday at $63.25, down just 5.6
percent for the year, while PepsiCo closed at $36.935, down 9.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that investors should avoid bottling stocks?
Not necessarily, say some money managers and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside isn't limited if you are a long-term value
player,'' said Scott Black, the president of Delphi Management,
which is among the top five stakeholders in Coca-Cola Consolidated
and has a stake in Pepsi Bottling. ``You're getting exclusive
territorial franchises, a business that generates lots of cash, and
very low multiples.'' With cash flow growth of 10 percent or so in
good times, the stocks are attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he thought all the bottling stocks had been
oversold. He has 12-month price targets of $40 on Coca-Cola
Enterprises, $31 on Pepsi Bottling and $16 on Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pepsi Bottling, which announced the Pepsi-Cola
concentrate price increase last month, said the timing was right as
long as PepsiCo made marketing-support payments to the bottler.
``Consumers have to want what we make, sell and deliver,'' said the
spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the concentrate companies and their
bottlers has been a concern on Wall Street. Many investors want to
see a more equitable distribution of profits between the two sides;
historically, more of the profit has accrued to the concentrate
makers, whose margins are extremely high. Returns on invested
capital have also been far higher for the concentrate companies
than for the bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems to be some confusion, said Paul Rissman, a
senior vice president at Alliance Capital Management, who recently
added to stakes in Coca-Cola Enterprises and Pepsi Bottling, both
of which he calls ``incredibly cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the concentrate companies were to intend to rob some of the
profits from the bottlers, they'd just be cutting off their
noses,'' he said. ``We think they know that. We think they are
trying to reach agreements with the bottlers where they can both
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Coca-Cola have urged ever-higher volume from
their bottlers, and stand to benefit from increased concentrate
sales. But there has been a big cost to bottlers around the world,
said Andrew J. Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to investors published last week, Conway assessed
Ivester's contributions and generally gave him high marks. However,
he said volume growth targets of 7 to 8 percent _ which Ivester's
successor, Douglas N. Daft, said he planned to pursue _ had a
distinct downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivester's targets have led to an unprecedented rate of bottler
investment in plants, trucks, machinery and coolers,'' Conway
wrote. ``Given the global economic slowdown, this rate of
investment was well ahead of the volume curve that has emerged. In
turn, this has left many global bottlers with subpar returns on
invested capital.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Chilly, strong winds from the northwest will buffet most of the
Northeast states Saturday in the wake an intense low-pressure
system heading slowly toward the Canadian Maritimes from northern
Maine. Winds will average 20 to 35 mph along the southern and
central New England Seaboards, with gusts over 40 mph possible in
places.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will develop in the mountains of northern New England as
cold Canadian air is moistened by invading Atlantic moisture. Most
of the snow, however, will be light. A few snow showers will fall
farther south and east, but none will survive to the coast, save
northeast Maine, as winds from the northwest rapidly dry on descent
from the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, moderate rains will develop in the Pacific Northwest,
mainly on west-facing high ground of west Washington and northwest
Oregon, where ocean winds are forced to rise up the sloping
terrain. Snow will fall at high elevations in the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered rains will develop over parts of east Texas and
western Louisiana as increasingly moist air over the Gulf of Mexico
stream inland ahead of a slow-moving low-pressure system over the
upper Rio Grande Valley. Late Saturday and Saturday night, however,
as the low arrives, rains will intensify over east Texas, raising
the rainfall potential to more than 2 inches in some areas by
Sunday morning. Thunder will accompany some of the rain.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the low, strong winds from the northeast will
gradually ease across southern California.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MOIST MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this month, Springfield, Mo., had a record
amount of rainfall. Thursday's showers tallied 2.77 inches,
eclipsing the day's record set most recently in 1985. With the
heavy rain that fell last weekend, the monthly total stands at 6.84
inches, compared with a normal month-to-date value of 1.06 inches.
The wettest December in Springfield occurred in 1982 when 8.84
inches fell. With 20 days remaining, it is highly likely that at
least another 2 inches of rain will fall, making December,1999, the
wettest ever. In fact, another rainstorm should arrive on Monday.

VIVID COLORS OF RESTORED FRESCOES BRIGHTEN SISTINE CHAPEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Ending a 20-year restoration of the Sistine Chapel, the
Vatican on Friday unveiled newly cleaned frescoes by Botticelli and
other 15th-century artists that had long been overshadowed by
Michelangelo's masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Michelangelo's ``Creation'' and ``Last Judgment''
frescoes were painstakingly restored, it took five years of careful
scraping and wiping to clean centuries of dust, soot and grit off
scenes from the lives of Jesus and Moses that line the walls
beneath Michelangelo's ceiling. At long last, the entire room is
uniformly bright, glittering with vivid blues, rich crimsons and
gold, and long-forgotten details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that the unity of the color
schemes with Michelangelo's work has been refound,'' Arnold
Nesselrath, director of the Vatican Museums' department of
Byzantine, medieval and modern art, said Friday at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the pope is to preside at a ceremony to celebrate
the full restoration of the Sistine Chapel, where cardinals gather
to elect a new pope. John Paul II's election in 1978 was held there
before restoration work began. Francesco Buranelli, director
general of the Vatican Museums and Pontifical Galleries, said,
``John Paul II will be remembered as the last pontiff of this
millennium, and one who will have put his own `signature' in the
Sistine Chapel _ not as a commissioner of new works but as a
conserver of ancient ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The frescoes, executed in 1481 and 1482, some 25 years before
Michelangelo began painting the ``Creation,'' are by the most
famous artists of their time, Tuscans brought to Rome by Pope
Sixtus IV. They are well known to art historians, but less so to
ordinary tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only in the Sistine Chapel could biblical scenes by the
likes of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino be so easily
overlooked by the thousands of visitors who stream through the vast
room every day, heads tilted back to take in Michelangelo's vast
and overpowering vision of Creation, which includes Adam's arm
reaching out to to touch the hand of God. The restoration of the
ceiling, begun in 1979 and completed in 1990, was surrounded by
controversy as a small but emphatic group of critics complained
that the restorers had rendered the ceiling too bright and almost
vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer complaints by 1994, when the restoration of
Michelangelo's ``Last Judgment'' was completed. And few art
historians expect much conflict over the cleaning of the
15th-century frescoes. ``I doubt there will be a fuss this time,''
said Luciano Bellosi, a medieval-art historian at the University of
Siena. ``I've seen some of the frescoes, and they were in fairly
good condition, so most of the restoration work is really just a
cleaning. Of course, any restoration represents a kind of trauma to
the work of art, but really, I think this one is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts who studied, cleaned and gently brought the frescoes
back to their original colors say they discovered new details,
including inside jokes, like a small white dog who makes cameo
appearances throughout the frescoes, rearing back from the sight of
drowning Egyptians in a ``Parting of the Red Sea'' by Biagio
d'Antonio, and begging on its hind legs at a ``Last Supper''
painted by Cosimo Rosselli. Nesselrath said that the dog was
probably a mascot of the artists.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that a palm tree in the background of the
``Voyage of Moses in Egypt,'' a fresco by Petro Perugino, was added
by Botticelli. ``The cleaning brought out the beautiful, very
precise botanical details that must have been executed by
Botticelli,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The artists and their apprentices executed their work with
unusual speed: It took 30 restorers and technicians five years to
clean frescoes painted in less than a year. Of 16 scenes from the
life of Moses and 12 of the life of Jesus, fewer than a dozen
survive intact, and many were completely destroyed long ago.
Perugino, whose rendition of Jesus' giving keys to St. Peter is
among the most famous of the works, also executed a fresco of the
Assumption of Mary over the altar. That was summarily destroyed to
make room for Michelangelo's ``Last Judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazzareno Gabrielli, the Vatican Museums' director of scientific
research, was one of several restorers eager to enhance the
reputation of the 15th-century artists _ even at Michelangelo's
expense. ``Ghirlandaio was working in extraordinary shades of blue
at the time,'' he said. ``He didn't even know that Michelanelo
existed.''
</P>
<P>
   He lavishly praised the Tuscan artists for adapting so easily to
materials then found only in Rome. ``For the first time, they were
using plaster made of lime and pozzolana,'' he said, referring to a
form of volcanic ash that was also used in ancient Roman times.
``And they painted on it so naturally _ the same as Michelangelo.
But for Michelangelo, it was normal It wasn't for them.''

A BIGGER WINDOW FOR BARGAIN MUNIS 
</HEADLINE>

municipal bond fund is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   December is ordinarily a good month to buy closed-end municipal
bond funds. Tax-related selling by some investors can push down the
funds' prices, creating windows of opportunity for others. And this
year, those windows may be open wider than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the rare opportunities to buy closed-end muni
bond funds at extremely undervalued levels,'' said Thomas J.
Herzfeld, an investment adviser in Miami specializing in closed-end
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, experts say, is unusually heavy tax-loss selling
this year. The bond market has been hit hard by interest-rate
increases by the Federal Reserve, and some investors are selling to
lock in losses for tax purposes. Many investors are also worried
about more rate jumps next year _ a fear that may already be priced
into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is shaping up to be the second-worst year in the bond
market, after 1994, since we started keeping statistics in 1926,''
said George W. Karpus, an investment adviser in Pittsford, N.Y.
``And muni bond funds have done even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of
shares that trade in the same way as those of ordinary companies.
As a result, they can trade at discounts or premiums to the value
of their underlying holdings, or net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Because most closed-end muni funds use leverage, issuing
short-term debt and investing the proceeds in higher-yielding
long-term bonds, the decline in their net asset values and market
prices is magnified.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the decline has been accentuated by a glut of new
funds. Thirty have come to market through November, compared with
just 10 in 1998 and 4 in 1997, Herzfeld said. And some bonds held
by the funds are being called and replaced by lower-yielding
issues. That reduces the fund's net income, resulting in dividend
cuts and putting more downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   The net asset values of closed-end muni bond funds are down 5
percent this year, on average, through November, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. But their share
prices have fallen further, an average of 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, funds are trading at extremely wide discounts to
net asset values; the average discount was nearly 9 percent as of
Nov. 26, versus a premium of 1.4 percent last year. At the start of
2000, as tax selling dries up, those discounts should begin to
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The January effect in closed-end funds generally will be very
pronounced in munis this year because the discounts have gone way
overboard, and will narrow or flip to premiums,'' Herzfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that worries about Year 2000 computer problems, which
may also have held back buyers, should disappear in January.
</P>
<P>
   The recent price decline, of course, has meant rising yields.
Closed-end muni bond funds recently yielded an average of 6.5
percent, tax-free, versus about 6.2 percent for long-term taxable
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Herzfeld likes Van Kampen Strategic Sector Municipal Trust and
Van Kampen Municipal Opportunity Trust II, which yielded 7.0
percent and 7.0 percent, respectively, as of Dec. 8 and traded at
discounts of 15 and 17 percent. He also likes Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Municipal Premium Income Trust, yielding 7.1 percent on Dec.
8 and trading at a 18 percent discount.
</P>
<P>

INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN HELP DETER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, ADVOCACY
GROUP SAYS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of a century when governments killed
tens of millions of citizens with impunity, the long arm of
international law now threatens tyrants with imprisonment, a
leading human rights group says.
</P>
<P>
   International tribunals and a proposed permanent international
criminal court can deter inhumanity in the century to come, said
the group, Human Rights Watch, in its annual report on nations that
commit crimes against their people.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as never before, ``governmental leaders who committed
these crimes faced a greater chance of prosecution and even
military intervention,'' the report, issued on Thursday, said.
``The lesson sent is that leaders risk their freedom and control of
territory if they commit the most severe human rights abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   As the reach of international law and institutions grows, the
power of sovereignty is breaking down, and that represents ``the
beginning of a new era for the human rights movement,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The milestones this year included the case brought in Spain and
Britain against the former dictator of Chile, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet. The year also saw the first indictment by an
international criminal tribunal of a sitting head of state,
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyrants are increasingly likely to be indicted,'' the report
said. And, ``at least in parts of the world'' like Kosovo and East
Timor, ``the international community seems more willing to deploy
troops to halt massive slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept that human rights can override national sovereignty
was framed by the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, in his speech
in September at the opening of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that ``the developing international form in favor of
intervention to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter'' would
be met with skepticism and hostility from many nations.
</P>
<P>
   Those skeptics include India and China. The two nations, each
with more than 1 billion people, say sovereignty has to be
strengthened, not weakened. China argues forcefully that human
rights are an internal affair, not an international one.
</P>
<P>
   And even the United States has qualms about sacrificing a
measure of sovereignty in the name of human rights. It has resisted
the establishment of an international criminal court, which would
be the first permanent global institution able to prosecute war
criminals and human-rights violators. The current U.N. tribunals
are investigating crimes only in the Balkans and in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Although it supported the United Nations' creation of the war
crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the United
States last year voted against establishing a permanent
international criminal court. The Pentagon strongly objected to the
idea, arguing that it might expose U.S. troops overseas to
prosecution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials, citing the case against Pinochet, voiced
fears that U.S. policymakers could be accused of complicity in
deaths that resulted from covert actions in the Cold War undertaken
by the United States in Latin America, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But 120 countries, including almost every major U.S. ally except
Israel, have signed the treaty to establish the permanent
international criminal court. After 60 governments have ratified
it, which could take years or decades, it will start operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer a question of if, but when,'' said the
executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth.

 (ATTN: Britain, France)  
 THE UNAMERICANIZATION OF McDONALD'S FOR FRENCH CONSUMERS   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Say it ain't so, Ronald.
</P>
<P>
   If Ronald McDonald has a naughty side, it burst into full view
in France in recent weeks, where the McDonald's fast-food chain has
come under assault as a symbol of American culinary and commercial
imperialism. The French attack on the burger peaked in August, when
the firebrand head of a farmers union, Jose Bove, was jailed for
organizing the destruction of a McDonald's under construction in a
southern French town.
</P>
<P>
   But now McDonald's France Services, the company that operates
McDonald's restaurants in France, has struck back with a campaign
of full-page newspaper ads that take a potshot at Americans and the
questionable sources of their food _ hormone-treated beef,
genetically modified crops and mass-produced vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a Big Mac in France is made the same way as
elsewhere and tastes pretty much the same, too. The point is that
McDonald's France may have been ``born in the United States,'' as
the ads read, but is ``made in France,'' with French suppliers and
products sold by French employees.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald's and the agency that created the ads, Euro RSCG
Corporate in Paris, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of
Havas Advertising, now seem more than a little uncomfortable with
the mocking, anti-American tone of the ads, the last of which ran
this week in leading French newspapers, including Le Monde,
Liberation, and Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Auffret, a spokesman for McDonald's France, said the
company would not discuss the ads, except to quote from a
five-line, prepared statement that says they are part of a ``local
campaign'' whose purpose is to ``reinforce the message that
McDonald's in France is a local French company with local
employees, local franchisees, local suppliers and products.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads' creators at Euro RSCG, under orders from McDonald's,
were not much more informative, though equally defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely French campaign; it was not meant as an
attack on Americans,'' said Charlotte De Sereville, who created the
ads together with Marie-Noelle Brouaux. She said it was a
McDonald's decision not to comment.
</P>
<P>
   So how had Ronald been naughty?
</P>
<P>
   The ads, black and white except for a red and gold McDonald's
logo, picture fat, unkempt American men, in cowboy hats or overalls
and camouflage jackets, complaining about the food at McDonald's
France restaurants. One, a grizzled cowboy standing under a snippet
of American flag, moans, ``What I don't like about McDonald's
France is that it doesn't buy American beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the attacks on McDonald's has been to
protest what many French see as the unfairness of an American
decision to tax French gourmet foods in retaliation for a European
ban on American hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   The text goes on to say that only by using French beef can
McDonald's trace its source, and thus guarantee ``maximum hygienic
conditions.'' It concludes, addressing the cowboy's 10-gallon hat:
``In any case _ nice hat, John.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad depicts an immensely obese American male complaining
that McDonald's France serves salads; a third shows a hog-jowled
American in a cowboy hat proclaiming in disbelief: ``McDonald's
France products come from the farm? And they eat them?'' (Read: and
not from the laboratory.)
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's won't say how much the ad campaign cost, though
full-page ads in Le Monde, the leading national paper, average
about $72,000. Ms. De Sereville said Euro RSCG had been
commissioned in July to create the ads, sharing the McDonald's
account in France with other agencies, like BDDP(AT)TBWA, a unit of
the Omnicom Group, which does McDonald's French television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Wentz, editor of Advertising Age International, called
the ads a ``tongue-in-cheek French thing.'' As for Euro RSCG, she
said: ``It's certainly not part of their international positioning.
They're as American as they come.'' Far from being French
provincials, she said, the agency and its chairman and chief
executive, Bob Schmetterer, have recently emphasized their New York
base and international sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Winogrodzki, director of the Advertising Consultancy in
London, recalled that Ikea, the Scandinavian mass furniture
retailer, had run a similar campaign in Britain not long ago,
``aimed at knocking the English _ You know, `You're so English. Be
more cosmopolitan.'''
</P>
<P>
   But self-parody, he said, was a British thing. ``It's very
French to knock someone else,'' he said. ``They took the Yanks, and
made it a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was amazed that the McDonald's parent company had not
opposed the campaign, given a company penchant for propriety in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, McDonald's, which jealously guards every aspect of
its restaurants, was stressing local independence and denying any
paternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ad programs are local,'' said Agnete Samdahl, a spokeswoman
for the McDonald's Development Co. in London, which oversees
European activities. Some advertising, she said, like commercials,
was produced centrallyfered to national companies, ``but all
decisions are local.''
</P>
<P>
   To what extent McDonald's impressed the French is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened for Americans who are depicted in these ads as
overweight farmers,'' said Patrice Vidieu, general secretary of the
Confederation Paysanne, the farmers union that organized the
attacks. ``The ad is misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidieu, who returned recently from Seattle, where he took part
in the anti-globalization protests at the World Trade Organization
ministerial meeting, denied that McDonald's beef was good because
it was French.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're perfectly capable of making industrial beef here,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Gifts from the heart in Honduras
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _Cary Sanders was trying hard to put on
a brave, happy face. She smiled, cooing ``hola'' _ hello in Spanish
_ as she handed a bright green shoe box stuffed with Christmas toys
to Keimy Mejia, a tiny, emaciated 8-year-old girl at a run-down
orphanage for children with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this?'' Cary asked through an interpreter, holding up
a palm-sized Etch A Sketch toy to the amazed but overjoyed child,
who grinned broadly as she rummaged excitedly through the box the
16-year-old student had packed back in Conyers, Ga. ``You are so
precious.''
</P>
<P>
   The two played together like sisters for half an hour or so, but
when Cary walked out of the dark, dingy stucco building in a San
Pedro Sula slum and waved goodbye, her grip on her emotions left,
too. She embraced Tracie Watkins and the two Heritage High School
students wept.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of a long, gut-wrenching day for the Georgia
teens, who were chosen to take part in Franklin Graham's
``Operation Christmas Child'' crusade in Honduras this week because
he thought it would ``help them heal'' from any lingering trauma
caused by last May's shooting at their school that left six
classmates wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cary, Tracie managed to keep her emotions in check as their
delegation mingled with a dozen abandoned AIDS kids. Tracie, an
18-year-old senior who was in a Christian devotional when the
Heritage High shootings occurred, bounced Sandra Martinez, 7, on
her knees, caressing the child's black hair and singing ``Feliz
Navidad,'' the popular song that means ``Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra yelped in delight as Tracie pulled a pair of purple
sunglasses out of the gift box she'd packed and put them on the
child's face, then showed her how to style her hair with a
barrette.
</P>
<P>
   The teens had been troopers, traipsing from one orphanage to
another, sloshing through muddy fields to deliver Christmas boxes
to dozens of other destitute children. But the Hogar Amor Y Vida
(Home of Love and Life), their last stop after a long day, proved
too much.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make grown men cry, and some did, like Cary's
father, the Rev. Preston Sanders, who came as his daughter's
chaperon. He dabbed at his eyes with a white handkerchief as he
watched with obvious pride as Cary tried to explain her emotions to
people outside. She regained some composure, but lost it when
someone asked how it felt knowing that it was unlikely little Keimy
would be alive this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just feel blessed to have met her,'' Cary said,
trying unsuccessfully to choke back tears. ``It makes me realize
how fortunate we are in the United States where we don't even see
poverty. This is really powerful. I hope I can give my friends even
a taste of what we have experienced. I want them to know that if
you send a gift box, you have no idea how much it really means to
these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cary, Tracie and others on the mission played inside with
the dying children, healthy ones with muddy bare feet rushed up
from nearby shanties to peer through white metal bars at what was
going on. Graham's organization, Samaritan's Purse, which runs the
annual Operation Christmas Child program, brought more than 300,000
gift boxes to Honduras, but they were given only to the neediest in
one of the poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel almost as sorry for the ones outside as those
inside,'' said Cary's dad, nodding at the kids looking in. ``It's
sensory overload. You can't believe how poor these people are
unless you see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduras, known as the original ``banana republic,'' is a
beautiful country with towering mountains of mahogany and cedar
trees, but per capita income in this nation of about 6 million is
less than $700 a year. Most families get by on no money at all,
said Rene Fonseca, who has helped Graham's international relief
group, based in Boone, N.C., aid the poor since Hurricane Mitch
killed an estimated 13,000 Hondurans 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fonseca, an American-educated former presidential candidate in
Honduras who plans to run again, said Graham's assistance was
sorely needed and will be for years. He has been helping the
47-year-old evangelist _ the son and already-appointed successor of
his father, Billy Graham _ organize a project to build homes for
tens of thousands whose mud or thatched huts were washed away by
floods from the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside another orphanage visited by the Heritage kids,
about 35 miles south of San Pedro Sula, Fonseca walked down a muddy
road to a cluster of 30 cinder block houses, each 15 by 20 feet in
size. So far, Samaritan's Purse has built nearly 4,000 of the
houses in areas all across the Tennessee-sized country.
</P>
<P>
   Tracie and Cary walked into many of the homes and were quickly
surrounded by grateful residents. One man said he saved his four
children and wife by tying them to a tree when flood waters in the
valley swept everything away. Tracie, who took off her mud-caked
sneakers before entering one of the homes, marveled that the owner
insisted on tying her shoes as she left.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, in daily morning devotionals during the weeklong trip,
cautioned Cary and Tracie and the rest of their delegation _ about
a dozen people, one of several Samaritan's Purse groups making
concurrent visits _ to be careful but polite. The water is not safe
to drink, he said, so they should decline token offerings of
thanks. And even in San Pedro Sula, a city of more than 330,000,
the streets are not safe. Men armed with pump shotguns make
themselves visible in front of banks and other businesses. In
Balsamo, where the cinder block home village is located, soldiers
of the National Police in camouflage fatigues tote M-16 rifles with
long curved ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has warned tourists that
machete-wielding bandits roam the countryside, often hijacking
passenger cars, cabs and even buses, sometimes between San Pedro
Sula and its airport about 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Tracie and Cary looked out of their bus windows in amazement as
peasant women washed clothes by hand in a muddy stream down a steep
hill from their shantytown village, where homes look like
clubhouses built in American back yards by kids using scrap lumber.
Buses and cars dodged mule-drawn carts hauling firewood or small
batches of bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, an energetic man who'd sent an army of employees of
Samaritan's Purse to pave the way for gift-bearing Americans, was
upset that the pilgrimage, which began Monday in Atlanta, started
out on a sour note. Just before the Conyers teens and their
delegation boarded their plane in Atlanta, rumors flew about the
latest school shooting spree in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Few details were available here until Wednesday, and Graham, who
piloted a twin-engine Samaritan's Purse jet from Atlanta to San
Pedro Sula, was clearly upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country has become so violent,'' he said during an
interview between stops. ``Everything is blood. The movies. The
video games. We have a generation of kids who know nothing but
violence. As long as we have this stuff, it's just going to get
worse. I'm just glad Cary and Tracie have a chance to come out and
show the good we do have in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the delegation had time to think too much about
the incident. After arriving late Monday, they spent the rest of
the week visiting orphanages and sick children and helping Graham's
paid staff and volunteers distribute Christmas shoe boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Each day began and ended with a devotional and short sermons by
Graham and other preachers in his ministry, which has 307
employees, most based in Boone. Buses ran on a tight schedule on
narrow roads where anarchy appeared to be the main traffic rule. It
was clear each stop had been carefully planned, because everything
went off like clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrimage climaxed at a run-down hospital in San Pedro
Sula, where the delegation gave gifts to stunned-looking children,
victims of accidents or parental neglect. Most children didn't even
muster a smile when handed gift boxes and hadn't seen toys before.
</P>
<P>
   After opening a box, Reina Orbelina, 4, didn't seem to know what
to do with a doll inside, but Judy Pressley Hauck, a 47-year-old
Heritage counselor who served as Tracie's chaperon, quickly showed
the malnourished girl, whose arms weren't much bigger than a garden
hose.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage girls stayed busy handing out gifts piled high on
metal carts that were pushed by Samaritan's Purse staffers. Though
the children in the crammed wards didn't seem to know what to make
of the commotion, their parents did. Adults came out of rooms to
beckon gift-givers in to make sure their children received
something for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Cary, Tracie, Hauck and Preston Sanders opened boxes of crayons,
then showed the sick kids how to use them in cartoonish coloring
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This picture is going to be so pretty,'' Cary said to
Esperanza Vasquez, 7, who showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's organization has delivered shoe box gifts to more than
80 countries around the world since 1993. In a week he leaves for
Kosovo and will be accompanied by Crystal Woodman, a 17-year-old
senior at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where students
killed 13 people a few weeks before the shootings at Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who concedes he was once a Scotch-guzzling ``hell
raiser,'' gave up smoking after he ``accepted Christ'' while in
Jerusalem at age 22. A sincere man given to black lizard skin
cowboy boots and bluejeans, he talks fondly of his father and
ailing mother, whom he said he regrets disappointing during his
years as a ``rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother ``got on me good,'' he laughed, after he drove a Land
Rover from London to the Middle East with a bottle of Scotch in one
hand and the other on the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up drinking 10 years ago and has been running
Samaritan's Purse, which has a $110 million annual budget, since
1979. He said he can relate to kids in trouble, even those who're
driven to ``crazy'' acts, because he spent so much time on a
wayward path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sinner,'' he said. ``The Bible says we have all sinned.
I'm still a sinner. I've been to hell on earth, Rwanda, Beirut,
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   And many other places, he said, ``that are even worse off than
Honduras.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, until his father passes the mantle of the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association to him, he said, he'll devote his time to
aiding the poor and helping American kids like Tracie and Cary
understand ``how much need is out there and what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope for these young girls it gives them a whole
appreciation for what they have, and to make others see it, too,''
Graham said. ``Bad things happen. But things aren't hopeless. Now
Tracie and Cary know that, too, and they will bear witness.''

STAND PUTS NEW SPIN ON HOLIDAY TREE SETUP

<P>
   Each year many of us find the perfect Christmas tree, and then
it's time to wrestle it into a tree stand.
</P>
<P>
   If you are still skinning your knuckles and swearing at the
stand you have had for years, convert it into a bird bath and buy a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   Tree stands have come a long way from a cross of wood nailed to
the base of the tree. Now on the market is the patented Swivel
Straight tree stand by Country Line Limited of Solon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Simply by stepping on a pedal, you can swivel the tree into
place. To keep the tree in position, just release the pedal. No
more crawling around on the floor readjusting screws.
</P>
<P>
   County Line's tree stand holds plenty of water (3 1/2- or
5-quart reservoir), is durable, easy to use and comes with a
lifetime guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Attach the receptacle to the tree trunk and tighten the large

HISTORIANS' REPORT BLAMES SWISS FOR BARRING JEWS DURING WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Israel, Britain, Sweden and Poland)   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland _ A panel of independent historians has
concluded that wartime Swiss officials refused entry to thousands
of Jewish refugees even after it was known that they faced almost
certain death in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1942 at the latest, the historians said in
their detailed 350-page report, the Swiss authorities were aware
that Jews were being annihilated by the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   The historians also said there was no evidence that accepting
many more asylum seekers would have put neutral Switzerland in
danger of ``invasion by the Axis or caused insurmountable economic
difficulties.'' They thus rejected an argument advanced in
Switzerland's defense after earlier disclosures of the country's
treatment of Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the report cited anti-Semiticsm and an entrenched fear
of foreigners in Switzerland as the reasons authorities turned away
more than 24,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials ``became involved in the crimes of the Nazi
regime by abandoning the refugees to their persecutors,''
Jean-Francois Bergier, the Swiss historian who headed the panel,
said at a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of larger historical inquiry, commissioned by
the Swiss government, that produced another report last year on
Switzerland's gold transactions with Hitler's Germany. Earlier this
week, a separate report by Swiss banks and American Jewish groups
found that 54,000 Swiss bank accounts might be linked to Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report was prepared over the last two years by nine
historians from Switzerland, Israel, the United States, Britain and
Poland, who had unprecedented access to the Swiss national archives
as part of Switzerland's effort to come to terms with its wartime
history. Jewish groups praised the new report, but there were
complaints from the Swiss government and from some private groups
that the sharply critical study failed to measure official actions
against the troubled international situation at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report did not delve deeply into other countries'
treatment of World War II refugees, historians said at Friday's
news conference that Sweden, also neutral during World War II, had
been significantly more helpful than Switzerland. Sweden, like
Switzerland, had limited Jewish immigration between 1938 and 1942,
but reversed its policy after officials learned of the mass
killings of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland followed suit only in July 1944, when it declared
that persecution for being Jewish was a valid ground for granting
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's governing body, the Federal Council, issued a
statement Friday saying the country's asylum policy ``was marred by
errors, omissions and compromises'' _ renewing its 1995 apology for
wartime refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can make good the consequences of decisions taken at
the time, and we pay our respects before the pain of those who were
denied access to our territory and were abandoned to unspeakable
suffering, deportation and death,'' the seven ministers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ministers said the report ignored ``fears generated by
the threat facing Switzerland, the uncertainty about the future, as
well as the necessity of maintaining foreign trade to ensure the
country's survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland took in 51,000 civilian refugees during the war,
including some 21,000 Jews, although many of those had slipped into
the country illegally and were then allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   There were some heroes among Swiss officials, particularly among
consular employees who ``were liberal in granting entry visas,''
but the report details specific instances of serious ``human
suffering'' to highlight the impact of Swiss refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
   The study cited as particularly egregious the Swiss push for a
requirement, enacted in 1938, that German passports for Jews be
stamped with a ``J.'' It also cited the closing of the border with
Germany in 1942 to refugees persecuted solely because they were
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Swiss pressure, the passports would not have been
stamped until later, perhaps not at all,'' the report concluded.
``This would have made it less difficult for refugees to find a
country willing to accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was particularly critical of the 1942 decision to
close Swiss borders to Jews even though senior officials were
``aware of the fact the refugees sent back were being threatened
with deportation to Eastern Europe culminating in death.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was some public protest, the Swiss authorities
stepped up rejections of asylum seekers _ even denying most the
right to pass through the country to other destinations _ declining
to ``help people in mortal danger,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In an annex to the report, the historians exonerated Switzerland
of accusations that Jews being deported from France and Italy could
have crossed Switzerland by train on their way to the gas chamber,
concluding there was no evidence to support that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the president of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar
Bronfman, said the report ``a landmark event in Swiss and European
history,'' and called it ``an example for other European nations to
follow.''

   At Goldman Sachs, A Bonanza For Charities &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Goldman Sachs Group, many fruits of going public are
going to schools that are private.
</P>
<P>
   Freed last month to give shares of the firm's stock to charity,
350 current and former Goldman partners have indicated how they
intend to dole out some of their charitable gifts this year. Among
the beneficiaries of their largess are some of the nation's most
exclusive colleges, universities and prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   The partners have been restricted from selling the shares they
received when Goldman raised $3.66 billion through its initial
public offering in May. But the firm waived those restrictions last
month to allow the partners to donate stock to organizations, which
can then turn around and sell the shares.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the eight million shares they plan to give away _
worth about $640 million _ will go into private foundations set up
by individual partners, according to a Goldman filing last week
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the remainder will go to the Fidelity Charitable
Gift Fund, which lets donors make contributions and decide later
how the assets will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recipients that were named are well-known charities
like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (19,614 shares) and the
Salvation Army (9,153).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Ivy League is well represented _ by, among
others, Harvard (27,460 shares), Yale (18,961), Cornell (26,152)
and the University of Pennsylvania (15,037). So are many of the
secondary schools that feed them, including Greenwich Academy in
Connecticut, 15,038 shares; the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville,
Conn., 30,729; the Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, 13,076;
and the Menlo School in Atherton, Calif., 13,076.
</P>
<P>
   The school receiving the largest windfall is Hamilton College of
Clinton, N.Y., which will get 75,384 shares, worth about $6
million, more than twice the amount for any other school that was
named.
</P>
<P>
   Among other less well-known beneficiaries were Adventure
Unlimited (10,461 shares), which operates camps in the West for
young Christian Scientists, and the Zarephath Community Chapel in
Zarephath, N.J., an evangelical community that suffered flood
damage (23,537) during Hurricane Floyd.  &QL;

   Kerschner's List: A Giant Fund Takes a Bow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management, the $65 billion money
management unit of PaineWebber, is finishing the century on a
lucrative high note. Last week, PaineWebber announced that it had
raised $2.1 billion in assets for a new offering, the PaineWebber
Strategy fund _ the largest subscription offering for an open-end
stock mutual fund ever.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund, which will hold just 30 or so stocks, will invest
in companies on the Highlighted Stocks list compiled by Edward M.
Kerschner, PaineWebber's chief investment strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Kerschner has been publishing the roster of
stocks, which he thinks stand to benefit from certain sociocultural
and economic themes.
</P>
<P>
   While the themes and stock picks have changed over the years,
the list's performance has been impressive in its consistency: the
average percentage price gain for his list has beaten that of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index every year since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988 through Aug. 31 of this year, the list gained 24.8
percent on average, compounded annually, versus 15.5 percent for
the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   So what themes will Kerschner be likely to bet on in the coming
year?
</P>
<P>
   One is something he calls the ``new millennium American'' _ his
belief that baby boomers, rolling in money and with their material
needs satisfied, will probably spend more money on experiences than
tangibles. Among the companies on his list that stand to benefit
are Carnival, Delta Air Lines, Tandy and AXA Financial.
</P>
<P>
   A second theme is what Kerschner calls ``muted cycle
cyclicals,'' his view that ``benign deflation'' and temperate
business cycles have changed the way different sectors move in and
out of style in the market. Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond, Gap, Illinois
Toolworks and Weyerhauser are stocks that stand to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   His third theme, ``information revolution wars,'' centers on
business opportunities resulting from technology. Beneficiaries
would include IBM, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund, temporarily closed to new shareholders, is
investing the cash it raised and should reopen early next year, but
only for a limited time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a limited-capacity product,'' said Brian M. Storms,
president of Mitchell Hutchins.

&HT;     CUBA CAPITALIZING ON REFUGEE BOY'S PLIGHT

 (Eds.: Accents on A in Elian, A in Gonzalez and second O in
Broton.)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ The first-grade classroom at Marcelo Salado
Primary School contains a single green desk, on top of which rests
a folded Cuban flag, six neatly stacked books and a pencil holder.
</P>
<P>
   A message is taped to the back of the tiny chair: ``Elian, your
seat is untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old pupil, Elian Gonzalez, was discovered over
Thanksgiving, clinging to an innertube off the Miami coast. He had
been separated from his 30-year-old mother, Elizabet Broton, a maid
who apparently perished along with several others who had hired an
ill-fated powerboat to take them to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government has organized daily demonstrations to
demand Elian's return, in the most heated showdown with Washington
since Cuban fighters downed two unarmed planes belonging to a Miami
exile group in 1996. In Cardenas, where the boy's father and four
grandparents still live, Elian has been turned into a kind of
living martyr. His innocent face is plastered everywhere _ in
doorways, on billboards and street banners _ and yet his friends
and relatives have no idea when they might see him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long, I can't take this anymore,'' said Mariela
Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother. ``I don't understand why
it's taking them so long to bring him home. It's just too much to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintana burst into tears while standing in her son's living
room and asked to postpone the interview. A family friend, who
identified himself as Gustavo, said Thursday that the family had
been under additional stress because they had been unable to talk
to Elian the past two days. The boy has no legal status in the US
but remains under the temporary custody of a great uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they call and the line is always busy,'' said
Gustavo. ``Sometimes they call and they just hang up on the other
end. It's inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, in the apartment where Elian's maternal
grandparents live above a pharmacy, an elderly man who identified
himself as an uncle said the boy's other grandmother, Raquel
Rodriguez, had required medical attention earlier in the day
because of the stress. He said she had gone to stay with her
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, she hasn't slept much in five days,'' said the
man, who declined to give his name and said he had been asked to
watch over the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's immediate fate appeared to revolve around his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a Communist Party member who works at a plum
job as a bellman in Varadero, a nearby beach resort. US officials
said they have been negotiating with the Cuban government to have
the Immigration and Naturalization Service interview Gonzalez to
prove that he is Elian's natural father and would like to see him
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Although the custody arrangement is still unclear, Elian
apparently spent as much time with his father, his stepmother and
his three-month-old half brother as he did with his mother. Yosbel
Perez, 27, a cook who lives across the street from the family, said
Elian ``lived with both sides'' and was often seen playing baseball
in the street with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very much a hands-on father,'' said Perez.
</P>
<P>
   US officials requested to interview Perez Wednesday evening but
said they received no response from the Cuban goverment. The next
day, President Fidel Castro said in an open letter published in
Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, that Gonzalez had decided
not to subject himself to an interview with any US government
official, a position that Castro said he supported. Later, US
officials said they hoped that the issue was still open.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gonzalez's relatives said he had traveled to
Havana, about 90 miles west of Cardenas, but declined to say what
his mission was or where he could be located. The sequence of
events has suggested that Washington may be slowly preparing to
return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you just send back a kid without knowing this is his
father?'' said one US official when asked why the process has taken
so long. ``The issue has been spotlighted and you don't want to
make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Elian only continues to grow as a symbol. After
more than 100,000 people marched Thursday past the US Interest
Section on the Malecon, the curving road that runs along the Havana
beachfront, thousands more people turned out Friday in Santiago,
Havana's second largest city. There were other sizeable protests in
other cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have been promoted and organized by the government,
which has used state-owned buses to ferry people to the
demonstrations. A US official derided the protests as staged events
that offered ``a rallying point'' for Cubans despite the ``rather
sad state of the revolution at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiments behind the protests appeared to be real,
fueled by Elian's close relationship with his father and the way
Cuban exiles in Miami have showered the boy with toys, as if to buy
his allegiance. Sylvio Rodriguez, the folk singer, drew a huge roar
from a crowd earlier this week when he sang two songs to Elian and
announced: ``I am here as a father, and, of course, a a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   In a poem posted on a bulletin board in Elian's classroom, a
woman wrote:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To see your mother die
</P>
<P>
   Is a pain that never leaves
</P>
<P>
   And now, to be with your own,
</P>
<P>
   You cannot, cannot even cry
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How is it possible that there exists
</P>
<P>
   So much egoism and cruelty
</P>
<P>
   This little one is a child
</P>
<P>
   He is not a toy to be played with
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elian's classroom essentially exists now as a shrine to the
little boy. On the wall is a picture if Elian wearing his his
school uniform _ red shorts, a white shirt and a blue kerchief _
and a pair of Nikes. A table is strewn with letters and poems
written to him from all over the country. On another table is a
book signed by hundreds of Cubans, including Castro, who visited
the school Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the freedom of Eliancito,'' wrote Castro, referring to the
boy by his nickname. ``Fatherland or death.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the door is an easel on which the boy was apparently just
learning to assemble words. On top of the easel, E-L-I-A-N is
spelled out in cardboard squares covered with letters written in a
black marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just learned to write his name,'' said a teacher
supervising the shrine. ``That's all he could write.''

NOT MANY USING `SAFE CORRIDOR' OUT OF GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHECKPOINT SEVER, Russia _ High on a wind-swept hill overlooking
Chechnya's burning, bombed-out capital of Grozny, a small crowd of
haggard-looking civilians crowded at a checkpoint Friday, held back
by heavily armed Russian riot police.
</P>
<P>
   The checkpoint straddles the ``humanitarian corridor'' the
Russian military command has opened to allow Chechen civilians to
leave Grozny and avoid a massive assault on the city the army has
threatened to unleash Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the only people who reach Checkpoint Sever are those willing
to brave the constant Russian shelling of the besieged capital and
able to walk several miles up a steep moutinroad north of the city.
That ruled out most of the civilians trapped in Grozny, according
to refugees who arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people, old people, ill people, Chechens, Russians, many
of them are still there, hiding in their cellars,'' said one woman
who gave only her first name, Malika, as she waited for police to
check her papers. ``They are cut off from the world. They have no
heat or light or food. They cannot even go outside for bread,
because the Russians stop us with their bombardment. They can't
even bury their dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Russian army dropped leaflets saying it would
kill anybody who remained in Grozny after Saturday. The leaflets
also promised safe passage for anyone who left. But by midday
Friday, only 330 refugees had been registered at Checkpoint
Severny.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing bombardment, and the slow outflow of refugees, have
raised questions about the goals of the Russian commanders'
warning. Independent observers have suggested that the threat to
kill everybody in Grozny was a sign that the Russian generals are
under pressure to finish the war in Chechnya as quickly as possible
after taking three months to occupy half of a republic about the
size of Connecticut. And some have expressed concern that the
military is considering more powerful weapons _ from fuel-air bombs
to gas _ to clear the city of an estimated 3,000-6,000 rebel
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers at Checkpoint Sever Friday gave several
explanations for the slow trickle of civilians. One said a computer
that checks each refugee's record for criminal activity failed to
work until Thursday. Another claimed that most of the civilinhad
already left Grozny, but that flies in the face of the Russian
government estimate that up to 45,000 civilians remain. A third
said the Chechen rebels were not letting anyone out, a charge that
refugees and a rebel spokesman denied.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum has provoked outrage in the West, and Friday a top
Russian politician, breaking with the generally supportive mood on
Chechnya, joined in the criticism of what the Kremlin calls its
``anti-terrorist operation'' in the separatist republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will everyone get out? And if they don't, will they also be
destroyed?,'' asked Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, leader of an
anti-Kremlin political alliance, at a conference in Moscow. ``Thi
is no way to fight terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Russian officials are now trying to play down the
ultimatum, saying it was aimed at rebel fighters in Grozny and
designed to save civilian lives. Friday, Emergency Situations
Minister Sergei Shoigu backed away further, saying Russian forces
would interrupt combat operations to let civilians leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deadline. Everything will be all right,'' Shoigu
told NTV television. ``What deadline? Is it the end of the world
tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu is the leader of a Kremlin-backed party which is vying
with Luzhkov's alliance for seats in the Duma, or parliament, in an
election set for December 19.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya, Colonel Alexander Veklich, a Russian military
spokesman, said federal forces had halted their barrage against
Grozny days ago to let civilians out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true, they bombed us all last night,'' said Malika
Friday. ``Just like they've been bombing us for the past two
months. They haven't killed any fighters, u they've killed lots of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees said the bombardment has been so bad the past few days
that many people in Grozny did not know about the ultimatum because
they dared not venture outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, someone told us about the safe corridor, and we decided
to risk it,'' said Khasan Takayev, who fled with his wife and two
small children.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Veklich acknowledged that there may have been some
fighting in recent days, but he blamed the rebels for the small
number of refugees. He said the insurgents wanted to use civilians
as ``human shields'' and had shot at anyone who tried to escape the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not fired at Grozny today,'' Veklich said. As he
spoke, a salvo of explosions erupted on a nearby ridge, sounding
suspiciously like outgoing artillery. Veklich said troops were
using explosives to dig a trench. Another salvo sounded. A reporter
asked some soldiers what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're digging a trench,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's outgoing artillery,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up, Sergei!'' said the first soldier.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the only contradiction at this checkpoint, or around
Grozny. Shoigu, the minister, said buses would use six routes to
take refugees safely to Russian-controlled territory in the north.
But there wasonly one open road.
</P>
<P>
   And why was the checkpoint way up on the hilltop, far from the
highway leading out of the city in the valley below?
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman said the road was the most convenient route
out of the city. But soldiers manning Russian positions on the
mountain offered a different explanation _ despite Russian claims
that Grozny is completely encircled, the military has not been able
to take control of the road, and rebel fighters still command a
village outside Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 245th brigade tried to take it, but they couldn't,'' said
one soldier, who asked to remain anonymous. ``They were ambushed
and lost eight guys. We still haven't taken it. It is far from calm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those losses were not reported by the military _ in the official
version of events, that ambush never happened. In fact, the
official death toll has actually fallen since last month, when the
government information center said 452 servicemen had died and
1,485 had been wounded since Russian troops began fighting Islamic
militants who invaded Dagestan, a region next to Chechnya, in
August.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Russian commanders said their losses totalled 379
dead and 800 wounded for the entire campaign. No explanation was
given for the lower casualty count.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders in the field do not talk about their losses,
they talk about successes. Colonel Sergei Skiba, an infantry
commander with a fur hat and white beard, described how his unit
wiped out a rebel force near a train station three miles east of
Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were well dug-in, but we surprised them,'' Skiba said as
he showed off elaborate trenches he said were dug by the rebels.
``We came in from behind when they expected us to attack head on.
They thought they would hold out for long, but we showed them we
have an army, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He handed a reporter a pair of binoculars, which revealed a line
of Russian tanks and armored vehicles in the distance. Beyond them
stood the battered houses and buildings of Grozny. Thick plmes of
smoke from burning oil wells blackened the sky. The city center,
already badly damaged during the 1994-1996 war that left Chechnya
de facto independent of Moscow, has been totally flattened by
Moscow's campaign to bring he region back under its control.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders say the Chechen fighters inside Grozny cannot
cross their lines. But Russian soldiers, and the rebels, say the
separatists move easily at night. Analysts say this means that even
as the numerically and technically superior Russian force takes
towns and territory, they are vulnerable to guerilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them try,'' said Colonel Skiba.
</P>
<P>
   He said his troops have an advantage the Russians lacked in the
last war _ the support of villagers. Towns that refused to take in
rebel fighters were spared bombardment, a fact made clear by a ride
on a BMP-2 troop carrier through a muddy field just outside Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   To the left was a train station and a cluster of houses, all
destroyed, where Chechens had taken up positions. To the right was
the unscathed village of Tsentora-yurt, which made a deal with the
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not fighting them,'' Skiba said. ``They are Russian
citizens like us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Colonel Veklich said the Chechens had blown
up canisters containing toxic chemicals in Khankala, a suburb on
the eastern outskirts of Grozny, and winds were carrying a toxic
cloud northwest over the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Veklich said the cloud likely consisted of chlorine and ammonia.
He said it was impossible to assess immediately if there was any
danger to civilians, but that the cloud would disperse within two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels are trying any men to keep people from leaving,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Chechen spokesman had a different story. He said Russian
artillery had hit a storage tank of chemicals at a former military
factory. The spokesman, Sharip Yusupov, said the rebels had
frequently warned the military not to hit the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Felgenhauer, an independent Russian military analysts, has
suggested that Moscow might be planning to use chemical weapons to
clear the city of fighters. In an interview last week, he said that
if the weapons were used, the Russians could then easily claim it
was the Chechens who employed them.
</P>
<P>
   Contradictions.

NO BOMB, MALFUNCTION ABOARD EGYPTAIR 990, US OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A detailed analysis of the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir
Flight 990 has uncovered nothing to indicate that a bomb or any
mechanical problem caused the Cairo-bound e t crash, the nation's
top aviation-safety official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said that sophisticated sound analysis of the cockpit
recorder is continuing but that ``no sounds have been detected that
would be consistent with mechanical failures or an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   All 217 on board were killed when the Boeing 767 crashed 60
miles south of Nantucket, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The 31 1/2-minute tape begins before the aircraft took off from
New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on the morning of
Oct. 31, Hall noted, and ``routine air traffic control
communications are heard throughout the recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a major problem with the jet or an explosion, it
is likely that a member of the crew would have issued a distress
call during the 51 seconds in which the plane dropped from its
cruising altitude of 33,000 feet to 16,400 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the plane's two ``black boxes'' _ the cockpit
recorder and the flight data recorder _ stopped working, as did the
plane's transponder, which sends identifying information to
controllers, indicating a power failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did a member of the flight crew use radio
communication to advise air traffic control of either an emergency
of a mechanical failure or concern,'' Hall said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the safety board will conduct a major,
expensive reconstruction of the wreckage, sources said. Hall seemed
to indicate as much. ``The ship will conduct its salvage operations
for about a week before returning to port. The need for further
operations will be evaluated at that time'
</P>
<P>
   A private salvage vessel will be used to recover human rmains
and wreckage. It arrived in Rhode Island on Tuesday, but because of
ba weather, it is not expected to sail to the crash site until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said investigators will most likely focus on the cockpit
and the area below the cockpit floor. Investigators believe it is
likely that the plane was brought down deliberately by copilot
Gamil El Batouty when he was alone in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   While Hall would not characterize either the Arabic or English
transcripts of the voice recording, sources said Captain Ahmed El
Habashi is heard returning to the cockpit and saying, ``Pull with
me! Help me! Pull with me!''
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder indicates that the elevator flaps on
the tail were split, with the left one _ manipulated by the captain
_ pointing up in an effort to give the plane lift, while the right
elevator was pointed down. Elevators are controlled by pushing or
pulling on the column, or yoke, in the cockpit. The Boeing 767 has
two columns that work in tandem unless more than 50 pounds of
pressure is exerted to shear a pin connecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the safety board was poised to turn the
investigation over to the FBI, believing that Batouty might be one
of the worst mass murderers in US history. Egyptian officials,
however, have disputed the contention.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, careful not to create a new controversy, would not
elaborate on what the transcript contains, saying ``I do not
believe this transcript can be characterized or further described
without adding to the speculation or misleading the public about
the contents of the recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said tat investigators had finished initial simulator work
at Boeing using infrmation from the data recorder to re-create the
environment of the cockpit by having instrument displays and
control input mechanisms behave as they would have during the
accident.

NOTE FROM CLINTON LED TO ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Israeli and Syrian leaders meet next week at
the White House to resume negotating a return of the high Golan
plateau for the promise of peace, they will know full well that it
was the third man in the room who got them there.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who sees the chance of a peace deal as a
crowning achievement to his two terms in office, pointedly passed a
message to Syrian President Hafez Assad three months ago that time
was running out if he wanted the return of the Golan Heights, said
US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him, `The train is pulling out of the station,' ''
said one administration official who works on Middle East issues.
``What just happened was that Assad decided to get on the train.''
</P>
<P>
   The train is Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By his and others' reckoning, Assad and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak can either work out a deal now in the last year of
Clinton's presidency, or they can wait for several years _ if then
_ until the next US president is prepared to step in as broker.
Historically, complex foreign policy negotiations, especially
involving the Middle East, are not seriously undertaken until after
a president's first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which will open Wednesday with Clinton and then move
to the Blair House, a nearby presidential guest house, will
encompass several issues, including Israel's withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, which was captured from Syria in 1967, security
arrangements, and the nature of peace between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is reached _ a major if _ the repercussions would
reverberate far beyond Golan, which explains the excitement being
felt by so many in the Clinton administration and in the Middle
East. A deal presumably means that Israel would pull its troops out
of southern Lebanon; that the Lebanese army would crack down on the
Hezbollah guerrilla fighters; that radical groups in Iran would
lose an avenue of attack on Israel; and that Israel would be
encircled by old enemies who had made peace with it. That leaves
one negotiation unfinished _ the most difficult one, with the
Palestinians, over the future of Jerusalem, the West Bank, water
rights, and return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long been obsessed with the prospect of putting
together the pieces of a comprehensive peace deal, even spending
most of nine days in the fall of 1998 to wrest several incremental
advances in the Israeli-Palestinian peace track. He also has been
obsessed with getting credit for being the dealmaker and winning
his place in history alongside former President Jimmy Carter, who
brokered the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt. Clinton
has insisted to his senior aides that he must be the one who
announced any advances _ not subordinates and not Middle East
leaders, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the Israel-Syria talks, Clinton sees the prospect of
breakthrough, but only if the talks begin now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a clear understanding in Syria that this is the last
chance for the Clinton administration,'' said Shibley Telhami, who
holds the Anwar Sadat Chair for Peace and Development at the
University of Maryland. ``If they didn't do it this time, (the
administration) would move on to other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Murphy, director of Middle East Studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York and ambassador to Syria
from 1974 to 1977, said Assad told him in 1974 that ``there had to
be active American participation before there is any peace deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His first words to me were, `You are more than a middleman,'
'' Murphy said. ``I think President Clinton may only have had to
promise him that America would be actively involved in the
negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more than that, but the details remain a mystery.
When he announced the resumption of talks, which had broken off
more than three years ago, he said he took a ``blood oath'' not to
reveal his terms of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   But, said one US official, ``it took a lot of finessing to get
Assad'' to reopen talks.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, whose health has been failing for several years, is
sending Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa to negotiate on his
behalf, while Barak will represent his country. It represents the
highest level talks ever between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks shift to the Blair House, they will likely
include Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, US officials
said. The discussions, scheduled to last two days, are aimed at
establishing a framework for tackling the outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   Further talks could be held either near Washington or at a
Middle East location. Barak, who said when he was elected in June
that he wanted to withdraw troops from Lebanon in a year's time,
has told US officials that he expects difficult negotiations with
Syria but that a solution ``could come fast, and we're talking
weeks, not months,'' the US official said.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is running so high in some quarters in Israel that
there have already been newspaper articles speculating when Barak
will visit Syria. US officials offer more tempered assessments but
clearly see the talks as a big step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Said longtime US Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross Friday:
``Clearly, both sides have a level of confidence about the
possibility of needs being met, and that's one of the reasons that
they have come to the conclusion that it's important to get back to
the table and try to work things out.''

FAA TO ENFORCE RULES GOVERNING RESERVE PILOT HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration informed airlines Friday
that it will begin enforcing a rule requiring reserve pilots to
have at least nine hours of rest in the last day before they can be
called in to fly an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Because airlines are worried about having to cancel flights if
crews are not available to fly, some 11 airlines _ including major
carriers American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and US Airways _ had
asked the FAA for an extension. But the agency granted only one
extension, to Comair, a relatively small carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gilligan, FAA deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said the FAA had notified airlines in
June that the rule, which in effect requires reserve or ``on call''
status not to be considered rest time, would be implemented in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were in noncomplaince at the time, we believed six
months a reasonable period of time for them to make corrections,''
Gilligan said in a telephone conference.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve pilots are full-time airline employees, but much like
substitute teachers, they fill in when a regularly scheduled pilot
is sick or cannot continue to fly. Most pilots are paid only for
the hours they fly.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve rest rule had been in place since at least 1991, but
not enforced. For the most part, airlines interpreted reserve
status or pilots ``on call'' as resting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have known about this upcoming requirement since
last June,'' said Duane Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots
Association. ``There is absolutely no excuse for granting any more
leeway. Any extensions would be unfair to the airlines that acted
in good faith to meet the requirement, and unfair to the traveling
public, which expects that existing FAA safety rules will be
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are increasingly faced with pilot shortages as older
pilots retire, and the demand for air travel increases. Hiring and
training pilots is expensive and takes time. The costs will borne
by travelers in the form of higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the industry's trade association,
has estimated that carriers will have to hire about 3 percent more
pilots to comply with the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said FAA inspectors will begin on Monday conducting a
comprehensive review of the scheduling of airlines. Once inspectors
have a baseline understanding of the scheduling systems, they will
begin to collect data on the actual schedules of reserve crews used
to see if the FAA requirement is being met, a process that is
expected to take several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find noncompliance, they will bring that to the
carrier's attention and will see if the carrier made a good-faith
effort to comply,'' said Gilligan. The FAA could take action
ranging from written letters to fines.
</P>
<P>
   Comair, a regional airline, was granted an extension until April
1. Gilligan said Comair officials worked with FAA inspectors and
presented a plan to hire and train new pilots and were making ``a
good-faith effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said the other airlines that asked for extensions but
were denied were American Eagle, Piedmont, Allegheny, Midwest
Express, Air Midwest, Pacific Southwest Airlines, and Skyways
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Piedmont, Allegheny and PSA are owned by US Airways. US Airways
spokesman David Castelveter said the airline ``will comply with the
new reserve crew rest rules while making every effort to keep our
schedule intact. Should there be any impact, we expect it to be in
line with the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot fatigue is a contentious issue in aviation and the
National Transportation Safety Board has made numerous
recommendations to the FAA to improve regulatory oversight of pilot
scheduling to reduce fatigue. The NTSB is scheduled to hold
hearings next month on the June 1 crash of an American Airlines
flight at Little Rock, Ark. that killed 11 people. One issue the
NTSB is examining is flight crew decision-making and its
relationship to fatigue. The crew was approaching the maximum
amount of time it could work for one day.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA proposed new rules in 1995, but received so many
criticisms in the public comment period it withdrew the proposal.

HANCOCK IPO YIELD EXPECTED TO APPROACH $2.6 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. could raise
nearly $2.6 billion, one-quarter more than originally expected,
when it sells stock to the public next month.
</P>
<P>
   According to a document Hanockc filed Friday with securities
regulators, the amount would constitute one of the largest initial
public offerings ever for a financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston insurer originally anticipated raising $2 billion in
its sale, set for Jan. 27. That figure was computed by multiplying
the 102 million shares that Hancock will sell by the estimated $20
per share price indicated by the company in a September filing.
</P>
<P>
   A new document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
offered a price range for Hancock of $15 to $25 per share. The
upper end of the scale means the company could raise $2.55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, the nation's 13th-largest life insurer, is converting
from a mutual company owned by policyholders to a stock company
owned by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's stock will be formally priced the night
before it is sold, the initial price is likely to fall somewhere in
the range indicated by Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   The range is particularly broad _ there is a 66.6 percent
difference between the low and the high price _ because Hancock had
to notify regulatory authorities of its conversion plan months in
advance . The range must be able to accommodate market swings,
which are harder to project further out. Most companies file
initial public offering prospectuses much closer to the actual
offering date and have smaller ranges of around 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A price of $25 a share values Hancock at $8.3 billion. And it
gives Hancock a book value of $15 per share. The investment
community will calibrate the initial price against projected
earnings _ still a company secret under SEC rules. Independent
industry analysts have said Hancock could be worth up to $14
billion once in public hands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to selling shares to the public, Hancock will issue
an additional 231.2 million shares to policyholders who are
eligible for compensation for their ownership rights in the old
company. Hancock will have a total 333.2 million shares of
outstanding common stock. The company has 3.3 million
policyholders, including 2.9 million eligible for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock will spend the bulk of its sale proceeds, or $1.7
billion, compensating policyholders with cash and policy credits.
It will retain $200 million for internal uses, including paying out
shareholder dividends in 2000. Had the company been public this
year, it could have paid out $607.1 million in shareholder
dividends based on its 1998 financial results, according to
Friday's SEC filing.

   The document said Hancock will spend at least $252 million on
the administrative and transaction costs of ``demutualization,'' as
the conversion process is known. About $100 million of the total
will go to the investment bankers and underwriters, led by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, who will sell Hancock stock to professional
investors.

   The 137-year-old company wants to go public to have stock as a

shares in a 1-for-3 reverse split and petition Nasdaq to move its

   ADAIR-INNOCENCE (Los Angeles) -- In an unusual move, a judge has
declared Jeanie Adair factually innocent of the November 1996
beating death of her husband in their Sylmar condominium. The judge
said he found Jeanie Adair had no possible motive to kill Paul
Adair, although she has collected about $400,000 in insurance
money. Adair was not in the courtroom, but said through her
attorney: ``This is the second-best Christmas gift.'' The ruling
will allow Adair to say that she has never been arrested. It will
also clear her record of any mention of the arrest or trial. By

LEARNINGSMITH GOING OUT OF BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Learningsmith Inc., the educational toys-and-games
retail chain founded by entrepreneur Marshall Smith that counted
public TV station WGBH as an early investor, plans to close all 87
of its stores by mid-January and go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Learningsmith employs about 850 full-time workers and 1,500
part-timers, said Harold B. Murphy of Hanify &AMP; King, the Boston law
firm that represents Learningsmith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting in place a severance package,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Bulington, mass. company's senior executives,
including chief executive Janet Emerson, have already ``departed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company anticipates liquidating all of its assets, and
store-closing inventory sales are presently under way at the
company's 87 store locations throughout the country,''
Learningsmith said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued Friday shortly after the company filed
for Chapter 11 protection in US Bankruptcy Court in Boston. In
court documents, Learningsmith listed assets of $60.7 million and
debts of $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the holiday shopping season, fun and games can be a
tough business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive environment,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Learningsmith couldn't figure out how to attract
enough of the consumers' toy dollar in a world where everyone from
Wal-Mart to Target and Toys ``R'' Us is selling toys.
</P>
<P>
   As if competition wasn't already fierce enough, brick-and-mortar
toy sellers face new competiton from Internet retailers such as
eToys.com, Amazon.com, and toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Learningsmith attempted to stand out from this crowd by offering
distinct product lines that were available nowhere else. But those
products were believed to account for less than 40 percent of the
store merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many items could be found at other stores such as
Zany Brainy or Noodle Kidoodle. Often, larger rivals could sell
items at lower prices than Learningsmith could.
</P>
<P>
   Brio, a Swedish toy company that sold products to Learningsmith,
suggested the chain ``lacked focus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only about 10 percent of what they sell are toys,'' said
president Peter Reynolds of Brio's US subsidiary. ``You couldn't go
there as a destination. It was a place for impulse buys.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides toys, Learningsmith sells computer software, art
supplies, books, puzzles, and science projects.
</P>
<P>
   A privately owned company, Learningsmith never disclosed sales
or earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the creditors listed on Learningsmith's court documents
were Citizens Financial Group Inc., Brio, and founder Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he has had no involvement with Learningsmith in
recent years. He said he left Learningsmith in the mid 1990s to
start Cybersmith, a cafe concept with computer terminals wired to
the Internet at almost every table.
</P>
<P>
   Cybersmith also filed for Chapter 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Big Learningsmith suppliers such as Brio have insurance to help
cover their losses. But small suppliers can be out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I was robbed,'' said Julia Blagden, who runs a
tiny San Francisco firm that supplied CDs of children's music to
Learningsmith. ``This is going to screw me.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was founded in 1991, Learningsmith was believed to be a
new kind of store, one that eschewed violent toys to focus on
educational learning experiences for kids and adults.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH was an early investor, and the chain was once known as WGBH
Learningsmith. Among items sometimes found on store shelves were
videos and companion books of the Nova and Masterpiece Theater
series, two staples of public television.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH incrementally invested about $1 million in Learningsmith in
its early years; none of that money came from member donations or
government funding, said Jeanne Hopkins, a WGBH vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investment was earned back and then some,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Learningsmith made a big push to expand nationally a few
years ago, WGBH opted to play a reduced role, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We essentially licensed our name to the stores in the Boston
area,'' Hopkins said. ``But we never had any involvement in
management.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH viewers who make donations to the station can qualify for
discounts at Learningsmith stores.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hopkins, ``Whether they will still honor that, I don't
know.''

SAMSONOV STATISTICS HIGH ON ASSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Ts News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It's not very often that Bruins left wing Sergei
Samsonov looks at his season statistics and notices he has more
assists (seven) than goals (six).
</P>
<P>
   But that's the case this season for the third-year right wing,
who was the rookie of the year in 1997-98 with 22 goals and 25
assists in 81 games. Last season, he bettered those numbers
(25-26-51) in 79 games.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov believes he should be more productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be better than six goals,'' said the 5-foot-8-inch,
184-pound Russian. ``It seems I'm getting chances every game, but
I'm not burying the puck. One day, though, that's going to come.
And then there are the assists _ I've never had more assists than
I've had goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, opponents played Smsonov differently, making sure
that he didn't simply get the puck and scoot by without being
checked. Now Samsonov is getting hit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are paying attention to be right now,'' said Samsonov,
who has had only one two-goal game, against the Buffalo Sabres Oct.
30. ``Opposing teams are watching the tapes and they're seeing what
kind of moves I make and I'm trying to adjust to that. I knew that
would happen eventually, so it's not really a surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of this special attention started late in Samsonov's
rookie season, as he was en route to leading the league's rookies
in goals and power-play goals, and was second in assists.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns wants to make sure Samsonov doesn't lose
the puck in critical areas while ang into traffic. ``He's got to
skate away and let them chase him,'' Burns said. ``He's a dandy
when it comes to handling the puck. He's got a lot of skill. But
with his size, he's got to overcome that in making people run after
him, not running into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Samsonov, ``Opponents have been playing physically against
me all the time, but I don't see any difference between my second
year and this season, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has implored Burns to shoot more, and, Samsonov said,
``I'm starting to pick up on that. I'm shooting a little bit more,
I'm thinking more about shooting right now than about making other
moves. It's in my head right now. I'm taking five or six shots, and
you've got to do that _ take more chances _ if you're going to
score.''
</P>
<P>
   When Samsonov was playing for the Detroit Vipers in the
International League (1996-97), he was able to watch quite a few of
the Red Wings' home games on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best teams in the league,'' said Samsonov of
the Wings (17-8-3, first in the Central Division), who will visit
the FleetCenter Saturday night. ``We have to be ready for them,
both mentally and physically. We have to start thinking of the game
right now, not just one hour before the game. We have to be ready
when we get on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have gone 0-3-2 in their last five, which has
Samsonov puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why that's been happening, that we've had those
ties, after we've come back from 2-0 and 1-0 deficits, but we just
have't had enough to come back all the way,'' Samsonov said. ``(In
a 2-2 tie with Edmonton Thursday) we both played similar hockey, we
had good effort and the's nothing wrong with a tie. Sure, you
always want to get that extra point, especially when you outshoot
them (37-21).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain why we have so many ties. It just
happens sometimes, we just need that extra effort to win the game.
We had a lot of chances in the overtime and we just have to bury
those chances.''

SLEEPY STEPS FOR JAPAN AFTER A LONG HIBERNATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The questions may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Commodore Perry parked his big black ships at the mouth of
what is now Tokyo Bay nearly 150 years ago and demanded entry,
Japan was still a feudal society.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Japan appears to be tentatively emerging from a
more modern version of the Dark Ages, an economic recession that
has lasted for most of the decade. More important, the rigidity
that has been the hallmark of its postwar economic structure
appears to be cracking.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are talking about doing things that have been going
on elsewhere for years: privatization, deregulation, restructuring,
promoting competition.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign direct investment, never very popular in Japan, is
rising. The banking system is being reformed. And some big
companies that used to guarantee lifetime employment are announcing
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments have not gone unnoticed: the Topix stock index
is up nearly 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   P. Nicholas Edwards, a managing director and head of the Warburg
Pincus Japan Growth fund, talked about the Japan that seems to be
emerging from the rubble. Following are excerpts from the
conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Numbers released in Tokyo last week suggest that after two
periods of very modest expansion, Japan's economy contracted a bit
in the third quarter. After being so weak for so long, are
conditions still that fragile?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The numbers were badly reported in the U.S. The headline
number was worse than expected, although that was largely due to
the fact that prices as measured by the gross domestic product
deflator fell more than they had in the second quarter. In real
terms, the economy grew at just under a 1 percent annual rate, up
from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the economy won't show tremendous
growth. It will grind through that period with growth of somewhere
between 0.5 percent and 1 percent. Two years down the road, the
economy should really accelerate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the Japanese consumer, who unlike his Western
counterparts would rather save money instead of spend it? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The consumer is feeling more buoyant than he was, but that is
a relative judgment, because he was very depressed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Computer sales are up 57 percent year-over-year, and last month
car registrations turned positive for the first time in 32 months.
Consumers don't feel ebullient, but they do feel a bit better and
there is a constructive view going forward. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. That is not exactly the sort of economic outlook that should
excite investors. Yet the stock market is doing better. Why? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The story about Japan and the stock market _ and it has been
a tremendous year if you were in the right areas _ is about Japan
feeling its way to the creation of the new economy which surrounds
the Internet and telecommunications and restructuring. Some
companies are working very hard and are very focused on improving
value for shareholders. Others are less focused. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which companies best symbolize this new Japan? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I refer to them as the Three Musketeers _ Softbank, NTT
Mobile Communications Network and Hikari Tsushin. Those companies
symbolize the growth in the telecommunications and Internet sector
in Japan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any other companies that come to mind? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sony and Fujitsu have done well. But it is really a sector
thing. A number, including telecommunications, electronics,
specialty retailers and securities brokers, have done well. The
rest have underperformed. Fifteen of the 33 groups of stocks in
Japan are down for the year. Steel, mining, foods, &QL; 
warehousing are all the boring old sectors. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your 2000 market forecast? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The outlook is not quite as good, but the basic premises of
the thesis remain sound: by continuing to invest selectively in the
winners one should continue to do quite well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the depths of the Asian crisis, it was commonly held that
the rest of Asia couldn't recover without a vigorous Japan. Things
don't seem to be panning out quite that way. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The fact that the economy has gone from negative to positive
growth, and that the currency is stronger, has been positive for
the region. It may be a while before Japan becomes an engine again,
but Asia looks quite good because Japan looks better. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Japan is a very traditional society with entrenched elites.
What are the chances the forces that represent those elites, and
the old economy, will prevail over those who represent the new
economy? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is validity in the fact that there are forces of
conservatism in the country. But there is zero chance the old will
win out over the new.
</P>
<P>
   Culture is irrelevant. If you compare Great Britain of the 1950s
through the early 1970s to today, it is apples and oranges. At the
moment, Japan is probably halfway through its transformation.

FUNCTIONAL FOODS: HOW DO THEY TASTE? A FOOD CRITIC ANSWERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12)

   All food is functional. That's why humans eat three times a day.
But unlike animals and insects, they do not eat for function's sake
alone. Somewhere in the tortured mental software that governs
eating behavior, the pleasure principle lives in more or less
uneasy proximity to the efficiency principle. We eat to live, but
we also live to eat, which means that functional foods have to jump
through two hoops at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Do they taste good? That is the question. In my home test
kitchen, I consumed a generous sampling of functional products,
jotting down my taste impressions and rating them on what might be
called the imperial Roman scale: thumbs up or thumbs down. Here are
the results. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHOLESTEROL CONTROLLERS
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Apricot and Orange Cereal Bar. Thumbs down. Texture of a
rubber eraser, enlivened by a hideously artificial fruit flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Deluxe Raspberry Muesli. Thumbs down. Makes you wonder
what the non-deluxe version could possibly be.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol Thousand Islands Dressing. Thumbs down. Like McDonald's
secret sauce, without the finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol spread. Thumbs down. Exhibits absolutely no taste
characteristics other than salt.
</P>
<P>
   Take Control spread. Thumbs down. A slick texture and,
astoundingly, even less flavorful than Benecol, even though it has
more salt.
</P>
<P>
   Take Control Blue Cheese Dressing. Thumbs down. Blue cheese
dressing should taste like blue cheese. This tastes like sugar and
vinegar and has the consistency of paint.
</P>
<P>
   BONE BUILDERS
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Apricot and Almond Cereal Bar. Thumbs down. A notch above
the apricot-orange, but the flavor is medicinal.
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Instant Hot Chocolate Drink. Thumbs up. A little chalky,
but the chocolate flavor is fairly honest and not too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Orange Juice Drink. Thumbs up. A good, tangy orange flavor
with apricot notes and the peculiar penicillin-like whiff that
seems to haunt all orange drinks not actually squeezed from
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Viactiv Soft Calcium Chews, Caramel flavor. Thumbs up. A nice,
salt-water-taffy consistency, with a respectable, dark brown sugar
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   DIGESTIVE AIDS
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Crunchy Wholewheat Biscuits. Thumbs up. Dense and compact,
with a subtle almond flavor.
</P>
<P>
   MULTIFORTIFIED SNACKS (with fiber, anti-oxidants, vitamins)
</P>
<P>
   EnfaGrow Nutritional Cracker Bites (for Toddlers), Cheese
Flavor. Thumbs up. Sharp cheddar flavor comes through before the
cracker disintegrates into an unpleasantly dusty, dry powder.
</P>
<P>
   SUGAR CONTROLLERS (for diabetics)
</P>
<P>
   Choice Nutrition Bar, Fudge Brownie. Thumbs down. Chews like a
plug of tobacco, minus the flavor, except for a haylike aftertaste.
The chocolate coating seems to be for color only. Nuts depicted on
the wrapping fail to show up in the actual bar.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The gold market has just gone through a derivative burnout, not
an awakening signaling the end of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   As the price surged from $253.70 to $326 an ounce in an
August-to-October rally, burnout seems to have been a key element.
In time, though, the rally may give desperate gold bulls some small
hope.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have been happier on Sunday, Sept. 26, when 15
European central banks said they would limit their annual gold
sales to 400 metric tons (almost 13 million ounces) for five years
and promised to restrict their gold lending to current levels.
</P>
<P>
   That statement was the spark needed for a rally, even though the
permitted gold sales would be well above the annual average of 297
tons during the 1990s. It also removed the threat of a huge
increase in central bank sales, a worry that had been depressing
gold prices for years. And the restriction on central bank gold
lending would make bets against gold by speculators and hedging by
producers less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Haruko Fukuda, executive director of the World Gold Council,
felt that the environment in the gold market had changed so much
that she declared in a speech Oct. 18 that ``a new era dawned for
gold'' that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the price of gold back down to $281 an ounce, even the
bulls are wondering.
</P>
<P>
   George Milling-Stanley, manager of gold market analysis at the
gold council, acknowledges that something big has to happen to get
the price up.
</P>
<P>
   The derivative turmoil was not on the scale _ nor did it get the
headlines _ that came with the near-collapse of Long Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund that was rescued in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Ashanti Goldfields Co. of Ghana and Cambior Inc. of
Canada are both reeling because of their gold hedging programs,
which depend on derivatives. And like Long Term Capital, the two
companies underestimated the risk of a sharp market move against
them, in this case a surge in the price of gold.
</P>
<P>
   In a market where the price of gold had fallen for the last four
years, bets against gold were understandable. And hedging _ which
allows gold producers to sell their production in the future at
prices above current levels _ enabled many companies to be
profitable while the price was declining.
</P>
<P>
   But this appears to be a case of two companies going too far in
their derivative plays: both are now struggling to survive because
their hedges turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti, which had 10 million ounces of gold, or 38 percent of
its reserves, hedged on Sept. 30, had to give its bullion dealers
the option to buy 15 percent of the company to avoid being forced
to meet a margin call against potential hedge losses that analysts
said were around $270 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti said the margin call threatened its solvency. Cambior
quickly had to buy one million ounces of gold to reduce its
exposure to losses, which Michael Jalonen, a Merrill Lynch analyst,
calculated at $88 million on Sept. 30. Cambior is now trying to
sell off some of its gold and base metal assets. Both companies
have agreements with their bullion dealers that give them time to
work out their problems.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of the unwinding of these hedge positions _ which could
have required the purchase of millions of ounces of gold _ was a
driving force behind the panic gold buying in late September and
early October. Investors who had bet on a gold price decline
scurried to buy the metal back, while producers bought to limit
their hedging losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put a great deal of fuel into the rally,'' said Philip
Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields Mineral Services, a
London-based precious metals research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the derivative burnout might still redound to the benefit of
the gold price if it changes the attitude of speculators and gold
producers, who have assumed that the price will stay where it is or
fall further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have seen that this market can move both ways, up
and down,'' said Bruce D. Hansen, chief financial officer of the
Newmont Mining Corp. If that lesson takes hold, speculators won't
be as eager to bet on further declines and producers will hedge
less. And that would provide gold some headroom.

JAPANESE EXPECTANT, AND HOPE THE PRINCESS IS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ By the starchy standards of palace life, theirs has been
anything but a conventional fairy tale. But with an abundance of
patience, and some high-powered medical help, it seems that their
dream has finally come true.
</P>
<P>
   After more than six years of a marriage filled with nervous
speculation over whether Crown Prince Naruhito and his wife,
Princess Masako, were able to furnish a successor to the
Chrysanthemum Throne, the Japanese people awoke to a flood of news
reports Friday that the couple would appear to be bearers of good
news.
</P>
<P>
   If the news must still be stated in the conditional, it is only
because the Imperial Household Agency, the secretive and extremely
cautious bureau that manages the lives of Japan's royalty down to
the way they are allowed to wave to admirers, has not made any
official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many ordinary Japanese have judged that leaks like these,
about a child reportedly due in August, cannot happen by accident.
And in a country stuck rather gloomily in a decade-long economic
rut, many concluded excitedly that the news of the first pregnancy
of the 36-year-old princess was worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard about it, I remembered the words of one of
my friends who once told that she found that Princess Masako seemed
so pitiful without a child,'' said Toshiko Muto, a woman in her 60s
who was waiting to enter a downtown kabuki theater. ``Anyway, we
can pray for her safe childbirth now.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Masahide Koshimuzu, 52, the owner of a real estate business,
said: ``I've heard the news, and it's good, because if the princess
got too old she wouldn't be able to have a baby. The imperial
family is part of Japan's tradition. But I've been worried about
the succession: without boys, who can assure the line?''
</P>
<P>
   The imperial claim to legitimacy stems from the myth of the
nation's founding 2,660 years ago by Jimmu, a descendant of the sun
goddess, Amaterasu. In reality, though, the role of the emperor
today was formed largely from the last century, and it often seems
as if it is still stuck in that time.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's contemporary royal couple _ Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko, the first commoner to marry into the royal family _ have
in their own quiet way done much to modernize the institution.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In ways that are scarcely being discussed in Japan's often meek
press, the drama surrounding the 39-year-old Prince Naruhito and
Princess Masako's efforts to conceive is stripping away much of the
remaining mystery that has traditionally shrouded royalty here, and
perhaps revolutionizing the role of women in the imperial lineage.
</P>
<P>
   The imperial family has been plagued with fertility problems,
and the prince and princess _ and the official handlers, who
usually leave little to chance _ seem to have decided that a touch
of the ultramodern was just what was called for in these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It has been widely reported here that a team of six top
reproduction experts was recently assigned to facilitate the
conception. And everyone here is already wondering whether
artificial insemination was used.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pressure to conceive has been publicly borne by the
Harvard- and Oxford-educated princess _ just the second commoner to
become crown princess _ even though several of the prince's uncles
and great-uncles were childless.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse under a system that requires a male for the
succession, the children of Prince Naruhito's brother, Akishino,
and of the imperial cousins who are also theoretically able to
furnish a successor to the throne, are all girls.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the second great modernization under way:
constitutional changes are said to be in the works to allow a woman
to assume the throne.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Household Agency initially opposed Prince
Naruhito's choice of a bride, seemingly fearing her as a dangerous
and completely modern precedent setter.
</P>
<P>
   When the prince courted Princess Masako, she was a career
diplomat who spoke French, Spanish and English. Questions were
asked about whether she would keep her eyes downcast in public and
walk five steps behind her husband, as custom demands, and whether
she would be happy abandoning the professional world in favor of a
life full of stiff receptions and obligatory appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But concern over the lack of a child forced the agency to send a
mission to Europe to study legal changes, in countries like Sweden,
that have allowed women to reign. And now it is widely assumed that
if a girl is born, there will be a change in the rules of
succession to allow any child of the couple to ascend the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a son is born, that is best, but even if there is a girl,
that is good news too,'' said Toshiaki Kawahara, the author of
several books about the imperial family. ``If there is a girl,
there is no doubt that in the future the government will change the
rules so that a woman can be an emperor. It is time for us to stop
making a distinction in terms of whether a man or woman can sit on
the throne.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With such a change, Princess Masako, herself once a reluctant
bride who was nearly spurned by the custodians of the palace, will
have quietly avenged modern women.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference shortly after the couple was married,
Prince Naruhito, asked how many children the couple planned to
have, answered that the stork would decide.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Masako, though, perhaps already sensing her power,
quickly declared, ``Please don't expect enough children to make an
orchestra.''

GLOBALIZATION APPLIES TO RELIGION, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Globalization: it's a curious contraption of a word, a noun
built on a verb, globalize, built on an adjective, global, built on
a noun, globe. By now, however, the word not only rolls around
rather easily in the mouth; it has also become irreplaceable for
discussing the kind of issues that brought demonstrators to the
streets in Seattle a week ago. It is also a notion applicable to
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament of the World's Religions, which drew thousands of
religious leaders to Cape Town between Dec. 1 and Dec. 8, was a
colorful reminder of religious globalization. The original such
Parliament was held in 1893 in Chicago, in connection with the
World's Columbian Exposition. A hundred years later it was
repeated, and now its Chicago-based organizers plan to make it a
perennial event.
</P>
<P>
   When the 6,000 participants were not hearing speakers like
Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama, they were enjoying something
like a global religious fair, rushing back and forth to hundreds of
workshops and discussions. As in Seattle, there were even a few
demonstrators, in this case denouncing the whole affair as satanic
and, of all unlikely things, ridden with Zionists. But like the
World Trade Organization's meeting, the Parliament was only one
manifestation of a process that is irreversibly under way.
</P>
<P>
   The world's great faiths have always interacted, of course. They
sent missionaries, they borrowed ideas, they adopted rituals. They
even absorbed and transformed deities. And they fought wars.
Sometimes they imitated one another, sometimes they defined
themselves in contrast to one another.
</P>
<P>
   But this usually happened when religions were neighbors
geographically, or when a religion expanded through migration or
conquest, or when one faith had emerged from another, or simply
when a few mobile and spiritually inquiring individuals had
cross-pollinated beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as economic globalization is of a completely different
order than traditional overseas commerce, today's religious
globalization barely resembles these earlier interactions among
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Today, world religions are truly world religions. Every major
faith is everywhere, represented by migrant populations or local
converts, its beliefs and sacred texts available to virtually any
curious seeker. Pope John Paul II, the Rev. Billy Graham and the
Dalai Lama are world figures with followings far beyond their own
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that marking the millennium has become a global
event is suggestive. Even the most secular celebration cannot
entirely erase the religious origins of a calendar that is now
implanted in the daily life of historically non-Christian cultures.
</P>
<P>
   But this free flow of religions, like free trade in cotton,
computers and currencies, has created its own issues and added new
twists to older ones. Many of the issues can be grouped under three
headings: turf, tolerance and truth. But in fact they are all
interrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Turf is the most ancient of these concerns, the one that endures
despite the fact _ and maybe because of the fact _ that barriers to
religious alternatives are increasingly harder to maintain. Russian
Orthodox leaders protest that Russia is their turf and everyone
else is a religious intruder. Roman Catholic leaders often sound
much the same way about Latin America. Hindus protest Christian
conversions; Islam does the same. Orthodox Judaism claims prior
rights in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are opinions within each group challenging this
religious equivalent of protectionism. There are vitally important
distinctions, moreover, among religious bodies and leaders
regarding the lengths to which they will go to protect their turf.
There is a growing international lobby against religious
persecution. There are advocates of an unrestricted religious
marketplace who argue that rigorous competition makes faith
stronger, not weaker. And there are also cautionary voices warning
that American standards, in this case of church-state separation,
cannot be universalized.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the question of turf is linked to the question of
tolerance. In principle, almost everyone favors tolerance. In
practice, it can be more difficult to uphold and, sometimes, even
to define.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the premises of the Parliament of the World's
Religions was that tolerance, if it is to be more than a prolonged
truce in religious warfare, requires real respect for one another's
traditions, reflected in a willingness to engage in dialogue and
cooperate in serving humanity and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises the issue of truth. To some people, genuine
respect and tolerance are incompatible with claims that ``I have
the truth and you don't.'' To others, the demand that ``I must
abandon my claims to the truth in the name of tolerance'' is the
very essence of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, religious globalization has already dramatically
modified the way claims of religious truth are commonly made.
Believers today are far less likely than before to deny all the
truth in other faiths. The question becomes not true versus false
religion, but which faith has the fuller truth, the more adequate
grasp on a dimension of reality that will always remain mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, still conflicts with the conviction that every
religion must be viewed as equally true, and that nothing less can
be the basis of genuine respect and tolerance. But to propose that
principle as the basis of religious globalization would probably
arouse more opposition and outrage than anything the World Trade
Organization ever dreamed of.

CLINTON HOPES TO GENERATE NEW INVESTMENT IN IMPOVERISHED AREA 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST MEMPHIS, Ark. _ President Clinton came home to Arkansas on
Friday to tout his efforts at boosting economic opportunities in
the nation's poorest regions, including this state's impoverished
delta area along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   But he also used his trip to raise money for the presidential
library he plans to build in Little Rock along the Arkansas River
and to ``take a walk back through memory lane,'' as he put it, of a
presidency rocked by scandal but still able to boast of
accomplishments on the domestic and foreign policy fronts.
</P>
<P>
   At appearances here, in nearby Earle and in the state capital of
Little Rock, Clinton announced a $110 million initiative he hopes
to get funded next year that would create a Delta Regional
Authority to help generate new investment in this struggling
agriculture area, which has failed to keep pace with the rest of
the country's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the nation's record prosperity, backed by the first
budget surpluses in 42 years, Clinton said there was no better time
to focus on lifting the country's economically depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't figure out something to do about this now, when in
the world will we ever get around to it?'' the president asked at
one point during a speech to the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce,
which pledged to give Clinton $1.25 million to help build his
library and policy center.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty initiative, if approved by Congress next year, would
help provide needed education, health care and economic development
assistance throughout the Mississippi delta region. Clinton hopes
that the federal incentives will spur additional financial
investment from the private sector. Clinton made a pitch for
immediate investment from the business world during a private
meeting here with 20 heads of big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to give people the same incentives to invest in poor
areas of America, like the Arkansas Delta, we give them to invest
in poor areas in Latin America, or Asia, or Africa,'' Clinton said,
adding that lifting people out of poverty would help ``minimize'' a
host of other social and cultural problems in the country's poorest
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the chamber of commerce, Clinton spent some
time touting his plans to build a sprawling library and policy
center on 26 acres near downtown Little Rock. Clinton hopes to
raise at least $125 million for the project, which will be
affiliated with the University of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   He said his library would not only house his presidential
materials, but would be home to a conflict resolution center that
would help bridge ``racial and other divides in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This library can be an energizing force in the life of the
city and the broader community. It will attract people from all
over the world,'' Clinton said, describing what he characterized as
an ``interactive'' museum rather than ``a mausoleum'' used to store
the presidential papers and memorabilia from his two-term
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While the library and his poverty initiative were at the center
of his trip to Arkansas, Clinton also used his appearances to
summarize the accomplishments of his nearly 7-year-old presidency
and to remind people that he still has 14 months to go in his
second term and still has ``lots to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to remember that a significant chunk of
the time that I have been given to serve is still out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hopes to spend next year working on Social
Security and Medicare reform, improving public education, and
continuing to promote peace and stability abroad. He also said his
top priority would be to keep the ``longest peacetime (economic)
expansion in our history'' going.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my lifetime ... there has never been another time, not one,
when our country had this level of economic prosperity, this level
of social progress, this level of national self-confidence, with
the absence of a crisis at home or a threat from abroad,'' Clinton
said in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay on the track we're on now ... this country will be
out of debt in 15 years for the first time since 1835,'' Clinton
said, adding that the country has a great opportunity ``on the edge
of the new millennium to really shape the future ... for our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   At each stop in the state where he served as governor for 12
years before winning the presidency in 1992, Clinton thanked the
crowds for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been for the experiences you gave me and the
lessons I learned, I wouldn't have been prepared to serve at this
moment in our history,'' Clinton said, adding that his life in
Arkansas helped him decide to run for president at a time ``of
economic distress, social decline and deep political division'' in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to remember what it was like just a few short
years ago,'' Clinton said during one stop. He added that his
``mission'' as president has been to provide ``opportunities for
every American'' and to challenge every citizen to be a
``responsible'' member of their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled through the politics, we battled through a whole
flurry of special interests, we battled through our fair share of
mistakes. But we never forgot who we were working for or what the
mission was,'' Clinton said. ``And I hope that all of you, without
whom I would never have become president, can take some pride in
the results.''

3-WAY TALKS COULD LEAD TO JAPAN'S 2ND LARGEST PHONE COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ KDD Corp., Japan's largest international telephone
service company, said Friday that it was in talks with its
faltering competitor, DDI Corp., and IDO Corp., a cellular phone
operator, over a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   The companies stressed that no deal was imminent and that their
discussions were most immediately concentrated on whether they
could jointly develop a new generation of mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of a merger of the three companies, which would
create Japan's second-largest telephone company after the Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., is likely to further intensify the
already frenetic realignment of the Japanese telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies may do nothing more than band together to
seek one of the three lucrative licenses the government plans to
award next year to allow telecommunications firms to sell cutting
edge cellular phone services like high-speed Internet access and
links to online video services. But even that would be significant.
Together, the three companies would present a more formidable force
than any one of them alone.
</P>
<P>
   A merged company would have revenue of 3 trillion yen, just 30
percent of the 10 trillion yen, or $97.18 billion, in revenue that
NTT is expected to produce this fiscal year on a consolidated
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each of the companies has its problems. For example, a
combined company would have debts of 1.9 trillion yen, or roughly
$18.4 billion at current exchange rates. KDD has had difficulty
finding an international partner, which many analysts regard as
essential, while its competitor Japan Telecom has quickly allied
itself with British Telecommunications, Vodaphone Airtouch and AT&AMP;
T.
</P>
<P>
   DDI alone is struggling with debts of 1.5 trillion yen, roughly
$14.6 billion at current exchange rates. IDO, in which Toyota has a
63 percent stake, is a relative bit player in Japan's mobile phone
market, which is dominated by NTT Mobile Communications Inc., an
affiliate of NTT.
</P>
<P>
   DDI could not even afford to think about developing new cellular
phone technology were it not for a promise from Toyota, which has
ample cash sitting on its books, to help the company raise money.

HUMMER IS THE ULTIMATE OFF-ROAD VEHICLE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arnold Schwartzenegger had four Hummers at last count, but at
$70,000 or more a pop, taking just one of these babies home would
be a challenge for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after just a few days this past week in our test vehicle,
the 2000 Hummer four-door soft-top, I was taking a serious look at
my resources to see whether, just maybe, I could swing one. My wife
wouldn't go for the second-mortgage-on-the-house idea, though, and
neither would she consider shifting the teen-ager's college fund to
a more practical purpose, such as a downpayment on a brand-new
Hummer, which costs almost as much as our house did.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well _ maybe later, after I win the lottery or something.
</P>
<P>
   For now, I'll just tell you about the experience and keep on
dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is the ultimate off-road vehicle, and except for its
extraordinary width, the Hummer is the best thing I've found yet to
take into the backcountry of America. The 72-inch-wide track is a
big limitation for some of my favorite off-road routes, such as the
Rubicon Trail in Northern California's Sierra Nevada mountains or
The Squeeze on the Pinyon Mountain Trail in Southern California's
Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of places it will go, and there's not much
terrain that can stop it _ mountains, desert or swamp.
</P>
<P>
   The width also makes the vehicle a bit of a challenge to drive
on narrow city streets, but most other drivers quickly move out of
the way when they see the Hummer coming. It's the perfect urban
assault vehicle for rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is a Hummer? For those of you who don't know _ and I
ran into a bunch of you during my week with the Hummer _ this is
the civilian version of the Humvee, the vehicle that began taking
the place of the jeep in the U.S. armed forces in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   AM General Corp., once a part of now-defunct American Motors,
traces its roots back to the original Army jeep of World War II. In
the early '80s, the company designed the Humvee _ that's short for
``high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle _ and won a contract
to make the vehicles for the U.S. military. There are about 155,000
of them in use worldwide, and they were stars of Operation Desert
Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian model owes its existence in part to
Schwartzenegger. While on location in Oregon shooting the movie
Kindergarten Cop, he saw a convoy of Army Humvees driving along
Interstate 5.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, he asked what they were, and began trying to find out
how he could get one. At that time, the vehicles were built only
for the military and were not sold to individual buyers. But with
Schwartzenegger's persuasion and the great publicity the vehicles
got during Desert Storm, AM General decided to develop a civilian
version. The first one, of course, was delivered to Arnold, in July
1992, and the macho man has been building his own fleet ever since.
</P>
<P>
   There are some unique features. The vehicle can be driven
through water up to 30 inches deep (60 inches for the military
versions), it was designed to be dropped by parachute and lifted by
helicopter (and even the civilian model has helicopter lift-hooks),
and it can go downhill at a 45-degree angle. It has 16 inches of
ground clearance _ double that of the average sport-utility vehicle
_ and it has a remarkable approach angle of up to 72 degrees and
departure angle of 37.5 degrees, great for dropping down a steep
hill into a flat creek, then climbing out the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer comes with Goodyear off-road tires that are 3 feet
tall and has a steel-box frame with five heavy-duty cross members
for rugged support. The bonded and riveted aluminum-alloy body is
built more like an aircraft fuselage than a truck. It can carry up
to 4,000 pounds of people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel independent suspension is outstanding for
off-road use, allowing each wheel to find its own spot on very
uneven terrain. On the road, the ride is at least as good as that
of most full-size pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Four civilian models are offered for 2000. They are the
four-door soft-top version we tested (base price $79,065 plus $790
transportation), two-door soft top ($68,362), four-door hard top
($82,042), and four-door wagon ($85,718).
</P>
<P>
   All Hummers for 2000 are powered by a General Motors 6.5-liter
turbodiesel engine rated at 195 horsepower and 430 foot-pounds of
torque. They come with full-time four-wheel drive, a heavy-duty
four-speed automatic transmission, a two-speed transfer case for
low-gear operation off-road, and a combination
traction-control/antilock braking system.
</P>
<P>
   They're not fast, but they're no slouches, either. Top speed is
about 85 mph, and it takes about 12 seconds to go from zero to 60
mph. But there is lots of low-speed power for hill-climbing and
towing, and the vehicle has plenty of power for highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has a lot of wasted room, thanks to the engine,
transmission and transfer case taking up a huge area right down the
middle of the passenger compartment. Our vehicle had four seats,
all on the outside corners, with a huge table-like area between the
seats. Off road, someone can sit in this area, although not very
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the interior size limitations, there are creature
comforts not found in the military version. Standard are
air-conditioning, inboard-mounted four-wheel disc brakes, power
steering, tinted glass, power windows and door locks with remote
locking/unlocking, and even cupholders and grab handles (for easier
entry and exit).
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the vehicle is a challenge for people in skirts;
it's a bit of a climb up. But the bucket seats are comfortable, and
they are fully adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   Our candy-apple red test model came with several extras that ran
the total sticker price up to $89,936, including transportation.
Included were the deluxe gray interior ($684), a special package
($8,381) with cruise control, central tire inflation system,
run-flat tires, power mirrors, trailer-towing equipment, a front
brush guard, and driveline protection underneath. The heated
windshield was $667, and an automatic-dimming rearview mirror
tacked on $349.
</P>
<P>
   The central tire inflation system allows the driver to inflate
or deflate all four tires, or just the front or rear tires, by
pushing buttons on the instrument panel. This is invaluable for
off-roading, where it is often necessary to lower tire pressures to
below 20 pounds to get through mud or sand.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy seems to be rather dismal, although the
manufacturer did not provide any ratings (as a big truck, no EPA
ratings are required). But I got the feeling that you could almost
calculate the fuel usage in gallons per mile than miles per gallon.
Well, not really, but mileage is probably less than 10 mpg. There
are two tanks, though _ a 25-gallon main and a 17-gallon reserve.
The driver can switch between them with the push of a button on the
instrument panel.

off-road capabilities, go to www.hummer.com on the Internet.

   CAPE CANAVERAL _ This was the week when things were meant to
start going right again for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Discovery was to depart Saturday on a mission
to fix the disabled Hubble Space Telescope. But Friday the
lozenge-shaped digital clock that counts down to liftoff in front
of the press viewing area was blank.
</P>
<P>
   Signs all around the Kennedy Space Center telling tourists when
to expect a launch said TBD _ to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is nothing huge. Engineers found a foot-long dent in
a fuel line that circulates hydrogen to the three engines.
Apparently somebody had stepped on it. But they should have it
mended quickly and officials are tentatively planning to blast the
orbiter into the heavens at 9:18 p.m. next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crew of seven will be a British-born astronaut,
Michael Foale.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is ideal. First, it means that the agency will have
people in space over Christmas for the first time since 1983. All
holiday time has been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, it brings the nine-day mission perilously close
to the last day of the year. There is no certainty that the
computer software on the Discovery shuttle can handle the potential
pitfalls of Y2K. It must be back home by Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure on NASA to perform a successful launch as soon
as possible is intense. And it has little to do with Hubble itself,
even though the telescope has been completely disabled for the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   There is such urgency because this has been the year when NASA
has fumbled almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Both politicians in Washington and the public are starting to
ask what is going on. Even President Bill Clinton felt compelled
during a press conference this week to offer NASA his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all use the slogan, `Well, it isn't rocket science.' Well,
this is rocket science,'' Clinton remarked. ``We have to keep doing
this if we ever hope to know what's beyond our galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's worst calamities have been in the Mars program. In
September, the Mars Climate Orbiter was incinerated when it dipped
into the Red Planet's atmosphere _ somebody forgot to convert
imperial measurements to metric.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, all contact was lost with the Mars Polar
Lander after it was supposed to touch down. It is now presumed dead
and nobody yet knows what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Russia's inability to continue funding its
contribution to the construction of the International Space Station
means that the project has been put on ice. Until Russia is able to
complete a crucial part of the orbiting complex, no further work on
it can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The picture with the shuttle program here on Cape Canaveral is
hardly better. There have only been two missions so far this year _
the slowest pace since the aftermath of the Challenger explosion in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the last flight in July _ the first to be
commanded by a woman _ almost ended in disaster when a short
circuit disabled two computers that control the shuttle's engines.
It was that near-miss that led to the slowdown in the launch
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring problem was deemed so severe that NASA responded by
grounding its entire fleet of four orbiters for wiring inspections,
which took several weeks. Thus, the Hubble mission that was
originally meant to launch in October, is still here on the ground.
The latest delay was the sixth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agency is naturally defensive about all the problems.
``Obviously everyone at the Space Center would like to see the
shuttles fly more often,'' Joel Wells, a NASA spokesman, agreed.
``But our primary concern must be that the shuttle is safe to fly
and if that means we have to sacrifice a little bit of the
frequency of flights then that is what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the pressure and all the delays are even getting to
some of the astronauts, including Foale, who completed a highly
perilous mission on the Russian Mir station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am paying more attention to the readiness of this flight
than I have on my previous flights,'' he admitted. ``If you get off
the curve, you get off your edge, you lose a little bit, and I
think we've been too long from flying.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA knows that its troubles may only really begin when Congress
reconvenes in Washington after the Christmas break. Already,
members have warned that hearings will be convened to assess
whether or not the agency is doing its job properly.
</P>
<P>
   For many representatives, the loss of the Polar Lander was the
last straw and evidence that taxpayers were wasting money on NASA.
</P>

   ``This week's failings of the Mars Polar Lander as well as
difficulties NASA has had with the International Space Station,
shuttle launches and the Chandra X-ray telescope, among others,
have made it clear that we need a total reassessment of NASA's
approach to interplanetary exploration,'' warned Representative
Bill Frist, who heads a subcommittee that oversees the agency. &QL;

   The man in the hot seat will be Daniel Goldin, who is in charge
of NASA. Because of pressure to cut costs from Congress, he has
pushed through a new ``cheaper, better, faster'' policy at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under Goldin's leadership, the agency has switched from
concentrating on a few grand _ and grandly expensive _ mission
programs to juggling a great number of less expensive ventures,
like the Mars landers. And it has all been done on what some
believe is a shoestring.

   ``There is still this misunderstanding in some circles that NASA
is getting all this money,'' Wells insisted. ``When in fact our
piece of the pie could not even stand up on its own _ we get less

<P>
   Some contend that it is precisely the tightening of the federal
purse that has caused an overstretched NASA to commit avoidable
errors, including here at Canaveral.

   ``The thing is, the shuttle work force has been reduced. They
are sorely tried to do all they're supposed to do with the staff

   Astronaut Michael Foale, like everybody else, knows how
important getting Discovery off the pad and into space has suddenly
become. ``I think after this flight, NASA will breathe a collective

HOLLYWOOD AND WASHINGTON MIX ON NEW YEAR'S EVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hollywood star power will meet Washington political
power on New Year's Eve as some of the world's biggest celebrities
join President and Mrs. Clinton for a glitzy, patriotic celebration
to usher in the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create something worthy of the ringing in the Year
2000 in the nation's capital,'' said Toby Graf, a spokeswoman for
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose office is spearheading the
planning for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady will open a three-day festival entitled
``America's Millennium,'' at 11 a.m. eastern time on Friday, Dec.
31, with the unveiling of a time capsule, which will be stored at
the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a different kind of time capsule in that
we're trying to find things that define the whole 20th century as
well as what life is like right now,'' said Graf. But she declined
to reveal what will be in the capsule.
</P>
<P>
   While the three days will include parades, dozens of parties and
an array of exhibitions highlighting American history, the focus of
the celebration will be on CBS's nationally televised New Year's
Eve show at the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Actor and rapper Will Smith will host a three-hour show, which
starts at 10 p.m. eastern time. Joining Smith will be fellow actors
Robert Duvall, Sam Waterson and Diane Keaton, opera stars Jessye
Norman and Kathleen Battle, along with gospel singer Bebe Winans,
country singer Trisha Yearwood and 25 New York cast members of the
musical hit ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCarthy, executive director of America's Millennium, the
organization coordinating the celebration for the White House,
promised that other celebrities would be at the event but would not
identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the program, entitled ``America's Millennium
Gala,'' will offer more than just ``another celebrity special.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the show, created by musician Quincy Jones and
producer-director George Stevens Jr., will offer a ``thoughtful
melange'' of 20th century America. ``The show is meant to be moving
rather than just another musical show,'' he said, adding that the
Lincoln Memorial was chosen because it has been the site of many
key moments in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady will begin celebrating around 7
p.m. with a black-tie ``Creators Dinner'' at the White House to
honor some of the country's most prominent figures in sports, arts
and sciences. Playwrights Edward Albee, August Wilson, Arthur
Miller and Neil Simon will be among the attendees, as well as
musicians Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zuckerman and Marilyn Horne.
Others include dancers Edward Villella and Arthur Mitchell; artist
Robert Rauschenberg; architect Maya Lin; Olympian runner Carl Lewis
and Internet pionier Vinton Cerf.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:30 p.m., a motorcade of limousines accompanied by dozens
of Secret Service vehicles and Washington, D.C. police cars will
take the Clintons and their guests to the Lincoln Memorial, where
they will join a Mall crowd that _ depending on the weather _ is
expected to reach 250,000 people. Last year's temperatures on Dec.
31 ranged from 19 to 28 degrees. Normal temperatures for the day
range from 18 to 36.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:30 p.m., as the so-called ``Midnight Moment''
approaches, a 100-piece orchestra, along with the combined bands,
choirs and marching units of the U.S. Armed Forces, will premiere a
score by award-winning composer John Williams. The music will
accompany an 18-minute movie on America in the 20th century by
academy award-winning director Steven Spielberg that will play on
giant screens on three sides of the Reflecting Pool in front of the
Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Then U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky and his predecessors Rita
Dove and Maya Angelou will read from their new works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be able to see and hear what this country is
about and what makes it so special,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, organizers say, the Mall will explode into a
spectacular sound-light-and-fireworks show between the Lincoln
Memorial and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The show will end with a group of American children _ joined by
the stars of the gala and choruses _ asking the crowd to join in a
sing-along of traditional American songs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials are expecting that during the day Dec. 31
as many as 750,000 people will use the city's public transit
system, more than twice as many as last Dec. 31 and easily more
than record crowd of 541,000 on last July 4.
</P>
<P>
   City spokesman Ray Feldmann said bus and train service will be
provided throughout the day. Usually on New Year's Eve, the city
runs trains until 2 a.m. and buses until 3 a.m., but this year, the
city will keep both going an extra hour.
</P>
<P>
   According to Graf, the Clintons plan to leave the Lincoln
Memorial before the ``Midnight Moment'' show ends at 1 a.m. ``The
president and the first lady are still deciding how to spend the
rest of the evening,'' she said. ``They may just decide to go home
and spend some time alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether this New Year's celebration will be the largest
under President Clinton, Graf hedged, saying: ``Well, the
millennium doesn't actually start until 2001, and next year's New
Year's Eve will be the last one under the administration. So we'll
see.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL _ This was the week when things were meant to
start going right again for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Discovery was to depart Saturday on a mission
to fix the disabled Hubble Space Telescope. But Friday the
lozenge-shaped digital clock that counts down to liftoff in front
of the press viewing area was blank.
</P>
<P>
   Signs all around the Kennedy Space Center telling tourists when
to expect a launch said TBD _ to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is nothing huge. Engineers found a foot-long dent in
a fuel line that circulates hydrogen to the three engines.
Apparently somebody had stepped on it. But they should have it
mended quickly and officials are tentatively planning to blast the
orbiter into the heavens at 9:18 p.m. next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crew of seven will be a British-born astronaut,
Michael Foale.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is ideal. First, it means that the agency will have
people in space over Christmas for the first time since 1983. All
holiday time has been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, it brings the nine-day mission perilously close
to the last day of the year. There is no certainty that the
computer software on the Discovery shuttle can handle the potential
pitfalls of Y2K. It must be back home by Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure on NASA to perform a successful launch as soon
as possible is intense. And it has little to do with Hubble itself,
even though the telescope has been completely disabled for the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   There is such urgency because this has been the year when NASA
has fumbled almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Both politicians in Washington and the public are starting to
ask what is going on. Even President Bill Clinton felt compelled
during a press conference this week to offer NASA his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all use the slogan, `Well, it isn't rocket science.' Well,
this is rocket science,'' Clinton remarked. ``We have to keep doing
this if we ever hope to know what's beyond our galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's worst calamities have been in the Mars program. In
September, the Mars Climate Orbiter was incinerated when it dipped
into the Red Planet's atmosphere _ somebody forgot to convert
imperial measurements to metric.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, all contact was lost with the Mars Polar
Lander after it was supposed to touch down. It is now presumed dead
and nobody yet knows what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Russia's inability to continue funding its
contribution to the construction of the International Space Station
means that the project has been put on ice. Until Russia is able to
complete a crucial part of the orbiting complex, no further work on
it can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The picture with the shuttle program here on Cape Canaveral is
hardly better. There have only been two missions so far this year _
the slowest pace since the aftermath of the Challenger explosion in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the last flight in July _ the first to be
commanded by a woman _ almost ended in disaster when a short
circuit disabled two computers that control the shuttle's engines.
It was that near-miss that led to the slowdown in the launch
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring problem was deemed so severe that NASA responded by
grounding its entire fleet of four orbiters for wiring inspections,
which took several weeks. Thus, the Hubble mission that was
originally meant to launch in October, is still here on the ground.
The latest delay was the sixth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The agency is naturally defensive about all the problems.
``Obviously everyone at the Space Center would like to see the
shuttles fly more often,'' Joel Wells, a NASA spokesman, agreed.
``But our primary concern must be that the shuttle is safe to fly
and if that means we have to sacrifice a little bit of the
frequency of flights then that is what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the pressure and all the delays are even getting to
some of the astronauts, including Foale, who completed a highly
perilous mission on the Russian Mir station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am paying more attention to the readiness of this flight
than I have on my previous flights,'' he admitted. ``If you get off
the curve, you get off your edge, you lose a little bit, and I
think we've been too long from flying.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NASA knows that its troubles may only really begin when Congress
reconvenes in Washington after the Christmas break. Already,
members have warned that hearings will be convened to assess
whether or not the agency is doing its job properly.
</P>
<P>
   For many representatives, the loss of the Polar Lander was the
last straw and evidence that taxpayers were wasting money on NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week's failings of the Mars Polar Lander as well as
difficulties NASA has had with the International Space Station,
shuttle launches and the Chandra X-ray telescope, among others,
have made it clear that we need a total reassessment of NASA's
approach to interplanetary exploration,'' warned Representative
Bill Frist, who heads a subcommittee that oversees the agency. &QL;

of NASA. Because of pressure to cut costs from Congress, he has

</P>
<P>
   Under Goldin's leadership, the agency has switched from
concentrating on a few grand _ and grandly expensive _ mission
programs to juggling a great number of less expensive ventures,
like the Mars landers. And it has all been done on what some
believe is a shoestring.

   Money Managers Aside, She Wanted to Be Alone &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1959 and a young Brown Brothers Harriman employee
named Richard H. Jenrette was managing Greta Garbo's money when he
learned some valuable lessons about Wall Street. At a dinner last
week to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, Jenrette told a few tales to show how much Wall
Street had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he said, it was Ms. Garbo who gave him the idea, then
novel, of providing his clients with more than one money manager.
``Back in those days, for some ridiculous reason, all clients had
only one person manage their money,'' Jenrette said. But, he
explained, Ms. Garbo broke with that practice, hiring three firms _
J.P. Morgan, Bank of New York and Brown Brothers _ and playing one
against another.
</P>
<P>
   When Jenrette founded DLJ, he remembered her approach: ``The
great Garbo was one of the earliest to see the merits of pitting
one money manager against the other. She may have invented the
concept of competitive money managers.''
</P>
<P>
   How different were those times, when Wall Street worked for
fixed 40-cent-a-share commissions. While still at Brown Brothers,
Jenrette recalled, he wrote a letter to a client saying he was
pleased to show that he had outperformed the Dow Jones industrial
average for that quarter. But before the letter was sent, it came
back from Jenrette's boss, with a big black mark through it and the
words: ``Never comment on investment performance. Once you start,
what do you talk about when you underperform?''

   Five years ago, when Larry Augustin was a graduate student at
Stanford, his friends David Filo and Jerry Yang came up with a
directory to the World Wide Web they ultimately called Yahoo. At
one point, the three, all computer science students, talked about
writing a joint business plan. But Augustin bowed out, going on to
earn his doctorate there in electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Last week, Augustin joined the ranks of Internet
billionaires himself when his company, VA Linux Systems, went
public. At VA Linux's closing price of $218 on Friday, Augustin's
16 percent stake was worth $1.44 billion. Before founding VA Linux,
which sells servers that run the Linux operating system, Augustin,
now 37, was a consultant for Fintronic USA, a provider of software
used for designing chips, and a research associate at Stanford.

<P>
   Being worth more than $5 billion, as Charles Schwab is, means
never whistling off-key.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab appears in a television commercial for his brokerage
firm's new high-speed trading system. The rock anthem ``Born to be
Wild'' blares as Schwab trades behind closed doors. Then he strolls
out of his office, whistling this Steppenwolf tune.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwab acknowledged last week _ in an interview to promote
WebShops, his firm's program of seminars that teach on-line
investing _ that his effort had to be electronically tuned and
enhanced for the soundtrack. Though he put his lips together and
blew, he explained, ``it just wasn't loud enough.'' &QL;

   If car company publicists ever get together for team bowling,
there will be fierce competition to pick Gerry Spahn. Otherwise,
they would want Spahn, Nissan's spokesman on the East Coast, to
keep his distance.
</P>
<P>
   When Popular Science recently honored recipients of its Best of
What's New awards, from the December issue, at a luncheon at Tavern
on the Green in Manhattan, General Motors set up a display of
innovations including what the magazine had called ``dentproof''
urethane truck fenders.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, GM rigged up a pendulum consisting of a bowling
ball, on a steel cable, that could be slammed into the futuristic
fender of a prototype Chevy truck.
</P>
<P>
   When Spahn took his turn with the bowling ball, ``he picked the
thing up over his head and dropped it,'' said Dan McCosh, the
magazine's automotive editor. Buckled by the impact, the fender was
slashed by the abrasive cable and shattered, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM officials were not amused, even after Spahn suggested turning
the pickup around to give others a crack at the remaining dentproof
fender. Having left his mark in New York, Spahn is being promoted
to a corporate public relations post in Japan. &QL;

 &HT;    Navy bombs hurt reef, scientist says
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Craters in a coral reef off a Puerto Rican island,
which has a U.S. bombing range on its eastern end, were not made by
hurricanes, as the U.S. government claims, but by bombs dropped by
American forces, a University of Georgia scientist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs _ along with two sunken ships, possibly naval vessels,
and corroding barrels leaking potentially toxic substances _ were
found by a team of investigators hired by the Puerto Rican
government last July, as it was negotiating the future of the
island with the U.S. Navy. While the Navy owns two-thirds of
Vieques, some 9,000 Puerto Ricans live on the other third, and
their government wants the 58 years of naval bombardment on the
target range to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators include University of Georgia coral reef
expert James Porter, ordnance removal specialist James Barton and
explosives expert Fred Hoverkamp. They were hired in July by the
Atlanta law firm King &AMP; Spalding, which is advising the Puerto
Rican government in its talks with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, a Marine pilot dropped an errant bomb on a
civilian employee at the Vieques range, killing him. Months of
talks between Puerto Rican and U.S. government officials have
followed, as have protests in Puerto Rico on behalf of Vieques'
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials proposed reserving the right to use the site
for 90 days a year, letting pilots drop concrete-filled, inert
bombs _ not live ones _ to practice their bombing techniques. The
Puerto Rican government has rejected that compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things this discovery does is to call into question
the use of even inert munitions,'' Porter said. ``A bomb might
leave the wing of an aircraft `green,' but if it destroyed the
integrity of these barrels, it could cause environmental harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The team found heavy concentrations of metallic shrapnel in
symmetrical holes, each 12 feet across, confirming that the
indentions were made by bombs, not hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative team also has taken samples of the leaking
material from the corroding barrels to determine if they were
toxic. Some appear to contain solid substances, while others hold
liquids.
</P>
<P>
   The team found the two wrecked vessels, both of which contain
numerous barrels, during an exploratory session Nov. 26. A
100-foot-long ship has between 150 and 200 barrels, while near the
broken barge are about 1,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Unexploded ordnance can also be found at both sites.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative team has taken samples of the leaking material
from the corroding barrels to determine if they were toxic. Some
appear to contain solid substances, while others hold liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's in the barrels, but until we do, they
shouldn't be disturbed by either live or inert bombs,'' Porter
said. ``There's been a debate on who does what, but the best course
of action would be for all parties to work together to clean up
that underwater dump site and the remaining underwater ordnance.''

`CARPETBAGGER' ISSUE STALKS MRS. CLINTON IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two questions stood out as Hillary Rodham Clinton
campaigned across Manhattan this week. First, will she ever be
accepted as a New Yorker? Second, does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   It is a more prominent issue than Clinton, who has never worked
or lived here, would like it to be. And it raised its head again
this week in a subtle but still damaging way.
</P>
<P>
   She was appearing Thursday morning at a midtown restaurant
called O'Neill's to accept the endorsement of leading
Irish-American Democrats, all of them grateful for her and
President Clinton's role in the Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked if she would march in the S. Patrick's Day
Parade, d the First Lady replied, with an eager grin, ``I would
certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, most Democrats do not march in that parade because
its organizers prohibit Irish gay-and-lesbian groups from taking
part.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is hardly insensitive to gay causes. Just a few
minutes earlier, she had criticized her husband's ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy for gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The goof was that she appeared not to know the parade was an
issue. It may seem a small flub, but a telling one, in a city where
one-fifth of the residents are Irish, a fair percentage are gay,
and the parade is a prominent issue for both groups.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Maguire, head of the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organiation,
lashed out. ``The idea that Hillary would march, or even that she
doesn't know the issue, is outrageous.'' She added Friday, more
coldly, ``Clinton needs to make her stand now. She either supports
lesbian and gay men in New York, or she actively supports the
bigots who tell us we can't be Irish and gay at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with a small misstep, the First Lady winds up on the verge
of alienating two groups that she has never remotely offended.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the incident serves to reinforce the widespread
perception that she does not know her way around the land mines of
New York politics. The perception first took hold with flaps
involving two other major ethnic groups _ her opposition to amnesty
for Puerto Rican terrorists and her ``kiss of death'' with the wife
of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during a Middle East visit.
</P>
<P>
   At moments like these, linton has come off like an
out-of-towner, not a term of endearment here. And the few times
when she has tried to go native _ putting on a Yankees cap, letting
it be known that her great-grandma married a nice Jewish fella _
she has come off as pandering.
</P>
<P>
   The pertinent question, though, is: Does this matter? Judging
from statements made this week, part of her campaign strategy
appears to be convincing New Yorkers that it does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political issues should be what campaigns are fought out
over,'' she said at O'Neill's.
</P>
<P>
   At another event this week, on a Wall Street trading floor, she
said, ``I'll ask people to support me on the basis of where I stand
on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   If this strategy succeeds, she may very well win the election.
All the polls indicate a very close race. She trails her likely
Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, but only by a few
percentage points, usually within the statistical margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Her flag of hope in these polls is that they show that she is
viewed much more favorably than Giuliani on issues she has long
cared about _ education, health care, and social welfare. However,
Giuliani comes out ahead when the questions shift to competence,
experience, and knowledge of what makes New York tick. The mayor,
once his campaign gets going, can be expected o emphasize those
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters often talk as if local savvy is an
irrelevant issue. At a Women-for-Hillary fund-raising breakfast
this week, Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat,
said, ``We New Yorkers know the only question is who can serve our
interests best, not whee you're from.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, in every poll, roughly half of New Yorkers,
including many Democrats, ae concerned about where a candidate is
from. It is because the concern is so widespread that even a small
misstep can cast so huge a shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's supporters have tried to maneuver around the
``carpetbagger'' issue by placing her in a tradition of senators
from New York _ Robert Kennedy, Jacob Javits, and the retiring
senator she hopes to replace, Daniel Patrick Moynihan _ who have
brought national and international stature to the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fills that bill, but the program may have changed. ``Al
D'Amato changed the rules,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic
consultant. ``He showed that a senator has to bring home the bacon,
too, that it's not just the job of a congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schumer, who beat D'Amato in the last election, has paid
no less attention than D'Amato to local concerns. ``That's what
Hillary has to do, too,'' another Democrat said. ``She has to show
she knows the ropes.''

 &HT;    Ga. teacher bilked students, gets 30 years
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former high school teacher Vanessa Velez-Cruz was a
hit with her students until she stranded a group in Europe last
summer by bouncing checks to the travel agency that booked their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   When authorities investigated, they learned that Velez-Cruz, 48,
was a one-woman criminal organization who had stolen more than
$200,000 from students and others.
</P>
<P>
   Velez-Cruz pleaded guilty Friday to multiple counts of theft,
bank fraud, forgery, income-tax evasion and racketeering, said
Danny Craig, district attorney for the Augusta Judicial Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Carl Brown sentenced her to 30 years in
prison and ordered her to make restitution of $227,774, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Pete Theodocian, declined to speculate about how
much time she would serve but said she could appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed for her that she got that length of
sentence,'' Theodocian said. ``She's done a lot of good in her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Velez-Cruz, a native of Puerto Rico, collected about $80,000
this year to take a group of students in her Spanish class at St.
Thomas Aquinas High School in Augusta, Ga., to Europe. Instead, she
diverted the money to her own account. Shortly before the trip, she
paid for airplane tickets with checks that bounced after the group
arrived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Even after frantic parents called her in Paris, Velez-Cruz
continued bilking her students, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She collected money from them for a play and overcharged them
by $900,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Velez-Cruz had been stealing for years. She arranged
other foreign trips for students that failed to include promised
stops or were canceled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Velez-Cruz also solicited donations to transport the bodies of
three murder victims back to Mexico about a year ago, but kept the
money.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 of Velez-Cruz's victims attended the sentencing,
including Cay Hickey, whose 15-year-old daughter and three nieces
went on the June trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey said students at the private Roman Catholic school ``just
loved'' Velez-Cruz, in part because she allowed them to drink
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out later our children had been dancing on the tables
and drinking at Hard Rock Cafes,'' Hickey said.

BRADLEY CAMAPAIGN APOLOGIZES FOR `LIAR' LEAFLET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: This is a longer version of the story that moved
Thursday.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be like this.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, said he wanted
to run a clean campaign of ideas, not dirty tricks. Vice President
Al Gore said he, too, wanted to campaign above the fray, sticking
to the issues.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bradley leaflets handed out this week at drugstores
throughout New Hampshire accused Gore of ``uncontrollable lying,''
the vice president said he was surprised by the personal invective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was proposing a different kind of campaign, but
this doesn't even meet the minimal standards of civility,'' Gore
said in a telephone interview from Iowa Friday. And he said
Bradley's reaction to criticism about his health care plan shows
``a mighty thin skin.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the Bradley campaign had backed away from
what was supposed to have been an all-in-good-fun campaign stunt _
handing out mock perscriptions for ``Gore-itis'' _ and issued a
stern apology that reflected the tensions within the organization
over how to respond to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flier is not characteristic of Bill Bradley, nor the
style in which he has run this campaign,'' said Doug Berman,
Bradley's chairman. ``I am confident it will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Longabaugh, the New Hampshire director for Bradley,
said, ``these were intended to be a tongue-in-cheek response'' to
the Gore campaign, which had senior citizens pass out literature
about the vice president's perscription drug proposals at drug
stores in 11 towns throughout the state Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the characterizations contained in this flier
went further than they should have,'' Longabaugh's statement said.
``For that, I would like to issue a formal apology to the vice
president on behalf of myself and the Bill Bradley for president
campaign in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Longabaugh took the blame for the attack on Gore,
campaign officials in New Jersey refused to say whether they had
signed off on the mock perscription idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has fumed angrily for weeks while Gore
pounded them daily on their proposal to provide near-universal
health insurance. Gore has argued that the plan would use up the
budget surplus, setting aside no funds to shore up Medicare, the
federal health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that it would destroy Medicaid, the federal health
insurance program for the poor and disabled. Bradley's proposed
subsidies for private insurance are grossly inadequate, Gore has
said, placing African-Americans, Latinos, the disabled, people with
the AIDS virus, and nursing home patients all at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign says Gore is not telling the truth. In
towns throughout New Hampshire Thursday, Bradley campaign workers
passed out mock perscription forms citing the disease
``Gore-itis.'' The symptoms, it said, include ``uncontrollable
lying.'' The leaflet perscribed a lifetime supply of truth serum
and said Gore should take a healthy dose ``especially when talking
about the Bill Bradley health plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said in the interview that the real problem is that
Bradley accepted a ``deeply flawed'' health plan that would benefit
private insurance companies. Instead of being willing to debate the
specifics, Gore said Bradley is lashing out when criticized. (The
pair is scheduled meet Friday (Dec. 17) at Daniel Webster College
in Nashua for their first forum since an October town hall meeting
in Hanover.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of thought that after the trouble Bob Dole got into in
New Hampshire in '88, that it would be the next millenium, not this
one, before a candidate in New Hampshire said once again, `He's
lying about my record,' '' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he sees nothing wrong in comparing and contrasting his
plans for the future to Bradley's plans _ without resorting to
name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that's what campaigns are supposed to be all
about,'' said Gore. ``You propose solutions for the problems that
need to be solved, propose new directions for our country and then
be willing to answer questions about what you're proposing and have
them compared to the proposals of other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the traditional way of campaigning when democracy works
the way it's supposed to,'' he said. ``The idea you can put out
some sort of general platitude and then in response to questions
about what it means and how it would work just fly off the handle
and launch a personal attack, that shows a mighty thin skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he stands by his contention that
African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities and women are
more likely to suffer under Bradley's health proposal than other
groups because they are more likely to be in low-income brackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an undeniable fact that they are disproportionately
dependent upon the Medicaid program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People under Medicaid would be much worse off, not just
because Medicaid would be eliminated under his plan, but because of
the inadequacy of what he proposes to substitute for Medicaid,''
said Gore. ``If we can replace it with something better, that's
fine. But vouchers capped at $150 a month don't even come close to
being what's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a plan to insure all children by 2005,
targeting families with incomes of up to 250 percent of poverty, or
$41,000 for a family of four. His plan would allow both the
children and their parents to participate in an existing
federal-state Children's Health Insurance Program called CHIP. Gore
would also allow Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 to buy
into Medicare, and he would provide two tax credits for small
businesses that buy health insurance and for individuals who buy
health insurance.

RICK DANKO, 56; ROCK HALL OF FAMER WITH MANY INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Danko, the affable but often troubled Rock and Roll Hall of
Famer who sang and played bass with the Band and had many other
side projects, died Friday in his home in Woodstock, N.Y. He was
56.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko reportedly died in his sleep, according to Ike
Phillips, a friend and general manager of Woodstock radio station
WDST-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko's deeply soulful voice keyed such Band classics as
``Up on Cripple Creek,'' ``The Weight,'' ``The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down,'' ``Stage Fright,'' and ``Unfaithful Servant.''
</P>
<P>
   The pink house that Mr. Danko rented near Woodstock in the late
'60s was where the Band recorded its debut record, ``Music From Big
Pink,'' which catapulted the group to fame and is considered one of
the great rock albums.
</P>
<P>
   The Band, which backed Bob Dylan on his breakthrough electric
tour in 1965, played the original Woodstock Festival in 1969 and,
along with the Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers, appeared at the
Watkins Glen Festival in 1973. That fest, with a half-million
spectators, actually drew a larger crowd than came to Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his soulful vocals and steady bass lines, Mr. Danko
played fiddle, which gave an old-timey feel to some Band songs.
That quality helped earn the group its status as leaders of the
Americana roots movement, though four members (including Mr. Danko)
were born in Canada, where they first backed rockabilly singer
Ronnie Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko, who was born in Simcoe, Ontario, left school at age
14 to pursue music. He later battled an alcohol problem, which he
discussed in interviews, and two years ago was found guilty of
smuggling heroin into Japan. He was given a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mr. Danko was known by many as an eternal optimist. He
defined himself that way and, after the suicide of Band member
Richard Manuel in 1986, Mr. Danko even rationalized in a Globe
interview that Manuel ``was just checking a new, sophisticated
knot. That may sound weird, but that's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko, however, took the death of his close friend Manuel
hard. And he suffered the next year when friend and occasional
touring partner Paul Butterfield died. Still, Mr. Danko did not
harbor bitterness. Although the Band never reunited with guitarist
Robbie Robertson, Mr. Danko sang backup on Robertson's self-titled
debut album in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Robertson's absence, the Band re-formed (with Mr. Danko,
Levon Helm, and Garth Hudson) for a number of tours through the
years, playing the Newport Folk Festival and hosting New Year's Eve
at the Paradise in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko toured relentlessly and was a frequent visitor to
Boston with his own groups. He played the Channel, Jonathan
Swift's, Nightstage, the Middle East, and Ed Burke's, imparting
honky-tonk blues and good times.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko found the most peace at his Woodstock home deep in the
woods, by a pond that he stocked with trout. And he always took
pride in how the Band's music influenced the next wave of artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really thankful the way our music has been passed down
from father to son, and generation to generation,'' he once told
the Globe. ``I've been influenced, and I have influenced. It's good
to be on both sides of the light.''

DR. W. FRENCH ANDERSON: THE LONG VIEW ON GENE THERAPY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Pa.)  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been nine years since Dr. W. French Anderson performed
the first gene therapy experiment, on a 4-year-old girl with an
immune system disorder. In those days, the idea that diseases could
be treated, or even cured, by infusing patients with healthy DNA
was the bright light of medicine, offering hope to patients and the
promise of profits to investors. But the light has dimmed
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   In September, an 18-year-old Arizona man, Jesse Gelsinger, died
in an experiment at the University of Pennsylvania after receiving
a dose of corrective genes encased in adenovirus, a weakened cold
virus. His was the first death directly attributed to gene therapy.
Then came word that other scientists had failed to report safety
data to a National Institutes of Health oversight committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee met last week to review Gelsinger's death and the
safety of adenovirus, and to debate a proposal opposed by the
biotechnology industry that would force researchers to disclose all
patient deaths, whether or not related to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the headlines have been gloomy. Avigen, a
biotechnology company in Alameda, Calif., has reported good results
using gene therapy to treat a form of hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dr. Anderson, director of the gene therapy program at
the University of Southern California and the founder of a
pioneering gene therapy company now owned by Novartis, discussed
these developments and the prospects for commercial gene therapy.
Here are excerpts from the conversation.  &QL; 
Q. What impact has the death at Penn had on interest in gene
therapy? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think it has affected it much. The whole field of
biotech has had a bit of hard times, but gene therapy particularly,
because the fact is there haven't been any products. We are
probably still a minimum of three years away from anybody having a
product out there. This definitely throws some cold water on
investment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are marketable products taking so long to emerge? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The human body has much better defenses against manipulating
its DNA than we thought it had. We can do miracles in a tissue
culture dish. You can cure cancer in mice with gene therapy. But
then you go to the human body, and we face three major problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first is, how do you get a gene into enough cells to make a
difference? The second is the body's defense mechanisms, which
basically shut down the genes once they get there. And then the
third is figuring out how to get genes into cells at the right
place, at the right time, making the right amount of product to
treat a given disease.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In 1995, you sold Genetic Therapy, the company you founded,
to Sandoz, now part of Novartis. Now there are reports that
Novartis is scaling back, and has abandoned its largest study, for
treatment of glioblastoma, a brain cancer. What happened? &QL; 
A. We still don't have a product.
</P>
<P>
   The glioblastoma data hasn't been made public yet, but it's so
widespread on the grapevine that it isn't confidential anymore. The
survival curve between those who received the gene therapy and
those who did not was basically no different. Even though
individual patients were helped, and there are patients alive now
who would have been dead, it was not a product that a major
pharmaceutical company would want to go forward with. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In retrospect, did Novartis pay too much for your company?  &QL; 
A. I think the jury is still out. The total investment was around
$315 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the time they bought it, I got annoyed by some people at
Sandoz. They told us that the things we thought were so exciting
would probably not work right away. So, Sandoz, they had their
heads on right _ they bought it as a long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if it takes another 10 years before gene therapy comes up
with a major product, then they will have paid too much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Look into your crystal ball. Is the business outlook for gene
therapy still exciting? &QL; 
A. All around the world, there is progress being made. The first
indications that we might be tipping over the hump are in
cardiovascular disease, cancer, AIDS and hemophilia. We are seeing
signs that there are potential products, real products.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two or three years, if we don't hit another brick
wall, and several of these products get into Phase 3 trials and
things look encouraging, the business outlook for gene therapy will
brighten again and money will flow back into the field.

 &HT;    Lockheed to start work on F-22 jets
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After surviving a near-death experience in
Congress, Lockheed Martin Corp. has won approval from the Defense
Department to start building its controversial F-22 jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The green light comes just one day after a Pentagon review of
the F-22 program determined that the Stealth fighter is the ``most
capable option'' for meeting the Air Force's air superiority needs.
</P>
<P>
   This decision clears the way for Lockheed Martin to receive $1
billion in research and development funds to build six test
aircraft and to purchase raw materials for 10 additional planes.
</P>
<P>
   That spells good news for Lockheed Martin's Marietta, Ga.,
plant, where the aircraft will be assembled. It has been a tough
year for the nation's largest military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   First, the F-22 came under stiff opposition during the
congressional budget process. The House, led by Rep. Jerry Lewis
(R.-Calif.), chairman of the appropriations panel overseeing
military spending, voted to eliminate funds to build the aircraft
until more testing could be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the funding was mostly restored. But a few weeks
later, news broke that Lockheed was considering selling off or
consolidating some of its military aircraft business, including the
Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's decision to move forward is a positive sign for
the plant's future, said members of the Georgia congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked very hard to see this important funding appropriated
this year,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.). ``Today's
announcement is good news for Georgia and for the future of
Lockheed's Marietta facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased,'' Cleland said. ``I think this augurs well for
the plane and it is a positive straw in the wind for Marietta.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the funding, Lockheed laid out a number of goals
for the program for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rearden, Lockheed Martin's vice president and general
manager for the F-22 program, said that the top goal would be to
get four airplanes flying out of the Marietta factory in the coming
year. Those planes were approved by Congress in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rearden also said the contractor would send the planes through a
battery of avionics software testing and ground testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wants to buy 339 fighter jets over the course of
the next decade, so it was more than pleased that work on the
planes would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Col. Eric Garvin said the F-22 is superior to
other fighters such as the F-15 because it has the ability to
detect the enemy far in advance of the enemy spotting the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``As threat continues to evolve, F-15s won't work as well as the
F-22,'' Garvin said. ``If we don't do anything, we will put our
sons and daughters in harm's way. And once you lose air dominance,
you lose American lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Lockheed will be to secure funding for the
F-22 in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's scrutiny, the Georgia delegation plans to
mount a strong lobbying effort to avoid budget attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who represents the congressional district
where the Lockheed plant is located, said that the company should
be rewarded for meeting cost and performance mandates set forth by
the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite an undeserved attack by some in Congress on the
program, the men and women who make the F-22 are clearly doing a
great job and keeping their eyes on the ball,'' Barr said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Things looked promising at the Reebok store on
Manhattan's Upper West Side last Saturday. Dozens of screaming
teenagers stood outside waiting to get in. Inside, younger children
scrambled amid the milling adults as music pulsed and members of
the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   All the hoopla surrounded the introduction of Traxtar, a
children's shoe with a computer chip to help measure athletic
performance. But most of the screaming adolescents were there to
see No Authority, a pop music group playing at the event, and few
of the people attending the promotion were wearing Reebok sneakers
_ or planning to buy any.
</P>
<P>
   The scene highlights the problems facing Reebok International,
once the nation's premier sneaker maker and now the laggard in this
country's large but stagnant $13.8 billion retail athletic-footwear
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Through the introduction of the Traxtar and a campaign for an
updated version of its stalwart Classic sneakers, Reebok is trying
yet again to regain cachet with consumers and reverse a market
share decline that has continued for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company could certainly use a boost. It has slipped to No. 3
in the world market, steadily losing market share over the decade
to Nike, the market leader, and to reinvigorated brands like Adidas
(now No. 2 worldwide).
</P>
<P>
   But its strategy is a big gamble, because Reebok is seemingly
writing off the huge and important teenage market to distinguish
itself from Nike.
</P>
<P>
   While adolescents and young adults make up about 42 percent of
the athletic footwear market, they are more likely than their
parents to buy several pairs of sneakers and to spend large amounts
on the latest top-of-the-line models, at more than $150 a pair. And
their imprimatur can often make or break a brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on innovation and luxury,'' said Paul Fireman,
chairman of Reebok, which also makes Reebok brand apparel and
accessories as well as Rockport, Polo/Ralph Lauren and Greg Norman
footwear and apparel. ``Fashion has moved from the hokey-looking
products to more streamlined'' styles, he added. And Reebok is
betting that its streamlined Classic styles will strike a chord
with fashionable feet of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   As for coolness, ``We stopped trying to chase that,'' said Angel
Martinez, chief marketing officer of the Reebok division, which
accounts for 80 percent of the company's revenues. ``We were able
to establish footwear as the badge of a lifestyle. That's what
we're really going back to,'' he said, recalling the company's
early success as it cashed in on the shift to casual footwear and
the aerobics craze of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That success, however, was followed by a string of unsuccessful
strategies in the 1990s that were intended to fend off rivals.
First, hefty spending on celebrity endorsements failed and Reebok's
performance footwear was unpopular. It refocused on women's shoes
in 1992 but lost out to more fashionable competitors. A new
technology in 1997 suffered from poor marketing and unattractive
styling.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of missteps, missed opportunities and management
shake-ups, few analysts are persuaded that the company's newest
initiatives will pull Reebok out of its slump. What the company
really needs, they say, is a consistent message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Reebok is that they've gotten very excited
about a number of products over the years,'' but the company's
efforts have not always translated into strong sales, said Josie
Esquivel, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``They were
losing market share during the growth of the industry,'' Ms.
Esquivel added. ``They're not perceived as being cool and having
their act together.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Reebok's earnings fell 82 percent, to $23.9 million
from $135.1 million in 1997. Sales, which have been declining since
1995, were down 11.5 percent last year, to $3.2 billion. Reebok's
profit margin also plunged, down more than 80 percent, to .7
percent. And the company's shares have lost more than 80 percent of
their value in the last three years, closing at $8 on Friday. Its
12 percent share in the world market put it behind Nike, with 33
percent, and Adidas of Germany, with about 16 percent. In the
United States, it was still in second place, behind Nike, but its
market share has been falling.
</P>
<P>
   And when Nike faltered in 1998, because of Asia's economic slump
and as teenagers deemed the styles uncool, Reebok was unable to
gain ground, as other competitors, including New Balance, did.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1999, sales were $2.28 billion, down
9.6 percent from a year earlier. In September, as part of a
restructuring, Reebok laid off 120 employees at its headquarters in
Stoughton, Mass., and announced plans to cut an additional 500 jobs
around the world _ a total of nearly 10 percent of its work force.
Cuts were also made last year.
</P>
<P>
   While industry sales in the United States are forecast to fall
slightly this year before rising in 2000, several competitors,
including Nike and New Balance, are expected to gain market share.
Reebok could end up tied with New Balance Athletic Shoe, with about
8 percent of the U.S. market, said John Shanley, an analyst with
First Security Van Kasper. He estimates that Nike will have about
50 percent, followed by Adidas, with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, Carl Yankowski, who had been president and
chief executive of the Reebok division for only 15 months, resigned
to return to the technology industry. Fireman is taking over his
duties and few analysts expect Yankowski's departure to deeply
affect Reebok's fortunes. The departure is, however, the latest in
a series of recent management changes and another example of the
problems Reebok must overcome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Things were not always so bad.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in 1987, propelled by the women's aerobic fitness
craze, Reebok overtook Nike as the largest athletic footwear
company in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies' positions reversed again in 1989, and in the
last few years Reebok has been unable to increase shelf space with
retailers. Some styles were deemed unattractive. Analysts complain
_ and the company acknowledges _ that Reebok has no uniform message
or concise marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok was forced to back away from its efforts to emulate
Nike's success through a focus on competitive sports and celebrity
endorsements, ending costly contracts with many athletes, including
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Reebok's DMX performance technology, which
puts moving air in the sole for added comfort, was a good one. But
while DMX, introduced in 1997, was popular in running shoes, the
company could not transfer that success across product lines.
Reebok also had difficulty getting professional athletes to switch
to their products.
</P>
<P>
   Oversaturation from its focus on mass-market retailers like
Sears, Roebuck and J.C. Penney caused Reebok to become victim to
heavy discounting. The company also lost credibility with
speciality retailers like Foot Locker and among teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't want to shop at a J.C. Penney,'' said John Horan,
publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
``And Foot Locker doesn't want that stuff if it's all over the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, niche players like Saucony and K-Swiss have hurt
Reebok's Classic program with their clean, simple styles at similar
prices _ $50 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   But Reebok officials are betting that the Traxtar and new
Classic designs will build on the success it has had with products
like its Allen Iverson basketball shoe and Polo/Ralph Lauren lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Traxtar uses a microprocessor and motion-detection
technology to measure how fast children run and how high and how
far they jump. Lights on an oval pod on the tongue of the shoe glow
and music is played as performance is measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look at the kids' marketplace, it's becoming more
interactive,'' said Matt Feiner, director of global product
marketing for children's footwear. ``We wanted to be the first to
bring it into footwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok said it would spend about $6 million to market Traxtar in
2000, triple what it is spending on children's shoes this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes the Traxtar, which will sell for around $60 a
pair, will be just the beginning of a new line of ``smart shoes''
for children and adults. Plans are being considered, for example,
for a walking shoe with a built-in chip to measure distance and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign for Classics will begin in early 2000. Reebok
plans to position the line as stylish, well made and upscale, with
ads in publications like Vogue, In Style and GQ.
</P>
<P>
   The Classics, long known as a simply styled white sneaker, will
come in more colors and a modified design, and will be made of
nubuck _ a brushed leather _ as well as soft leather. The company
hopes the updated styles will encourage sales of Reebok apparel as
well as catch the eye of teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   To push the line, Reebok will spend about $15 million on print
and billboard ads next year. Company executives say Reebok has
never before spent more than $1 million a year on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also planning a new basketball shoe, called
Blacktop, and a new fitness shoe for women with DMX technology,
later next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street remains unconvinced that Reebok has found a winning
path.
</P>
<P>
   Some dismiss the Traxtar as a fad. And technology, they say, is
not what sells sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebok has this DMX technology, but nobody cares,'' said
Allison Malone, an analyst with Off the Record Research, an
investment research company based in San Francisco. ``The biggest
demographic, these teenagers, they only care about fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Classics have a following among older ladies,'' Ms. Malone
added. ``They're going to have to appeal to a larger base.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas and smaller companies like New Balance and K-Swiss have
made inroads in the children's and sports-performance market.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month Nike introduced Nikeid, which the company
calls an ``interactive, design-a-shoe experience.'' Customers can
use the Internet to order two models of customized sneakers,
choosing the shoe color and adding a nametag.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok is a financially strong company with high brand
recognition. But if its products do not excite more consumers soon,
analysts warn, it will continue to lose credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many lives do they have?'' Ms. Esquivel asked. ``Winning
back is a lot harder than starting off fresh.''

SEARCHERS AT BURNED WAREHOUSE OBSERVE MOMENT OF SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. -- The memorial was over, the VIPs had left,
but the grim search went on Friday, as firefighters continued to
sift through the wreckage of the Worcester Cold Storage and
Warehouse Co. building for four of their lost colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage crews have worked ceaselessly, 24 hours a day, since the
vacant warehouse caught fire on Dec. 3. But for the first time, the
effort came to a brief halt as firefghters observed a moment of
silence at 6:13 p.m. -- exactly one week to the minute the fateful
alarm went out, sending engines and ladders to the blaze that would
claim six mens' lives.
</P>
<P>
   As a gentle rain fell across the city, crews stood in a line
atop the wreckage, some bowing thir heads, some pacing sadly. All
took off their helmets and held them to their hearts. At the
stations, firefighters stood grim-faced and silent, some raising
their hands in salutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking contrast to the hours before and afterward,
when construction equipment roared and beeped, lifting piles of
brick and dropping them, crashing, to the ground. Crews atop the
piles of debris inside the building hurled charred pieces of wood
and pipe to the ground, and sifted through the mounds of wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Every day a little bit more of the warehouse disappears, as
construction equipment gnaws away atthe thick brick walls.
Firefighters spent much of Friday preparing to protect the rubble
within, and the walls themselves, fromhwinds and heavy rains
expected this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have literally hundreds of people here working, and we have
all our resources in place,'' District Chief James Callery said.
</P>
<P>
   Weary firefighters, many of whom have had little sleep or rest
since the deadly blaze, made plans to attend the funeral Sunday for
Timothy P. Jackson and another on Monday for James F. Lyons III,
the two firefighters whose bodies have been recovered. Paul
Brotherton, Thomas Spencer, Jeremiah Lucey, and Joseph McGuirk are
still lost beneath the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread support for fatigued and grieving firefighters
continued to come from near and far, in expressions large and
small.
</P>
<P>
   The Colleges of Worcester Consortium, an umbrella group
representing 15 private and public schools, announced Friday that
its member institutions will provide scholarships to the 17
children whose fathers died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of help and support continued to flood into the
Local 1009 Firefighters Union office. Bags of stuffed animals
shared space with tables laden with donated food, and gestures of
sympathy poured in by mail, from adults and from children, even
those barely old enough to know how to write.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Mormino, 6, of Quincy, wrote his letter on the thin,
lined paper children use when they are first learning to print. He
penned his thoughts in large, halting letters:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry about your Dad that you cant see your Dad at Christmas.
So you can have my Lunch money to buy your Mom a presant.
OXOXOXOX''
</P>
<P>
   In the envelope, he had placed $1.50 in quarters.

PUTIN SOFTENS HIS BOSS'S CRITICISMS OF AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin returned Friday from an official visit to
Beijing sounding more like a recidivist Soviet premier than a
president, having rattled Russia's nuclear saber at President
Clinton on Wednesday and denounced American culture, values and
military dominance before leaving Beijing Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But more intriguing, perhaps, is what Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin was doing in Moscow while he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin excoriated Clinton and the West for their complaints
about Russia's conduct of the war in Chechnya, Putin was busily
smoothing things over. He said that Yeltsin was not ``ushering in a
period of coolness'' toward Washington, that the United States and
Russia remained friends and that Clinton's criticism was no doubt
spurred by concern, not anger.
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin flew home Friday, Putin revealed that he had been
in secret peace talks with Chechnya's president, Aslan Maskhadov.
Russian generals opened a public-relations front, accusing Chechen
rebels of employing chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kremlin's emergencies minister vowed to go to Chechnya
to ensure that civilians trapped in the conflict get safe passage
to Russian-built refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's willingness to revise and extend his boss' remarks
underscores his independence in Yeltsin's Kremlin, where two of his
predecessors were dismissed this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that Yeltsin was aiming his words at Russians
as much as foreigners. With a crucial parliamentary election due in
a week, it would not do for Yeltsin to meekly accept Western
dressings-down over a hugely popular war.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also indicate that Western attacks on human-rights
violations in the war are finally starting to sting, and that
Russia's leaders want to mollify their critics, at least with
soothing words, until they can secure a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Europe in particular has seethed over Russia's conduct of the
war and demanded peace negotiations, which Putin now indicates have
occurred, albeit unsuccessfully. The government's newfound concern
over refugees also addresses a major complaint of western critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Yeltsin's remarks in Beijing were scripted,''
said Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat in Moscow who is now a
Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington. ``He feels a lot of the pressure. And its sort of the
way Yeltsin's mind works _ he wants to lash out, to remind people
they're an important power.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Putin's reaction is a real one, too, that he may
have said things he shouldn't have said, and that we're trying to
walk it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin erupted in Beijing on Wednesday after Clinton said
Russia could pay a stiff price for the high rate of civilian
casualties in Chechnya. Yeltsin said Clinton seemed to have
forgotten ``what Russia is; that it possesses a complete arsenal of
nuclear weapons.'' And he added: ``It did not happen and will not
happen now that Bill Clinton would alone dictate to the world how
to live, how to work, how to rest. We will dictate how to live, not
him.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed that Friday with a joint Russian-Chinese communique
that fairly bristled with resentment toward U.S. policy. The
document criticized the ``negative momentum'' in international
relations and the ``uni-polar world'' and the ``single model of
culture, value concepts and ideology'' which it said the West was
forcing on the world.
</P>
<P>
   The communique said Russia and China would strengthen their ties
to counterbalance Western dominance, and the nations endorsed each
other's policies in two key trouble spots, Chechnya and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's condemnations of the United States resonated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin was absolutely correct in his logic, and this logic is
determined by internal political developments,'' Andronik
Migranyan, a political scientist and presidential adviser, said in
an interview Friday. ``The stakes here are already high. Russia is
trying to get rid of these terrorist bandits, to restore law and
order, and it is completely supported by the overwhelming majority
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   With a major election coming up, he said: ``You cannot respond
another way. Otherwise you are out; nobody needs you. He would have
been viewed as an idiot before his public, his army, his
government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is impossible to tell whether Yeltsin and Putin choreographed
their remarks as a good-cop-bad-cop routine or whether Putin, whose
prosecution of the war has made him a runaway favorite to succeed
Yeltsin, is simply feeling his oats.
</P>
<P>
   And it may not matter. In the wake of the performance, Clinton
revised his own remarks, somewhat softening his attack. The
European Union, opening its own summit meeting in Helsinki, toned
down talk of economic sanctions and diplomatic reprisals over the
Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin, in Uzbekistan, made clear that whatever benevolent
impression he had left, the war in Chechnya will continue as
before. ``The goals we set to uproot terrorism in Russia will be
reached,'' he said. ``We do not believe that the chosen tactics
should be changed.''

RICK DANKO, 56; ROCK HALL OF FAMER WITH MANY INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New Ykims News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Danko, the affable but often troubled Rock and Roll Hall of
Famer who sang and played bass with the Band and had many other
side projects, died Friday in his home in Woodstock, N.Y. He was
56.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko reportedly died in his sleep, according to Ike
Phillips, a friend and general manager of Woodstock radio station
WDST-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko's deeply soulful voice keyed such Band classics as
``Up on Cripple Creek,'' ``The Weight,'' ``The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down,'' ``Stage Fright,'' and ``Unfaithful Servant.''
</P>
<P>
   The pink house that Mr. Danko rented near Woodstock in the late
'60s was where the Band recorded its debut record, ``Music From Big
Pink,'' which catapulted the group to fame and is considered one of
the great rock albums.
</P>
<P>
   The Band, which backed Bob Dylan on his breakthrough electric
tour in 1965, played the original Woodstock Festival in 1969 and,
along with the Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers, appeared at the
Watkins Glen Festival in 1973. That fest, with a half-million
spectators, actually drew a larger crowd than came to Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his soulful vocals and steady bass lines, Mr. Danko
played fiddle, which gave an old-timey feel to some Band songs.
That quality helped earn the group its status as leaders of the
Americana roots movement, though four members (including Mr. Danko)
were born in Canada, where they first backed rockabilly singer
Ronnie Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko, who ws born in Simcoe, Ontario, left school at age 14
to pursue music. He later battled an alcohol problem, which he
discussed in interviews, and two years ago was found guilty of
smuggling heroin into Japan. He was given a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mr. Danko was known by many as an eternal optimist. He
defined himself that way and, after the suicide of Band member
Richard Manuel in 1986, Mr. Danko even rationalized in a Globe
interview that Manuel ``was just checking a new, sophisticated
knot. That may sound weird, but that's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko, however, took the death of his close friend Manuel
hard. And he suffered the next year when friend and occasional
touring partner Paul Butterfield died. Still, Mr. Danko dd not
harbor bitterness. Although the Band never reunited with guitarist
Robbie Robertson, Mr. Danko sang backup on Robertson's self-titled
debut album in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Robertson's absence, the Band re-formed (with Mr. Danko,
Levon Helm, and Garth Hudson) for a number of tours through the
years, playing the Newport Folk Festival and hosting New Year's Eve
at the Paradise in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko toured relentlessly and was a frequent visitor to
Boston with his own groups. He played the Channel, Jonathan
Swift's, Nightstage, the Middle East, and Ed Burke's, imparting
honky-tonk blues and good times.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danko found the most peace at his Woodstk home deep in the
woods, by a pond that he stocked with trout. And he always took
pride in how the and's music influenced the next wave of artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really thankful the way our music has been passed down
from father to son, and generation to generation,'' he once told
the Globe. ``I've been influenced, and I have influenced. It's good
to be on both sides of the light.''

DURING ARKANSAS VISIT, CLINTON FOCUSES ON FUTURE BEYOND
PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST MEMPHIS, Ark., _ President Clinton still has more than 13
months left in office, but he was clearly focusing on his future
after he leaves the White House on Friday as he made a nostalgic
homecoming trip to his native state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sounded more like a governor than a president as he
spoke to the Greater Little Rock Chamber of Commerce and toured
depressed areas of eastern Arkansas, announcing millions of dollars
in federal grants to promote economic development, train long-haul
truck drivers and improve local health care services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just take a minute to walk back through memory lane,''
Clinton said in a mellow, wistful speech to the Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The whole day followed that pattern as Clinton thanked the
people he credited with making possible his career in national
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to begin by thanking the people of Arkansas, who gave
me the chance to serve for a dozen years as governor, without which
I could never have become president,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He observed that his days in the White House were winding down,
and he emphasized this theme so much that it sounded as if his term
would end next month, rather than in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had little to say about his plans for the remainder of
his term. Rather, he boasted of his achievements over the last
seven years and described _ in more detail than ever before _ his
vision of life after the White House, including his plan to build a
presidential library in Little Rock, on a 26-acre site beside the
Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the library would not only burnish his record but
also attract visitors to Little Rock from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to be a museum, but not a mausoleum,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his presidential archives would be combined with a
policy center, where he intends to continue the projects he began
as president. He said nothing about the home he and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, bought recently in Chappaqua, N.Y., or the
career she seeks as a U.S. senator for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come home to build the library and my policy center,''
Clinton said, ``I want to deal with a lot of these big questions:
How do you close the digital divide and use these high-tech
advances to benefit every American? How do you create good jobs and
a clean environment? How do you leave behind the ethnic and
religious hatreds, the other kind of hatred that is manifested in
hate crimes in America, and the tribal slaughters in Africa and all
the wars in between? How do you create genuine economic opportunity
and empowerment for people who have been poor a very long time?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce used Clinton's
visit as an occasion to encourage donations to the foundation that
is building the library. They said they were trying to raise $125
million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would continue his work as a peacemaker,
mediating racial, ethnic, political and religious conflicts after
he left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock and his presidential center can become ``a beacon of
hope for those kinds of people,'' Clinton said.

KOBE'S ROLE SCALED BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Upon further review, maybe Kobe Bryant needs
some time to warm up this season before the Los Angeles Lakers'
nightly fate is placed entirely in his hands. At least, that's
coach Phil Jackson's feeling right now.
</P>
<P>
   While Bryant has shown no physical rust from his seven-week
layoff, he has made some judgment errors in his first five games
back _ witness the six turnovers he committed in Wednesday's loss
to the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson might scale back some of Bryant's responsibilities,
specifically the burden of orchestrating the Lakers' last
possession of each quarter. It was in those situations, with the
clock running down, when Bryant made the majority of his errors
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I've put a lot of responsibility on him,''
Jackson said, ``because he's a creative player, he's also a very
talented player, and in that responsibility mode, there's some
things _ end of quarters, time-clock kind of situations _ that
haven't happened for us right yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fully understands the role, but I think he doesn't quite
grasp the severity of the situation, really the responsibility of
the whole situation. A lot of games in the NBA you see a team win
(based on) who scores at the beginning of the quarter, who scores
at the end of the quarter. ... And for us in Sacramento, for
example, it was disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the third quarter, for example, the Lakers had a
chance to run one last play and cut the deficit to six points, but
Bryant lost the ball as he made a move toward the baseline. The
Kings took it to the other end, where Derek Fisher fouled Jason
Williams, sending him to the line with four seconds left. The
Lakers entered the fourth quarter down 73-64.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things that Kobe, as a responsible player, will
measure out and know the clock, take the last shot or create the
situation for the last shot, so there's not a turnover,'' Jackson
said. ``It happened the night before against Washington too, at the
end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to readjust that thinking a little bit and wait
until Kobe (has) that experience to handle those situations. I
might have been a little bit too hasty to put him in that
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is already working on it. He took one of the game tapes
home to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to watch it, go through it and grimace, feel the
remorse about it, I know, because that's the kind of kid he is,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   George returns: The Lakers activated rookie swingman Devean
George on Friday and placed forward Travis Knight on the injured
list.
</P>
<P>
   George went to the injured list Dec. 1 to make room for Bryant
but was activated as soon as he was eligible. Jackson wanted George
to spend some time watching and learning from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's ready,'' Jackson said. ``He says he's ready to
play. I played him this morning (in practice), he played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who hasn't left the bench in four of the past eight
games, has never fully recovered from the right ankle he sprained
in mid-October. He's averaging just 5.1 minutes per game.

AFTER NFL, ANYTHING BUT PITS FOR NASCAR CZAR GIBBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, when he was signing off as an NFL pregame analyst
with NBC, Joe Gibbs had a vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural for me,'' said Gibbs, the Hall of Fame coach
who won three Super Bowls with the Washington Redskns. Gibbs was
just starting a new career as an owner in NASCAR, with one car, one
driver, and 18 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like pro football,'' said Gibbs. ``You have an
owner, a coach (crew chief), a quarterback (the driver) and and
entire crew with him. I think this sport is great, and is going to
be even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just a handful of years ago. Now Gibbs has six cars,
six drivers, 130 employees, and two of the sport's hottest drivers,
Bobby Labonte (second overall this year) and rookie of the year
Tony Stewart (fourth overall).
</P>
<P>
   ``This sport is still taking off, it hasn't peaked yet,'' said
Gibbs, trying to explain to your humble servant why NASCAR has
become the second biggest sport in America, ranking only benthe
NFL. ``To start with, this sport is built around something that
everyone knows something about _ cars. People love cars. People
love our drivers. They are good guys. They present themselves well
with the fans and the sponsors. Our guys don't pull some of the
other stuff you see in other sports. We wouldn't let them get away
with it if they did. There's too much at stake. All of the drivers
have a morals clause in their contracts. This is not three strikes
and you are out. This is one strike and you are out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the nine years I've been in this, there hasn't been a
single driving under (the influence). We won't put up with the
stuff you see in other sports. My three major sponsors are worth
collectively more than $220 billion, and no one working for me is
going to do anything to put that relationship at risk. The
demographics are great. It's very popular with women. The NFL
averages 60,000 people a game, we average 120,000 for a Winston Cup
race. Our sport runs longer than the others. We got 10 months a
year. One of these races is like a football game. It's an event.
Fans tailgate. Corporate America can't get enough of the sport.
This is an upscale crowd. We are very close to having a large track
in every major television market in American.''
</P>
<P>
   According to NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, Gibbs is right on
the money on the growth of auto racing on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is second only to the NFL in producing TV ratings on a
consistent basis throughout the regular season,'' said Ebersol, who
recently signed NASCAR to a major long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   There are 34 Winston Cup races during the course of a season.
``A wonderful thing happened at our race in Miami, which was their
33d of the season,'' said Jon Miller, vice president of programming
at NBC. ``Everyone of the top drivers was there. All of the stars
were there. They show up every week. This is not like the NFL when
you get toward the end of the season and there is no Steve Young,
no Vinny Testaverde, no Terrell Davis. The stars in racing are
still there going as hard as they have all season.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of popularity:
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't waste my time going to see it in person, or watching
it on television, but there is no questioning the great impact of
modern pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   This week the World Wrestling Federation and CEO Vince McMahon
came to the FleetCenter with ``Smackdown.'' Incredibly, all 17,500
tickets were sold in one day, when you have thousands of empty
seats for Bruins and Celtics game every night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots offense has been shut down four weeks in a row, but
I don't think Indianapolis can do it, which is why I feel the
Patriots will pull the upset and beat the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the Patriots have beaten the Colts seven
straight, and it is not easy to get over the idea that another team
has your ``number'' when they've beaten you seven straight, and
came from 21 points behind last time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a lot of irony here. Bill Belichick and the Jets
(and Drew Bledsoe has give i credit for this) came up with the
defensive scheme that has haunted the Ptriots for the past month.
That is, press the Patriots' smallish wide receivers to neutralize
their speed, and play a two-deep zone over the top, in case they
break free from quick coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Then the two safeties can move in to take away the big play.
There is only one team in the league that has held the Colts to
fewer than 25 pointsthis year. That's the Jets, and they did it
twice, allowing 16 and 13 points. The irony is that the Jets did it
with the same defensive scheme _ they pressed the receivers and
played two deep.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, against New England they tried to pressure
Bledsoe, while against Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, they
backed off and played more coverage downfield. Manning eats a blitz
alive. He knows where the pressure is coming from, how to avoid it,
and where the open man is going to be. The Jets took a different
tact, making him opt to throw short, making the big play in the
pssing game difficult, and forcing the Colts to march the ball,
where more mistakes can occur.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried to pressure Manning when he came to
Foxborough in the second game of the regular season, and he put 28
points on the board in 30 minutes. Peyton dominated them. In the
second half, the Patriots backed off, and the Colts did not score
again. The Colts do not have a great cast on defense, but play Vic
Fangio's zone blitz scheme very well. However, unlike the Jets,
Bills, Dolphins, and Cowboys, the Colts don't appear to have the
defensive backs to press the Patriot recievers off the line of
scrimmage and get away with it.

   You are a super sleuth if you can come up with the fictitious
name Charley Barkley used at the Ritz when he came to Boston
Thursday night. Answer is below. Don't peek. Here's my own Sir
Charles story. I had dinner with him, Payne Stewart, and Robert
Fraley in the midst of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the first
year of the Dream Team. Charles was being widely criticized widely
that week for elbowing a player from Angola, and we were kidding
him that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why everyone is on me,'' said Charles in defense,
``Karl Malone hit some guy from Croatia so hard with an elbow that
his eyes started watering and he didn't want to play the rest of
the game. Think his name was (Dino) Radja.'' Guess who showed up
with the Celtics the next year? Radja. Barkley said Friday that
Stewart was on the way to see him when the golfer's plane crashed
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got along great,'' he said. ``I loved the guy. He was a
fine man. I had some great times playing golf with him. I spoke to
him the day before (the fatal crash). He was coming to Houston to
play in a golf tournament, so we were going to get together. He was
going to come to our game. I still can't believe it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley says Kevin McHale was ``the best player I ever played
against. Both ways. He was hard for me to stop on offense. I
couldn't do it. He was too big for me. And he was so good on
defense, it s hard for me to score on him.'' Barkley, inch for
inch, ``I'm 6-4 1/2 in stocking feet'', is the greatest rebounder
in NBA history. ``I just loved to rebound. It's been that way my
whole life. When I first came to pro ball, Moses Malone took me
aside and gave me some tips. Moses was one of the greatest
rebounders ever. When that ball was in the air, I just said to
myself, `this one is mine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   We will miss you, Charles.

   The crowd that showed up to vote on the Patriots Stadium issue
in a special town meeting was a Foxborough-record 2,329. The
crucial vote on the access road was 1,731-121, 93.5 percent. What
swayed the town more than anything else toward the stadium was the
Patriots upping the present ante of $400,000 per year to upwards of
$2 million a year when the stadium is finished . . . Consider this:
The Red Sox had 13 pitchers on the disabled list last season and
still finished first in pitching in the American League. Tom
``Flash'' Gordon, prime among that unlucky group, is scheduled for
surgery next week.

   The US champion Marlboro Shamrocks thought their season was over
with a fifth national title two weeks ago, but there is another
challenge that they are going to accept for a great reason. ``The
Wichita Drillers have said for years they are better than us and
want to play us,'' said Shamrocks coach Bob Brennan. ``We play in
the USFA. They play in the AFA. It's like the old NFL-AFL days.
We've neer played them before, but we're going to play them now
because we wtto do something for this Firefighter Relief Fund in
Worcester. We're only about 15 miles from Worcester, so what
happened is close to home. Wichita has agreed to come and play us
in Marlboro next Saturday at 1 o'clock. This will be like the first
Super Bowl (of semi-professional football) and we are going to give
all the proceeds to that fund. We're hoping to play a game at
Fitton Field in Worcester next spring to give even more money to
the fund.'' . . . If you want to help in Worcester, here is a way
to do it. Phil Castinetti of Sportsworld in Everett, the largest
memorabilia store in New England, is having his ninth-annual All
Boston Sports Auction and will donate all of the proceeds on a 1939
Ted Williams replica jersey to the Firefighters Fund. The auction
starts Dec. 17. You can get a catalog and other information by

   Former Patriot defensive coordinator Al Groh is one of the top
candidates for the vacant head coaching job at Princeton. They
couldn't pick a better man. Groh's son, Matt, was the starting QB
for the Princton freshman last year . . . Virginia Tech football
coach Frank Beamer, whose team will play Florida State for the
national championship, said he was a ``house'' away from taking the
head coaching job at Boston College in 1990. Beamer was a top
candidate for the job before Tom Coughlin got the position. Beamer
came to Boston, met with athletic director Chet Gladchuk, accepted
the deal and went house-hunting the same day. When he saw how
expensive houses were in Newton and in surrounding towns, he
decided it wasn't that bad living in Blacksburg, Va., for a lot
less just eight miles from the office, and went back to Tech . . .
Before deciding to go to Boston College, Tim Hasselbeck was pursued
hardest by Northwestern and coach Gry Barnett. ``I thought that was
where Tim was going to go,'' said father Don, a Colorado alumnus.
``But he decided to go to BC and follow in Matt's footsteps.''
Coincidentally, Garnett left Northwestern and is nowthe head coach
of Colorado, which plays against Tim and the Eagles in the
Insight.com bowl in Tucson. On the way, the Hasselbeck clan will
stop in Green Bay to spend Christmas with Matt, who is backup to
Brett Favre on the Packers. ``When we visited Green Bay before to
have Christmas with Matt, the boys decided to have a flag-football
game at a local field,'' said Don. ``One of his brothers whacked
Matt in the nose and broke it, and he had to go back to Lambeau
Field and the trainer to get it taken care of. It's the hardest he
got hit all that year.'' The third Hasselbeck, Nathaniel, a wide
receiver/safety, heads to BC next year.

   Thanks to all of those who sent money to help Greg Bednarz of
the Weymouth Club travel to Japan in search of the world's light
heavyweight arm wrestling championship. With sizable donations from
John Hancock and Terry Clark and Clark Co., in Boston, plu many of
you, Bednarz raised enough money to make the trip, and didn't let
anyone down. At 42, going against competitors averaging between 25
and 30 years old, Bednarz did the incredible, winning the title on
both arms, which no one had done before . . . Quiz answer: James
Bond.

INVESTING WITH RICHARD T. WEISS: STRONG COMMON STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Wis., Calif.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of Strong Common Stock is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors who dabble in smaller-capitalization stocks have had a
lot to grumble about in recent years. But you won't hear complaints
from Richard T. Weiss, portfolio manager of the $1.60 billion
Strong Common Stock and $2.37 billion Strong Opportunity funds,
even though both offerings are laden with small and midcap
companies.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the poor showing last year among smaller stocks was
``the equivalent of a hundred-years storm,'' Weiss said, adding
that the clouds were already breaking up. Calling 1999 a
``transition year,'' he said the large caps' winning streak was
bound to end in 2000: ``The market will shift and small cap will
tend to do much better than larger-cap stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss commutes from his home in Chicago to the headquarters of
Strong Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wis., near Milwaukee. Fond
of cowboy boots, the theater and the avocado ranch he owns near
Santa Barbara, Calif., Weiss, 48, strikes an independent stance and
often mines forgotten precincts of the market. So the recent poor
performance of the midcap and small-cap issues gives him plenty of
opportunity to find the kind of inexpensive stocks he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get beyond the biggest 25 stocks and out of the
technology group, the rest of the market is reasonably priced,''
Weiss said. ``Not dirt cheap, but reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   His funds have fared well. The Common Stock fund, which has been
closed to new investors since 1993, returned 20.2 percent a year,
on average, for the three years through Dec. 3, compared with 14.9
percent for its peer group of midcap blend funds, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Opportunity fund, which is less risky, returned 21.9 percent
a year, on average, for the three years through Dec. 3, versus 10.3
percent for its category of midcap value funds, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is superstitious _ he carries a lucky pen, pencil and
coins and wears an elephant hair bracelet. Soft-spoken, sometimes
laconic, he can sound almost mystical when talking about markets.
</P>
<P>
   He strives to ``listen for the quiet,'' as he puts it, when
searching for neglected stocks. ``Some market segments are simply
ignored, not necessarily because they're bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss also likes to ``find areas that may have been hard hit but
are basically sound industries with the potential for higher
P/E's.'' Last summer, for example, when worries about Year 2000
computer problems pushed down second-quarter earnings in the
software sector, ``we were able to buy many good Internet-centric
software companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His preferred valuation method is called private value analysis,
in which he tries to figure out what an entire company would be
worth to a knowledgeable buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis varies, depending on the industry. But for
conventional operating companies, he is willing to pay seven to
nine times cash flow. He will pay more for technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   He might sell a stock when the price reaches 80 percent to 100
percent of private market value _ but not always, he said. ``If
it's a unique asset and the value will grow,'' he said, ``we'll
hold on until the value catches up with the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently added to his position in Hollinger International,
the Toronto media company owned by Conrad Black. Among its
newspapers is The London Daily Telegraph, which survived a recent
price war with The Times of London, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. Should Murdoch raise prices at that paper, The Telegraph
would follow, Weiss said, ``and any price rise would fall directly
to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hollinger's National Post, a new Canadian newspaper,
``circulation has vastly exceeded expectations,'' he said, ``and I
think that will translate into higher revenues, because it has a
lower cost structure than its competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss expects three-year earnings growth of more than 20 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in August at $11; the stock closed on Friday at
$13.1875, or 75 percent of what he sees as its private market value
_ $18 a share.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Barnes &AMP; Noble, the bookseller. ``The market
thinks the Internet will put booksellers out of business. I
disagree,'' Weiss said, adding that he believes online market share
will increase only modestly going forward.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the company is using innovative strategies to tie
together its Internet site and its stores, he said _ for example,
by delivering books ordered online in New York City with a
messenger service.
</P>
<P>
   The main offline rival of Barnes &AMP; Noble is the Borders Group,
which trades at 13 times this year's earnings. He calculated that
excluding Barnesandnoble.com, the separately-traded online
affiliate, Barnes &AMP; Noble trades at less half that. ``Any way you
look at it,'' Weiss said, ``it's ridiculously cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, he bought shares at $25.45 each. The stock closed
on Friday at $21.9375, or 63 percent of his estimate of its private
market value of $35 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Seagate Technology, the disk drive maker
based in Scotts Valley, Calif. ``Right now, business is terrible
because there's a lot of pricing pressure,'' Weiss said. ``But
we're at the bottom of the cycle and things should get better from
now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagate owns a 30 percent stake in Veritas Software, which
produces software used in storage area networks, as well as
positions in several other software companies. In total, the stakes
are worth $49 a share, Weiss figures.
</P>
<P>
   So Seagate, which closed on Friday at $38.8125, sells for less
than the value of its holdings, ``and you get the largest disk
drive manufacturer in the world for free,'' he said. He expects the
company to become profitable next year.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying shares in July, at an average cost of $25.50
each. The shares now trade for 60 percent of his estimate of
private market value _ $65 a share.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clutching her oboe case and looking for all the world
like any other teenager out with her family to share the merriment
of the season, Johanna Johnson arrived at Lincoln Center on
Thursday and made her way to the Christmas tree at the fountain.
</P>
<P>
   But Johanna, a 16-year-old aspiring musician and soccer player
from Grass Valley, Calif., a suburb of Sacramento, wasn't just any
visitor. Battling Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the lymph tissue
that in her case appears to have gone into remission, she was asked
this summer by the Make a Wish Foundation, which grants requests to
children with life-threatening illnesses, to pick the thing she
most wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna did not ask for a trip to Walt Disney World, or for a
shopping spree or a meeting with her favorite celebrity, the three
most popular requests the foundation receives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Johanna said, ``I want to sit in the middle of a great
orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   After some research on the Internet and the New York
Philharmonic's Web page, she zeroed in on the Philharmonic and its
longtime principal oboist, Joseph Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Robinson and the Philharmonic not only invited
her to visit the orchestra and receive a lesson from him but also
to play alongside him Saturday night in Avery Fisher Hall when the
orchestra performs Aaron Copland's Third Symphony under Andrew
Litton.
</P>
<P>
   Never has such a young person who is not a featured soloist ever
played with the orchestra, the Philharmonic said. The only guest
appearance by a nonprofessional musician goes back more than 30
years when George Plimpton played the gong, triangle and sleigh
bells with the Philharmonic for a television documentary on NBC in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The Copland symphony has significant parts for oboe but as
acting assistant principal, Johanna, who has two years on the oboe
and five on the clarinet, will mainly support and reinforce the
louder passages. ``She plays pretty much everything except the
solos,'' said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Even before her debut, Johanna emerged from a rehearsal
pronouncing her visit a success. ``I wanted to sit and hear music
all around me,'' she said. ``What can I say? My wish came true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can be somebody's wish some day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic was equally delighted.
</P>
<P>
   It was last April, when she was 15, that a lump she had noticed
in her neck months earlier and ignored was diagnosed as an enlarged
lymph node from Hodgkin's disease. The cancer had spread to a
second site. While continuing to play in her high school soccer
league and as principal oboist in the Auburn Youth Symphony, she
underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Her hair fell out
and is now growing back.
</P>
<P>
   The disease went into remission and a recent checkup showed
Johanna to be cancer-free, said her father, Richard, a Lutheran
pastor. Although there is a high recovery rate, the radiation
treatment itself raises the risk of new tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With cancer you never know,'' Johnson said, adding that
Johanna was determined to prevail. ``Her attitude was `I'm going to
beat this.'''
</P>
<P>
   In August Johanna was called by a volunteer for the Make a Wish
Foundation, which since 1980 has granted wishes to 66,000 children,
the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Her wish caught the organization by surprise. ``What's an
oboe?'' the volunteer asked. Johanna was also quizzed to make sure
she was uttering her own request, not her parents'. She convinced
them that sitting in at the Philharmonic and meeting Robinson, a
teacher of prominent oboists, was indeed her wish.
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, Robinson was there to greet her as Johanna,
along with her father and her mother, Lois, a kindergarten teacher
and singer, and her 19-year-old brother, Luke, arrived at the
Lincoln Center plaza, their air ticket and stay at the Marriott
Marquis Hotel paid by the foundation. It also gave Johanna $250 to
buy a black dress and shoes for the concert. (Her earrings were a
gift from her English teacher, Mike Cartan.)
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a 22-year-veteran of the Philharmonic, turned Johanna
around to face Avery Fisher Hall. ``You're playing in there, you
know that?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna replied quietly, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``You don't seem to be the least bit nervous about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't see because I'm wearing so many clothes,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked her about her oboe reeds and she pulled out an Altoids
tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your case?'' Robinson asked, winking. He had a surprise
in store.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the family to the Shun Lee West restaurant for lunch,
Robinson told Johanna, ``You paid me the greatest compliment of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna said, ``It was either you or Mia Hamm,'' confessing that
she had briefly considered asking to meet this soccer star.
</P>
<P>
   She had another admission for Robinson. She had never really
heard him play but learned about him on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He feigned dismay. ``I thought you must have my picture on your
wall, and all my recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   No, she said. But now that she thought about it, she said, she
had heard him play after all. ``I went to the Internet to see what
you looked like and clicked on a sample of your music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After cracking open fortune cookies _ Johanna's said, ``You will
travel both far and wide for business and pleasure'' _ the group
decamped for Robinson's apartment where Johanna was to receive an
oboe lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson rearranged her hands. ``Secret service fingers are no
good on the oboe,'' he said. ``They should move like Prussian
soldiers, goosestepping.''
</P>
<P>
   Urging her to greater passion, he said, ``You get out of your
tone what you put into it, kind of like life itself.'' At another
point he urged: ``More Bloomingdale's tone, less Kmart. More like
mahogany, less like pine.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna took a deep breath to start again and Robinson stopped
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone tell you not to do that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said. ``Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, without the big breath, ``Do like a karate chop:
kind of hit the cane, blow your brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best defense is a good offense,'' he said. ``Don't yield.
You have to dominate the cane.''
</P>
<P>
   He regaled her with stories of his teacher, Marcel Tabuteau who,
Robinson recalled, once told him: ```There were a few good notes.
And they're still ringing.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair stood up on the back of my neck,'' Robinson said.
``That was my road to Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said with deceptive casualness, ``We got this package
yesterday from Paris.'' He put it in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   She opened it, revealing a new oboe from F. Loreepremier
fabricator of the instrument. Robinson had prevailed on the
company's owners, the Gourdons, to raid one of their outgoing
shipments and substantially cut the usual $5,000 price; the rest
Robinson raised from contributions by himself and other players and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh My God!'' Johanna said, burying her face in her hands. ``Am
I awake or am I dreaming?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No more plastic, baby'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Johanna arrived at Avery Fisher Hall for the
rehearsal. The players made a fuss over her. ``Ah, don't be
worried,'' said Mark Nuccio, a clarinettist. ``We're harmless.'' As
the Copland orchestrations swept the hall, and Johanna got the
signal to play for the first time, she lifted her new oboe to her
lips and blew. Then she turned to Robinson, gave a slight smile,
and turned the page.

 &HT;    Hamilton puts Alvin `on the map'
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALVIN, S.C. _ They will be rolling up the rugs and pushing back
tables and chairs in the Low Country tonight. Getting ready for a
Heisman Trophy party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd better get the cops from everywhere around here, I mean
it, because we're going to block off the streets and have ourselves
a good time,'' said Iva Beauford, owner-operator of the small
African-American community's lone convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   As hordes of sportswriters and TV crews made their way to Alvin,
home of Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton, much has been made
about what Alvin does not have.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are no stoplights, McDonald's or movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But what the town of about 500, that evolved when former slaves
left plantations to sharecrop after the Civil War before eventually
tending their own land, does have is an abundance of decent,
hard-working, pride-filled people. Just like Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's driven, and always wanted to win _ and to be the best,''
says Mark Hamilton, Joe's uncle, who will be among at least 50
family members attending the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   That high self-regard will be on display tonight when Hamilton
joins other Heisman hopefuls in New York for the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, Alvin has hit the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to find Alvin, unless you go there,'' says
Pierson Prioleau, a rookie defensive back with the San Francisco
49ers, who is Hamilton's first cousin. ``You'd always have to say
it's close to Charleston, or something like that. Now it's on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   College recruiters did find Alvin, where Hamilton, Prioleau and
Penn State star defensive end Courtney Brown played at Macedonia
High. The school has since closed and then was torched by
arsonists, and there are no more blue-chip recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Matters not, the deed has been done. Heisman Trophy or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just wanted people to know that there are good, decent
folks in Alvin,'' Prioleau says. ``Knowing Joe, he's going to be
hurt if he doesn't win the Heisman. Not for himself, but for his
family and the people of Alvin. But he will get over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's a fighter, and he'll come to realize that he's been
blessed _ truly blessed _ just to be considered for the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a foregone conclusion that Wisconsin running back Ron
Dayne's name will be etched on the trophy. Yet, back home, Lil' Joe
already has been declared a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, I'm so proud of him,'' Silas Hamilton, Joe's
grandfather, says while watching television as Tech's star receives
the Davey O'Brien Award, which goes to the top quarterback. ``I
tried to teach him the right way, and Joe never forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas Hamilton, 79, taught his seven children, and their
children, values. Of religion, family _ and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his modest home warmed by a space-heater, lots of
plants and walls and shelves filled with framed pictures of loved
ones _ all smiling _ Silas Hamilton wears a blue Georgia Tech
sweatshirt. On the front it reads, ``1998 ACC Champions,'' with a
gold helmet and ``No. 14, Joe Hamilton'' on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more telling tipoffs of their connection.
</P>
<P>
   A blue ``GT'' cap, tipped back and to the right, just the way
Joe Hamilton is prone to wearing his. The warm smile, twinkling
eyes that look directly at yours, and the handshake, firm and
wrapped amongst work-worn fingers.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine of them, the middle one on the left hand having
been lost in a mill accident. One of Silas Hamilton's daughter's
also lost part of a finger, at the same mill. They returned to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Silas Hamilton would go anywhere to work _ the Charleston Navy
Yard, the mill in Jamestown, road construction and the Santee River
Dam. Yet, he'd come back every night to his beloved Alvin, his
sweet-potato patch and his hunting grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little fella, but I worked all over the place,'' he
says. ``But I stayed here where I was born and raised. I never had
it in my mind to leave Alvin. Back in my day, there wasn't much.
Now, Alvin is picking up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a new community center, where the youngsters now play
little-league football instead of the sandlot variety in the field
behind Kinlaw's barbershop that produced Hamilton, Prioleau, Brown
and 18 other Division I football players the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The shining light, however, may be ``M&AMP;B Community Mart,'' which
opened in January and exhibits the don't-quit spirit around Alvin
that Joe Hamilton has made a hallmark of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The ``M,'' is for Moultrie, Iva Beauford's family name. Her
husband, Jethro Beauford, proved the ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother ran a store right next door,'' Iva Beauford says.
``It had a store on one level, a restaurant on another, and then a
club. She named it the `Holiday Inn.' Then one day the other
Holiday Inn sent a letter telling her she couldn't call it that no
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, she called it the `Three Roof Inn.' But it burned down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the ``Three Roof Inn'' lives on through ``M&AMP;B Community
Mart.'' Just as Alvin lives through its football heroes. Heisman
Trophy, or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about putting up a banner across the road:
Alvin, S.C., Home of Champions _ Joe, Courtney and Pierson,''
Beauford says. ``Wouldn't that be nice?''

 &HT;    Hamilton again an underdog for Heisman
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Heisman was at Georgia Tech from 1904 to 1919,
longer than any of his eight coaching stops. But in one of the
ironies of sport, no player from Tech has won the Heisman Trophy,
college football's most coveted individual honor.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Joe Hamilton, the most prolific offensive player in
Atlantic Coast Conference history, would love to be the first to
bring the Heisman to Georgia Tech when the 65th trophy is presented
tonight at the Downtown Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen? Probably not. All of the early surveys among the
voting panel of 921 made up of media, former winners and football
officials point in the direction of Wisconsin running back Ron
Dayne. This season Dayne broke the NCAA career rushing record held
by Texas' Ricky Williams, the 1998 Heisman recipient.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton, a senior from Alvin, S.C., wants you to know that
for him, it has never been about the trophy. Sure, picking up that
impressive piece of hardware would be nice. The joy Hamilton feels,
he said, comes from the journey. It's a long, long way from
Macedonia Middle School, where he began his football career, to one
of five Heisman finalists. It has been a memorable ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would ever think that somebody from Alvin could wind up in
New York with a shot at the Heisman Trophy?'' Hamilton said. ``And
I can honestly say I have enjoyed every minute of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a big week for Hamilton. On Wednesday, he traveled
to Orlando, Fla., for Thursday night's Home Depot Awards Show on
ESPN, where he was named the nation's top quarterback. Then, it was
off to New York on Friday, where Hamilton and the other four
finalists got to take a big Christmas bite out of the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we had the ACC (awards) banquet here, and now I get
to meet all the other guys I've just read about and seen on TV,''
he said. ``To me, that's the most fun _ just hanging out with the
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   During the season, Hamilton said he never allowed himself to
think about the Heisman race. But he confessed that once the
regular season was over, he indulged in some daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Heisman cannot be one of your goals,'' Hamilton
said. ``It just doesn't work that way. But now that the season is
over, I can say that I did everything that I could do. I feel
really good about the way I played. Whatever happens now is out of
my hands. But, yeah, I can imagine what it would feel like to walk
up there and accept the trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton reads the papers and watches television. He surfs the
Net. He knows the score on the Heisman and that his chances of
winning are remote. If he finishes second to Dayne, he will be the
second runner-up from Georgia Tech. Billy Lothridge finished behind
Navy's Roger Staubach in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people will find this hard to believe, but I'm not
going to be really disappointed if my name isn't called,'' Hamilton
said. ``I'm there with a lot of great players. Whoever gets it is
going to be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   The award will be presented in the tiny Heisman Room on the 13th
floor of the Downtown Athletic Club. Only family members and
coaches of the finalists, key Heisman officials and ESPN, which is
televising the event, are allowed in the room. Sitting behind
Hamilton will be his parents, Joseph and Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've wanted to go to everything,'' Hamilton said. ``I think
they are more excited than I am, and I didn't think that was
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hamilton wins the Heisman, he'll spend two more days in New
York getting the traditional tour that goes to all the recipients.
If not, he returns Sunday, when his attention will turn to a Jan. 1
date with Miami in the Gator Bowl. In February, there will be
another round of awards banquets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys think it's a drag, but I think it's fun,'' Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Hamilton said he expects his thoughts to drift back to
middle school, where coach Ken Green saw something special in the
tiny seventh-grader.
</P>
<P>
   He'll think about all of his friends in Alvin, huddling around
TV sets waiting to get a glimpse of the man who put their city on
the map.
</P>
<P>
   He'll think about how he came to Georgia Tech as an uncertain
freshman and how he will leave as the confident, most productive
quarterback in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really only had one goal when I came to Georgia Tech,''
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was to get better every year I was in school. I think
I did that.''

PATRIOTS RUNNING GAME? DON'T SELL IT SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Servie clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The shoulder shrug was no act. Rookie
running back Kevin Faulk was not trying to feign disinterest.
Friday after practice as he leaned against his locker, Faulk did
not have the time or energy to put up a front.
</P>
<P>
   And the shoulder shrug spoke volumes. Here we go again. Another
week. Another set of rushing statistics. Another reason for hope or
depair. It was not the last time Faulk would hear questions and
criticisms of the running game. The now-you-see-it, now-you-don't
nature of the New England ground attack lends itself to speculation
and conen.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation comes from inconsistency and the inclination to
want to fix it. The concern comes with the cold winter months upon
us and the time-tested football adage that you must have a running
game to survive December. But a long look at the numbers would show
that the running game continues to post respectable gains. The
concern is not unwarranted, but the situation is far from dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're improving week by week and it's just something that
we've got to maintain,'' said Faulk. ``(The statistics) are not
something we really keep an eye on. We just need to go out there
and perform. We just need to keep coming out every week and doing
what we're doing. We have to do it even better the next week and
the next week and keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Added the Patriots' leading rusher, Terry Allen, ``It's always
going to be iffy, until we get to the point where we stick with it.
With the opportunities that we get, I think we do what we can.''
</P>
<P>
   And Allen has been doing just fine. He ranks fifth among AFC
scoring leaders with eight touchdowns. The veteran also is ninth
among AFC running backs with 690 yards on 188 attempts. While the
Colts' rookie sensation, Edgerrin James, leads all conference
rushers with a 4.3 average and 1,210 yards through 12 games, Allen
averages a creditable 3.7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The last time New England faced Indianapolis, Allen's
performance gave fans a reason to believe the Patriotsd found their
running game. After Faulk twisted his ankle in the second quarter,
Allen carried the load on his surgically repaired knees and
battered ankles. The veteran gained 74 yards on 15 carries, alowing
the Patriots to run effectively wen they needed to and proving the
benefits of a balanced offense.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Colts will again face a healthy Allen, who can't wait
to rack up the carries and the yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having not been injured, I don't feel right,'' said Allen.
``Normally, I'm beat up this time of year, so I feel real good
right now. It does give me a bit of confidence, but at the same
time I'd like to feel different. I'd like to have been used more,
but I understand the situations of the game and what we've been
going through. It's a natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen leads a group of rushers that has posted numbers
comparable to Patriots teams of the past. Through 12 games, New
England has 1,100 total yards, a 3.4 average. Last season, with
Robert Edwards leading the way, the team accumulated just 945 yards
over the same period. And in 1996 behind Curtis Martin, the
Patriots posted 1,138 yards in their first dozen contests.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Allen, LSU-product Faulk hasbeen a large reason why
New England has maintained its level of ground production despite
the absence of Edwards. The rookie has 65 carries for 223 yards
(3.4 average).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm feeling more comfortable with the offense,
it's that I'm feeling more confidence in myself and feeling more
confidence in my ankle from when I hurt it,'' said Faulk of his
improving performances. ``It helps me to let my instincts take over
and just run the ball like I have been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a whole lot from Terry. Reading defenses.
Predetermining where all the linebackers are going to be or where
all the defensive linemen are going to be or the safeties. It
really was a smart thing, working me in slowly and letting e
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Faulk, the Patriots' running game remains a work in
progress. Yet, it's clear the team needs a successful running game
to win. New England is 7-0 when it runs the ball 26 times or more.
The denizens of Foxboro Stadium are 0-5 when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the teams that run the ball, they've run the
ball 30-plus times and those are the teams that are winning,'' said
Allen. ``We're not running the ball that many times. (The criticism
of the running game) is unjust because we haven't stuck with it
yet, so you never know how it's going o come out.''
</P>
<P>
   And not much time remains to find out.

FIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI A CAREER MOVE FOR RUIZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNICA, Miss. _ This is a long way to come for a tuneup, but
John Ruiz is hoping it's worth the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelsea, Mass. heavyweight has come to this riverboat
gambling center on the Mississippi to put at risk the World Boxing
Council's No. 1 heavyweight ranking. It is a commodity worth more
than most things he's gotten out of boxing the last seven years,
including all his purses.
</P>
<P>
   This is not being done by chance, although, in a sense, it is
taking a chance with a potential multimillion-dollar payday down
the road as a mandatory callenger for undisputed heavyweight
champion Lennox Lewis. If Ruiz is upset Saturday by a former
contender of little note named Jade Scott, he will have blown his
dream and the millions that follow.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be a loss. It would be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz (35-3) has never seen fights like this that way.
Several weeks ago, it was he who first suggested to his manager to
make a match with No. 2-rated WBC contender Michael Grant, who is
widely seen as the heir apparent to Lewis's throne. Those
negotiations have not reached fruition because Ruiz wants the same
$1.5 million to risk his ranking that International Boxing
Federation No. 1-rated heavyweight David Tua turned down to fight
Grant. This seems reasonable to Ruiz, but boxing is not a
reasonable businesswch only makes his boldness in seeking out Grant
more refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Te real problem, though, is that a mandatory WBC title fiht is
at least a year away because Lewis's most recent vitory over
Evander Holyfield counted as a mandatory bout, meaning he does not
have to face the No. 1 WBC contender again until November unless he
chooses to. With more pressing engagements looming with both the
World Boxing Association's and IBF's top contenders, the likelihood
of anything breaking the logjam for Ruiz until the end of next year
is unlikely. So he has decided to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   That comes in the form of Scott, who just a year ago was the
WBA's No. 2 contender, although always a lightly regarded one.
Despite a 25-3 record, he is not considered a threat to Ruiz by
most boxing observers, except for the fact that men as big as these
are always a threat if they land a punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Johnny knocks him out in six rounds,'' said Ruiz's
manager, Norman Stone. ``But these are heavyweights. There's always
a risk. We just think it's worth the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny wants to prove to people he deserves to be the No. 1
contender. He's tired of hearing people question him. That's why he
suggested fighting Grant and it's why he's fighting Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Ruiz is fighting is to stay busy and to keep the WBC off his
back. WBC president Jose Sulaiman has been pestering Don King,
Ruiz's promoter, for some time in an attempt to force him to fight
another ranked challenger to keep his rating. Ruiz is not only
willing to do that, he's willing to do it with the No. 2-ranked
fighter, the highly publicized Grant.
</P>
<P>
   This is not unusual in boxing, it's unheard of. No one who gs to
No. 1 puts it on the line against anything but a cadave until his
title shot arrives. When it does, he takes his $1 million or $2
million payday and rolls the dice. But Ruiz is made of sterner
stuff than that.
</P>
<P>
   What he is hoping is that he will look spectacular on the
Showtime telecast in stopping Scott and thus improve his leverage
in trying to force Grant and executives at HBO to accept what he is
offering: a chance for the fighters to decide who should be the
WBC's No. 1-rated heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is refreshing,'' said HBO Sports senior vice president for
programming Lou DiBella, whose network has a long-term contract
with Grant. ``I don't believe John is a legitimate No. 1 guy, but I
understand how this works. It's not his doing. But I'm not willing
to pay him nd King $1.5 million when the fight isn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't worth it perhaps until Grant found himself nose-first
on the canvas two weeks ago in the first round of his fight with
Andrew Golota. Twice he went down, once on his pants and once on
his face, before rising up, taking a terrible beating for most of
nine rounds and then dropping a tiring Golota in the 10th. When
Golota got up, he simply quit, something he's done four times while
taking HBO's money (twice in his foul-plagued losses to Riddick
Bowe and again when he froze against Lewis and was destroyed in two
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   When that fight was over, Ruiz saw HBO analyst Larry Merchant, a
persistent critic of his ability, and told him, ``He wouldn't have
gotten out of the first round if I was in there tonight.'' Merchant
did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   So now Ruiz is hoping to have that chance in April, buthand his
handlers understand all that might be ahead of him is predicated on
avoiding a fate he's already experienced once in this Deep South
state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Ruiz was 14-0 and feeling good about himself when he
journeyed to Mississippi, a place that has never been kind to
Northerners. He was there to fight another up-and-coming fighter
named Sergei Kobozev. There was only one difference between them.
Stone was in Ruiz's corner. Les Bonnano, the fight's promoter, was
in Kobozev's.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who won the decision?
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz believes this shouldn't happen to him again because he is a
better fighter under any circumstance than Scott, who has not
fought since losing to journeyman Marvin Foster 13 months ago. More
important than that belief is the fact that he understands this
tuneup cannot turn into a need for an overhaul if he wants to get
Grant into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the other fights if we don't win this fight,''
Stone said. ``That's why as much as Johnny wants to fight Grant,
he's told us he doesn't want to hear his name mentioned until after
this fight. Even if we make the fight, he doesn't want to hear
Grant's name until he's done with Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that is clear because Ruiz knows what can happen
to a kid from Chelsea if he leaves Mississippi without a win again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory of that fight in Mississippi is in my mind,'' Ruiz
admitted. ``It happened to me twice (losing controversial
decisions). I understand I have to fight hard from the first bell
to the last bell. There's no such thing as a tuneup for myself. The
Grant fight is something I really want, but this fight with Scott
is t most important fight of my career. Without it, I can't get the
other ones''

   Frontiers in Marketing I: Not Just a Pretty Face &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The assignment: Find a marketing gimmick that can make a
business-to-business Internet start-up stand out from all the
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go for the old reliable celebrity endorsement, and
borrow a little sex appeal from a famous entertainer?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that is how RuPaul, of all people, happened to land
in Silicon Valley, of all places, last Tuesday: as celebrity
endorser for WebEx, a San Jose, Calif., company that provides
meeting services over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has a certain logic. There being no other towering
transvestite an average person may be able to name without
prompting, it is fair to say RuPaul knows a thing or two about
standing out.
</P>
<P>
   And dot-com start-ups have been successful with off-the-wall ad
ideas before. But where Outpost.com and others have tried bizarre
non sequiturs like imitation gerbils shot from a cannon, WebEx at
least squeezes a pun from RuPaul's presence: ``Meetings used to be
a drag.''
</P>
<P>
   WebEx said it would spend most of its $25 million in new venture
capital on the ad campaign.

COMING IN FROM THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM _ Back in the late 1960s, Robert Mundell was trying to
find a university where he would be comfortable. He was then
approaching 40. Having attended the London School of Economics,
Mundell received his PhD from MIT in 1956. He then caromed from the
University of Chicago to Stanford University to a couple of
European institutes and, in between, the International Monetary
Fund, before returning finally to Chicago, which he left after five
years of increasingly bitter feuding with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In a pique and facing a personal crisis of considerable
proportions, he then accepted a position at an unranked university
in his native Canada, the University of Waterloo near Kitchner.
Ontario. Whereupon a fellow economist famosly remarked, ``At last,
Waterloo has met its Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mundell received the Nobel Prize in economics, the
13th in a line of economists with close connections to the
University of Chicago to receive the award in the 31 years since it
was first given. Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Theodore
Schultz, George Stigler, James Buchanan, Merton Miller, Harry
Markowitz, Ronald Coase, Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Robert Lucas,
and Myron Scholes preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mundell had been among the first to glimpse the
possibilities of the revolution in the understanding of how
politics afcs economics that has unfolded during the past 25 years
-- the firs, it could be argued, in a certain sense -- he is
perhaps the last Chicagoan of his generation who will be recognized
by the Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for that, and they make an instructive story.
For Mundell is far better known to the literate public by a couple
of pejorative epithets _ as a supply-sider and as a gold bug _ than
as a technical economist.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel citation mentions two main contributions, both made in
the early 1960s. First, a series of papers explored the economics
of stabilization in ``open'' economies _ those in which capital
movements, to and fro, were freely permitted. Trade economics was
done virtually without money in those days, strictly in terms of
flows of goods and services. With a relatively simple model,
Mundell conclusively demonstrated that fiscal and monetary policies
inevitably would have very large and very different effects,
depending on whether exchange rates were fixed or floating.
</P>
<P>
   The point seemed somewhat academic in the early 1960s, when the
system ratified at Bretton Woods constituted the rules of the game;
it turned out to be ``almost prophetic'' in the 1970s (in the words
of the citation), after Bretton Woods broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1961, Mundell posed the question of an ``optimum
currency area'': for what reasons might a number of regions find it
advantageous to join _ or leave _ a common currency? The paper only
briefly mentions the advantages of widely-shared money; it
describes the disadvantages in far greater detail. Mundell was a
Canadian, after all, and had been profoundly struck by e ill-effect
on the provinces of the devaluation of sterling in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a time when sovereignty and a national currency were
simply equated and taken for granted, Mundell's paper got other
economists thinking, Ronald Mckinnon of Stanford and Peter Kenen of
Princeton in particular, according to the Swedes. In due course, in
other hands, monetary economists made the case for the introduction
of the Euro, for currency boards and ``dollarization'' in some
cases became compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedes also dwelt on Mundell's teaching. The years he spent
in Chicago _ from 1966 until 1971 _ were a period of great ferment
in economics, as a new generation sought to discard the short-term
one-thing-at-a-time analysis of their teachers in favor of a
dynamic ``general equilibrium'' approach. Mundell exhorted his
students to study the international economy's adjustments over
time, and they did. A sea-change in international economics was the
result.
</P>
<P>
   When his students honored him with a Festschrift _ a celebratory
book _ at the height of the Asian fiscal crisis in the fall of
1997, the best international economists of the next generation,
including Rudiger Dornbusch, Jacob Frenkel and Michael Mussa
presided. Meanwhile, their students dashed for the phones to make
sense of a crisis that, in strictly Mundellian terms, was not
supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   For all his brilliance, Mundell couldn't handle the rigors of
university life. He spun off into the wilderness for a time,
drinking heavily, his personal life a shambles. He bought a
decrepit castle in Italy. His intellect never failed him, however,
and brought a steady stream of visitors to Italy, often for
informal conferences of his own devising. In 1973 he was invited to
give the prestigious Marshall Lectures at Cambridge University; the
next year Columbia University hired him as a professor. After a
three-year interregnum, he was back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Columbia that he was discovered by Jude Wanniski, then
an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal, and eventually by
Robert Bartley, Wanniski's boss. Wanniski had been searching for
the world's greatest economist; Arthur Laffer, a former University
of hicago student serving in the Office of Management and Budget,
had told him about Mundell, who meanwhile had become convinced that
his most important contribution had been a little-noted IMF staff
paper published in 1962. ``The Appropriate Use of Monetary and
Fiscal Polict for Internal and External Stability'' had laid the
groundwork for the recipe of tax-cuts and gold standard that
Wanniski and Bartley soon enough were calling ``supply-side
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much is known with any confidence of him in these years.
Mundell must be the only Nobel laureate not to publish a curriculum
vitae. But from his list of publications his waning influence
within the profession clearly can be seen. His last appearance in a
refereed major journal was in 1965. A couple of books followed,
then many edited volumes, essays in collections edited by others,
articles in newspapers, bank letters, a working paper from the
Center for Economic Policy Studies of St. Vincent College in
Latrobe, Pa., an article in the premier issue of the Zagreb
Economic Journal, an so on.
</P>
<P>
   Did he consult to Paul Volcker after Volcker became cairman of
the Federal Reseve Board? ``I can't say I was a big buddy, but I
was an admirer,'' Volcker recalled last week. ``He called on me a
couple of times when I was in office. Nothing very momentous. I
will say he had a very useful skepticism: that floating exchange
rates would solve all problems, that competitive devaluations were
always the right approach (to trade imbalances.)'' At the height of
the policy debate in Washington in the early 1980s, Mundell
apparently was holding forth mainly to the Wall street Journal,
consulting to the Uruguayan central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell's rehabilitation has been underway for years. Former
students argued for the centrality of his work to present day
international marcroeconomics. Remarriage and a new baby stabilized
his personal life. Mundell continues to press his case for gold,
but in less dogmatic ways. ``For most economists gold goes in
teeth, around the neck or on the pinkie,'' says his friend and
student Dornbusch at MIT. ``In Mundell's rendition it has a more
central place as the monetary standard in a world otherwise without
an anchor. Whether he is quite serious about this is open to doubt.
He does like on occasion to be outrageous intellectually and
delights in leaving an audience baffled.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Nobel lecture, ``A Reconsideration of the Twentieth
Century,'' Mundell briefly surveyed the reign of gold over over two
millenia and then zeroed in on a century-long escape from the
``anonymous monarch'' that heretofore had facilitated the practice
of ``creave nationalism.'' Most of the talk was unexceptionable,
for Mundell is one of the leading living experts on the gold
standards. Only occasionally, when narrating the history of events
since the 1980s, did Mundell veer towards controversy, and then not
very far. He ventured that the leading source of instability in
monetary systems in the next century will be exchange rates between
the dollar, the Euro and the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Mundell's prescient radicalism in the 1960s can be
seen more carly in Mundell's 1968 book ``Man and Economics'' than
in any other single work. He wrote the book to argue the importance
of capital mobility to a lay audience. In it can be glimpsed the
deep skepticism of governmental motives later argued by James
Buchanan; the extension of economic analysis to unfamiliar
provinces of choice that is associated with Gary Becker; the
emphasis on expectations of Robert Lucas; on transaction costs and
externalities of Ronald Coase.
</P>
<P>
   When Torsten Perrson, professor of economics at Stockholm
University, presented Mundell to the audience at at the award
ceremonies, he congratulated him for having ``examined the ways in
which monetary and fiscal policy can be decentralized, by asking
how instability in the economy over time might be avoided....'' It
was tantamount to acknowledging that Mundell had anticipated,
however faintly, the new emphasis on the political aspects of the
economy _ and as close as anyone came all week to mentioning
``supply side economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobelists have been cranks before. There was Linus Pauling and
his preoccupaon with vitamin C, Theodore Shockley and his eugenics.
At one point Mundell last week mentioned that he hopes to use a
portion of his prize money _ it will be reduced from nearly $1
million to something like $500,000 after taxes if he pays New York
rates _ to create a foundation. Perhaps he will get those
conferences at his Italian castle going again. ``They were fun,''
recalls Paul Volcker, who attended a couple of them. ``You could
tell him what you thought of his ideas and he would tell you what
he thought of yours.''

JUDGE FAVORS DALLAS MEAT COMPANY IN USDA FIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A Texas meat processing company that is a major
supplier of ground beef to school lunchrooms won a temporary
injunction in federal court Friday, effectively preventing the USDA
from shutting down its meat grinding business because of salmonella
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks that salmonella in meat is a good thing,'' U.S.
District Judge Joe Fish said in extending an earlier restraining
order, ``but that's not what this case is about. The question is
whether the Department of Agriculture had the authority to do what
it did.''
</P>
<P>
   A final determination of the issues, he said, will be made at
trial next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Fish issued a temporary restraining order against
the government after the USDA pulled its inspectors out of the
Supreme Beef Processors Inc., plant near Fair Park in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken after the company flunked three consecutive
salmonella testing programs in the past year. It was the first meat
company in the nation to fail the salmonella test since tougher
standards were imposed in 1996. A slaughter house controlled by
Supreme Beef in Ladonia, Texas, also failed three rounds of similar
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Without the government inspectors, the company could not legally
sell its meat in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spiritas, CEO of the company, testified Friday that if
the restraining order were not continued, it would be difficult for
the company to remain in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It essentially shuts down the backbone of the business,'' he
said. About 180 of the company's 300 employees are involved in the
ground beef operation, which turns out nearly 600,000 pounds of
meat a day.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction hearing mostly centered on testing methods and
the risk to public safety if the plant continues to operate in
spite of the salmonella levels found in USDA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritas told the court that none of his company's beef has ever
been recalled and no illnesses were ever attributed to it. Supreme
Beef has been operating since 1971, he said. It currently supplies
about 15 percent of the 90 million pounds of beef the USDA
purchases annually for its school lunch programs.
</P>
<P>
   From 1907, when the Federal Meat Inspection Act was passed,
until 1996, inspectors worked mainly by touch, sight and smell to
cull potentially hazardous meat. In 1996, following fatal outbreaks
of meat poisoned by the E. coli bacteria, the USDA adopted
regulations that subjected meat to more scientific testing that
could detect harmful microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations allow fowl to be sold with higher levels of
salmonella than beef. Chicken passes inspection if salmonella is
found in 25 of 53 test samples; in turkey, the organism can show up
in 29 of 53 tests.
</P>
<P>
   A beef processor flunks if salmonella is found in more than five
of 53 tests, according to testimony at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney's for the company argued that salmonella, a one-cell
organism that appears in fruit, animals and humans, is a naturally
occurring substance and not an ``adulterant,'' and is easily
destroyed by proper cooking. Yet, it is estimated that it causes
550 deaths and 1.4 million illnesses a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gordon, an attorney for consumer groups that have sided
with the USDA, urged the judge to withdraw the temporary
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Supreme Beef wants to do is shift the responsibility (for
eliminating salmonella) to a 16-year-old kid flipping burgers in a
fast food restaurant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, the USDA withdrew its inspectors from the plant and
canceled its purchasing contracts with Supreme Beef. That same day,
the company obtained a temporary restraining order from Fish so
that it could continue grinding beef until the issues are heard in
court.
</P>
<P>
   In extending the restraining order, Fish noted that prior to
1996, all beef was ``distributed to consumers containing salmonella
because there were no standards'' and ``there were no outbreaks of
salmonella poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifting the restraining order, he said, would amount to the
``death penalty'' for Supreme Beef, a punishment he considered too
severe in the absence of a clear threat to public safety.

 &HT;    Hoping to attract more visitors, Georgia Music Hall of Fame in
Macon puts plans in motion
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 12.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ The numbers people must have seen something in
James Brown's red sequined suit that would-be visitors to the
Georgia Music Hall of Fame just haven't.
</P>
<P>
   When the hall opened here a little more than three years ago,
marketing analysts estimated that 250,000 to 350,000 people would
visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the analysts were optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Since the $8 million museum opened Sept. 21, 1996, the facility
has drawn about 233,000 visitors total _ an average of less than
78,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   But the low turnout doesn't seem to worry Hall of Fame director
Rob Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admissions are important,'' he said. ``But fortunately we're
not solely dependent on them. It's a nonprofit business, meaning,
simply, we're not supposed to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered,'' he added, ``I'm fine with where we
are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the hall hasn't met attendance projections, said Ruth
Sykes, communications director for the Macon-Bibb County Convention
&AMP; Visitors Bureau, the museum is still the No. 1 hook for Macon _
birthplace of Little Richard, home to Otis Redding's widow, former
headquarters for the Allman Brothers Band, and burial place of the
group's Duane Allman and Berry Oakley, both of whom died in
motorcycle accidents there. Said Deborah Robbe, a Georgia State
University business professor who advocated building the hall in
Atlanta: It takes ``a massive amount of marketing to attract
visitors to something like the Georgia museum. Especially because
of where it is'' _ in this central Georgia city 78 miles southeast
of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the museum's budget is subsidized by the state,
through direct subsidies, special tax allocations and grants. The
$7.50 admission has covered about 46 percent of the balance over
the three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers have improved each year here,'' Blount said.
``Where at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it's gone from a first
year of, like, 1.3 million to 500,000 by the third year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that far better known museum in Cleveland _ whose
spokesman, Tim Moore, affirms Blount's rough estimates _ has
attracted more than 2 million visitors in its four years.
</P>
<P>
   After 32 years, the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville has
passed the 10 million mark in attendance, including the 196,000
people that visited last year.
</P>
<P>
   But a fairer comparison for the Georgia museum may be with the
Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in Birmingham. About 500,000 visitors _
or 83,000 a year _ have seen the displays on Nat ``King'' Cole and
Sun Ra and His Intergalactic Space Arkestra since it opened in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated radio personality Tom Joyner has brought some of his
listeners to the Alabama museum, ``because I know some folks may
not wake up and say, `You know, I need a little excitement today. I
think I'll go to Birmingham.' You may have to be led there.''
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for Macon: It's not necessarily a destination spot
yet; a lot of folks visiting the museum happen to be in town for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeVinney of Atlanta came recently for a conference held at
the hall and ventured down to check out the exhibits. ``I didn't
have to walk far to see something great,'' she said, as she
listened to Sam Cooke recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta's Mike Latka and Jim Clark stopped in recently before a
big bikers convention. And 16-year-old Angela Snyder of Augusta
spent a day showing siblings Rebecca, 6, and Donny, 9, the exhibits
while Mom attended a conference.
</P>
<P>
   Snap. Sssnap. Snap-snap.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca kept somewhat awkward time with her fingers as Lena
Horne played in the headphones. Donny had barely left the museum's
first major stop, the Rhythm &AMP; Blues Revue, before he yelled:
``When are we leaving?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhh,'' dad Don advised. He'd read about the hall in the
newspaper, he said. ``It sounded like a good place to go, if we had
to come. I can't say it would be the reason to come'' to Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Londoner Roger Kirkham, in Macon for a cousin's wedding,
endorsed the 42,000-square-foot facility, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this museum has should be required viewing. Even though
there isn't a crowd here, it's not because what's here isn't worth
the attention. Georgia should be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud, but apparently not content.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blount said he's not ``disappointed'' with attendance
figures, the Georgia Hall of Fame, with help, has plans to attract
more visitors. Its strategy includes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A $1 million children's exhibit that opened in September. In
it, children in preschool through middle school take a musical tour
of the state, compose their own songs and tap on a king-size
keyboard like the one in the Tom Hanks movie ``Big.'' Blount said
the number of children visiting doubled to 2,204 in November
compared with November 1998. Kids do get in free but are usually
accompanied by a paying adult.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Keeps Calling Me Home: A Gram Parsons Retrospective
Exhibit.'' The display about the Waycross singer-songwriter, a
major country rock influence, runs through December. Over
Thanksgiving weekend, 2,002 people visited the hall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An online gift shop expected to be accessible on the hall's
Web site (www.gamusichall. com) sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A print marketing campaign in January by the Macon-Bibb County
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. Its tagline will be ``The Song and
Soul of the South.'' The Georgia Music Hall of Fame ``will be
prominently featured, because it is a critical part of our tourism
package,'' said communications director Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ``Let Freedom Ring'' exhibit that will open in February
and run for a month. It will include artifacts, text and historic
photographs that detail the Albany Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee Freedom Singers and the group's role in the civil rights
movement. It will also depict Georgia musicians who have effected
social change: Bernice Johnson Reagon, an original Freedom Singer
and a founding member of the a cappella group Sweet Honey in the
Rock, and R&AMP;B singer-songwriter Curtis Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-month marketing survey, the independent agency
hired by the visitors bureau found that when people thought of
Macon, they thought of music first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what (the museum) is doing and happy it's
here,'' Sykes said. ``Looking at the marketing estimates that were
made before it even broke ground, it's like, `What happened?!' But
that's what can happen when you have an organization come into a
new market and it bases its estimates on historical information
from other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when you compare what the hall has done in its three
years with the other attractions and destinations in the city, it's
done well,'' Sykes said. ``But yes, when you compare its attendance
to the numbers people expected, it does sound really crippling.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like what GSU's Robbe expected when she heard the Hall of
Fame was opening in Macon, not Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with an event in Colorado that was 2 1/2 hours away
from the major metropolitan city, so I know firsthand how very
difficult it is to pull these things off,'' says Robbe, who teaches

 &HT;    McCain lobbies to keep Cuban boy in U.S.
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A presidential order should be signed keeping 6-year old
Elian Gonzalez in the United States, Arizona Sen. John McCain said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this young man should be absolutely assured
that he will be able to live in freedom and not in slavery,'' the
presidential candidate said during a news conference at the popular
Versaille restaurant in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who was found clinging to an inner tube in the ocean
off Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Thanksgiving Day has become the
center of an international struggle. The boy's mother and
stepfather were among 11 people who drowned in their effort to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that his son be
returned to Cuba to live with him and his four grandparents.
Cuban-American leaders in Miami argue that the boy belongs here
where he is being cared for by his great uncle and great aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the father has any right to get his son back, McCain
said he is convinced that the father is not free to express his
opinion about what is best for his son as long as he remains in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious what the father would say,'' McCain said. ``That
the young man should enjoy democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Cuban President Fidel Castro should allow the boy's
father to come to the United States or ``to go to a neutral
country'' where he can make his feelings known without fear
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has expressed outrage at the refusal of the United States
to return Gonzalez's son. There have been mass demonstrations in
Cuba against the United States organized by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Manuel Slabarria said McCain's stand on the young boy
is the right one and it will help him with Cuban American voters.
``The mother made this an issue when she was willing to give her
life for freedom for her son,'' he said. ``This is an important
matter to us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did depart a bit from the more strident Cuban Americans
who say they want nothing to do with Castro until he is overthrown.
McCain said the United States should do the same thing it did with
Vietnam, slowly rebuilding relations over a numbers years with each
side taking small but significant steps toward the goal of working
together.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, McCain traveled to Pensacola, where he trained
to be a naval aviator after graduating from Naval Academy in 1958,
to attend a dinner to raise money for his campaign.

TRANSPORTATION BOARD TO CONTINUE EGYPTAIR INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After appearing eager last month to turn over the
investigation of the EgyptAir crash to the FBI, the National
Transportation Safety Board said Friday that it would hold on to
the case for at least another month and do a thorough
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said this was partly because they were looking for
a cockpit instrument that could confirm or refute their theory that
a co-pilot deliberately crashed the jet.
</P>
<P>
   American investigators still think that the crash, which killed
all 217 people aboard the New York-to-Cairo flight on Oct. 31, was
a deliberate act. But after weeks of trying to build an unequivocal
case from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, and
after complaints from Egyptian officials about the idea that the
crash could have been a murder-suicide, the board chairman, James
Hall, said in a statement Friday that investigators would produce a
full set of reports on all aspects of the crash, as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the transcript of the voice recording would be
released with the reports. Previously, board officials had
suggested that the transcript might never be released, because the
case would be handed over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the investigation would take at least until the
end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had said on Nov. 15, soon after the cockpit voice recorder
was retrieved from the water about 60 miles from Nantucket, that
the board was concentrating on whether the investigation was to
remain under its leadership. The board and other federal agencies,
Hall said, were ``committed to an early resolution to this matter
as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he said he would not publicly describe the tape,
because ``I do not believe this transcript can be characterized or
further described without adding to the speculation or misleading
the public about the contents of the recording.'' Other officials
said that this was because of disagreements about what the words
meant and differences of opinion about who said which words.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe, based on the tape and the flight data
recording, that a co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti, entered the cockpit
and replaced the co-pilot then scheduled to fly. Then,
investigators say, the captain briefly left the cockpit and Batouti
turned off the autopilot and put the plane into a steep dive.
American and Egyptian investigators are struggling to determine
whether the words exchanged between the captain when he returned
and Batouti represent an argument or an effort to save the plane.
</P>
<P>
   A salvage ship chartered by the U.S. Navy, the Smit Pioneer, is
expected to leave Quonset, R.I., on Sunday or Monday and begin work
at the site for two or three weeks. The investigators are
particularly interested in a part called a torque tube, which is
under the cockpit and connects the controls of the pilot and the
co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   They are concentrating on the part because the flight data
recorder showed that the elevators, the moveable panels at the back
of the horizontal tail, moved to different angles instead of in
unison, as they are supposed to. Investigators theorize that this
occurred because one pilot was pushing forward, to make the plane
dive, while the other pulled, to make it climb.
</P>
<P>
   The torque tube is designed to break if 50 pounds of force or
more is exerted in opposite directions. If that happened, the tube
should show rivets that were shorn off; if the elevators moved
separately because of a mechanical problem, the rivets would not be
shorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost inevitably, the wreckage will tell a story without a
spin, without a disagreement,'' one aviation official said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will also be looking for signs of any mechanical
flaw that could have caused the crash; there was no evidence of any
on the flight data recorder, Hall said. But, investigators say, the
elevators could have split if the controls became jammed, a
condition that the wreckage might reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Friday that audio engineers were continuing to analyze
the tape, but that ``no sounds have been detected that would be
consistent with mechanical failures or an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that safety board engineers, working with Boeing, had
programmed a 767 simulator with information from the flight data
recorder of the plane that crashed, to study the plane's movements.

IOC ETHICS COMMITTEE DRAWS MANY QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ As the International Olympic Committee
prepares to begin changing its procedures in the wake of the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal, serious questions were raised Friday
about the jurisdiction, intent and independence of its commission
to investigate ethical violations.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission, which includes a former U.S.
senator, Howard Baker Jr., and a former secretary-general of the
United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, announced Friday that it
would not initiate investigations of possible wrongdoing but would
require a written complaint before it began a review.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission also said Friday that it would not have
the power to discipline any members newly found to have committed
wrongdoing but would pass its findings on to the IOC's 11-member
executive board, which would decide on any punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission further indicated that it was unlikely to
consider any future disclosures of impropriety uncovered by a U.S.
Justice Department investigation of the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working for the future,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``We
are not particularly interested in what happened in the past. We
are interested in prevention. We are still discussing the principle
of nonretroactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the IOC has come under criticism for not being
sufficiently active after rumors of corruption in the Salt Lake
City bidding process became widespread. The IOC maintained that it
had no concrete evidence even after Toronto officials years ago
forwarded a lengthy list of improprieties and one of the
committee's own members, Phil Coles of Australia, helped write
dossiers about his colleagues' vulnerabilities that were
distributed to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Much uncertainty emerged at an evening news conference about
just how the IOC would handle any new evidence resulting from the
Justice Department investigation. Two indictments have been issued
so far, both related to allegations that Salt Lake City bid
officials arranged a sham job for the son of Kim Un-yong, a
prominent IOC member from South Korea. Kim received a serious
warning from the IOC executive board, which said that the case
could be reopened if new facts emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the IOC executive board said that the Kim
case would be handed to the ethics commission. In May, the ethics
commission handed the case back to the executive board. Then this
week, Francois Carrard, director general of the IOC, said that the
ethics commission would review any developments in the case. Not
so, said Keba Mbaye, an IOC member from Senegal who is chairman of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Servan-Schreiber, an IOC spokesman, denied that the IOC
was looking to pass the buck on new evidence arising from the Salt
Lake City investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a shell game,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``Maybe
there is some confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission has also been charged with developing a
code of conduct for the IOC, which did not have one for the first
century of its existence. Mbaye said the IOC's president, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, would still not be subject to the same rules
against accepting gifts from bid cities as other members are.
Samaranch was excluded from gift limits because he does not vote on
cities bidding for the Winter and Summer Games, Mbaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who nevertheless can exercise great influence on the
voting, was criticized for accepting expensive gifts from Salt Lake
City bid officials. They spent millions of dollars on cash
payments, scholarships, shopping sprees and other favors for IOC
members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Samaranch should have been included in the limits
on gifts to improve the IOC's tarnished image, Mbaye said, ``It is
up to the president to decide what he must do for his image.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbaye, a vice president of the International Court of Justice,
took issue with the ``culture of corruption'' label placed on the
IOC by American lawmakers. Ten members were fired or resigned in
the Salt Lake City scandal, and another 10 received warnings. The
IOC is currently composed of 102 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more widespread elsewhere than the IOC,'' Mbaye said,
referring to institutional corruption. ``The majority of the
members of the IOC are honest.''

MASSIVE EFFORT CREATED MEANINGFUL TRIBUTE TO FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON AND JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a spectactular scene, perhaps the largest firefighter's
memorial in US history: 30,000 firefighters and honor guards from
around the world, in full dress uniforms, marching in formation
down the streets of Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The thousand of spectators who watched them witnessed a somber,
dignified portrait of order: Men and women, in brass-buttoned navy
jackets and formal hats, silently honoring the six fallen Worcester
firefighters with crisp salutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the preparation for the most massive and moving tributes _
which featured President Clinton, Vice President Gore and a host of
dignitaries _ began just hours after news that the firemen had
answered their final alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The procession and ceremony was assembled in part by Boston
firefighters and the national firefighters' union in Washington,
D.C. _ two groups well experienced in the sad task of preparing
tributes for their dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was organized chaos,'' said George Burke, spokesperson for
the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, the
national union which helped organize the event. ``We did three
months' work in just three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve McDonald, spokesperson for the Boston Fire Department and
leaders of the state and national firefighters union were at a
retirement party in Boston when they heard six men were lost in a
fire at the Worcester Cold Storage &AMP; Warehouse Co.
</P>
<P>
   Just more than an hour after traveling to Worcester that night,
McDonald and other firefighters were on the phone with Burke,
planning for a possible memorial _ even as crews continued to fight
the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   As the news of the tragedy spread, McDonald said, professional
wrestlers performing at the Centrum Arena gave checks for $24,000
to officials at the Worcester Fire Department headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, Burke and two officials from the national
union office were on a flight from Washington to Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   They met with McDonald and his colleagues with a simple yet
monumental task: use their experience to create a stirring public
tribute to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the unofficial committee had helped planned
similar events after firefighters perished in Atlanta, Boston and
Stockton, Calif. Burke and his colleagues had coordinated a large
tribute two years ago for nine crew members who died fighting the
Hotel Vendome fire in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   And they knew that the Worcester Fire Department was too
burdened to do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, this is a very taxing situation for the locals,''
said Burke. ``They are hard at work trying to remove their brothers
from that tomb, they have to deal with the families, and in this
case there were six families.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning, city council members, Mayor Raymond Mariano
and Worcester public works and chamber of commerce officials were
brought into the process along with members of the city
firefighters' union.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, city leaders, the planning committee and local
firefighters agreed that the memorial service should take place on
Thursday in the Worcester Centrum. Six city firefighters were
assigned as liasons to each victim's family, explaining the event
and asking for their permission to stage it.
</P>
<P>
   The families were always involved in the planning, said
McDonald; one of the widows, he said, wanted a memorial service
instead of a full funeral because it would be too painful for her
sons often attend games or concerts in the Centrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to have all the families in agreement if this is
what they wanted,'' Burke said. ``If just one family member said
no, than we would have never had the memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers and phones, donated from local businesses, were
connected to conference rooms of The Crown Plaza Hotel in
Worcester, which became the nerve center of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the tragedy spread, it became clear from the flood of
condolence calls that the event would draw thousands of mourners
from across the country and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, union officials met with city leaders again to
discuss dozens of details: parking for the hundreds of buses
expected, the procession route, jumbo TV screens for the overflow
crowds, the logistics of shutting down New England's second-largest
city for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also began listing what they would need from the
Centrum staff: flowers, audio and visual equipment. The state fire
marshal's office donated radios so all could communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to put the word out.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, firefighters from Worcester and across the state
began calling their comrades. Web sites were set up and local
departments relayed information to their firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the grim search to find four bodies still missing in the
warehouse wore on, Worcester firefighters used donated cellphones
to make more calls, ensuring that every firefighter in every
department they knew of had the opportunity to attend.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday evening, the White House had confirmed that Clinton
would speak at the service. Gore, whom the local and national
firefighters' union had endorsed for president, also promised to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we knew Clinton was coming, that put a whole other
overlay to the preparation,'' said Burke. ``There were White House
staff and security considerations and all the things that go with a
presidential visit.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant everyone entering the Centrum had to pass through
metal detectors and security checks, and that the national media
would likely attend, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the event, the slate-gray arena stage was adorned
with flowers, polished yellow helmets and large color portraits of
each victim. Clinton and Gore both spoke privately to the families
and firefighters before taking their places on the stage, now fixed
with a podium bearing the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   The families took their places, and wave after wave of
firefighters silently filled the seats. As with any massive event,
the orderly appearance belied a few hitches.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald tells of how he had asked 30 honor guard members from
various departments to line the stage. However, 30 entire honor
guards of three to ten men each showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Quick thinking yielded a solution. McDonald directed the honor
guards to line the aisles of the arena instead.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Burke said, officials thought the Centrum would be
large enough to hold the 15,000 firefighters they expected. But at
least that many more were still marching down the streets to the
arena as the ceremony began.
</P>
<P>
   The overflow crowds watched the service on the jumbo TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the service started late and ran slightly longer than
planned, things seemed to run like clockwork. ``We were told it
turned out very well, but that is not our purpose,'' said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Said McDonald: ``It helps the family to know their husband that
died, or son or brother, that their life mattered, that the
community is taking the time to honor them in the right way.''

RUSSIAN SPY BUG WAS PLANTED IN STATE DEPARTMENT'S EXECUTIVE WING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russian spies managed to place a sophisticated
eavesdropping device in a conference room on the executive floor of
the State Department by removing a piece of wall molding and
replacing it with a nearly identical piece with the electronic bug
embedded inside, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they described the installation of a Russian
eavesdropping device in the headquarters of American diplomacy as a
serious breach of national security, investigators said they could
not help but marvel at the Russians' methods and audacity.
</P>
<P>
   With a skill that would do a high-priced interior decorator
proud, the Russians matched the style and paint color of the
molding so well that the bug, in a conference room just down the
hall from the offices used by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, was nearly undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   It was found only after a thorough search of the building by
investigators using a device that tracks down radio signals. The
exact location of the bug and how it was hidden were first reported
by ABC News and The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the sophisticated bug _ and the elaborate and
presumably time-consuming method of installing it _ have led
investigators to question low-level maintenance workers at the
State Department who may have helped the Russians, perhaps
unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine no one noticed when a hunk of the wall
was removed,'' said a department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the bug had been found in a piece of wooden
rail molding about halfway down the wall of a conference room used
by the department's oceans and environment division on the seventh
floor. The wing of offices used by Albright and her senior staff is
also on the seventh floor, although it is several hundred feet away
from the conference room and behind heavily fortified doors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that the conference room may have been
selected for surveillance because it was used on occasion by Russia
specialists who work in offices adjoining the oceans and
environment bureau.
</P>
<P>
   They said they believe that at least two trips were required for
the installation of the bug _ one to inspect and measure the
molding and another to install the new piece.
</P>
<P>
   Although they say it is unclear when the device was installed,
government officials said the bug was powered by a tiny battery,
and that the amount of power left in the battery would give them
clues to the date of the installation.
</P>
<P>
   They theorized that the Russians used the small, low-power
battery in an effort to defeat electronic surveillance equipment
that might have picked up signals from a higher-powered device. The
battery had so little power, however, that a spy was required to
linger just outside the department to listen to conversations going
on inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   In television interviews Friday, Albright insisted that the most
sensitive areas of the State Department were not compromised by the
listening device. ``My office and the most sensitive offices in the
State Department have not been penetrated,'' she said on Cable News
Network. Asked on ABC if anyone inside the State Department might
have helped the Russians, she replied, ``I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the most sensitive areas of the State Department
had been ``very carefully swept'' for bugs and that she had ordered
tighter security in the building long before the device was found.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian diplomat, Stanislav Borisovich Grusev, was arrested on
Wednesday after he was found loitering in a park across the street
from the State Department. Grusev has been identified by federal
authorities as a technical expert for the Russian foreign
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   In searching Grusev, officials said, investigators found a
remote switching device hidden in his clothing. The device turned
on a receiver and tape recorder in the car and a device designed to
detect electronic surveillance signals.
</P>
<P>
   Government authorities say that Grusev had been under
surveillance since last summer, when an FBI surveillance team
working on another case noticed him lingering outside the
department near his car.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian eavesdropping equipment installed inside
the State Department has been described as highly sophisticated,
Grusev appears to have been less so in his spycraft. He drove a car
with distinctive diplomatic license plates, and made little effort
to hide his presence outside the department.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe that he used the radio devices in
his car to activate the eavesdropping device, and would wait
nearby, hoping to overhear an important meeting in the
seventh-floor conference room.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that
oversees security at the State Department, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.,
announced that he would investigate the incident.

   NEW YORK _ Why do some NASDAQ stocks zoom and swoon each trading
day? And why do these moves seem wilder all the time?
</P>
<P>
   Although several factors contribute to the increasingly common
roller-coaster action in stocks, some veteran traders have an
intriguing theory about what's driving many of the moves. They say
many of the biggest price swings are a result of manipulation by
traders who place sizable orders to buy stocks on electronic
trading systems and withdraw them seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   This lures in other traders who, thinking a new buyer is in
town, jump in to ride what they hope will be a buying wave.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as unknowing investors pour into the stocks and drive
them higher, the pretenders have already withdrawn their bids and
are selling. The shares soon fall.
</P>
<P>
   Traders in New York call these phantom bids. In London, the
practice is called ``spoofing'' the market.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofing has increased substantially in recent years, traders
say, and is now a regular practice in many NASDAQ stock trades. The
National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs NASDAQ,
recently told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was
experiencing a big increase in canceled orders on its SelectNet
system, which connects NASDAQ market-makers. The jump in
cancellations is a concern to NASDAQ, because it taxes the capacity
of the system.
</P>
<P>
   J. Patrick Campbell, NASDAQ's chief operating officer, said he
did not believe that the increase signaled market manipulation or
that phantom bids influenced investor behavior. ``But there are two
sides to every story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One stock that a trader said was subject to phantom bids in
recent weeks is Diversinet, a developer of e-commerce technology.
The shares, which traded at $1.50 a year ago, peaked at $29 this
month. The stock opened on Friday around $19, spiked to $25 about
45 minutes later, quickly fell back and closed at $19.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofing the market is easier these days for three reasons.
First is the rise of electronic communication networks, which allow
traders to place orders anonymously and to cancel them immediately
with no consequence. The NASD system requires traders to keep their
bids and offers available to other investors for 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Propelling stocks this way is also easier because firms that
make markets in NASDAQ stocks are unwilling to commit big capital
to many stocks, instead limiting their exposure to 100-share blocks
at a time. Even a 1,000-share buy order can move the market.
</P>
<P>
   The growing use of computers to trade stocks is also helping
spoofers. Now that sophisticated trading equipment allows investors
to watch second-by-second changes in NASDAQ stock prices on their
screens, throngs of traders looking for a rocketing stock jump on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that volatility is near record levels in the
stock market today? Leuthold Weeden Research of Minneapolis says
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has moved up or down 1 percent or more on
39 percent of trading days this year. Only during the vicious bear
market in 1974 were stocks more volatile. That year, stocks moved
more than 1 percent on 45.1 percent of trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer Berman is a veteran hedge fund manager in Boca Raton,
Fla., who specializes in stocks. He says he is very concerned about
spoofing and the volatility that it creates. ``It destroys the
integrity of the market,'' Berman said. ``An individual investor
may gain at times, but in the end he'll lose because he'll get
caught in an issue that's falling.''

GENE THERAPY DISCLOSURE PLAN DISCUSSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Addressing heightened concern about the safety
of gene therapy experiments and the openness of the scientists who
conduct them, a government advisory committee on Friday debated
requiring researchers to make information about all patient deaths
public, whether related to the therapy or not.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement was reached on the plan, put forth by the
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the National Institutes of
Health panel that oversees gene therapy research. It was brought up
on the final day of a three-day meeting devoted to examining the
death of Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old Tucson, Ariz., man who in
September became the first person killed by gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear mandate for public discussion of adverse
events, to inform the public but also to inform investigators,''
said Dr. Lana Skirboll, who runs the Office of Science Policy at
the institutes. But she added, ``There will be some challenges
about what data we gather, how we manage that data and how we make
it accessible'' to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Those challenges were readily apparent Friday. The proposed rule
change drew criticism from the biotech industry, the American
Society for Gene Therapy and even some members of the advisory
panel itself. Dr. Robert Spiegel, chief medical officer for
Schering-Plough Corp., described the proposal as ``poorly thought
through.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how the committee can restore public trust in the
safety of gene therapy without duplicating the efforts of the Food
and Drug Administration, which regulates the experiments. The FDA
already collects so-called adverse event reports on patients who
have suffered side effects from gene therapy _ roughly 1,000
reports a year, according to Dr. Philip Noguchi, the agency's top
expert in the field _ but keeps the data confidential except in
unusual circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the RAC, as the advisory committee is known, is
to foster openness. The committee already has rules requiring
reporting, but it has learned in recent months that not all
researchers are complying with them. The proposal considered Friday
would require scientists to report more information, more quickly,
to the RAC than they report to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   It would also preclude researchers from classifying the reports
as trade secrets, as at least one company, Schering-Plough, has
attempted to do in the past. While that company's Spiegel said it
was no longer pressing the trade-secret issue, he argued that the
release of a flood of patient safety data might unnecessarily
frighten the public and result in ``a deluge of uninterpretable
reports.''
</P>
<P>
   That concern was shared by some members of the committee, who
worried that the panel has neither the expertise nor the manpower
to analyze the safety data. But Dr. Ruth Macklin, a bioethicist at
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y., and a
committee member, said that if the new rules were adopted, the
committee would also create a mechanism for reviewing the reports.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In part, Friday's debate was symbolic. Four years ago, the RAC's
authority was scaled back in a reorganization; with the death of
Gelsinger, the committee is now trying to reassert itself. It
reports to Dr. Harold Varmus, the director of the National
Institutes of Health. Karen Rothenberg, a bioethicist at the
University of Maryland who sat on the panel when the experiment
involving Gelsinger was approved, suggested Friday that the panel
might have greater authority if it reported directly to the
secretary of health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost the authority, what worried me most was that we
were establishing a perception with the public that we were able to
watch out'' for events like Gelsinger's death, she said. ``I don't
think we were. That's why I came back today.''

BRADLEY CANCELS FUND-RAISERS BECAUSE OF IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley yesterday cut short a West
Coast campaign swing because of an irregular heartbeat, forcing
cancelation of two Seattle fund-raisers and a rally scheduled for
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was being treated Friday night in California with a
small electric shock to the heart, a common treatment for a
condition called atrial fibrillation, said Tony Wyche, a campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wyche, quoting Bradley's cardiologist, described the condition
as an inconvenience rather than a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   The news about the former New York Knicks forward, who
campaigned Friday in Sacramento, caught his local campaign
organizers by surprise. A total of 80 people were expected at a
$1,000-a-person breakfast in Seattle hosted by technology executive
Keith Grinstein. A second Bradley fund-raiser, a $500-a-plate
brunch hosted by Starbuck's CEO Howard Schultz, was also canceled.
It had been expected to draw as many as 200 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be pretty damned sick. I've been with him when he was
ill and he simply plows ahead,'' said Tom Allison, a Seattle
attorney and leading local supporter of Bradley's bid for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., one of a half-dozen physicians in
Congress and a Bradley supporter, said the condition is not likely
to hinder Bradley's insurgent campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not life threatening,'' McDermott said. ``People like
(former President) George Bush have had it. Hakeem Olajuwon plays
basketball every day with it. It is correctable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancellation of Bradley's visit came just as Vice President Al
Gore's campaign was about to send out a news release designed to
blunt the fast-rising challenge by the former New Jersey senator
and .
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign statement announced that 31 Washington state
legislators are endorsing the vice president, including two
representatives who have switched after earlier backing Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's condition had not been disclosed prior to Friday's
brief hospitalization. ``It's not a major thing. It developed in
1996, in his final year in the Senate, so he's had it for a couple
of years,'' Wyche said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the fourth time Bradley has undergone the minor
electric shock treatment, technically known as cardioversion. The
treatment returns heartbeat to normal.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Bradley was put on an anti-arrhythmic drug called
Procanbid because the irregularity returned several times, as is
common. The candidate's condition was detailed in a letter from
Bradley's doctor, Robert Heissenbuttel, of Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center in New York, which was released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wyche said Bradley would spend the night in a hotel, and then
fly to Florida to resume campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million Americans suffer from atrial
fibrillation, a condition which occurs when the upper changers of
the heart (the atria) contract rapidly. They do not pump blood
adequately into the bottom chambers, the ventricles, which speed
up. It the irregular heart beat gets too rapid, people feel
discomfort in their chest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley felt the condition Thursday night, Wyche said. When it
did not go away yesterday, he decided to seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's brief hospitalization marks the first time in months
that Bradley has missed a beat. This week, two polls showed him
running ahead of Gore in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first
presidential primary. A third survey, released yesterday by the
Boston Globe, showed the two candidates in a dead heat.

IRREGULAR HEARTBEATS CAUSE BRADLEY TO CANCEL APPEARANCES

<P>
   Bill Bradley, a candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination, canceled an afternoon of campaign events and went to a
hospital in Northern California Friday after a bout of irregular
heartbeats, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, the director of communications for Bradley's
presidential campaign, said the irregularities corrected themselves
before Bradley, 56, received any treatment. He was expected to
spend the night in a hotel near San Francisco Friday evening and
plans to fly to Florida Saturday where he will resume his campaign
schedule, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley's irregular heartbeat, known as atrial
fibrillation, was diagnosed in 1996, during his final year in the
Senate. She said he has been taking medication to keep his
heartbeat regular for the past 18 months, and has suffered two
brief episodes since then, neither requiring hospital treatment.
Neither Bradley nor his aides had previously disclosed the
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors say atrial fibrillation can be brought on by
stress and lack of sleep, which are a part of every presidential
candidate's life, Ms. Dunn said that Bradley's condition would have
no impact on his ability to campaign. The pace of the campaign is
expected to speed up in the new year, as the candidates push toward
the first voting of the primary season, the Iowa caucuses on Jan.
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to change his schedule at all,'' Ms. Dunn
said Friday evening. ``This is not new. It is inconvenient, but
there is no reason for him to change what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Bradley had not felt woozy or experienced
shortness of breath from the palpitations, just ``minor
discomfort'' in the chest. She described him as ``irritated'' that
he had had to cancel his afternoon events.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday evening, only Bradley's top campaign aides, his
family and a few close friends were aware of the condition. Ms.
Dunn said the campaign had intended to notify news reporters about
the condition next week, when they said they were planning to
release a letter from his doctor summarizing a physical examination
Bradley underwent last week.

INTERNET COMPANY'S STOCK JUMPS 483 PERCENT ON FIRST DAY OF
TRADING 
</HEADLINE>

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another day, another Internet takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of FreeMarkets, an online auctioneer for industrial
products, jumped $232, or 483 percent, Friday on its first day of
trading to $280 a share the day after the price of VA Linux Systems
had an eightfold increase, setting the record for the first day of
trading of an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also rallied enough Friday to push the Nasdaq
composite index to another new high, its fifth since Thanksgiving.
The index rose 26.07 points, or 0.73 percent, to 3,620.24. the
index was led higher by Oracle, Global Crossing and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up 89.91 points, or 0.81
percent, to 11,224.70, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks, up 8.93 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,417.04, both closed
just below their recent highs. General Electric led both indexes
higher. Xerox's warning that fourth-quarter profits could be 40
percent below current forecasts came after the close of the New
York Stock Exchange. In after hours trading the stock fell almost
20 percent, to 19~.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming into the end of the year, and money managers
want to show that they are fully invested,'' said Timothy M.
Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp., especially if
they have been holding back cash because of concerns about year
2000 computer problems. So, he said, they are still snapping up the
most popular stocks, including those of technology, media and
communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he expects trading to slow in the last two weeks of
the year, however, because some firms have told their money
managers to do just that in case year 2000 concerns roil financial
markets near the end of the year. But he expects once the New Year
is under way, the stock rally will continue. ``It's off to the
races,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the jump in shares of FreeMarkets was less than of some
other new offerings it in no way diminishes the hot performance of
the Internet offerings this year. According to CommScan LLP, the
average first day gain of 279 initial public offerings this year
has been about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the report that the Producer Price Index for
finished goods rose just 0.2 of a percent in November helped push
bond prices higher and yields, which move in the opposite
direction, lower. The report showed that the core producer price
index for finished goods, which excludes food and energy prices,
was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32, to 99 16/32.
The yield fell to 6.16 percent from 6.21 percent on Thursday. The
yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to the threat
of Federal Reserve interest rate increases, fell to 5.91 percent
from 5.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued good news on inflation, Federal Reserve
officials have made clear recently that they are likely to raise
interest rates again if the economy does not slow significantly
from an annual rate of growth that could top 4.5 percent in the
fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PERVOMAISKAYA, Russia _ After enduring two months of thunderous
bombardments, a trickle of dispirited refugees straggled out of the
besieged Chechen capital Friday and made their way to the Russian
military checkpoint in the Tersky hills three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The checkpoint marks the end of an escape route or humanitarian
corridor that the Russians hope will lead to the evacuation of the
thousands of civilians still trapped in Grozny. Russia says it has
stopped bombing the city and has pledged not to attack the escape
route.
</P>
<P>
   To Khasan Dakayev, a 25 year-old who brought his family out of
Grozny Friday, the route out seemed more like a risky gantlet than
a safe passage. He spent weeks worrying that his family might be
shot by Russian soldiers, only to discover that they were
endangered by gangs of marauders who cruise the area, brandishing
automatic weapons and stealing food with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of the them,'' Dakayev said. ``They don't
hold anything sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russian troops surrounding Grozny, the predicament of the
city's civilians has become an urgent problem. Nobody knows for
sure how many civilians, who include ethnic Russians, still live in
the city. It was home to almost 400,000 people in the 1980s.
Russian estimates of the current civilian population range from
15,000 to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has been beseeching them to evacuate so it
can unleash an even more furious barrage against the several
thousand rebels hiding in the city. It has issued warnings and even
an ultimatum _ since postponed _ telling Grozny's defenders and
residents to abandon the city by Saturday or risk death.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian air force stopped bombing Grozny four or five days
ago, when the checkpoint was first installed, in the campaign to
get civilians to leave, Russian officials and Grozny residents said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Friday, however, around 400 people had passed
through the checkpoint since it was opened earlier in the week,
presenting the Russians and the increasingly anxious international
community with a vexing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Friday that he was in contact
with the government of the breakaway Chechen republic, led by Aslan
Maskhadov, and that he had met secretly a little more than a week
ago with one of its vice premiers. But there has been no indication
of a breakthrough, and the conditions in Grozny continued to
deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Set astride the river Sunzha and between two mountain ridges,
Grozny has long been a strategically important center. A Cossack
general built it as a fort in 1818 when he led one of Russia's
campaigns against the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The city sprawls across both sides of the river and was regarded
as one of the Soviet Union's more pleasant cities. During the
1994-1996 Chechen war and the current fighting, however, it has
been a ghastly battleground.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Refugees interviewed at the checkpoint Friday said that a
sizable population still lives in the city, many of them elderly.
They have had to spend long hours hiding in chilly cellars to avoid
Russian bombing, which has been far more intense than in the
1994-1996 war, but they also live in fear of gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the young people have left, but a lot of older people
have stayed,'' said Baudi Eltamirov, 62, who passed through the
checkpoint Friday. ``There are marauders in the Staropromyslovsky
district in northern Grozny. They call themselves militants, but
they come and confiscate all the food and kick people out of their
houses. They claim they have permission from Maskhadov to take what
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems, too. On Friday, a tank full of
chlorine and ammonia exploded in Khankala, a region on the eastern
approach to the city, near the airport. Russian military officials
at the Mozdok air base, northwest of Chechnya, said the blast had
unleashed a poisonous cloud and blamed the explosion on the
militants. They in turn pointed their fingers at the Russians;
there was no way to verify either charge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As terrible as life is in Grozny, leaving it is not a simple
proposition. The evacuation corridor runs from rebel-held Grozny
through a neighboring settlement at Pervomaiskaya, which has also
been occupied by rebels, to a kind of no-man's land and then to the
Russian checkpoint in the Tersky hills. Refugees are anxious about
making the journey, and Dakayev asserted that some militants had
fired at a column of refugees Friday.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Civilians pass through the Russian-controlled checkpoint in two
stages. At the first, the refugees are checked for weapons and
sniffed by dogs for narcotics. At the second, a few hundred yards
up the hill, information from their documents is logged into a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, refugees who do not have relatives to give them shelter
proceed to the northern part of Chechnya, which is under the tight
control of Russian troops. The Russians are erecting two tent
cities in northwest Chechnya to accommodate up to 4,500 refugees
from Grozny and from refugee camps in a neighboring republic,
Ingushetiya.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been easier for refugees from Grozny to travel
west through the lowlands to Ingushetiya. But the Russians do not
want to increase the number of refugees in Ingushetiya; they want
to return them to Chechnya, both for humanitarian reasons and to
demonstrate that the political situation in Chechnya is being
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   The corridor was inaugurated this week when an elderly man and
his wife walked up the hillside to see if the escape route was
safe. The Russians gave the man a car and told him to spread the
word that the corridor was open. But only four people initially
passed through, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to receive people on Tuesday, but we really did
not have anything to do until the next day,'' said Col. Sergei
Malyovanny, the Russian commander at the checkpoint. ``A lot of
people in Grozny are really scared. They have been told that
Russian soldiers shoot refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, more people began to arrive. On Thursday, the total
was 183, not including children. Friday some 200 had arrived by
early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even as refugees pass through the corridor, Russian troops are
preparing to seize Pervomaiskaya, through which the corridor runs.
Russian soldiers were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties in an
early battle there, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the town would enable the Russians to tighten their grip
on Grozny and move the checkpoints down from the hills, which would
make it easier for civilians to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians are not the only ones trickling out. Some militants
have been trying to leave, disguised as refugees, according to a
Russian lieutenant who would identify himself only by his first
name, Andrei. The lieutenant, at Primykaniye, a settlement 3 miles
east of Grozny, said that some militants have shaved their beards
but that the skin underneath is lighter than the rest of their
weather-beaten faces, giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoints, Dakayev said he had not seen any of the
thousands of leaflets dropped by the Russian air force, urging
people to leave immediately. He heard about the corridor on a
Russian-controlled radio station, ``Free Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Dakayev, an ethnic Chechen, said the Russian air and artillery
strikes were terrifying. So were the militants who would
pistol-whip civilians and raid their apartments for food, not that
Dakayev had any to share. He, his wife Larisa and two small
children had been surviving on crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children did not see bread for three months,'' he said, as
he pulled a stale crust from his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Having run the gantlet out of Grozny, Dakayev and his family
stood in the frigid winter wind as they waited to board a truck for
northern Chechnya, where they plan to live with his father. Still,
his brow was furrowed with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   As the family climbed into the truck, Dakayev plaintively ask
his Russian escorts a question: ``Is it safe?''

HARK! THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE RESTLESS IN EUROPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HILARY ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a victory for the underdog, and a harbinger of changing
times in Europe's boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Telecom Italia found itself having to scrap a plan
to split off its wireless unit, for a reason that until recently
barely made it onto the business radar in much of Europe: Angry
minority shareholders were howling that the plan trampled their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few years ago, Telecom Italia and its
controlling shareholder, Olivetti, would have met little opposition
from shareholders and could have easily rammed the deal through.
But new laws, new pressures and the growing presence of
American-style institutional money management in Europe are
changing the climate in favor of shareholders, who are asserting
themselves as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia learned that after announcing its plan in
September. Large investors objected in person to managers who were
touring Europe; some European and American investors wrote letters
urging Telecom Italia's directors to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Peter C. Clapman, chief investment counsel at TIAA-CREF, the
teachers' pension fund, was among those who went even higher. ``We
communicated our views to the Italian government that an action
that disadvantages minority shareholders will cause doubt as to the
credibility of the Italian marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the news media aired the complaints, management was boxed
in. ``Telecom Italia had the majority to vote in favor, but it was
very difficult to damage the minority because of the debate in the
media,'' said Fabio F. Galli, who heads the Milan office of
Assogestioni, the fund managers' association. ``We see that as a
major victory in the new climate.''
</P>
<P>
   The juggernaut known as the global market is responsible, in
several ways, for expanding shareholders' power in Europe. So much
of America's foreign investment capital has poured into equities in
Western Europe _ nearly $1 trillion, twice the total for the rest
of the world, according to the Securities Industry Association _
that American-style reverence for shareholder value and shareholder
rights has inevitably influenced the attitudes and priorities of
investors and companies alike.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to privatize state-owned businesses has compelled
governments to back away from interfering in corporate affairs and
to create legal environments attractive to foreign buyers. And the
introduction of the euro, the common European currency, makes
cross-border value comparisons easier.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are leading companies like Olivetti to conclude that
they ignore shareholders at their peril. Dario Trevisan, a lawyer
who represents minority shareholders on the Olivetti board, said,
``If institutional investors are not happy, you are not managing
your company well, because access to financial resources is not
easy at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In several countries, new laws are part of the trend. In 1998,
Italy made takeovers easier and use of defenses more difficult, and
encouraged companies to include an independent member elected by
minority shareholders on their audit boards.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, new legislation has loosened restrictions on voting
rights, strengthened auditors' independence and required companies
to disclose the existence of any board committees. The French
government is considering compelling the release of more details on
executive pay and requiring shareholder approval each time the
roles of chairman and chief executive are combined.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder rights groups have sprung up, meanwhile, as have
proxy research services. And European mutual funds and individual
investors, like non-European pension funds, are increasingly
speaking their minds at annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, however, European activism is just beginning. Most
European shareholders still habitually trust the management of
domestic companies and are reluctant to vote against them or their
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   They are even more passive with their foreign holdings, because
they find cross-border voting to be costly and time-consuming,
although many large American investors have found ways to do it
efficiently. Initiatives by shareholders are rare in France and
Germany, because only those with large stakes can propose them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In France, the asset managers' association adopted a set of
model governance guidelines last year that, among other things,
opposes poison-pill takeover defenses and unequal voting rights for
different classes of stock. The group has begun alerting members
whenever a resolution proposed by a major corporation breaches the
guidelines; this year, that has happened at 21 of the 31 largest
companies in France, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders are starting to respond to the activists' call to
arms. The French asset managers' group said 42 percent of its
members had voted against at least one management resolution this
year. American and French shareholders managed to defeat one of
them, a proposal for a poison pill at Rhone-Poulenc, according to
Stephen M. Davis, founder of Davis Gobal Advisors, a Newton, Mass.,
proxy research firm &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, DWS, the retail fund management unit of Deutsche
Bank, has been a leading voice for change among institutional
investors. ``Companies are queuing in front of DWS's door to get a
hearing,'' said Christian Strenger, who was chief executive of DWS
until last summer and now acts as an independent adviser to
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from shareholders, especially Deutsche Bank, may have
contributed to the resignation last week of the chairman of the
management board of Philipp Holzmann, the giant Frankfurt-based
construction company that was rescued in November from imminent
bankruptcy. An advocacy group representing individual shareholders
said that it will also press for the ouster of the chairman of the
company's supervisory board at a special shareholders' meeting in
February. Deutsche Bank was said by analysts to be pressing for a
sale or merger.
</P>
<P>
   One European country where shareholder rights have not gained
much traction is the Netherlands. At Dutch companies, supervisory
board members are chosen by the board, not elected by shareholders,
and ``corporations have every possible poison pill,'' said Eric G.
Coppieters, founder of Deminor, a Brussels proxy research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, though, the eight largest Dutch pension funds agreed
to form an association and send a representative to each major
annual meeting. Last October, the eight funds pooled their votes to
block an effort by the management of CSM, a food company, to limit
any single shareholder's vote to 6 percent of outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, CSM agreed to allow voting without restrictions
except in the case of a hostile takeover bid. ``It was a sign to
companies that the pension funds are a sector to reckon with,''
said Rene H. Maatman, general counsel at ABP, the largest of the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   More changes are coming, including simplified electronic voting,
expected to be introduced over the next few years in Britain,
France and possibly Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers expect European corporate governance to
retain significant differences from the American-British model. It
may be impossible for management to focus entirely on shareholder
value in countries like Germany and France, where other
``stakeholders'' like labor unions and local governments have
entrenched influence on boards.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the outspoken California civil service pension
fund, Strenger said: ``Calpers says shareholder value is the only
thing and the rest will follow for the stakeholders. In Europe,
there are more parties at the table, and they behave better if you
involve them early.''

PUTIN SOFTENS HIS BOSS'S CRITICISMS OF AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT details on Putin's peace talks.)  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin returned Friday from an official visit to
Beijing sounding more like a recidivist Soviet premier than a
president, having rattled Russia's nuclear saber at President
Clinton on Wednesday and denounced American culture, values and
military dominance before leaving Beijing Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But more intriguing, perhaps, is what Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin was doing in Moscow while he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin excoriated Clinton and the West for their complaints
about Russia's conduct of the war in Chechnya, Putin was busily
smoothing things over. He said that Yeltsin was not ``ushering in a
period of coolness'' toward Washington, that the United States and
Russia remained friends and that Clinton's criticism was no doubt
spurred by concern, not anger.
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin flew home Friday, Putin disclosed that he had been
in secret peace talks with representatives of the Chechen
government, which is led by Aslan Maskhadov. Russian generals
opened a public-relations front, accusing Chechen rebels of
employing chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kremlin's emergencies minister vowed to go to Chechnya
to ensure that civilians trapped in the conflict get safe passage
to Russian-built refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's willingness to revise and extend his boss' remarks
underscores his independence in Yeltsin's Kremlin, where two of his
predecessors were dismissed this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that Yeltsin was aiming his words at Russians
as much as foreigners. With a crucial parliamentary election due in
a week, it would not do for Yeltsin to meekly accept Western
dressings-down over a hugely popular war.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also indicate that Western attacks on human-rights
violations in the war are finally starting to sting, and that
Russia's leaders want to mollify their critics, at least with
soothing words, until they can secure a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Europe in particular has seethed over Russia's conduct of the
war and demanded peace negotiations, which Putin now indicates have
occurred, albeit unsuccessfully. The government's newfound concern
over refugees also addresses a major complaint of western critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Yeltsin's remarks in Beijing were scripted,''
said Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat in Moscow who is now a
Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington. ``He feels a lot of the pressure. And its sort of the
way Yeltsin's mind works _ he wants to lash out, to remind people
they're an important power.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Putin's reaction is a real one, too, that he may
have said things he shouldn't have said, and that we're trying to
walk it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin erupted in Beijing on Wednesday after Clinton said
Russia could pay a stiff price for the high rate of civilian
casualties in Chechnya. Yeltsin said Clinton seemed to have
forgotten ``what Russia is; that it possesses a complete arsenal of
nuclear weapons.'' And he added: ``It did not happen and will not
happen now that Bill Clinton would alone dictate to the world how
to live, how to work, how to rest. We will dictate how to live, not
him.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed that Friday with a joint Russian-Chinese communique
that fairly bristled with resentment toward U.S. policy. The
document criticized the ``negative momentum'' in international
relations and the ``uni-polar world'' and the ``single model of
culture, value concepts and ideology'' which it said the West was
forcing on the world.
</P>
<P>
   The communique said Russia and China would strengthen their ties
to counterbalance Western dominance, and the nations endorsed each
other's policies in two key trouble spots, Chechnya and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's condemnations of the United States resonated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin was absolutely correct in his logic, and this logic is
determined by internal political developments,'' Andronik
Migranyan, a political scientist and presidential adviser, said in
an interview Friday. ``The stakes here are already high. Russia is
trying to get rid of these terrorist bandits, to restore law and
order, and it is completely supported by the overwhelming majority
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   With a major election coming up, he said: ``You cannot respond
another way. Otherwise you are out; nobody needs you. He would have
been viewed as an idiot before his public, his army, his
government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is impossible to tell whether Yeltsin and Putin choreographed
their remarks as a good-cop-bad-cop routine or whether Putin, whose
prosecution of the war has made him a runaway favorite to succeed
Yeltsin, is simply feeling his oats.
</P>
<P>
   And it may not matter. In the wake of the performance, Clinton
revised his own remarks, somewhat softening his attack. The
European Union, opening its own summit meeting in Helsinki, toned
down talk of economic sanctions and diplomatic reprisals over the
Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin, in Uzbekistan, made clear that whatever benevolent
impression he had left, the war in Chechnya will continue as
before. ``The goals we set to uproot terrorism in Russia will be
reached,'' he said. ``We do not believe that the chosen tactics
should be changed.''

<P>
   Along the way, Pincay has accumulated a record-five Eclipse
Awards as the nation's top jockey. His mounts have earned more than
$206 million, trailing only McCarron and Day on the all-time list.
He has led the country in purses seven times. He has won four
Triple Crown races _ the 1984 Kentucky Derby aboard Swale and the
1982-84 Belmont Stakes on Conquistador Cielo, Caveat, and Swale,
respecively _ plus seven Breeders' Cup events. And he has piloted
such Horse of the Year champions as Affirmed in his post-Triple
Crown season of 1979 and Spend A Buck in 1985. He was inducted into
the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame in 1975 at age 28.
</P>
<P>
   But equally impressive are the countless claimers and
nonentities Pincay has somehow coaxed to victory when they probably
should have been pulling hansom carriages in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the Lou Gehrig of horse racing,'' said his agent of
nearly a cade, Bob Meldahl, employing an analogy the frustrated
baseball player would savor. ``He rides every day, whether it's
raining or cold, to give the fans every inch he can on a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   He has given much more than that, sacrificed much more than
that, experienced travails and tragedy almost as numerous as his
victories _ and that's not even counting the jockey's inevitable
physical toll: 12 broken collarbones, 10 broken ribs, two spinal
fractures, two punctured lungs, and two broken thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those an even footnotes compared to the devastation he
experienced in 1985 when his first wife, Linda, shot herself in the
head at home Jan. 18 and died a day later. A misdiagnosis had led
to a ruptured appendix, and as her intestines became ravaged by the
poison, Linda, 37, steadily deteriorated while seeking solace in
pills, painkillers, and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was in bad shape,'' said Pincay. ``She'd be up and
down _ fine one day, a wreck the next. She told me a couple of
times that she was a burden to the family, and I kept telling her
that wasn' so.''
</P>
<P>
   But she found no escape, and after she pulled the trigger,
Pincay lapsed into a massive depression punctuated by his own bout
with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a week, I thought of giving up racing,'' he
said. ``I just couldn't think about riding. But one day I woke up
and said, `I've got to take care of my family' '' _ daughter Lisa,
who last month gave birth to Pincay's first grandchild, and son
Laffit III. `` `I've got to do this for my family and myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was back in the saddle two weeks after Linda's death, and
later that year, he rode Spend A Buck to an epic victory in the
Jersey Derby that sewed up top honors for horse and jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay refused to let tragedy conquer him, just as he had done
two decades before with those intimidating horses. He came out of
the emotional tailspin ``by focusing even more on the job, working
horses, doing different things.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been happily married to Jeanine since 1992. The couple
has a son, 6-year-old Jean-Laff, ``and since then,'' said Meldahl,
``I've never heard him complain about a thing. Not the quality of
mounts, not the number of mounts. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was waging legendary battles with the scales, for
Pincay is a natural welterweight trapped in a lightweight's
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't riding, I'd say he'd weigh about 135,'' said
Meldahl, knowing that a jockey can't carry more than 117 pounds,
with gear. ``He's tricked his body.''
</P>
<P>
   But his body has fought back while Pincay has kept it crying for
more than the maximum 113 pounds he allows it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, the man universally regarded as the most
gracious and likable in his sport found himself embroiled in
regular fistfights with fellow riders _ not because of temperament
but the combination of diet pills and induced vomiting he employed
to control his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diet pills make you hot-tempered,'' he explained. ``I gave
it up in the mid-'70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Other diets proved less antagonizing but equally unsuccessful.
Pincay became a vegetarian for a while, ``but I didn't like the way
I felt mentally. I was always sleepy. My mind craved proteins.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two years ago with his career apparently in eclipse, he
struck upon the solution: a diet of 850 calories a day high on
fruit and fiber, and regular workouts in the gym. The noted sports
orthopedic surgeon Robert Kerlan once called Pincay ``the
best-conditioned athlete I've ever seen,'' and there are no
dissenters even now.
</P>
<P>
   Meldahl recalls an encounter at a Del Mar gym, Frog's, where a
fellow client noted Pincay's physique and said, ``You must be on
steroids.'' Pincay responded, ``I've never, ev taken a drug like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But his career was in need of a boost after he won only 75 times
in 1997. By then, the record that Pincay once had ignored _ ``great
athletes are too busy fousing on the task at hand to think of
long-range goals,'' said Meldahl _ was within reach, and the rider
was eager to get the chase over with. So he considered a move to
racing's Off-Off Broadway _ Northern California or Seattle. But he
decided to stay put, not wanting to cheapen the milestone, and he
has chipped steadily away at Shoemaker's target ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what people were going to say _ `If he stayed, maybe he
wouldn't have done it,' '' said Pincay. ``Plus, leaving my family,
just seeing them on weekends, would be too hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was one other consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do it in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday the old ballplayer got his wish.

PATRICK BEDFORD, 67, CO-STAR OF `UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE'  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ireland)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Bedford, who performed in many Broadway shows
and played opposite Sandy Dennis in the 1967 film ``Up the Down
Staircase,'' died on Nov. 20 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Patricia O'Haire, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, who was born in Dublin, Ireland, had lived and worked
in New York for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   He first came to the United States in 1966 and quickly won a
role in Brian Friel's play ``Philadelphia, Here I Come!,'' for
which he received a Tony nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He starred with Ms. Dennis in the 1967 movie version of Bel
Kaufman's novel ``Up the Down Staircase,'' in which he played an
English teacher in a troubled high school in a large city.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford's 30-year career spanned two continents and several
theater companies, including the Hilton Edwards/Micheal MacLiammoir
Dublin Gate Theater, where he performed in the works of Chekhov,
Shaw and Shakespeare early in his career; he also directed
occasionally. He was involved in more than 200 productions.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other notable roles were Nym in the film ``Chimes at
Midnight,'' Orson Welles' adaptation of several Shakespeare plays,
which was shown at the 1966 Cannes International Film Festival and
released theatrically in 1967 under the title ``Falstaff.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two brothers, John and Frederick, and two
sisters, Alice McGuinness and Cora Kelly, all of Ireland.

SURGING NUMBER OF PATENTS ENGULFS INTERNET COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>

 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All over the Internet, from the most popular search engines to
personal home pages, are buttons that offer to send users to an
online store where they can buy books or music or other
merchandise. Hundreds of thousands of sites have added these links
because they earn commissions if any of their users click on them
and then buy something.
</P>
<P>
   This week, those sites suddenly found themselves at risk of
violating a patent just granted to a New York company called
LinkShare Corp. That patent gives LinkShare the right to block
anyone from using such an arrangement for links between sites with
commission payments.
</P>
<P>
   The number of patents related to the Internet has been
skyrocketing. And Linkshare is just one of many companies now
receiving patents that cover not just narrow technological
improvements, but widespread techniques for doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of the wild, wild West on the Web,'' said
Stephen Messer, LinkShare's founder and chief executive. ``There
are laws that protect the pioneers from pirates who steal all of
their good ideas. Everything you love to do on the Internet will
have some sort of patent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Messer will not say how LinkShare will enforce its patent
rights. But in recent months a number of other Internet companies
have filed patent-related lawsuits on other mattersPriceline.com, for example, has sued Microsoft and its travel
service, Expedia, over Priceline's patented arrangement letting
customers name their price for flights and hotels. Yahoo has been
sued by an inventor who claims a patent on a shopping-cart feature
on its site. And DoubleClick Inc., a big Internet advertising
network, has sued two smaller companies over its patent on an
ad-targeting technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some suits are already changing the face of the Internet. Two
weeks ago, for example, a federal judge issued a preliminary
injunction barring Barnesandnoble.com from letting customers buy
goods with a single mouse click, a method Amazon has patented. (The
court's remedy requires Barnesandnoble.com customers to place
orders with two clicks rather than one.)
</P>
<P>
   These cases, and other quiet demands for royalties, have
instilled fear into many Web site operators who are surprised to
learn that techniques that have become commonplace in the short
history of the World Wide Web now appear to be one company's
exclusive property.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting patents on things that are too general,''
said Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo. ``It's not healthy for
patents to be used to stop other people from doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the surprise is that patent applications in the
United States are secret until they are granted. And the U.S.
Patent and Trademark office is only now approving applications
filed two or three years ago in the formative stages of the Web.
The office granted 1,390 patents related to the Internet in the
first half of 1999, compared with only 648 in all of 1997. The
backlog of applications is growing even faster, so the patent
office has hired 500 examiners in its software and Internet
section, nearly doubling its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the patent office is approving applications to patent
not just specific technologies but broad concepts it calls
``business methods.'' For example, Sightsound.com of Mount Lebanon,
Pa., says it has a patent on the entire concept of selling music
through digital downloads, one of the hottest trends on the
Internet. Sightsound has demanded that anyone selling music in
digital form online pay it a royalty of 1 percent. It is suing
CDNow, the online music store being acquired by Time Warner and
Sony, to assert that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Most other countries do not allow such wide-ranging patents. But
patent experts say the Clinton administration, seeking to bolster
the technology industry in the United States, has been increasingly
liberal in granting patents for both software and business methods.
And earlier this year, the Supreme Court affirmed a strongly worded
appeals court ruling that backed the administration's stand that
even the most abstract business methods can be patented.
</P>
<P>
   In an obscure section of the budget bill passed last month,
Congress moved to reduce the risk that companies will discover that
their business is violating someone's patent. Some patent
applications will be made public after 18 months, as in the rest of
the world. And companies will have a limited right to continue
using business methods, without paying royalties, if they employed
them before finding out that they had been patented.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many patent experts predict a flurry of Internet-related
patents over the next few years and a resulting flood of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a land grab out there,'' said Gary Eichhorn, chief
executive of Open Market Inc., an Internet software company that
holds patents on several key building blocks of online stores.
``It's not a surprise that these patents are being issued now. It's
a wide-open field, and a lot of smart people have been looking to
get patents as a strategic weapon or a strategic revenue
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Internet sites may be forced to pay
royalties to use some of the most popular features. And in some
cases, patent holders may keep some of the best ideas to
themselves, the way Xerox, for example, blocked competitors from
offering plain-paper copiers for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see some Internet companies become industry giants
because they can exclude others from doing what they do, just as
Xerox did,'' said Kevin Rivette, the chairman of Aurigin Systems,
an intellectual-property management firm.
</P>
<P>
   One company that became a giant because of its intellectual
property was the Gemstar International Group of Pasadena, Calif.,
which owns a series of patents related to electronic program
guides. Indeed, TV Guide Inc. found its prospects of moving online
so threatened by potential litigation that it agreed earlier this
year to be acquired by Gemstar for $9.2 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the more ambitious efforts to develop patentable ideas
for electronic commerce was undertaken by Jay Walker, the owner of
a magazine subscription company, who in 1992 set up a think tank of
business executives and patent lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw an opportunity to invent entirely new methods of doing
business for the digital age and we could own them,'' Walker said.
He invested $20 million in the lab, called Walker Digital. So far
it has received 30 patents and has 300 pending. One of the ideas,
now patented, turned into Priceline, in which Walker holds stock
worth $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Walker Digital is hoping to come up with ideas to license to a
wide range of industries. Its most recent patent is for vending
machines that sell things by subscription: For example, a
soft-drink machine in an office building could have a Web site that
would sell a dozen cans in advance; that way people would not need
change when they wanted a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Walker rejects criticism that ideas like Priceline are too broad
to be subject to patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information revolution isn't some minor thing, it's a big
deal,'' he said. ``Our patents are no different than the patents
granted after the invention of electricity caused a revolution in
how industrial processes worked.''
</P>
<P>
   This thinking, however, is anathema to the pioneers of the
Internet, many of whom emerged from academia, with a culture based
on the free exchange of ideas and information. Even now, with much
of the Net's cooperative culture drowned out by the value of stock
options, many executives believe that speed rather than patents
determine success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my three years here, I don't think I've spent half an hour
thinking about what I could patent,'' said Stuart Wolff, the chief
executive of Homestore.com, the largest real estate Web site.
Wolff, a physicist who worked for Bell Labs and IBM, received his
own patent on an aspect of computer memory technology, but he says
the Internet is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas are cheap,'' he said. ``Execution is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivette argues that this sort of thinking has led companies to
lose rights to some of the most valuable inventions on the
Internet. The magazine Wired, he said, could probably have patented
the idea of the banner advertisement, the now-ubiquitous graphical
rectangles on Web pages that, when clicked, take a viewer to the
advertiser's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, patent experts say, eBay, the online auction house,
missed the opportunity to patent its method of combating fraud by
having buyers and sellers post ratings of each other, opening its
market to competition from the likes of Yahoo and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Patent lawyers say Internet companies are now much more likely
to file for patents than they were a few years ago, if for no other
reason than to have weapons in reserve to fend off potential patent
suits by others.
</P>
<P>
   Some patent experts argue, however, that ultimately the courts
will rule that the Patent Office has been too liberal, and that
they will invalidate many of the broader Internet patents. A patent
can be challenged in court with the argument that the invention is
not actually new, or that it is a development so incremental that
it was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of these patents are vulnerable to a claim that
applying a well-worn business technique to the Internet is not
sufficiently novel,'' said James Pooley, a lawyer with Gray Cary
Ware &AMP; Freidenrich of Palo Alto, Calif., who defends companies
against patent suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the recent patent lawsuits have already had a
chilling effect on some companies.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Escalate Inc., a new Silicon Valley company
backed by James Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape,
which is building computer systems to operate online stores on
behalf of other companies. Keng Lim, the chief executive, said the
company had developed its own one-click-buying software but decided
not to offer it to customers for now because of the Amazon patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some stuff, like one-click, that is so fundamental
that I don't think it should be patentable,'' Lim said. ``But we're
a young company and we don't want to get into a lot of legal
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Escalate has filed for a patent of its own, however, that would
allow online stores using its system to display merchandise geared
to what the customer has bought in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But Lim said this application is more useful for marketing now
than any potential intellectual-property rights later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patents pending are a good way to convince potential partners
they should work with us,'' he said. ``But how you win is by
gaining market share, not technology. We'll be a success or a
failure long before the patent is issued.''

BRADLEY HALTS CAMPAIGNING TO TREAT HEART IRREGULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Bill Bradley was put on hold
Friday, when he canceled all appearances in California and
checkedhmsf into a hospital because of an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley aide said the former New Jersey senator ``felt a
little different'' Thursday night from the heart condition. Bradley
hoped the condition, which was first diagnosed in 1996, would
correct itself as it has in the past, and attended a campaign event
Friday morning in Scramento.
</P>
<P>
   But by the afternoon, Bradley checked himself into a hospital
near Palo Alto, Calif., and met with cardiologist Dr. Edward
Anderson. According to a campaign spokeswoman, Bradley expected to
receive a mild electric shock to the heart, a treatment he had
received in the past. But Anderson said that before Bradley arrived
at the hospital, ``he had converted to a normal heart rhythm and no
therapeutic action was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters expecting to see Bradley in nearby Berkeley were instead
read a statement by the candidate. Bradley, 56, was remaining
overnight in California, but not in a hospital, aides said. He has
canceled his appearances in Washington state Saturday, but plans to
resume his schedule Sunday, with a trip to Orlando, Fla., to
address the state Democratic Party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Heart specialists said the condition should not hamper Bradley's
campaign, while the candidate's aides quoted his doctor as saying
the condition ``does not in any way interfere with his ability to
function.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of his condition, which had not been disclosed until
now, will bring new scrutiny on the candidate. Political analysts
said voters would be watching Bradley carefully in the coming days,
concerned with whether he can manage the strain of the campaign
trail, let alone the presidency
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a problem anytime a presidential candidate has a
health problem that requires hospitalization,'' said Darrell M.
West, a political science professor at Brown University. ``Voters
will be asking, `Can this guy handle the rigors of the job?' ''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College in California, said voters would be concerned only if the
heart problem is a serious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a minor problem, then it shouldn't have a serious
impact,'' sad Pitney. ``After all, we reelected Dwight Eisenhower
after his health problems in the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower had suffered a major heart attack. So did Lyndon B.
Johnson, when he was Senate majority leader in the 1950s. Johnson
was elected vice president in 1960 and then president in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But when former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas ran for
president in 1988, he provided an overly rosy picture of his health
after a serious batle with cancer. Tsongas died after a relapse in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Tsongas experience has led many candidates in recent years
to release detailed medical records in order to prove that they are
healthy and physically capable of holding the highest office in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Arizona Senator John McCain released his medical
records in order to refute whispered suggestions that he may have
suffered mental impairment because of his 5 1/2 years in a North
Vietnamese prison camp. He also reported removing a cancerous mole
from his shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation, an irregular beat of the heart's upper
chambers, is a common condition, affecting at least 2 million
Americans. It can be caused by many ftors, such as overactive
thyroid (the cause of former President Geore Bush's atrial
fibrillation), high blood pressure, and some medicines. But most of
the time, specialists said, there is no known cause.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike potentially deadly ventricular fibrillation, which
affects the heart's main pumping chambers and was linked to the
death of basketball player Reggie Lewis, the condition that Bradley
has is usually not life-threatening. The main risk, specialists
said, is that a clot will form within the heart because atrial
blood flow stagnates. Even a tiny clot in the left atrium can cause
a stroke if it migrates to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, patients with persistent atrial fibrillation
are routinely put on blood-thinning drugs. Sometimes a short
electrical shock is used if the atrium does not spontaneously
revert to normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deeb Salem, chairman of medicine at New England Medical
Center, said Bradley's atrial fibrillation is likely to be ``a
minor inconvenience'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James E. Muller, director of cardiology research at the
Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed: ``There are many people in
important positions who have atrial fibrillation,'' Muller said.
``If all he has is AF, it is not a significant factor in his
capability to perform the job of president.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Bradley's cardiologist was similarly describing
his condition as ``more of an inconvenience than a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also released results of the recent
physical exam, which showed no ther sign of disease and no
structural damage to the heart. The exam reported about a
half-dozen inciden of atrial fibrillation since 1996, three of
which were treated with a mild electric shock. Bradley was also
prescribed Procanbid to prevent or shorten the duration of the
episodes, without side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ice President Al Gore's campaign had good wishes for a speedy
recovery. ``Our hearts and thoughts and prayers are with Senator
Bradley,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Bradley is to travel to Claremont, N.H., to meet
McCain and shake hands on the need to overhaul the campaign finance
system. On Friday, he is scheduled to meet Gore in a forum at
Daniel Webster College in Nashua.

LEE INDICTED IN CASE OF STOLEN NUCLEAR SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury in New Mexico indicted a
nuclear weapons engineer Friday on 59 counts of illegally removing
highly classified design, construction and testing data from the
Los Alamos weapons laboratory where he was employed.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that the engineer, Wen Ho Lee, had
violated the Atomic Energy Act and Foreign Espionage Act,
assembling collections of 19 computer files containing some of the
country's most closely held nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arrested Friday afternoon at his home outside of Los
Alamos by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He made an
initial appearance at the federal courthouse in Albuquerque and,
after prosecutors described him as a flight risk, a federal
magistrate ordered him held without bail pending a detention
hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused Lee of transferring classified
information into unclassified computer files at the Los Alamos
laboratory and downloaded other material onto portable tapes. The
indictment said that seven of the tapes that Lee had made,
containing critical nuclear secrets, could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   Although the indictment accused him of mishandling nuclear data,
the charges did not accuse Lee of spying or of any espionage
offenses related to a foreign government. But the most serious
offenses, removing classified nuclear weapons data, are punishable
by a maximum of a life sentence in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher of Los Angeles, issued a
statement saying that the charges against Lee were ``groundless''
and that federal prosecutors were ``wholly unjustified in
suggesting that Dr. Lee is a flight risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said that Lee had been unfairly singled out because of
he is a Chinese-American and charged that ``prosecutive decisions
in this case have been influenced by other branches of
government.'' His complaint was an apparent reference to charges by
Lee's supporters that the scientist had been turned into a
scapegoat by law enforcement and energy officials who have been
criticized by Republicans in Congress for security lapses at the
country's nuclear weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Friday to the U.S. attorney in Albuquerque, John J.
Kelly, Holscher said that Lee would submit to a polygraph
examination about what the lawyer said were Lee's repeated
statements that he had not mishandled the computer tapes or turned
them over to any third party.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that prosecutors will accept Lee's offer. In the
past Lee has voluntarily taken government polygraph examinations,
which are not admissable as evidence, and has given some answers
about his activities that appeared to be deceptive, law enforcement
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment did not allege that Lee gave the material to
another country or any unauthorized person or government, but it
did charge that he removed classified nuclear weapons data ``with
the intent to injure the Untied States and with the intent to
secure an advantage for a foreign power.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment did not explain how the government would prove
Lee's intent and at a news conference in Albuquerque, Kelly
declined to discuss what evidence the government had obtained that
would demonstrate Lee's motives.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Lee's case has been the focal point of a furious
debate within the cloistered worlds of counterintelligence, law
enforcement and nuclear science and Friday's charges are unlikely
to quell that controversy, particularly within scientific circles.
Since Lee was fired from his job in March, some scientists have
said he was selectively punished because other researchers had
sometimes removed classified information without being severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee was charged with 29 counts of removing and tampering
with restricted data, 10 counts of retaining restricted data, 10
counts of gathering national defense information and 10 counts of
unlawful retention of national defense information under the
Federal Espionage Act.
</P>
<P>
   With its lengthy list of serious felony charges the government
left little doubt that prosecutors concluded that Lee was
responsible for what some counterintelligence officials regarded as
the most serious breach in security at the weapons labs in the
country's history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in the politically charged debate over U.S.-China relations,
the indictment seemed to further stir the controversy about Lee's
case and whether he could be blamed for what government officials
said was the loss of a vast store of secret data sufficient to
alter the world's strategic balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   But after a security investigation dating back to late 1994,
investigators have been unable to uncover concrete evidence that
Lee passed any nuclear secrets to China or any other government.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old, Taiwan-born, naturalized American citizen who
had worked at the country's weapons labs for 20 years had been
under suspicion in an inquiry into Beijing's suspected theft of
technology known as W-88, the design for the United States' most
advanced miniaturized nuclear warhead. Lee was fired from his job
at the weapons lab in March.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were unable to determine who was responsible for
the W-88 loss or even whether Chinese scientists might have
acquired the technology on their own. But counterintelligence
authorities continued to investigate Lee on circumstantial grounds
that he had access to some of the information and had traveled to
China on scientific exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1997, FBI investigators, anxious to step up their
inquiry into Lee, sought the permission from attorney general Janet
Reno to begin covert electronic surveillance. But Reno's
intelligence aides refused on grounds that investigators had failed
to show that Lee was spying for a foreign power.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, the Justice Department Office of Intelligence
Policy Review found the FBI's justification for electronic
monitoring too nebulous and dated to warrant such intrusive
methods.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year when Lee agreed to a voluntary search of
his office and home, agents uncovered evidence that he transferred
weapons data to nonsecure computers _ the first indication of the
massive removal of information at the center of Friday's
indictment.

BOY LIKELY TO BE RETURNED TO CUBA, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Gobe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 6-year-old Cuban boy rescued from an innertube and caught in
a raging custody battle since his ill-fated voyage to Miami is
unlikely to remain in the United States, according to immigration
policy analysts and family-law attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between Elian Gonazalez's father in Cuba and his
paternal great-aunt and great-uncle in Florida has unleashed an
emotional tug of war between Cubans and Cuban-Americans on the
opposing sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of thousands of people have protested in Cuba,
heeding Fidel Castro's call to support the boy's father, exiles in
Miami have bombarded the city's radio and TV talk shows to urge
immigration officials to let the boy stay with his Florida
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a child who lost his mother while bringing her child
to freedom,'' said Carmen Morales, one of five lawyers working for
free in support of Elian's relatives in Miami, who said they
believe the boy would be better off in the United States. ``We are
not against the father. We are against Elian growing up under a
totalitarian regime.''
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers for the US relatives petitioned Friday in federal
court to block Elian's return and to file for political asylum for
him with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, their efforts
are unlikely to overcome US law and international agreements that
normally require children to be returned to their closest living
relative, legal alts say.
</P>
<P>
   The US Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act considers the
parental relationship inviolable, so long as the parent isn't
abusive or neglectful, said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the
University of Miami Youth Law Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is no provable claim that the father is not
fit, the child should be expeditiously returned,'' Perlmutter said.
``They should be united without delay. The father's rights under
decades of Florida law, constitutional law, and international law
are clear. His rights are paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal procedure in custody cases of unaccompnied refugees is
that US officials return the children to the living parent or
guardian, said Dan Kane, an INS spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   US immigration officials in Cuba have already delivered a letter
to the communist-run government, he said, seeking to confirm
whether 32-year-old Juan Miguel Gonzalez is, indeed, Elian's
biological father. ``It's impossible to say what will be the final
outcome of Elian's case,'' Kane said. ``We have to talk to the
father.''
</P>
<P>
   International agreements such as The Hague Treaty, which Cuba
has not signed, support the argument that Elian should be returned
to his father, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of parental abduction, which Cuban officials claim
is what Elian's mother did while trying to escape the island, the
treaty says children should be returned to their native land.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials, however, have not confirmed this was a case of
kidnapping. And this is anything but a run-of-the-mill custody
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   What it is is one more battle in four decades of ideological
skirmishing between the United Staeand Cuba, where emotion and
politics often supersede reason and law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the US government, I can tell you, they're not debating
the law on this, they're debating what this might do to Al Gore's
presidential campaign,'' said Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton
administration adviser on Cuba, who now teaches at Georgetown
University. ``They're worrying what would happen if Castro
unleashed another wave of rafters. They're worrying what would
happen if the immigration accords collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1960s when thousands of Cubans fled as Castro
swerved his revolution toward communism, Cuba has wrangled with the
United States over its policy that nearly automatically awards
Cubans residency if they survive the trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after Castro gave Cubans a green light to leave and
some 35,000 Cubans set sail for Miami, the United States changed
its policy.
</P>
<P>
   The US Cuban Refugee Act, commonly known as the ``wet-foot,
dry-foot policy,'' declared that those Cubans picked up at sea
would be returned to Cuba, while those who touched US land could
apply for residency. Cuba, for its part, would try to restrain its
citizens from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two countries meet every six months to discuss
immigration policy. The next meeting is scheduled for Monday in
Havana. But many Cuba analysts say they expect Castro to cancel the
meetings in protest of the US government's handling of Elian's
case.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Elian is comfortable in Florida, flying his new toy
airplanes through the air or smashing his new Tonka trucks into one
another on national news broadcasts may not matter.
</P>
<P>
   Independent attorneys familiar with the case say, whatever Eli's
wishes, the law will force the boy to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last analysis, it's not really that complicated,'' said
David Abraham, a law professor who specializes in immigration
issues at the University of Miami Law School. ``He should be
returned to his father. Cuba may be a miserable place, but there's
no way to say that misery equates to the political persecution of a
6 year old.''

<P>
   Along the way, Pincay has accumulated a record-five Eclipse
Awards as the nation's top jockey. His mounts have earned more than
$206 million, trailing only McCarron and Day on the all-time list.
He has led the country in purses seven times. He has won four
Triple Crown races _ the 1984 Kentucky Derby aboard Swale and the
1982-84 Belmont Stakes on Conquistador Cielo, Caveat, and Swale,
respectively _ plus seven Breeders' Cup events. And he has piloted
such Horse of the Year champions as Affirmed in his post-Triple
Crown season of 1979 and Spend A Buck in 1985. He was inducted into
the Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame in 1975 at age 28.
</P>
<P>
   But equally impressive are the countless claimers and
nonentities Pincay has somehow coaxed to victory when they probably
should have been pulling hansom carriages in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the Lou Gehrig of horse racing,'' said his agent of
nearly a decade, Bob Meldahl, employing an analogy the frustrated
basa player would savor. ``He rides every day, whether it's raining
or cold, to give the fans everyinch he can on a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   He has given much more than that, sacrificed much more than
that, experienced travails and tragedy almost as numerous as his
victories _ and that's not even counting the jockey's inevitable
physical toll: 12 broken collarbones, 10 broken ribs, two spinal
fractures, two punctured lungs, and two broken thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't even footnotes compared to the devastation he
experienced in 1985 when his first wife, Linda, shot herself in the
head at home Jan. 18 and died a day later. A misdiagnosis had led
to a ruptured appendix, and as her intestines became ravaged by the
poison, Linda, 37, steadily deteriorated while seeking solace in
pills, painkillers, and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was in bad shape,'' said Pincay. ``She'd be up and
down _ fine one day, a wreck the next. She told me a couple of
times that she was a burden to the family, and I kept telling her
that wasn't so.''
</P>
<P>
   But she found no escape, and after she pulled the trigger,
Pincay lapsed into a massive depression punctuated by his own bout
with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a week, I thought of giving up racing,'' he
said.``I just couldn't think about riding. But one day I woke up
and said, `I've got to take care of my family' '' _ daughter Lisa,
who last month gave birth to Pincay's first grandchild, and son
Laffit III. `` `I've got to do this for my family and myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was back in the saddle two weeks after Linda's death, and
later that year, he rode Spend A Buck to an epic victory in the
Jersey Derby that sewed up top honors for horse andockey.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay refused to let tragedy conquer him, just as he had done
two decades before with those intimidating horses. He came out of
the emotional tailspin ``by focusing even more on the job, working
horses, doing different things.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been happily married to Jeanine since 1992. The couple
has a son, 6-year-old Jean-Laffit, ``and since then,'' said
Meldahl, ``I've never heard him complain about a thing. Not the
quality of mounts, not the number of mous. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was waging legendary battles with the scales, for
Pincay is a natural welterweight trapped in a lightweight's
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't riding, I'd say he'd weigh about 135,'' said
Meldahl, knowing that a jockey can't carry more than 117 pounds,
with gear. ``He's tricked his body.''
</P>
<P>
   But his body has fought back while Pincay has kept it crying for
more than the maximum 113 pounds he allows it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, the man universally regarded as the most
gracious and likable in his sport found himself embroiled in
regular fistfights with fellow riders _ not because of temperament
but the combination of diet pills and induced vomiting he employed
to control his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diet pills make you hot-tempered,'' he explained. ``I gave
it up in the mid-'70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Other diets proved less antagonizing but equally unsuccessful.
Pincay became a vegetarian for a while, ``but I didn't like the way
I felt mentally. I was always sleepy. My mind craved proteins.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two years ago with his career apparently in eclipse, he
struck upon the solution: a diet of 850 calories a day high on
fruit and fiber, and regular workous in the gym. The noted sports
orthopedic surgeon Robert Kerlan once called Pincay ``the
best-conditioned athlete I've ever seen,'' and there are no
dissenters even now.
</P>
<P>
   Meldahl recals an encounter at a Del Mar gym, Frog's, where a
fellow client noted Pincay's physique and said, ``You must be on
steroids.'' Pincay responded, ``I've never, ever taken a drug like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But his career was in need of a boost after he won only 75 times
in 1997. By then, the record that Pincay once had ignored _ ``great
athletes are too busy focusing on the task at hand to think of
long-range goals,'' said Meldahl _ was within reach, and the rider
was eager to get the chase over with. So he considered a move to
racing's Off-Off Broadway _ Northern California or Seattle. But he
decided to stay put, not wanting to cheapen the milestone, and he
has chipped steadily away at Shoemaker's target ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what people were going to say _ `If he stayed, maybe he
wouldn't have done it,' '' said Pincay. ``Plus, leaving my family,
just seeing them on weekends, would be too hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was one other consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do it in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday the old ballplayer got his wish.

PINCAY'S LONG RIDE FINALLY BRINGS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ His pursuit of history was over but his
workday wasn't. Laffit Pincay Jr. now had the cherished record for
most career victories by a jockey, but he also had two more races
to ride, two more obligations to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing _ not the delirious pomp and circumstance that had
just taken place along the Hollywood Park track after the sixth
race Friday afternoon, not the video tributes from a constellation
of fellow jockeys, not the champagne showers, not the spectacular
glass equine trophy and gleaming white Porsche he had received
while the trumpet flourishes of ``The Olympic Theme'' resoundingly
serenaded him in the background _ and most of all, not his 8,834th
career win, which knocked his idol, Bill Shoemaker, out of the
sport's annals _ was i to keep Pincay from his appointed rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd considered begging off after bagging the record
with his 2-length win aboard Irish Nip in an otherwise forgettable
1-and-one-16th-mile, $35,000 turf race for maidens 3 years old and
up, Pincay said, ``Not really. I don't want to disappoint anybody.
These guys want me to ride their horses, and I can't let them down.
That's the way I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why there was something to this epic moment beyond
mere statistical singularity. That's why Hall of Fame rider Chris
McCarron of Dorchester, Mass., came to the track on his day off,
drove the car that the Southern California tracks presented to
Pincay, and was positively beaming when he``This is the most
exciting thing I've ever been involved with in my life. Everybody
thinks that muc of Laffit Pincay. The guy is an icon. He's a
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is as beloved as he is successful. Even
Shoemaker _ who surpassed Johnny Longden's record of 6,032
victories in 1970 and rode his last winner in 1990 _ was rooting
for his challenger. In a wheelchair since a 1991 auto accident
rendered him a quadriplegic, Shoemaker was on hand for the
festivities _ just as he had been the day before when Pincay tied
him aboard I Be Casual. He savored the achievement with Pincay
during the official press conference following the last race, after
Pincay had taken care of business by finishing eighth aboard Storm
Dog in the seventh and eighth on I Gotcha Covered in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any feeling about the record,'' said Shoemaker,
68. ``I had the feeling that Laffit was the guy to do it. He's been
a greafriend, a credit to racing. He's stayed with it through ups
and downs. I'm very proud he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's day for the ages got off to an inauspicious start when
he finished last in the first race aboard Demidoll, third on Tart
in the second, and third atop Flying Journey, who pulled up lame
after crossing the finish line in the third.
</P>
<P>
   His major concern at that point was typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to have everybody come out here to see the show and
have to come back the next day,'' he told the media. ``I didn't
want you to have to keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Wearing the yellow, green, and white silks of
Parfet, Parfet &AMP; Sheffield Farm Inc. and with a red saddlecloth
portentously bearing No. 1 on the 3-year-old bay colt trained by
Richard Mandella, Pincay and Irish Nip engaged in a duel around the
grass oval with Quiet One, Kent Desormeaux up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the eighth pole, I thought I finally had him,'' said
Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   And when he broke the wire, Pincay said, ``I felt great, like I
just won the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   He's won that, along with just about every other major race, in
a 35-year career that he stubbornly prolonged even when it seemed
some trainers were ready for him to ride off into the sunset a
decade ago. He endured through assorted injuries, unyielding
scales, and the suicide of his first wife almost 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His family _ second wife Jeanine and his three children _ were
there toshare the glory Friday. They watched as he was surrounded
by the Hollywood jockey colony _ whose idle riders had been rooting
for him in the jockeys' room during the sixth _ and accorded video
tributes by the luminous likes of Mcaon, Gary Stevens, Eddie
Delahoussaye, Pat Day, Sandy Hawley, Jerry Bailey, Jorge Velasquez,
Braulio Baeza, Angel Cordero, and the 92-year-old Longden. They
joined a crowd of 5,855 in admiring the bouquet of red roses he
received to go with the blanket of yellow and white flowers that
draped Irish Nip.
</P>
<P>
   And they listened as Pincay said he would celebrate with ``a
piece of steak and maybe a glass of wine'' _ a veritable feast for
this perpetual weight watcher.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be having him home full-time in the near future.
Pincay, who has ridden 44,649 mounts and at 52 is the oldest jockey
at a major US track, indicated he'll keep going for another year or
two.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he may have set the bar at 9,000 winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has a nice ring to it,'' he said. He just as easily could
have been encapsulating his career.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite his roots in Panama City, Pincay's long ride to
immortality began almost by default. Laffit Pincay Sr., who
abandoned the family for Venezuela when the boy was 2, was a jockey
and trainer, but neither genetic inheritance nor even osmosis came
into play for his namesake. Laffit Jr.'s passion was baseball. He
aspired to be Mickey Mantle, not Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid playing Little League, that was all I thought
about,'' he recalled Friday in the jockeys' room before post time.
``That was all I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for his career aspirations, Pincay topped out at 5
feet 1 inch, and he found no shortage of discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept telling me, `Why not be a jockey like your father?
You're too small to be a baseball player,' '' he said. ``After I
kept hearing it, I thought,Why not? Maybe they are right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One thing was for sure _ he knew his future didn't lay in
scholarly pursuits. ``I didn't have the the patience to sit still
and read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So _ why not? _ Pincay began going to the track at age 15. He
encountered one immediate problem, akin to a batter who dreads a
fastball in tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid of te horses,'' he said. ``They were big, mean. I
was afraid they might bite.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the resolve that has become his signature, he took a
deep gulp and conquered the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't be scared if I wanted to be a jockey,'' he
said. ``Little by little, I got over it. I got more used to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that he took a flier at the Panama Jockey School run
by Bolivar Moreno, who imparted one bit of indelible wisdom: ``You
never know when you're going to need your fitness to win a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay has lived by that credo ever since. ``I was always doing
something,'' he said. ``Jogging, running, climbing stairs. All
kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the time he left Moreno's tutelage, Pincay's ambitions
were hardly extravagant. He merely wanted a steady job to help him
and his mother, Rosario, now 76, escape the poverty of Panama
City's slums.
</P>
<P>
   Then something entirely unexpected and grand happened. Pincay
kept getting to the finish line ahead of the field _ first aboard
Huelen at Panama's Presidente Remon on May 19, 1964. Soon he was
his country's leading apprentice, and his horizons expanded
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started winning a lot in Panama,'' he said, ``I thought
I could come to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He did in 1966, as a ctract rider for Fred Hooper at Chicago's
Arlington Park. Lo and behold, he found things no different on a
bigger stage. He guided his first US mount, Teacher's Art, to
victory, and the pattern continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I kept winning at Arlington, I went to New York,'' he
said. ``Just me and my agent. We didn't know anybody. We started
winning for Frank Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't stopped, on either coast, at any level.

SUPPORTERS OF LEE RESPOND TO INDICTMENT WITH ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:45 p.m.) 
(With CHINA-SPYING-RDP and related stories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Wen Ho Lee reacted to his indictment
Friday with anger and dismay, while a former high-ranking
government lawyer said the charges arose at least partly because
Lee is of Chinese descent and the current political climate
``demonizes China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to proving Dr. Lee's innocence and his being
exonerated of all charges,'' the law firm of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, in
Los Angeles, said in a statement. The firm said the government had
spurned repeated efforts by Lee to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said it was ``deeply troubled'' by the government's
position that Lee, 59, a former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, should be held without bail to await trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Justice Department is blatantly overreaching
and wholly unjustified in suggesting that Dr. Lee is a flight
risk,'' the law firm said, asserting that during the three years
Lee has been under investigation he has cooperated fully.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a former government lawyer, Hoyt Zia, said the
indictment of Lee was ``part of the witch hunt'' spawned by a
political atmosphere that ``demonizes China.''
</P>
<P>
   Until several months ago, Zia was chief counsel for export
administration in the Commerce Department. He is now executive
director of the Pacific Telecommunications Council, an organization
that promotes information services in the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Zia, a former Marine Corps officer who is of Chinese descent,
said he occasionally had to prove his loyalty as an American in
situations in which a Caucasian would not have been so burdened.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-count indictment returned Friday does not accuse Lee of
espionage, or of deliberately passing secrets to another country.
Rather, it accuses him of tampering with or altering classified
information on nuclear weapons while that data was on a computer
system at Los Alamos, and of unlawfully transferring some of that
information to unsecured computers.
</P>
<P>
   Zia said that even assuming that there was evidence of
``technical violations'' by Lee, ``a lot of people have done at
least as many violations as he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Zia noted that the CIA suspended the security clearance of its
former director, John Deutch, in August after concluding that as
director he had improperly handled national secrets on a desktop
computer in his home during the 18 months he headed the agency
before resigning in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of clearance meant that Deutch could no longer serve in
an advisory role to the agency, even though there was never a
suggestion that he intended to do anything traitorous. The
investigation found only that he had left secrets vulnerable to
spies or computer hackers _ a point that Deutch acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's case has been attended not only by questions about the
nature of his security violations, if any, but whether he has been
treated differently because of his race. He is a naturalized
American citizen who was born in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos said in
August that he thought Lee was unfairly singled out for scrutiny
because of his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief, Robert Vrooman, said that ``a lot of
Caucasians'' were not investigated, even though they had access to
weapons secrets and saw some of the same people that Lee saw.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman himself was criticized by investigators for allowing
Lee's continued access to nuclear secrets, and Vrooman's assertions
of bias were denied by investigators.

TURKEY IS INVITED TO APPLY FOR SEAT IN EUROPEAN UNION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ The European Union Friday accepted Turkey as
a candidate for membership, reversing a thumbs-down vote two years
ago, which was based mainly on Turkey's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Membership, which is probably many years down the road, would
mark the entry of the first Muslim country to the European Union.
Turkey, which has long sought closer ties to Europe, is already a
member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The economic and political union also agreed to a plan to bring
in more of the formerly communist nations of Eastern and Central
Europe, in the latest step to expand to the borders of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Alarm over Russian moves in Chechnya colored the summit
conference of the 15-nation bloc in Helsinki. The national leaders
put out a statement condemning the bombardment of cities in the
territory as ``totally unacceptable'' and threatening to cut
assistance to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the European Union would review its common
strategy on Russia, apply trade terms more strictly, suspend some
provisions of a partnership agreement and shift funds from a
technical program to ``humanitarian needs'' created by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey readily welcomed the European offer. ``There might be
details we find hard to accept,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said
in Ankara, ``but in general the acceptance of our candidate status
on equal conditions is a great success for Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Turkey has pursued European validation for years, it
balked at some of the terms for its admittance Friday, and Javier
Solana, the union's new foreign policy chief, was sent to Ankara to
clarify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going there just to explain what has been agreed by the
E.U. summit,'' he said on leaving Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   To join, Turkey will have to make sweeping political and
economic reforms and abolish its death penalty. Its neighbor Greece
lately indicated its willingness to reconsider allowing Turkey to
join it in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Lipponen, the prime minister of Finland, current holder of
the organization's rotating presidency, expressed hopes for a
positive response and said Ecevit had been invited to the
concluding lunch of the summit conference here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Malta were
the countries gaining preliminary consideration for membership
Friday. They fall into line behind six others already negotiating
entry _ Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least three years before the first of them become
full members, and it may be decades before all of them do. Under
the new plan, the E.U. will expand to 28 member states by 2025,
representing a population of 500 million people.

FRANJO TUDJMAN, EX-COMMUNIST GENERAL WHO LED CROATIA'S SECESSION,
IS DEAD  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A longer version of this story will move as TUDJMAN-OBIT.) 
(js) 
 By DAVID BINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Franjo Tudjman, the onetime communist general who as a
reborn nationalist led Croatia in 1991 into secession from
Yugoslavia, and from there to independence and war, has died,
Croatian state television announced early Saturday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of Croatia, the founder of the independent
Croatian state, has died,'' the government announced in a special
newscast about 2 a.m. The report did not say when he died or give a
cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But Tudjman had been hospitalized since Nov. 1, when he
underwent emergency surgery for what was described as a perforated
intestine. He had been gravely ill in recent weeks and on life
support machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman had undergone treatment for cancer at the Walter Reed
military hospital in Washington in November 1996. There were
reports in Croatian newspapers this March that cancer had spread to
his brain and that he had undergone radiation on a tumor under the
supervision of French physicians in Zagreb, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Vlatko Pavletic, the parliamentary speaker to whom presidential
powers were transferred on Nov. 26, delivered a brief statement on
television Saturday morning. He said that Tudjman's contributions
to the Croatian people were ``undeniable'' and that he would remain
a ``symbol of determination.''
</P>
<P>
   In joining and then leading an age-old separatist drive for
Croatia's independence, Tudjman (pronounced TOODGE-mahn)
contributed heavily to the collapse of the Yugoslav Federation of
six republics _ and indeed to the defeat of the whole concept of
South Slav brotherhood, whose founding fathers had included leading
Croatian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.5 million Croats paid a heavy price: In the second half of
1991 more than 8,000 Croatian civilians and soldiers were killed
and more than a quarter of the republic fell under the control of
indigenous Serbs who feared domination. Some 200,000 Croats were
uprooted from their homes, a third of the country's factories were
ruined and a $4-billion-a-year tourist industry largely collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand more ethnic Croats were killed in fighting with
Bosnian Muslims in 1993 and early 1994 as a result of Tudjman's
determination to create a homogeneous Croatian enclave in
Bosnia-Herzegovina that he eventually hoped to incorporate into his
state. That drive was blocked by U.S. intervention and mediation in
February 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman was one of the three ethnic leaders at the Dayton, Ohio,
talks convened by the Clinton administration in late 1995 to end
the Bosnian conflict, along with the Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic and the Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's governance of Croatia came under extremely harsh
criticism by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which accused him in a detailed report of harsh treatment
of his country's remaining Serbian minority, suppression of the
press and failure to cooperate with the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Three distinct phases characterized Tudjman's life: as a World
War II Partisan officer, as a much-criticized historian and as a
politician. His life was full of contradictions. He was an
enthusiastic Yugoslav patriot who became an equally enthusiastic
Croatian nationalist. He was an ardent Communist who became an
ardent anti-communist. He was an atheist who gained the support of
the Catholic Church hierarchy in Zagreb and later in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman is survived by his wife, Ankica; two sons, Miroslav and
Stjepan; a daughter, Nevenka Kosutic; and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's style of rule included a heavy dose of public
appearances exhaustively covered by the state television channel.
``In the Croatian media his cult is much bigger than Tito ever
had,'' said Mihajlo Mihajlov, a Yugoslav scholar who shared
dissident platforms with Tudjman in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As president the burly, silver-maned Tudjman emulated Tito down
to his white commander in chief's uniform (replete with nine medals
he awarded himself in May 1995), and his enjoyment of Tito's yacht
and Tito's vacation palace on Brioni Island.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdan Denitch, a Serbian historian with Croatian citizenship,
wrote in ``Ethnic Nationalism'' in 1994 that Tudjman ``had all of
Tito's vices and not a single one of his virtues.''

   NEW YORK _ Another day, another Internet takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of FreeMarkets, an online auctioneer for industrial
products, jumped $232, or 483 percent, Friday on its first day of
trading to $280 a share the day after the price of VA Linux Systems
had an eightfold increase, setting the record for the first day of
trading of an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also rallied enough Friday to push the Nasdaq
composite index to another new high, its fifth since Thanksgiving.
The index rose 26.07 points, or 0.73 percent, to 3,620.24. the
index was led higher by Oracle, Global Crossing and Microsoft.

   The Dow Jones industrial average, up 89.91 points, or 0.81
percent, to 11,224.70, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks, up 8.93 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,417.04, both closed
just below their recent highs. General Electric led both indexes
higher. Xerox's warning that fourth-quarter profits could be 40
percent below current forecasts came after the close of the New
York Stock Exchange. In after hours trading the stock fell almost
20 percent, to 19~.

   ``We are coming into the end of the year, and money managers
want to show that they are fully invested,'' said Timothy M.
Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp., especially if
they have been holding back cash because of concerns about year
2000 computer problems. So, he said, they are still snapping up the
most popular stocks, including those of technology, media and
communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he expects trading to slow in the last two weeks of
the year, however, because some firms have told their money
managers to do just that in case year 2000 concerns roil financial
markets near the end of the year. But he expects once the New Year
is under way, the stock rally will continue. ``It's off to the
races,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the jump in shares of FreeMarkets was less than of some
other new offerings it in no way diminishes the hot performance of
the Internet offerings this year. According to CommScan LLP, the
average first day gain of 279 initial public offerings this year
has been about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the report that the Producer Price Index for
finished goods rose just 0.2 percent in November helped push bond
prices higher and yields, which move in the opposite direction,
lower. The report showed that the core producer price index for
finished goods, which excludes food and energy prices, was
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32, to 99 16/32.
The yield fell to 6.16 percent from 6.21 percent on Thursday. The
yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to the threat
of Federal Reserve interest rate increases, fell to 5.91 percent
from 5.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued good news on inflation, Federal Reserve
officials have made clear recently that they are likely to raise
interest rates again if the economy does not slow significantly
from an annual rate of growth that could top 4.5 percent in the
fourth quarter.

 UNDATED: last week.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors say atrial fibrillation is, in and of itself, usually
not a serious condition and can be kept in check with drugs. It can
be an indication, however, of underlying heart problems and can
lead to an increased risk of strokes. Consequently many people with
the condition take blood thinning drugs to protect against clots.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley's doctors have told him that he has no
cardiac problems. She also said he is not taking any anti-coagulant
drugs, an indication that Bradley's doctors think he is at a
minimal risk for a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush also suffered from atrial fibrillation,
which came to light in 1991 when he was rushed to a hospital after
feeling heart palpitations while jogging at Camp David, Md. Bush's
condition had been brought on by Graves' disease, which causes the
thyroid gland to produce too much hormone.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bradley, a star basketball player with the New
York Knicks between 1967 and 1977, has worked out at least three
times a week, usually on a treadmill or stationary bike, Ms. Dunn
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter summarizing a physical Bradley underwent on Dec. 3,
Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center said that other than his irregular heartbeat, Bradley had
``no other health issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been evaluated and found to have nonstructural heart
disease,'' Heissenbuttel wrote in the letter, which Bradley's
campaign released Friday night. ``When you have atrial
fibrillation, you note an irregular heart beat, but have no other
symptoms. Thus, this rhythm does not, in any way, interfere with
your ability to function.''
</P>
<P>
   Heissenbuttel also wrote that Bradley's heart irregularities had
no known cause.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that Bradley's blood pressure was regular and
that he had passed a stress test. The letter also disclosed that a
``small benign polyp'' had been removed from Bradley's colon in
April. It said there was no evidence of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley first began to notice the most recent
palpitations on Thursday night after a day of campaigning in Los
Angeles. But one of his cardiologists, Dr. Edward Anderson of Palo
Alto, told him to wait 24 hours to see if the arrhythmia would
correct itself before seeking treatment. So he decided to continue
on to Sacramento and conduct his full day of campaigning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, he went to a fund-raiser in Sacramento, followed
by a press conference, an editorial board meeting at The Sacramento
Bee, then drove to Berkeley for another fund-raiser. But by early
Friday afternoon, the palpitations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   So at around 3 p.m., Bradley went to Sequoia Hospital in Redwood
City where he was met by Anderson. But before any treatment could
be performed, the palpitations stopped, Ms. Dunn said. He remained
in the hospital for at least an hour longer under the observation
of Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also canceled two fund-raisers in the bay area. And he
will miss a campaign trip to Seattle on Saturday, where he was to
hold a rally with Mayor Paul Schell, a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn refused to disclose where Bradley was staying
overnight, saying she wanted to protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment for an attack of irregular heartbeat is a mild
electrical shock known as a cardioversion. Between 1996 and 1998,
Bradley had four episodes of atrial fibrillation and received
cardioversions twice.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, he began taking the drug Procanbid to keep his
heart beat regular, Ms. Dunn said. Since then he has had three
bouts of fibrillation, including Friday's, none requiring shock
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Heissenbuttel said, ``the medication has been
effective in preventing or shortening the duration of episodes and
has been well tolerated with no side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Procanbid can cause nausea, vomiting and allergic reactions,
including rash.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley's wife, Ernestine, was in Iowa Friday
night campaigning and had no plans to go to California to be with
her husband. She said that Mrs. Bradley would continue with a full
day of campaigning in Iowa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bradley is scheduled to address the annual convention
of the Florida Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn sought to convey a mood of relaxed assurance during a
phone interview from Bradley headquarters in West Orange, N.J.,
cracking a few jokes about the flood of phone calls the office had
received. She said she had been long aware of Bradley's condition,
calling it ``no big deal.''

FAITH SALE, 63, BOOK EXECUTIVE WHO EDITED VONNEGUT AND HELLER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faith Sale, a publishing executive and the editor of
dozens of novels and short-story collections by such authors as
Donald Barthelme, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Kaye Gibbons and
Amy Tan, died Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in
Manhattan. She was 63 and had homes in Greenwich Village and Cold
Spring, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her husband, the historian and
biographer Kirkpatrick Sale.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a devoted writers' advocate and a hands-on editor of a
decidedly literary bent, Ms. Sale had a career in publishing that
spanned four decades, beginning at J.B. Lippincott and including
stints at Macmillan and E.P. Dutton. She spent the last 20 years at
G.P. Putnam's Sons, where she was vice president and senior
executive editor and is said to have introduced a more literary
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Her titles there included Heller's fictional treatment of the
life of Rembrandt, ``Picture This'' (1988), Ms. Tan's breakthrough
novel, ``The Joy Luck Club'' (1989) and Barthelme's massive
collection ``60 Stories'' (1981), which won the PEN/Faulkner
fiction award. Most recently, she was the editor of Vonnegut's
collection of stories from the 1950s, ``Bagombo Snuff Box,'' which
was published in September, and a new novel by Delia Ephron, ``Big
City Eyes,'' to be published in March.
</P>
<P>
   Born Faith Apfelbaum in New York in 1936, she grew up in
Manhattan and in New Rochelle, N.Y., and attended Cornell
University, where she came under the thrall of an authoritative
English professor named William M. Sale Jr. She worked on the
school newspaper with his son, Kirk, whom she would marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we spent most of our time in college, working on
the newspaper,'' Sale said. ``And that's where she learned the art
of editing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters,
Rebekah Sale and Kalista Sale Parish, both of New York; a brother,
Ben Apfelbaum of Atlanta; and a granddaughter.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawrence B. Lindsey, the former Federal Reserve
governor who is now George W. Bush's chief economic adviser, sees
himself as a mere technician, helping to turn the presidential
candidate's vision into nuts-and-bolts programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has a very clear idea of where he wants to take
the country,'' Lindsey said the other evening, winding down after a
hectic week of helping him make his first big economic policy
speech of the campaign. ``We're there to provide suggestions on the
best way to accomplish the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, an affable, 45-year-old Harvard-trained economist who
worked in the White House during both the Reagan and Bush
administrations, has been around politics long enough to know when
to defer to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey clearly has substantial influence in honing the
campaign's message and putting flesh on the Texas governor's
``compassionate conservatism'' theme. Equally important, he
provides policy gravitas to a candidate who constantly confronts
whispers that he is a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since they first met and began discussing
economic policy, Lindsey has covered a lot of ground with Bush,
from international finance and trade to Social Security and the
Federal Reserve. But on no subject has he had a more direct
influence than on tax cuts, the centerpiece of any Republican
platform.
</P>
<P>
   While by all accounts the $483 billion tax-cutting proposal that
Bush unveiled this month was shaped by the candidate's own
philosophy, its details and presentation carried Lindsey's stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, for example, does not see a clear case for reducing the
tax rate on long-term capital gains below the current 20 percent,
at least not at the expense of reducing marginal income tax rates,
but he is much keener on eliminating the inheritance tax on large
estates. The Bush plan bucked supply-side orthodoxy by skipping a
capital-gains tax cut, but it included a phaseout of the estate
tax.
</P>
<P>
   And while a strong believer in lower income tax rates, Lindsey
is not a fan of the single-rate flat tax advocated by other
Republicans including Steve Forbes, whose candidacy is dogging Bush
from the right. Bush's plan keeps the progressive income tax system
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has warned for several years that the economy may soon
turn downward, and Bush presented his tax plan in part as insurance
against a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear when you look at the Bush tax plan that it has
Larry Lindsey's fingerprints all over it,'' said Stephen Moore,
director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, a
conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   With elections often turning on pocketbook issues, an economic
plan is as much a part of a presidential campaign as the stump
speech or the fund-raiser. And as the presidential race moves
toward the first primaries, economists and other policy experts are
building economic platforms for each of the candidates, motivated
variously by principle and ideology, the lure of power and the
media spotlight, and the promise of a big job if the outcome is
right.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore, eager to
distance himself from Washington and President Clinton on many
issues, is making a conspicuous exception for the administration's
economic record. He is relying more for advice and policy
prescriptions on insiders like Gene Sperling, the White House
economic policy adviser, than on the outside economists in his
camp, like Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist and former Fed
vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator whose campaign
cultivates an image of plain-speaking insurgency and who keeps his
own counsel on most policy matters, announced last week that he had
two establishment heavyweights in his camp: Paul Volcker, the
former Fed chairman, and Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican candidates, Forbes has a whole stable of
supply-side economists, headed by Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan
administration economist now with Wertheim Schroder, an investment
firm. Sen. John McCain of Arizona has no formal economic team but
relies on an informal network of contacts from his two decades in
Washington and his chairmanship of the commerce ccCommittee.
</P>
<P>
   But needing to educate himself about a host of complex topics _
and eager to tweak traditional Republican thinking on some economic
policy issues _ Bush has assembled a larger and more prominent
roster of economic advisers than any of his rivals. In addition to
Lindsey, the 10-member team includes Michael J. Boskin, who was
chief White House economist under President Bush and is now at
Stanford University's Hoover Institution; Martin S. Feldstein, the
Harvard economist who is head of the National Bureau of Economic
Research; John F. Cogan, who was a budget aide to President Reagan;
and John B. Taylor, an expert on monetary policy. Cogan and Taylor
are also at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Developing Bush's proposals is a role that in some ways seems
tailor-made for Lindsey _ and enlisting him is good politics for
Bush. Lindsey made his name in Washington during the 1980s with an
academic defense of tax cuts as a spur to economic growth. That
endeared him to the Republican Party's supply-side wing, a group
that felt betrayed by President Bush and harbors suspicions about
Governor Bush's commitment to reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he has advocated conservative orthodoxy on reducing
marginal income tax rates, Lindsey has challenged it by urging his
party to do more to fight poverty and to provide low-income people
with better access to housing. At the Federal Reserve, where
officials often seem cloistered in their offices, Lindsey was known
for trooping through subsidized housing projects and warning
bankers to make sure that race and barriers to obtaining credit did
not discourage homeownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see in Larry's approach some of the precursors to
compassionate conservatism, whatever that means,'' said Blinder,
who served at the Fed with Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   To a presidential candidate trying to woo his party's
conservative base while seeking to redefine its ideology to appeal
to moderates, Lindsey's credentials as a supply-sider with a heart
fit perfectly. ``They were simpatico from the get-go,'' said Al
Hubbard, a longtime friend of Bush who worked with Lindsey at the
White House and introduced the two last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in other ways, Lindsey is an odd choice as a top aide to any
presidential candidate, especially the congenitally upbeat Bush.
Lindsey is renowned for his bearish views on the stock market and
his consistent predictions that the strong economy is on the verge
of a painful downturn, positions that raise questions about his
skills as a forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average was
at 8,500, he said publicly that stock prices were overvalued and
that he had sold all his equity holdings so he could sleep better
at night. The Dow closed on Friday at 11,224.70.
</P>
<P>
   And with the current business expansion just months from
becoming the longest in the nation's history, Lindsey warned
recently that a downturn in the business cycle was near.
</P>
<P>
   Under the glare of media attention as the campaign has heated
up, Lindsey has moderated his views _ but just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of faith about the long-term strength of the
economy and in the positive changes that have happened over the
last 20 years in reducing taxes and regulation,'' Lindsey said.
``But I don't think we've repealed the business cycle, and I think
that financial markets are probably more optimistic than they
should be about the course of the business cycle from here on
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Lindsey has always been outspoken, at least by
Washington standards. Four years ago, while still at the Fed and
making $123,000 a year, Lindsey was turned down for a charge card
by Toys ``R'' Us. Eager to make a point about the fallibility of
credit reports, Lindsey went public with his experience.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that his credit report showed many inquiries about
his financial history, in part because he was refinancing a loan at
the time. The inquiries raised a red flag, which Toys ``R'' Us and
the bank issuing its credit cards did not check further.
</P>
<P>
   The episode had a happy ending. Lindsey said that nearly all big
credit card issuers came to him at the Fed to say they would adopt
a new approach: People rejected for credit by a software program
would get a second look by a human being to see if there were
mitigating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I had was that we're increasingly using computers
to make consumer credit decisions and taking human decision-making
out of the process,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Peekskill, N.Y., the son of public school teachers,
Lindsey grew up intending to become a lawyer, and with far more
liberal views than he holds now. While at Bowdoin College in Maine,
he got early exposure to supply and demand by starting a hot-dog
stand, and exposure to politics as a volunteer for George McGovern,
the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee. As his interest in policy
grew, he moved decidedly to the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson we learned from the Great Society and the 1970s is
that those objectives of a better life for everyone are fine, but
big government is not going to be the one to provide it,'' he said.
``The question we have is what can we conservatives do, we who
believe in the power of the individual and the market, to solve the
problems that liberalism has failed to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lindsey's answer is on display in Bush's tax plan.
Acting on Bush's order that the proposal address the ways in which
high marginal tax rates hurt taxpayers at all income levels,
Lindsey and the rest of the economic team spent months debating not
just how much to reduce rates for the wealthy and the upper middle
class, but also how to aid the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   People earning $20,000 to $25,000 a year can face some of the
highest marginal tax rates in the system. At those income levels,
many people begin losing the benefits of the earned income tax
credit, which helps people whose incomes are below or just above
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that quirk as a barrier to entry to the middle class,
Lindsey and his colleagues settled on a plan that reduces the
lowest rate to 10 percent and doubles the per-child credit to
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strengths of the Bush plan _ which has many
weaknesses _ is its effort to reduce the high marginal tax rates
paid by the working poor,'' Blinder said. ``Among supply-side
conservatives there is typically remarkably little concern with the
plight of the poor in general and with the very high marginal tax
rates paid by the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent nearly all of his professional career in
Washington, including five years as a Fed governor ending in early
1997, Lindsey said he originally intended to remain neutral during
the Republican primaries, in part because he had ties to a number
of candidates, including Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle. Then
Hubbard introduced him to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling to Austin for three long sessions with the
governor last year, Lindsey jumped when Bush asked him to join his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the right president is important, and I think I found
the right guy,'' Lindsey said. ``He's a natural leader. He's got
good instincts. He absorbs things quickly and he's comfortable with
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey helped pull together the other members of the team, many
of whom worked in the White House during the 1980s and have
strongly held positions of their own. He has helped to brief Bush
on a variety of subjects and to prepare him for debates. And he is
working with the rest of the team on detailed proposals for topics
like overhauling Social Security and improving access to health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The group met irregularly for much of the last year, starting
even before Bush announced he would run. The members have gathered
in Austin, in Washington and once at Boskin's home in California;
they hold regular conference calls. Technically the group is
managed by Hubbard, not Lindsey, so that Lindsey is free to
advocate positions, rather than play the role of honest broker
among competing views.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been some disagreements. As the tax plan was
completed, for example, the 10 members were evenly divided over
whether the top income tax rate should be reduced to 30 percent or
33 percent from 39.6 percent. Bush ultimately decided on 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very collegial group that's worked well together,''
Hubbard said. ``That doesn't mean there haven't been disagreements,
but for the most part they haven't been about what's best for the
economy. They've been about what works best on the political side,
and ultimately that's the governor's call.''
</P>
<P>
   With the tax plan out of the way, Lindsey _ who is working for
the campaign as a volunteer _ is again spending more time at what
he calls his day jobs. Those are a chair at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative research group, where he is working on a
book about housing, and his consulting firm, Economic Strategies
Inc., whose clients are financial institutions and large
corporations in the United States, Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He seems likely, though, to be back in the thick of politics in
coming months if Bush goes ahead with an approach, backed by
Lindsey, to use much of the projected federal budget surplus to
finance a partial privatization of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   And should . Bush be elected president, Lindsey and his
colleagues on the economic team would no doubt have plum jobs
available to them _ from Treasury secretary on down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it and we shouldn't,'' Lindsey said of
post-election daydreams. ``My wife and I have said, `Let's do this
through the election and see what happens.' But by all means I'd
like to have only one job after the election.''

JEANNE S. CHALL, 78, EXPERT ON HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO READ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J., Ohio, Poland)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne S. Chall, a leading expert on how children learn to read
and a vociferous antagonist in at least two of the major
educational controversies of the last quarter-century, died Nov. 27
at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said Ariadne Valsamis, a
spokeswoman for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where Dr.
Chall taught for 26 years. She retired in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall championed both challenging reading material for
children and the use of phonics in basic reading instruction, as
against limited-vocabulary texts and the so-called whole-language
approach.
</P>
<P>
   With the argument that easy is not necessarily good, she was a
rigorous opponent of the prevailing view of reading specialists in
the mid-1970s that if assigned reading was too difficult, children
would become frustrated and give up trying to master it.
</P>
<P>
   That view, Dr. Chall said, was responsible for a rash of ``cute
kiddie books'' with lavish four-color illustration, limited
vocabulary and rudimentary syntax that made few demands on early
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall attacked that orthodoxy with scores of books and
articles in which she called for challenging primers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' she told an interviewer in 1977, ``children have
to grow in their ability to deal with increasingly complex
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall pressed her beliefs that year in a study that was
commissioned by the College Board as part of a project to learn the
reasons for a sharp decline since 1962 in average scores on the
reading-comprehension part of the SAT, sponsored by the College
Board. Although her report pointed to a number of possible
explanations for that decline, it found that the scores tended to
rise with the level of difficulty of the material students had been
given to read from their earliest days in school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall engaged in renewed combat in 1983, when, in the spring
issue of Contemporary Education Review, she wrote a blistering
review of a scholarly book, ``On Learning to Read'' (Knopf, 1982),
by Dr. Bruno Bettelheim and Dr. Karen Zelan, psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bettelheim-Zelan book, which had been almost universally
praised by other professional educators, argued that the ability to
decode words need not be taught but instead was intuitive,
resulting, without effort, from the reading of imaginative,
interesting stories. Accordingly, the authors said, the cure for
the decline in reading scores was more entertaining and engaging
primers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall scorned that argument, maintaining that ``comparisons
of different beginning-reading methods over the past 70 years have
found that methods that teach decoding earlier and more
systematically produce better word recognition as well as better
reading comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall also vigorously supported phonics, the method of
teaching beginners to read by having them associate certain letters
with the sounds those letters represent.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts have de-emphasized phonics over the last two
decades and instead adopted the whole-language approach, in which
reading is taught through context rather than recognition of the
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Chall said her research showed that knowledge of the
alphabet and familiarity with the sounds that make up words were
crucial. She expressed her view in ``Learning to Read: The Great
Debate'' (Harcourt Brace, 1967), recognized as a definitive
analysis of reading research.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Stemlicht Chall was born in Poland on Jan. 1, 1921, and
moved with her family to New York City when she was 7. She became
the first member of her family to go to college, graduating cum
laude from City College in 1941. She earned both a master's degree
(1947) and a doctorate (1952) from Ohio State University, and
taught at Ohio State, Teachers College of Columbia University and
then City College before joining the Harvard faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chall is survived by three sisters, Sylvia Rauch of East
Brunswick, N.J., and Miriam Warmbrand and Shirley Decker, both of
Rego Park, Queens, and seven nieces and nephews.

 WASHINGTON: by investigators.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The law firm, O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, released copies of a letter
that Mark Holscher, Lee's lawyer, sent Friday to federal
prosecutors in Albuquerque, N.M., in an unsuccessful last-ditch
attempt to head off the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said that he and his client could easily answer the
prosecutors' questions about supposedly missing computer tapes. The
lawyer said he would gladly make Lee ``immediately available to a
mutually agreeable polygraph examiner'' to prove that Lee had not
mishandled the tapes or given them to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``By separate letter, we will again raise with you our deep
concerns with the manner in which this investigation continues to
be mishandled,'' Holscher wrote. He said that an indictment in the
absence of any proof that Lee had given computer tapes to anyone
would be a ``horrible injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Holscher's firm asserted that prosecutors had
made decisions that had been ``influenced by other branches of
government whose political motives and agendas are suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The law firm did not elaborate on the subject of ``political
motives and agendas,'' but American-Chinese relations have been
sensitive in recent years over issues including trade deficits,
human rights and suspicions of Chinese attempts to influence the
1996 presidential election through illicit campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Zia said that while he was in the Commerce Department he was
interviewed by investigators looking into campaign fund raising,
even though he had nothing to do with raising money and had no ties
to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said the case had been the subject of much inaccurate
reporting. Given the inaccurate coverage and Vrooman's assertions
of ethnic bias, the firm said, ``It is astounding to have this case
reach this level.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm said that it was outraged by the government's refusal
to grant bail. ``Dr. Lee voluntarily relinquished his passport,''
the firm said, ``and voluntarily notified the government on every
occasion on which he has traveled outside of the Los Alamos area
for the past nine months. He has been under 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week surveillance since March 1999, even though the
government has fully acknowledged that it has no evidence that he
engaged in any espionage activities.''

AFTER TROUBLED PAST, AYALA TRIES FOR COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tony Ayala feels 36.
</P>
<P>
   It's the aches and pains he must endure after a fight or
workout, his body's way of telling him he's not the same man who
could once stay out all night drinking and then spar 10 rounds the
next day with no problem.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the 19-year-old who went away to a New Jersey prison in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he feels good, much better than most boxers
his age because he has experienced no wear and tear in the ring
over the past 16 years and doesn't abuse drugs or alcohol as he
once did.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Ayala is both realistic and optimistic as he heads into
the third fight of his improbable comeback: He faces journeyman
Tony Menefee tonight in his hometown of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The bout will be on pay-per-view television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that those who expect me to be like I was when I
was 19 will be disappointed,'' said Ayala, who was the No. 1 junior
middleweight contender when he was convicted of rape and went to
prison. ``I'll probably never be like that again. I'm a different
fighter now, smarter, more conscious of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals, my motivation are the same, though. That hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 20 pounds over his fighting weight at the time, left
prison on April 20 of this year and began training two days later.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy at first. After 16 years without physical
contact, getting hit by sparring partners was like getting hit by
an angry ram with a full head of steam. As Ayala put it, ``It was
discouraging to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he's determined. It's how he's always been. He also
knows this is his best chance to make big money, to set his family
up for life, and he wants to give himself every chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   So he works hard on his skills and conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The punching power and innate aggression were there the moment
Ayala stepped back into the ring. That's not the case with his
reflexes, quickness, footwork and timing, which come more slowly _
if ever _ after a layoff.
</P>
<P>
   His conditioning, a liability when he began training eight
months ago, is now a strength. He surprises himself sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went running with him yesterday,'' said psychologist Brian
Raditz, who treated Ayala in prison and now serves as his manager.
``We finished running for an hour and he looked at me and said, `I
can't believe how good I feel. I'm not even breathing hard. I don't
understand it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just working very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two victories, consensus is that he looked ``pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped Manuel Esparza in the third round on Aug. 20 in his
first fight back and then knocked out Robert Koon in four rounds on
Sept. 24. However, Esparza and Koon are club-level fighters, making
it difficult to gauge exactly what the two wins mean.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala admits he's not ready for the Oscar De La Hoyas or Felix
Trinidads, although he doesn't believe he's too far away.
</P>
<P>
   Raditiz said he expects Ayala to get a world-title fight within
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to be back in form for a couple more fights,''
he said. ``. .. But I'm at a point where I'll give anybody a damn
good fight. Name anyone out there and the fans will say afterward
that they weren't cheated out of their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go good, maybe I'll fight a guy like (former
champion Yory Boy) Campas in my next few fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Raditz is almost certain Ayala will make history.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fighter's determination, his passion, and the fact he's
not a typical fighter even if his stretch in prison is not
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand something: Tony's always done unique
things,'' Raditz said. ``When he was in the fifth, sixth grade, he
built his own car and drove it to school. When he was 11, he fought
the Mexican Golden Gloves champ, who was 22, and Tony knocked him
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was 14, he sparred with hard-punching former champion
Pipino Cuevas and gave him all he could handle. He's always done
things like that and it's no different now.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he fails? No biggie.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is not his obsession. Life as a free man is.
</P>
<P>
   He's made peace with himself in regard to the rape of a neighbor
in Patterson, N.J., while high on heroin and alcohol. He has
expressed remorse for his act and says he's now a ``normal''
person.
</P>
<P>
   His primary objective is keep it that way. Whatever he's able to
accomplish in boxing is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to be in the position I'm in now,'' Ayala
said. ``For 14 years, I never expected to fight again. So when you
expect nothing and get a lot, it's a blessing. That's how I feel
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the same fighter I was and I'm not the same person I
was.''

TURKEY IS INVITED TO APPLY FOR SEAT IN EUROPEAN UNION
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS 10 grafs at end with details of conference) 
 (With EU-TURKEY-REACT) 
(rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ The European Union Friday accepted Turkey as
a candidate for membership, reversing a thumbs-down vote two years
ago, which was based mainly on Turkey's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Membership, which is probably many years down the road, would
mark the entry of the first Muslim country to the European Union.
Turkey, which has long sought closer ties to Europe, is already a
member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The economic and political union also agreed to a plan to bring
in more of the formerly communist nations of Eastern and Central
Europe, in the latest step to expand to the borders of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Alarm over Russian moves in Chechnya colored the summit
conference of the 15-nation bloc in Helsinki. The national leaders
put out a statement condemning the bombardment of cities in the
territory as ``totally unacceptable'' and threatening to cut
assistance to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the European Union would review its common
strategy on Russia, apply trade terms more strictly, suspend some
provisions of a partnership agreement and shift funds from a
technical program to ``humanitarian needs'' created by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey readily welcomed the European offer. ``There might be
details we find hard to accept,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said
in Ankara, ``but in general the acceptance of our candidate status
on equal conditions is a great success for Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Turkey has pursued European validation for years, it
balked at some of the terms for its admittance Friday, and Javier
Solana, the union's new foreign policy chief, was sent to Ankara to
clarify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going there just to explain what has been agreed by the
E.U. summit,'' he said on leaving Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   To join, Turkey will have to make sweeping political and
economic reforms and abolish its death penalty. Its neighbor Greece
lately indicated its willingness to reconsider allowing Turkey to
join it in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Lipponen, the prime minister of Finland, current holder of
the organization's rotating presidency, expressed hopes for a
positive response and said Ecevit had been invited to the
concluding lunch of the summit conference here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Malta were
the countries gaining preliminary consideration for membership
Friday. They fall into line behind six others already negotiating
entry _ Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least three years before the first of them become
full members, and it may be decades before all of them do. Under
the new plan, the E.U. will expand to 28 member states by 2025,
representing a population of 500 million people.
</P>
<P>
   While the requirement to improve its human rights record and
enact social and political reforms is likely to make Turkey one of
the later entrants, Friday's decision is considered significant for
symbolizing a break with a long history of stereotyping of Turks as
un-European.
</P>
<P>
   The United States criticized the Europeans for spurning Turkey,
a strategically located Muslim NATO ally, at the European Union's
summit meeting in Luxembourg in 1997. President Clinton called on
the leaders to undo the offense when he visited Greece and Turkey
last month.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that conditions sought by Greece might have given
Ankara pause in accepting the invitation. Of particular concern to
the Greeks was a provision under consideration saying the two
countries should steer their Aegean border disputes to the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The overall mood of the conference, once envisioned as a
conclusive, forward-looking pre-millennial gathering, was soured by
disputes over France's defiance of the European Commission's
lifting of the ban on British beef and Britain's objections to a 20
percent withholding tax on offshore investments favored by the
other members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some tough talk,'' Lipponen said in a grim news
conference Friday evening. ``Our discussions were not at all
diplomatic in their language.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely mentioned in Friday's account of the meeting's
accomplishments was the approval of the new European rapid reaction
force that was once considered a centerpiece of the gathering. A
European Security and Defense Initiative calling for such a force
was adopted after a brief debate and some minor changes to the
program put together by the alliance's principal military powers,
Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which at the beginning of the decade expressed
interest in Europe's taking on military responsibility for regional
conflicts, more recently expressed anxiety at a European force's
potential to overlap with and detract from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to address that concern, but leaving the matter vague,
the summit declaration said, ``The objective is for the union to
have the autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a
whole is not engaged, to launch and then to conduct E.U.-led
military operations in response to international crises.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60,000-strong crisis response force is supposed to be ready
by 2003. The plan also calls for a separate military staff and a
permanent political and security committee.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a growing consensus _ especially since the war in
Kosovo _ that Europe needs to restructure its military and build up
its muscle. But many of the same nations have been cutting their
own military outlays.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The gold market has just gone through a derivative burnout, not
a new awakening that signals the end of long a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   As the price surged from $253.70 to $326 an ounce in an
August-to-October rally, burnout seems to have been a key element.
In time, though, the rally may give desperate gold bulls some small
hope.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have been happier on Sunday, Sept. 26, when 15
European central banks said they would limit their annual gold
sales to 400 metric tons (almost 13 million ounces) for five years
and promised to restrict their gold lending to current levels.
</P>
<P>
   That statement was the spark needed for a rally, even though the
permitted gold sales would be well above the annual average of 297
tons during the 1990s. It removed the threat of a huge increase in
central bank sales, a worry that had been depressing gold prices
for years. And the restriction on central bank gold lending would
make bets against gold by speculators and hedging by producers less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Haruko Fukuda, executive director of the World Gold Council,
felt that the gold market environment had changed so much that she
declared in a speech Oct. 18 that ``a new era dawned for gold''
that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the price of gold back down to $281 an ounce, the bulls
are wondering.
</P>
<P>
   George Milling-Stanley, manager of gold market analysis at the
gold council, acknowledges that something big has to happen to get
the price up.
</P>
<P>
   The derivative turmoil was not on the scale _ nor did it get the
headlines _ that came with the near-collapse of Long Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund that was rescued in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Ashanti Goldfields Co. of Ghana and Cambior Inc. of
Canada are both reeling because of their gold hedging programs,
which depend on derivatives. And like Long Term Capital, the two
companies underestimated the risk of a sharp market move against
them, in this case a surge in the price of gold.
</P>
<P>
   In a market where the price of gold had fallen for the last four
years, bets against gold were understandable. And hedging _ which
allows gold producers to sell their production in the future at
prices above current levels _ enabled many companies to be
profitable while the price was declining.
</P>
<P>
   But this appears to be a case of two companies going too far in
their derivative plays: both are now struggling to survive because
their hedges turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti, which had 10 million ounces of gold, or 38 percent of
its reserves, hedged on Sept. 30, had to give its bullion dealers
the option to buy 15 percent of the company to avoid being forced
to meet a margin call against potential hedge losses that analysts
said were around $270 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ashanti said the margin call threatened its solvency. Cambior
quickly bought one million ounces of gold and closed out positions
totaling 300,000 ounces, resulting in a net after-tax charge to
earnings of $28.2 million in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cambior is now trying to sell off some of its gold and base
metal assets. Both companies have agreements with their bullion
dealers that give them time to work out their problems.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of the unwinding of these hedge positions _ which could
have required the purchase of millions of ounces of gold _ was a
driving force behind the panic gold buying in late September and
early October. Investors who had bet on a gold price decline
scurried to buy the metal back, while producers bought to limit
their hedging losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put a great deal of fuel into the rally,'' said Philip
Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields Mineral Services, a
London-based precious metals research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the derivative burnout might still redound to the benefit of
the gold price if it changes the attitude of speculators and gold
producers, who have assumed that the price will stay where it is or
fall further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have seen that this market can move both ways, up
and down,'' said Bruce D. Hansen, chief financial officer of the
Newmont Mining Corp. If that lesson takes hold, speculators won't
be as eager to bet on further declines and producers will hedge
less. And that would provide gold some headroom.

AS STRIKE DEADLINE LOOMS, NONECONOMIC ISSUES COMPLICATE TRANSIT
TALKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the deadline looming for a transit strike in New
York City, labor and management negotiators said Friday that they
were divided over not only wage demands but also two important
noneconomic issues: disciplinary procedures and work rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 33,000 subway and bus workers, who are threatening to
walk out on Wednesday, are demanding changes in disciplinary
procedures, complaining that New York City Transit takes a
guilty-until-proved-innocent approach and often suspends workers
for minor infractions.
</P>
<P>
   But transit officials are also pursuing one of their longtime
priorities, demanding that the transit union agree to more flexible
work rules. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which
oversees the city transit agency, hopes the rule  will
increase productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best news to come out of this week's bargaining was
that Willie James, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100,
said he thought that progress had been made on the noneconomic
issues. Nonetheless, he said a substantial gap remained on those
issues and on monetary matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some movement on discipline, but it's still a
major issue,'' he said in an interview on Thursday night, before a
full day of negotiations Friday. ``Over all, things still don't
look good at this juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though state law bars transit workers from striking, James
has threatened a walkout if no agreement is reached by 12:01 a.m.
Wednesday, when the contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday during a break in negotiations, Gary
Dellaverson, New York City Transit's chief negotiator, was more
upbeat. ``If the union has a will to avoid a confrontation, there's
a way,'' he said, adding that headway had been made in the
negotiations. He said the agency had moved closer to the union on
the discipline issue, while the union had made progress in his view
on some job-classification and reorganization issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that momentum is maintained,'' Dellaverson said, ``I have
every expectation it will carry over to the thornier issues that
separate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers have complained to James about being suspended without
hearings and being forced to prove their innocence in disciplinary
proceedings. They say the suspensions came for minor infractions,
like having three buttons open on a uniform shirt during a
scorching summer day or wearing prohibited clothing, like hooded
sweatshirts, during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   They have also complained about the progressive system of
discipline, in which penalties increase for each successive
infraction, rising from a warning to a suspension and ultimately to
dismissal. The workers want the record wiped clean when a worker
goes a year or two without an infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA has a far harsher system of discipline than do most
city agencies or even the private sector,'' said Josh Freeman, a
labor relations expert at Queens College. ``It's become a
smoldering issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials say a strict disciplinary system is needed to
fight carelessness, drug use and poor attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Work rules are not as emotional an issue, but the union is
resisting management's efforts to loosen job classifications so
that, for example, mechanics who fix bus engines can also do
chassis or body work. Transit officials say more flexible work
rules would increase productivity and save money by having each
person do more.
</P>
<P>
   Dellaverson said the workers would benefit from having more
skills, although many of them seem to disagree, fearing that
allowing more flexible work rules could ultimately result in
layoffs. He said the two sides were negotiating job security
language that would be tied to any new work rules.
</P>
<P>
   James said he did not fully understand management's push for
changes in the work rules because in his view productivity has
soared in recent years. He said daily ridership had jumped 16
percent, to 3.5 million passengers a day, since 1997. What that
means, he said, is that bus drivers and subway workers are working
harder to handle the extra passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They owe this union,'' he said. ``Ridership is up, and every
member is producing more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the MTA, challenged that
logic, asking whether James would agree to lower wages if ridership
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Fortuna, executive director of the Citizens Budget
Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, questioned the
union's claims of higher productivity. The measure should not be
ridership per worker but the cost of running and maintaining each
train, she said, a figure that has remained relatively steady.

THE GEORGE W SMILE: IS THAT SIMPER FINITE CAUSE FOR CHAGRIN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not easy to read George W.'s lips.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the Cheshire cat's toothy grin and the Mona
Lisa's coy simper are the curiously curved lips of the Texas
governor and front-running Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a smirk, others a smile. Some say it makes George
W. Bush appear cocky and condescending; others say it's friendly
and frank. Whatever it is _ that pursed-lipped grin often
accompanied by raised eyebrows _ it has prompted comment from
C-Span viewers, online magazines and Kansas farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become a topic on local and national talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   But does facial expression really make a difference in a
presidential campaign? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   People expect their presidents to be ``cheerful and optimistic
and on the other hand, serious,'' said Jack Pitney, a political
analyst at Claremont McKenna College in California. To that extent,
he said, facial expressions ``can make a difference for some
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richard Nixon, in spite of his famous scowl, was twice
elected president, Pitney pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also elected Jimmy Carter, whose humorless grin g
very fast,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz over Bush's mug began in the national news media.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit News columnist and conservative Fox News commentator
Tony Snow referred to the Bush expression as ``The Smirk'' in a
recent syndicated column. The s-word has popped up in the online
``Slate'' and ``Talk'' magazines; other journalists have called the
expression a ``jaunty grin,'' ``bemused smile'' and ``half-smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign classifies his expression as perfectly
affable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it is a smile,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's media
consultant. ``It's a bemused smile. I would describe it as
charming.''
</P>
<P>
   The look appears most often when the governor is in listening
mode: listening to a potential constituent on the campaign trail,
listening to an interviewer pose a question, listening to CNN's
John King toss him his first question of the Arizona debate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's TV appearances have accelerated, commentators and
viewers have keyed on his enigmatic grin. In September, a ``Talk''
magazine writer described Bush as ``smirking'' throughout a
conversation about the execution of Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span viewers made the grin a topic of conversation on a
call-in show after Bush's mid-November foreign policy address.
``The Wall Street Journal'' ran a story on ``the alleged smirk''
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Texans tend to cut their governor a little more slack than the
nation does.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``is a person who, by all accounts, has a wonderful sense
of humor,'' said James Riddlesperger, a Texas Christian University
professor of political science. He said that sometimes when you see
the look, ``It's almost a pained expression because he'd really
like to throw out a one-liner but knows he can't. He has a smirk,
but his eyes are dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't the first presidential candidate whose mug has
prompted discussion. Think back to Nixon, ``who was thought to look
shifty-eyed and who perspired a lot'' on televised debates, said
Alan Schroeder, a professor in the School of Journalism at
Northeastern University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he said, recall Dan Quayle, ``who had this kind of
frightened look in his eye that the camera exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with television is that it perpetuates these
visual stereotypes, but whether they're valid or not is anybody's
guess,'' said Schroeder, author of ``Presidential Debates: Forty
Years of High-Risk TV,'' which is scheduled for publication next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   All the couch-potato grin analysis has Paul King slightly
annoyed. King, an associate professor of speech communications at
TCU, has some news for would-be face readers: ``There's really no
such thing as body language,'' he said, adding that pundits who try
to read a candidate's kisser ``irritate me endlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Carlin, a professor of communication studies at the
University of Kansas, said members of the Kansas Agricultural Rural
Leadership Program happened to be discussing Bush's expression at a
recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about just this issue _ they had all noticed
it, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness, every one of us has things we do that we're
totally unaware of,'' added Carlin, who admits to raising her
eyebrows a lot. ``That's the reason people don't like to watch
themselves on a video.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before deciding to go ahead with Friday's
indictment of Wen Ho Lee, senior law enforcement and intelligence
officials of the Clinton administration concluded that the
necessity of a prosecution outweighed any damage to national
security that might result from the release of classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   That judgment will be seriously challenged, as the case unfolds
over the coming weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, Lee had access to the most
sensitive nuclear weapons data possessed by the United States,
which if disclosed, could case serious damage to the national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for the government will be how to prove its case
against Lee in court without disclosing this information. What
typically happens in such cases is that the government will try to
withhold as much information as possible, in the interests of
national security, and that the defense lawyers will try to force
the government to disclose as much as possible, in order to defend
their client.
</P>
<P>
   Lee will also surely want much more classified information,
including the names of any informers against him. Many charges of
espionage have not even been filed because intelligence agencies
have not wanted to expose their sources and methods.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, defendants have used the threat of disclosing
secrets and intelligence gathering operations in open court to
persuade the government to drop cases. In response, a law was
enacted, in 1981, that now guides the government and defense in the
use of classified information at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as the Classified Information Procedure Act,
frees the government from the choice of disclosing classified
information or dismissing the indictment, said Stephen Jones, the
lawyer for Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the bombing of the
federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The law means the government ``does not have to give everything
in its purest form,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   But it still has to give something, or choose between security
and criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   The legal skirmishing will begin when Lee's lawyers request
classified information, and the judge determines that he needs it
for his defense. At that point, the government can ask the court
for permission to submit a summary of the information, or a
statement admitting to the facts the classified information would
prove.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules against the government, it must then dismiss
the case, or some of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   This has happened in the past, most notably during the
Iran-contra cases, when defendants sought, and were given access to
300,000 pages of classified material. After the legal wrangling,
the government dismissed the most serious charges against Lt. Col.
Oliver North, who was considered the ring-leader of the operation
to supply weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, rather than have some
of the information disclosed in court.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, the government dropped the complete
indictment of another Iran-contra figure, Joseph F. Fernandez, who
had been a Central Intelligence Agency operative in Central America
during the operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of Lee will put far greater pressures on the
government, for what is involved is not an embarrassing operation
of running guns to rebels, but Americas nuclear secrets. If Lee
damaged American security by down-loading them on to his computer,
the government will have to decide how much damage it will risk by
revealing them in open court.

WORTHY FIELD HITS WIRE IN HEISMAN RACE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last spring, two very good college football players
decided to skip the National Football League draft, return for
their senior year to graduate and put themselves in position to
pick up some postseason hardware. One of them, Wisconsin running
back Ron Dayne, will probably be awarded the Heisman Trophy
Saturday night at the Downtown Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick, is nowhere
near New York Saturday and that, unfortunately, continues to
generate too much discussion. He didn't get enough votes on the 921
ballots to make the trip here _ quarterbacks Joe Hamilton of
Georgia Tech, Michael Vick of Virginia Tech, Drew Brees of Purdue
and Chad Pennington of Marshall were the other players who did.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick went from Heisman front-runner to outsider when he was
suspended from two midseason games because of his involvement in a
shopping mall scam. Whether that is fair or not, whether an
off-field incident blinded voters to his game-day brilliance,
shouldn't matter. The five finalists had splendid seasons and
should be the focus of this once-in-a-lifetime day _ especially
Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   The 254-pound Dayne also battled perception problems over the
course of a record-breaking season. He broke the former Texas
running back Ricky Williams' year-old Division I-A career rushing
record, with 6,397 yards. This season, he rolled to 1,834 yards,
averaged 6.1 yards a carry and scored 19 touchdowns to help
Wisconsin (9-2) return to the Rose Bowl for the second consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the season, reporters, and schools with competing
Heisman candidates, floated theories on why Dayne wasn't the best
player. It prompted the Wisconsin athletic department to post a
treatise about Dayne, on the university's Web site, titled:
``What's Myth and What's Fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatise is pretty convincing. Here's a sample:
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne hasn't gained yardage versus quality opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Facts: Dayne and the Badgers have faced nationally ranked foes
15 times since 1996. His average rushing yards per game in those
contests is 114.9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: Ron Dayne turns the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   Facts: In 1,159 carries, Dayne has suffered just nine fumbles
lost. That is one miscue for every 128.8 carries. Dayne has fumbled
on just 0.77 percent of his career carries. Williams, by
comparison, lost 12 fumbles during his Heisman Trophy-winning
season.
</P>
<P>
   And on it goes. The problem, really, has been that neither
Dayne's bruising running nor his succinct speaking style has awed
or inspired.
</P>
<P>
   But these facts should: He stayed in school to be a father to
his 2-year-old daughter, Jada; a mate to his longtime girlfriend,
Alia Lester; and a big brother to his sister, Onya, a freshman
track athlete at Wisconsin. He will finish the 12 hours needed for
his degree this spring and finds being a role model sobering. ``I
take everything seriously,'' he said. ``You have somebody looking
up to you at all times, watching what you're doing, even trying to
copy what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow finalists also deserve their places on the Heisman
dais.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, the likely runner-up, returned Georgia Tech (8-3) to
national prominence and won the Davey O'Brien award as the nation's
outstanding quarterback. Hamilton passed, completing 203 of 305
passes for 3,060 yards and 29 touchdowns. He ran, rushing for 730
yards and 6 touchdowns. He also kept a cool head as the leader of a
young, mistake-prone team.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior, Marshall's Pennington, is an academic
all-American who won the National Football Foundation's Vincent
dePaul Draddy award as the nation's top scholar-athlete. He led the
nation this season with 37 touchdown passes, and completed 275 of
405 passes for 3,799 yards with only 11 interceptions. His team,
the Thundering Herd, is 12-0 and will play Brigham Young in the
Motor City Bowl. Just being here is enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to get to go,'' he said. ``I was hoping to be
invited so I could talk about how successful a program we have at
Marshall.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the finalists are two underclassmen who will be
early co-favorites to win the award next year: Vick and Brees.
</P>
<P>
   A red-shirt freshman at Virginia Tech, Vick seemingly came from
nowhere to lead the No. 2-ranked Hokies (11-0) to a national-title
game against Florida State in the Sugar Bowl. A quick-footed
left-hander, he completed 90 of 153 passes for 1,840 yards with 12
touchdowns while rushing for 580 yards on 110 carries. He also
became the first freshman to lead Division I-A in passing
efficiency, with a 180.4 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had him on the list when the season started,'' said his
coach, Frank Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   Vick will most likely shoot it out next year with Brees, who
announced early this season that he would return to Purdue for his
senior year. The Boilermaker triggered one of the nation's most
potent offenses, completing 301 of 494 passes for 3,531 yards and
21 touchdowns. Brees knows who should receive this year's Heisman _
Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of been their team for the last four years,'' said
the quarterback who will take Purdue (7-4) to the Outback Bowl
against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about Florida State's Warrick _ the college game is
well represented here. Warrick made a mistake; it doesn't make him
a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not have cost him a trip to New York. But he, too,
is on schedule to graduate this spring. He, too, has a big day
ahead of him, just not Saturday. He can pick up some hardware on
Jan. 4, when the Seminoles play for the national title. And that is
fair enough. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
A COMMON HEART CONDITION, OF AN UNKNOWN CAUSE, BUT TREATABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BRADLEY-HEART)  
(mcd) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is one of 2.2 million Americans who suffer from
atrial fibrillation, a very rapid, erratic beating in the atria,
the upper chambers of the heart. President George Bush also
suffered from the condition in 1991; in his case it was brought on
by a thyroid disorder.
</P>
<P>
   People who have atrial fibrillation often feel it as a heartbeat
that races one moment and feels sluggish the next. If the
fibrillation is severe enough to interfere with the heart's pumping
ability, other symptoms like dizziness, faintness, shortness of
breath and fatigue can result.
</P>
<P>
   The condition itself is not an emergency, and it does not signal
an impending heart attack. Its cause is often unclear. Dr. Robert
H. Heissenbuttel, who examined the Democratic presidential
candidate on Dec. 3, said in a letter dated Dec. 9 and made public
Friday by the Bradley campaign, ``In 1996, you were found to have
atrial fibrillation with no precipitating cause, nor any cardiac
disease identified.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may treat the fibrillation with drugs or an electrical
shock, called cardioversion, to restore normal rhythm. In Bradley's
case, according to Heissenbuttel, he received cardioversion in
1996, when the condition was first diagnosed; he had four episodes
of fibrillation over the next two years, and in 1998 received two
cardioversions.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, the doctor said in his letter, Bradley began
receiving the drug Procanbid; since that time the candidate had
``had two brief episodes of atrial fibrillation,'' which converted
to normal rhythm by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Heissenbuttel continued, ``has been effective in
preventing or shortening the duration of episodes and has been well
tolerated with no side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that in the Dec. 3 examination Bradley's heart
function was normal. ``Other than the arrhythmia, you have no other
health issues,'' Heissenbuttel said.
</P>
<P>
   While fibrillation is not life-threatening in itself, when it is
not fully corrected it can cause blood to pool in the atria,
increasing the likelihood of clots and the risk of stroke. The odds
of stroke are practically nonexistent in young people and minimal
in middle age, but the risk greatly increases in the elderly. For
that reason, older people are strongly urged to take a
blood-thinning drug to prevent blood clots and ward off a stroke.
The most commonly used blood thinner is the drug warfarin, also
known as coumadin.
</P>
<P>
   The atria are the upper chambers of the heart. One collects
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and the other collects
oxygen-poor, used blood from the rest of the body. The atria pump
their blood into the ventricles below. The right ventricle sends
blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen, and the left ventricle pumps
oxygen-rich blood to the body and the brain. Normally, the atria
contract just before the ventricles do, in a strong, synchronized
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In atrial fibrillation, the atrial rhythm becomes rapid and
irregular, and the abnormal rhythms can disrupt the beating of the
ventricles, causing an irregular or racing pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cannot always tell why a patient develops atrial
fibrillation. In some cases it is caused by some other form of
underlying heart disease, including coronary artery disease, a
heart attack or diseased heart valves. Lung disease, thyroid
disorders, diabetes and high blood pressure can also bring on the
condition. But in many cases, including Bradley's, it is
``idiopathic,'' meaning that doctors cannot figure out what caused
it.

 Another Tech IPO Soars, But Market Can Be Fickle  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Just a day after Sunnyvale's VA Linux Systems posted a record 697
percent surge in its initial public offering, an Internet company
called FreeMarkets showed some razzle-dazzle of its own, soaring
483 percent in its market debut yesterday.
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, these two IPOs followed Tuesday's 252
percent advance by an outfit named Andover.net.
</P>
<P>
   What do the three firms have in common? Simply put, each
represents a hot-button technology of the moment that Wall Street
thinks can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, as has been shown in a number of past IPOs, is
frequently mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that takes newcomers in particular niches and
embraces them and kisses them on both cheeks,'' said Ulric Weil, an
analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, when they are through, the investors say, `Next!'''
</P>
<P>
   Today's trend can be tomorrow's turkey. Like a schoolboy with
overactive hormones, Wall Street falls into and out of crushes as
quickly as it encounters a pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   And in today's Internet-powered, warp-speed world, that's mighty
quick indeed. This week's market action was a perfect case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMarkets, which counts prominent Silicon Valley venture
capitalist John Doerr among its board members, serves up two of
Wall Street's currently favorite fads: business-to-business
e-commerce and online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The company provides a venue for suppliers to bid on supply
contracts. Unlike traditional auctions, though, in this case the
prices go lower as the bidding proceeds, with the lowest bidder
winning the contract.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nifty idea, but it isn't profitable. In the nine months
ended September 30, FreeMarkets said it had sales of $13 million
but a loss of $13.5 million. It expects to keep losing money for
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is already well known, a solid bottom line is of
only passing concern to today's gimme-gimme investors. FreeMarkets'
stock rose $232 yesterday to close at $280.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have themes in the IPO market that people are going
bananas about,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with business-to-business and auctions, another theme du
jour is Linux, the free-to-all operating system touted as a viable
alternative to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Although nobody owns the Linux source code, a bunch of companies
are rushing to market with their own variations of the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux nailed investor sentiment dead on the nose Thursday
when its stock zoomed from an opening price of $30 to end its first
trading day at a whopping $239.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys had it all,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst with Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``They called themselves
`Linux,' their ticker symbol is LNUX.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might as well be called Dot-com.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that VA Linux has been bleeding money in its six
years of operation, losing nearly $30 million. And never mind that
the company's IPO filing says it ``expects to continue to incur net
losses for at least the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors don't look beyond the name and symbol,'' said Bill
Meehan, chief market analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.
``This is what happened with VA Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also what happened earlier in the week when Andover.net,
which runs Web sites aimed at Linux programmers, climbed in its
trading debut from $18 to $63.38 _ and this despite the ``Dutch
auction'' system that was intended to forestall huge first-day
pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's money to be made, providing that Linux turns out to be
a worthy competitor to Microsoft,'' Meehan said. ``It's not clear
if that's going to be the case, but it's not beyond the realm of
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Wall Street loves Linux not because of what it
is, but because of what it could be.
</P>
<P>
   The same logic applied a year ago to TheGlobe.com, an online
``community'' provider that skyrocketed more than 605 percent to
$63.50 in its IPO _ the record until VA Linux came along.
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe has lost quite a bit of steam since then. It closed
yesterday at $10.25.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody talks much about online communities anymore. Just as the
buzz has all but vanished for other formerly hot trends like
bandwidth-clogging push technology and the 3-D VRML programming
language.
</P>
<P>
   Investors used to say that content is king on the Net. That's
why MarketWatch.com, a financial news site, jumped more than 473
percent in its IPO earlier this year to $97.50. The company's stock
finished yesterday at $40.88 after trading below $30e a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the hype over online shopping this season, even
e-commerce _ the golden ticket to IPO riches just a few months back
_ has lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   While VA Linux was grabbing all the headlines Thursday, Redwood
City's Fogdog, an online sports retailer, climbed a mere 19 percent
to $13.13 in its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently had a hard time getting excited about a
company that, well, just sells stuff on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not to confuse investors with traders,'' said Shaun
Andrikopoulos, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in San
Francisco. ``Traders can be very fickle.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, he added, it's the long-term investor who
will usually come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading is a difficult way to make money,'' Andrikopoulos
said. ``It's not investing. It's gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also hard to forecast. Analysts say it's almost impossible
to predict the Next Big Thing that will catch the market's fancy
before the hype actually takes root.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies' Hogan said that in today's hyperactive market,
investors' enthusiasm for a particular trend can run from hot to
tepid virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who make the real money when a new stock goes ballistic
are the institutional heavyweights and the pack of day traders
yapping at their heels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors, if they're lucky, get no more than table
scraps, and usually at a much higher price than paid by the
institutional big boys. For this reason, Hogan observed, it's the
little guy who frequently gets burned when a company goes public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get in on a deal,'' he advised, ``you really don't
want it. If you really believe in a technology, let it come back
down before you buy.''

 Internet Services Help E-shoppers Who Are Stumped About What
to  Give 
 &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
I'm an avid e-shopper. I would far rather type my credit card
number into a computer than wait in a checkout line, and I love
letting the UPS guy lug my packages home for me.
<P>
   But can the Web help me find the perfect gift for my Aunt Irene,
Aunt Florence and Aunt Willadine in the Midwest? And what about my
3- three-  &LR; and 5-year-old nephews, Alex and Miles, who live in
Germany?
</P>
<P>
   Perusing my Christmas list this year, these were the relatives
who had me stumped. The aunts are all in their 70s. They live in
small towns in Ohio and don't have any of the interests _ like golf
or wine collecting or Zen Buddhism or day trading _ that seem to
dominate the American zeitgeist these days.
</P>
<P>
   As for Miles and Alex, I don't know what children enjoy other
than Pokemon, and I wasn't about to jump on that bandwagon. Because
the boys live abroad (their mother, my sister-in-law, is in the
Foreign Service), I haven't seen them in a while and don't have a
good handle on their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to ask the Web for help. Many sites these days have
gift-recommendation services that allow surfers to plug in the
amount they want to spend and characteristics of the recipient such
as age, gender and interests. Voila, a finely tailored list of gift
ideas appears. Theoretically.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, e-tailers' ability to offer ``smart'' services like
gift finding has import far beyond whether Auntie Flo likes her
Christmas present this year.
</P>
<P>
   A good gift finder can convert confused surfers into happy
shoppers _ meaning more revenue for the site. That's not chump
change  &LR;   &LR; when, according to Forrester Research, an estimated 8.6
million American households will spend $4 billion online this
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Value-added services like gift finding also give digital
merchants a compelling edge over their brick-and-mortar rivals, and
business economics favor the cyber set. Instead of having to hire a
fleet of sales associates to advise shoppers, an e-tailer need
merely install the appropriate software.
</P>
<P>
   Giftspot.com was the first place I looked for auntie ideas. The
site specializes in gift certificates but also has the simplest
kind of recommendation service _ a handful of ideas in the
categories of Women, Men, Kids and Teens, Romance, Office and Hard
to Buy For.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I had struck gold in my very first try when I clicked
``Women'' and up popped a cunning leopard-spotted handbag. ``Why
give my aunties something they might buy themselves?'' I reasoned,
imagining the appreciative murmur as Aunt Irene took her seat in
church clutching the spotted bag.
</P>
<P>
   But the photo was playing tricks on me. When I clicked on the
purse and got whisked away to Ebags.com, I discovered the tote was
only 8 eight  &LR; inches high. My aunties would never dream of carrying
a purse that can't hold at least a cubic foot of coupons, tissues
and lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Next I tried RedEnvelope.com, an attractive site that offered 10
``recipient'' choices, from Him to Pet; 13 occasions, from Birthday
to Just Because; and 16 areas of interest such as Entertaining.
Oddly, Christmas was not an occasion option, so I chose Anniversary
for Aunt Florence and Gardening as an interest, plus Her and the $0
to $50 price range.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening at Red Envelope, as it turns out, is a vastly
different undertaking than in Ohio, where gardening involves things
like flower bulbs and watering cans. Red Envelope's recommendations
included two desktop Zen sand gardens, a bonsai, a wreath, vases
and a candle holder.
</P>
<P>
   I typed in different occasions (Birthday, Just Because) and
areas of interest (Spa and Relaxation, Entertaining), but kept
pulling up the same yuppie tchotchkes and overpriced food
(chocolate-covered Oreos for $25. Hello! They're Oreos!).
</P>
<P>
   The most absurd was a 5-inch box of scented stones that cost
$30. Aunt Willadine would think I'd gone barking mad if I tried
slipping that under the Christmas tree. Briefly, I considered
starting my own Web site: Midwesternauntie.com, which would carry
large, sensible purses and garden trowels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, though, I noticed a button that allowed me to shop by
recipient, avoiding the finer slicing and dicing that didn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This one had a Grandmother option, which I chose because my
aunties are grandmother age. Finally, I spotted a gift that was
reasonably priced and perfect for Aunt Irene and Aunt Florence:
paper-white bulbs in a pretty glass vase for $25. Done.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Willadine was on my mind as I tried MySimon.com. MySimon
offered gift ideas in 16 categories like books, sports and toys. I
clicked on a couple of fun options _ bath beads shaped like bees,
chocolates with brandy centers. But MySimon was difficult to
negotiate; it kept linking me to other sites but not letting me
backtrack to MySimon. Eventually I gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Gifts.com, which told me in a pop-up popup  &LR; window
that shipping would be free if I ordered THAT DAY ONLY! I decided
to make an effort to find something for Aunt Willadine here, even
though the ad reappeared and I had to close it down each time I
revisited the home page, which was annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts.com had a wealth of categories: 14 areas of interests, 18
occasions and 16 recipient profiles. Once again, I was creative
with the categories. There was no Aunt, so I plugged in Mother. I
chose Birthday because Christmas or Holiday was not an option. (It
was available under a dedicated button, but not part of the
recommendation service.)
</P>
<P>
   And there it was: a crystal bud vase for $25 that seemed made
just for Aunt Willadine's jonquils. Done.
</P>
<P>
   Alex and Miles were next on the agenda. Their mother advised me
that Miles, 5, is discovering science and might like a chemistry
kit. I was impressed with her zest for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   My first stop was eToys, which I found to be well organized and
easy to use, with many different search options. Using the
ToySearch mechanism, I plugged in 4 to 5 Years Old and Science and
Nature to find something for Miles.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of cool stuff popped up, including several bug farms
that I immediately dismissed since I want to stay on my in-laws'
good side.
</P>
<P>
   Then I noticed a Scubascope Subsurface Viewer that kids can use
to look underwater while bathing or swimming. It linked to a whole
page of scopes, and soon I was checking out periscopes, zoomscopes,
megascopes and other snooping mechanisms _ all excellent training
tools for a young reporter-to-be, I couldn't help but think.
</P>
<P>
   I fell hard for the MegaScope, a combination telescope and
microscope, after reading this testimonial from Darren, 10, of
Urbana, Ill.: ``I can look at stars and I can look at bugs with it.
I can look at my other toys, too. Thank you, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   At $19.99, it was cheaper than chocolate-covered Oreos from Red
Envelope! The MegaScope went right into my shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   I also noticed that the MegaScope had won an award from a
parents organization, so I decided to check out other recommended
toys. EToys lists award winners for different ages, a great service
for gift givers who don't know much about kid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I questioned the awards' credibility a bit when I came across a
McDonald's Happy Meal Playshop that lets children make
cheeseburgers out of Play-Doh. What are we trying to teach our
children about nutrition, anyway? Still, I did find a very cool
walkie-talkie set for Alex.
</P>
<P>
   As I checked out, I found that EToys even ships abroad, which is
unusual among e-tailers. And the checkout service offered to
include batteries for the walkie-talkie and the scope, in the
appropriate wattage and number, in my order. I happily approved the
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my shopping was done, I decided to take a look at
ToysRUs.com for the sake of comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ToysRUs did not offer an award-winner category, so I tried the
EZ ToyFinder search mechanism. It didn't seem to be working. I
plugged in 3 to 4 Years Old and $10 to $25, but it came up empty
twice.
</P>
<P>
   As I clicked around in the 2-to-4-Years-Old category I found
myself wading through acres and acres of Barbies and baby dolls.
WNBA Barbie was interesting but not appropriate. I decided to end
my search there.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: Like so many other aspects of the infant Web, some
gift-recommendation services work well and some don't. But if my
experience is any example, the site that offers good
recommendations in well-organized categories is the one that will
win the loyalty of e-shoppers.

THE GEORGE W SMILE: IS THAT SIMPER FINITE A CAUSE FOR CHAGRIN?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Rsesnding to restore dropped word in hed) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not easy to read George W.'s lips.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the Cheshire cat's toothy grin and the Mona
Lisa's coy simper are the curiously curved lips of the Texas
governor and front-running Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a smirk, others a smile. Some say it makes George
W. Bush appear cocky and condescending; others say it's friendly
and frank. Whatever it is _ that pursed-lipped grin often
accompanied by raised eyebrows _ it has prompted comment from
C-Span viewers, online magazines and Kansas farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become a topic on local and national talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   But does facial expression really make a difference in a
presidential campaign? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   People expect their presidents to be ``cheerful and optimistic
and on the other hand, serious,'' said Jack Pitney, a political
analyst at Claremont McKenna College in California. To that extent,
he said, facial expressions ``can make a difference for some
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richard Nixon, in spite of his famous scowl, was twice
elected president, Pitney pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also elected Jimmy Carter, whose humorless grin got old
very fast,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz over Bush's mug began in the national news media.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit News columnist and conservative Fox News commentator
Tony Snow referred to the Bush expression as ``The Smirk'' in a
recent syndicated column. The s-word has popped up in the online
``Slate'' and ``Talk'' magazines; other journalists have called the
expression a ``jaunty grin,'' ``bemused smile'' and ``half-smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign classifies his expression as perfectly
affable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it is a smile,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's media
consultant. ``It's a bemused smile. I would describe it as
charming.''
</P>
<P>
   The look appears most often when the governor is in listening
mode: listening to a potential constituent on the campaign trail,
listening to an interviewer pose a question, listening to CNN's
John King toss him his first question of the Arizona debate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's TV appearances have accelerated, commentators and
viewers have keyed on his enigmatic grin. In September, a ``Talk''
magazine writer described Bush as ``smirking'' throughout a
conversation about the execution of Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span viewers made the grin a topic of conversation on a
call-in show after Bush's mid-November foreign policy address.
``The Wall Street Journal'' ran a story on ``the alleged smirk''
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Texans tend to cut their governor a little more slack than the
nation does.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``is a person who, by all accounts, has a wonderful sense
of humor,'' said James Riddlesperger, a Texas Christian University
professor of political science. He said that sometimes when you see
the look, ``It's almost a pained expression because he'd really
like to throw out a one-liner but knows he can't. He has a smirk,
but his eyes are dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't the first presidential candidate whose mug has
prompted discussion. Think back to Nixon, ``who was thought to look
shifty-eyed and who perspired a lot'' on televised debates, said
Alan Schroeder, a professor in the School of Journalism at
Northeastern University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he said, recall Dan Quayle, ``who had this kind of
frightened look in his eye that the camera exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with television is that it perpetuates these
visual stereotypes, but whether they're valid or not is anybody's
guess,'' said Schroeder, author of ``Presidential Debates: Forty
Years of High-Risk TV,'' which is scheduled for publication next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   All the couch-potato grin analysis has Paul King slightly
annoyed. King, an associate professor of speech communications at
TCU, has some news for would-be face readers: ``There's really no
such thing as body language,'' he said, adding that pundits who try
to read a candidate's kisser ``irritate me endlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Carlin, a professor of communication studies at the
University of Kansas, said members of the Kansas Agricultural Rural
Leadership Program happened to be discussing Bush's expression at a
recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about just this issue _ they had all noticed
it, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness, every one of us has things we do that we're
totally unaware of,'' added Carlin, who admits to raising her
eyebrows a lot. ``That's the reason people don't like to watch
themselves on a video.''

AFTER PLANE CRASH, RENEWED CALLS TO LIMIT AIR TRAFFIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y.)  By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HASBROUCK HEIGHTS, N.J. _ Residents of this town, where a plane
crashed on Thursday, killing all four people aboard, have been
trying for years to limit air traffic at nearby Teterboro Airport
amid increasing worries about noise and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, the second time in three weeks that a plane has
plummeted into a residential neighborhood in New Jersey, is causing
widespread concern. Air traffic at small airports in the nation's
busiest air corridor is increasing along with residential
development.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Teterboro Airport, a mile east of the crash site,
say that air traffic is safe and that there has not been a
significant increase in overall air traffic over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the crash of a twin-engine plane Thursday, prompted an
immediate outcry from residents and elected officials that the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns Teterboro, should
limit air traffic there. It has highlighted the growing tension
between residents of suburban communities surrounding New York City
and the directors of smaller regional airports trying to meet the
demand for more air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commerce and business that Teterboro provides is
important, but it should not supersede the quality of life of these
neighborhoods,'' said Rep. Steven R. Rothman, who visited the
accident site Friday with other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, located seven miles from Manhattan on 400 acres in
Teterboro and Moonachie has become a haven for private jets
transporting celebrities and business executives. Teterboro handled
198,466 general aviation takeoffs and landings in 1998, a 10
percent increase from 1997, according to the Federal Aviation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman, along with Sen. Robert Torricelli and others have been
calling for a flight curfew to keep planes from flying in and out
of the airport at night.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials said they would work with investigators
from the National Transportation Safety Board to see whether
changes are needed in airport operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned and saddened by yesterday's tragedy,'' said
Peter Yearkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority, which also
operates LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark International Airports. ``We
will cooperate in every way possible with the NTSB investigation.
There are a number of issues that will be examined as a result of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said there were limits to what the airport could do to
accommodate residents without hurting business. In every community
that has tried to impose restrictions on when aircraft could take
off or land, the courts have sided with the airports and declared
that curfews would be an unfair imposition on commerce, Yearkes
said. Some airports, however, have voluntary curfews.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and officials say the noise level has risen so sharply
in the last few years that some limits are urgently needed. The
number of jets flying out of Teterboro has increased to 81,766 in
1997 from 53,009 in 1987, according to the Port Authority. The
mayor of Hasbrouck Heights, William Torre, said such increases
could inevitably lead to more accidents like the one on Thursday,
and he renewed his plea for restrictions from federal aviation
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, help us minimize the risk so this doesn't happen again
in our town or the surrounding towns and the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, who was also at the crash site, called
on the FAA to conduct an emergency 60-day study to determine why
there have been an inordinate number of crashes in New Jersey this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that New Jersey is the most densely populated
state in the nation, so that airports, like Teterboro and Essex
County Airport in Fairfield, where John F. Kennedy Jr. took off
from on his fatal crash, and even Newark Airport, naturally present
more risk to residents.
</P>
<P>
   The number of fatalities in air crashes has gone down
nationally, to 621 in 1998 from 800 in 1988, the FAA said. But
crashes in densely populated areas that receive considerable news
media attention make people believe they are more common than ever,
said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, a Frederick, Md., group that represents 355,000
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In New York State, residents near the Westchester County
Airport, have also been complaining about the growing noise and
pollution. Westchester has the highest number of private aircraft
of any airport in the country, according to FAA reports, with
1,003.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bianchi, mayor and supervisor of Harrison, said that the
airport's parking lots, which were expanded during last airport
renovation, are already too small. But he said he would oppose
attempts to further expand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to turn it into JFK or LaGuardia,'' he said.
``Then they'll start flying in goods, warehouses will crop up
around the airport, and the whole complexion of suburbia will
absolutely change.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Spano, the Westchester County executive, recently ordered
a review of the airport's new noise monitoring system, said Susan
Tolchin, his communications director. She said that the county has
no plans to allow an expansion, but that the complaints about noise
have come mostly from neighbors closest to the airport, who say
many pilots ignore a voluntary curfew of midnight to 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of flights have increased in recent years, though
not by as much as at Teterboro. Westchester officials said that in
1998, there were 106,136 general aviation landings and takeoffs,
and 44,060 corporate ones. In 1989, there were 116,600 general
aviation landings and takeoffs, and 39,824 corporate ones.
</P>
<P>
   At Long Islands MacArthur Airport in Islip, N.J., which is owned
by the Town of Islip, air traffic increased since Southwest
Airlines began service last March with 12 daily nonstop flights.
</P>
<P>
   The number of passengers using the airport has more than doubled
from last year, according to town officials, increasing to more
than 200,000 in August, up from less than 92,000 the previous year.
So have complaints about the noise from nearby residents in an area
that is increasingly more populated.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say much of the noise is caused by the small private
jets that seem to land or take off late at night or early in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Lear Jets are loud,'' said Deborah Slinkosky of
Haolbrook, the chairwoman of Citizens for Enforcement of MacArthur
Airport Controls. ``They are flying these CEOs around, taking off
at 4:30 in the morning and coming in at 2:30 in the morning, and
besides being noisy, that could be extremely dangerous if anything
happens.''

IN SOCCER SEMIFINALS, SANTA CLARA DEFEATS CONNECTICUT IN 4TH
OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C., _ Santa Clara, the most experienced among the
four men's teams remaining for the national championship of college
soccer, went into the semifinals with six overtime victories in its
last eight games. Two of the overtime victories had come in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, against
Stanford in the first round and Alabama-Birmingham in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   So there was little surprise for the Broncos Friday when their
semifinal against Connecticut could not be decided in regulation
time.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty of joy for Santa Clara when Shawn Percell,
in the fourth overtime, scored his second goal of the game to give
the Broncos a 2-1 triumph over the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which took 138 minutes 50 seconds to achieve, not
only ended Connecticut's best season since it won the title in
1981, but it also put the Broncos in Sunday's championship game at
Ericsson Stadium against either UCLA or Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, the winner two years ago, played Friday's other semifinal
against Indiana, the defending champion, which eliminated Santa
Clara by 4-0 in last year's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal against Connecticut was Percell's fourth in the
tournament and it came from close range on a shot that went just
past Matt Chavlovich, the Connecticut goalkeeper, who left his near
post unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goalie cheated a little space in the near post,''
Percell said, ``and I took advantage. I struggled early in the
season, but the coach told me goals come in waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mitch Murray, who has been with Santa Clara since 1989, is
again within reach of a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara (16-3-3) lost the championship game in 1991 to
Virginia on penalty kicks and shared the title with Virginia in
1989 in frozen Rutgers Stadium. The icy conditions for that
championship game prompted the NCAA to put future tournaments in
warm climates.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Connecticut's first in the last 13 games. The
Huskies, who ended the season at 19-5-0, made their first
appearance in the semifinals since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was more technical in this game, but Santa Clara was
more practical. The Huskies tried to find their way through Santa
Clara's defense with short passes, quickness and speed as Santa
Clara employed more of a direct route with long passes.
</P>
<P>
   Percell scored his first goal in the 20th minute of regulation
when he stepped into an unguarded space and used his head to flick
home a free kick from the right side by Ari Rodopoulos to the far
post. It was his sixth goal of the season and third in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Lewis tied the score for Connecticut with a brilliant
individual effort and a blistering shot from 25 yards in the 56th
minute. The teams went back and forth without a goal after that
until Percell's winner 3:50 into the fourth sudden-death overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expended so much energy getting back their first goal,''
said Ray Reid, Connecticut's third-year coach. ``I thought that for
our first time here our guys did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut maintained possession for the most part, waiting for
the right opening, but Santa Clara's defense rarely allowed
Connecticut to threaten near its goal. The best chances for
Connecticut came on long shots.

ADMINISTRATION AND PUERTO RICO POINT FINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hopes for settling the dispute over bombing
exercises on the island of Vieques appeared to dwindle Friday, as
senior administration officials and the governor of Puerto Rico
differed over whether they had actually agreed on the future of a
bombing range there and, if so, what exactly they had agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   White House and Pentagon officials complained that the governor
had reneged on a promise to endorse President Clinton's proposals,
while the governor said the president had announced a plan that did
not reflect the actual negotiations with Puerto Rican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's compromise plan, recommended by Defense Secretary
William Cohen, rejected an earlier Navy recommendation to continue
live-fire exercises on Vieques and accepted a Puerto Rican demand
to halt the use of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also delayed several major decisions on the Navy's
future role in Vieques while the Navy and the Puerto Rican governor
discussed whether the military could resume exercises in March with
ordnance containing no explosives.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the package, the Navy offered the island $40 million
in economic revival money to show that it understands it must
``repair relations'' with the people of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   But just hours after the deal was announced last week by senior
military and civilian Navy Department officials, Gov. Pedro
Rossello publicly rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the Pentagon has now postponed several aspects of the
proposal and is discussing moves that could have a serious economic
impact on Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House was surprised by the rejection,'' a senior
administration official said. ``We had been led to believe that the
governor would endorse this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had crafted the compromise with the Navy and
Marines in recent weeks and was working under the assumption that
the White House had negotiated an agreement with Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House told us they believed the governor would
accept this,'' Cohen said in an interview. ``So, yes, I was
surprised when the governor did not support the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Rossello said that Cohen misunderstood what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the other way around,'' said Alfonso Aguilar, the
governor's spokesman. ``The president's plan did not reflect what
the governor had agreed to. We were surprised and disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Only President Clinton and several of his senior aides spoke
directly to Rossello. Clinton stepped into the negotiations on
Veteran's Day and spoke to the governor at least three times before
the proposal was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello believed that the president had agreed that the plan
would include legally binding commitments that the bombing on the
island would end and the Navy would leave, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Several defense officials said Friday that they believed the
confusion was the fault of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Vieques issue has brought a rare unity among the people of
Puerto Rico, who in turn have put it on the national political
agenda. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for senator from New
York State, which has a large Puerto Rican population, has sided
with Puerto Rico against the Navy. So has Vice President Al Gore,
whose presidential campaign co-chairman in Puerto Rico is Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House said it, too, was chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us was thrilled about where we ended up on Friday,''
the senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello will negotiate only with the president and his senior
aides in discussions on Vieques, and not with the Navy, his
spokesman said Friday, adding that the governor expected the
president to reconsider the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only dealing with the policy makers,'' Aguilar said.
``The Navy should understand its role in these things. The
commander in chief is the policy maker, and the Navy takes orders
from President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has postponed sending Rear Adm. Kevin Green to San Juan
as the special representative for Vieques, even though the
admiral's wife had already arrived there.
</P>
<P>
   And the senior administration official said Friday that without
a ``very good sense of whether these talks will go forward in the
next several weeks,'' the military would reconsider its entire
relationship with Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The territory is also home to Roosevelt Roads, one of the Navy's
largest bases and one of Puerto Rico's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pentagon officials, the White House and the
governor said they wanted to continue looking for some way to bring
the sides together to resume discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are complicated by the presence of hundreds of
demonstrators camping on the Vieques firing range who refuse to
leave for fear that the Navy will return. The range has been closed
since a civilian Puerto Rican guard was killed after Marine jets
dropped bombs that unintentionally hit an observation tower last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   That death galvanized Puerto Rican complaints against the Navy's
use of the 900-acre range on Vieques. The small island has high
unemployment; its residents have suffered health problems,
including a high incidence of cancer, and the island's coral reef
and wildlife have been threatened by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cohen said last week's proposal was the best the
Pentagon could offer. The loss of Vieques would mean the end of all
coordinated live-fire exercises on the east coast for the Navy. The
service says such training is essential as preparation for combat.
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official said the White House
appreciated that ``the Defense Department worked extremely hard''
on the proposal and had no intention of changing it. On the other
hand, the official said, the governor was also working hard to find
an accord, and the White House hoped to find a way to persuade both
sides that the only area of disagreement is how to implement the
proposal.

<P>
   USC football coach Paul Hackett said he intends to bring back
all of his remaining assistants coaches next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we've done what we needed,'' Hackett
said. ``As far as anyone being let go, that's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett fired offensive line coach Steve Greatwood two weeks
ago. Greatwood was replaced by tight ends coach Steve Morton, which
leaves a vacancy at that position.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate for the job could be former USC assistant coach
and Los Angeles Rams player Doug Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he will decide by Christmas how to shuffle some
responsibilities among the staff. One of the expected changes is
splitting up special teams duties.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff Classic update: USC is competing with Virginia Tech and
Oklahoma for the lone remaining spot in the Kickoff Classic
opposite Michigan. If Virginia Tech defeats Florida State next
month in the Sugar Bowl, the Hokies are expected to get the bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Kickoff Classic will not make a decision until January.

FRANJO TUDJMAN, EX-COMMUNIST GENERAL WHO LED CROATIA'S SECESSION,
IS DEAD  
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: A short version of this story, TUDJMAN-OBIT-SHORT, was
sent.)  
(js) 
 By DAVID BINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Franjo Tudjman, the onetime communist general who as a
reborn nationalist led Croatia in 1991 into secession from
Yugoslavia, and from there to independence and war, has died,
Croatian state television announced early Saturday. He was 77 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of Croatia, the founder of the independent
Croatian state, has died,'' the government announced in a special
newscast about 2 a.m. The report did not say when he died or give a
cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But Tudjman had been hospitalized since Nov. 1, when he
underwent emergency surgery for what was described as a perforated
intestine. He had been gravely ill in recent weeks and on life
support machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman was treated for cancer at the Walter Reed military
hospital in Washington in November 1996. There were reports in
Croatian newspapers this March that cancer had spread to his brain
and that he had undergone radiation on a tumor under the
supervision of French physicians in Zagreb, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Vlatko Pavletic, the parliamentary speaker to whom presidential
powers were transferred on Nov. 26, delivered a brief statement on
television Saturday morning. He said that Tudjman's contributions
to the Croatian people were ``undeniable'' and that he would remain
a ``symbol of determination.''
</P>
<P>
   In joining and then leading an age-old separatist drive for
Croatia's independence, Tudjman (pronounced TOODGE-mahn)
contributed heavily to the collapse of the Yugoslav Federation of
six republics _ and indeed to the defeat of the whole concept of
South Slav brotherhood, whose founding fathers had included leading
Croatian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.5 million Croats paid a heavy price: In the second half of
1991 more than 8,000 Croatian civilians and soldiers were killed
and more than a quarter of the republic fell under the control of
indigenous Serbs who feared domination.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 Croats were uprooted from their homes, a third of
the country's factories were ruined and a $4-billion-a-year tourist
industry largely collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand more ethnic Croats were killed in fighting with
Bosnian Muslims in 1993 and early 1994 as a result of Tudjman's
determination to create a homogeneous Croatian enclave in
Bosnia-Herzegovina that he eventually hoped to incorporate into his
state. That drive was blocked by U.S. intervention and mediation in
February 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman was one of the three ethnic leaders at the Dayton, Ohio,
talks convened by the Clinton administration in late 1995 to end
the Bosnian conflict, along with the Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic and the Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like the others he was a reluctant participant, although the
previous summer he had all but accomplished his goal of driving
ethnic Serbs from what he viewed as purely Croatian land.
</P>
<P>
   But he coveted more: the incorporation of most of western Bosnia
and much of Herzegovina into a ``Greater Croatia,'' as it had been
under Hitler's and Mussolini's protection in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With Tudjman's authorization, the bulk of this territory, a
Croatian puppet state, was named Herzeg-Bosna. But this state was
eliminated after some 50,000 NATO troops occupied
Bosnia-Herzegovina and all ethnic factions became subjects of
international authorities in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Tudjman finally secured Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium, the last enclaves controlled by Serbs in Croatia
who had rebelled against his state. This left only a disputed spit
of rocky land called Prevlaka, on the northwestern edge of the Bay
of Kotor facing Montenegro, still out of his reach and under
international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's governance of Croatia came under extremely harsh
criticism by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which accused him in a detailed report of harsh treatment
of the remaining Serbian minority, suppression of the press and
failure to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in
The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Three distinct phases characterized Tudjman's life _ as a World
War II Partisan officer, as a much-criticized historian and as a
politician. His life was full of contradictions: He was an
enthusiastic Yugoslav patriot who became an equally enthusiastic
Croatian nationalist. He was an ardent Communist who became an
ardent anti-communist. He was an atheist who gained the support of
the Catholic Church hierarchy in Zagreb and later in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Franjo Tudjman was born on May 14, 1922, the eldest of three
sons, in Veliko Trgovisce, a village in the hilly Zagorje region
that was also the birthplace of Tito, his onetime patron. His
mother died when he was 7. His father, Stjepan, the chief village
administrator, was active in the Croatian Peasant Party, the
nation's main political force between the two world wars. After the
Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the father and three
sons joined the Communist Partisans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout World War II Croatia was dominated by the nationalist
Ustase movement, which, though small, was given a free hand by the
Nazi occupation authorities to herd Serbs, Jews and Gypsies into
concentration camps and kill them. Most historians agree that at
least 500,000 civilians died in the Ustase camps.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war Stjepan Tudjman was named chairman of the
Communist Party committee in Zagreb. But in 1946 he and his second
wife, Olga, were found shot dead in their home. The police said the
two had committed suicide; four decades later Franjo Tudjman
claimed that his parents were killed by the communist secret
police, but the man he named as his source for the allegation
publicly denied it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Young Franjo completed grammar school in Trgovisce, then went to
middle school in Zagreb, where his studies were halted when the war
broke out. At 19 he returned to his home region, joined the
underground Communist Party and helped publish a Partisan
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He was named a divisional political commissar in 1944, the year
he met his future wife, Ankica, also a Partisan. She survives him,
with two sons, Miroslav and Stjepan; a daughter, Nevenka Kosutic;
and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman was commissioned a major in 1945 but did not see combat.
After the war he was sent to the Yugoslav High Military Academy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   When Stalin expelled Yugoslavia from the Soviet bloc in 1948,
Tudjman sided with Tito. In 1960, at the age of 38, he reached the
rank of major general, the youngest in Yugoslavia's peacetime
history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Tudjman published the first of many historical works,
``War Against War,'' about guerrilla warfare. In writing he found a
new vocation. He left the armed forces and with the support of Tito
and the Croatian Communist leadership, he became director of the
Institute of the History of the Working Class Movement in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   His party patrons also arranged his appointment as professor of
history at Zagreb University in 1963, although he lacked a doctoral
degree and his dissertation was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as storms gathered in the Communist Party around his
increasingly nationalist interpretations of contemporary Croatian
history, he sought and gained the protection of the leaders of
Matica Hrvatska, Croatia's premier cultural institution and an
incubator for revived nationalism, and he found a new vocation as a
nationalist politician.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he signed a petition demanding the linguistic separation
of the Serbo-Croatian language, which had also been a project of
the Ustase. This was too much for the Communists, who expelled him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, back in Croatia after a brief fellowship at Harvard, he
was arrested in a crackdown on ``nationalist counterrevolution''
and sentenced to two years in prison. Because of an appeal to Tito
by Miroslav Krleza, Croatia's reigning literary figure, he served
only 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite prohibitions, he continued to publish nationalist
tracts, the most controversial being a 505-page treatise in 1989,
``Impasses of Historical Reality,'' in which he questioned the
generally accepted numbers of victims of World War II genocide by
the Germans and the Ustase. He put the number of Jews killed in the
Holocaust at 1 million instead of 6 million _ and enraged Serbs and
Jews by diminishing their numbers killed in Croatia's main death
camp, at Jasenovac, from over 500,000 to 59,639.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Impasses'' he also wrote: ``A Jew is still a Jew. Even in
the camps they retained their bad characteristics: selfishness,
perfidy, meanness, slyness and treachery.'' In 1992 he said his
comments had been ``misinterpreted,'' and in 1994 he offered ``an
apology'' in a letter to B'nai B'rith, saying he intended to delete
``controversial portions'' from later editions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, as a presidential candidate of the Croatian Democratic
Union, Tudjman declared that the ``Independent State of Croatia''
established by the Ustase ``was not simply a Quisling creation and
a fascist crime, it was also an expression of the historical
aspirations of the Croatian people.'' He again harped on
nationalist themes, saying at one point, ``Thank God, my wife is
neither a Serb nor a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian Democratic Union, founded as a nationalist party
with a program of separatism, was heavily financed by members of
the Croatian diaspora, especially by remnants of the Ustase
movement in the United States, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's presidential campaign also greatly profited from the
effect on Croats of rising nationalism in neighboring Serbia under
his principal adversary, Milosevic, the communist leader who had
became Serbia's president.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators like Bogdan Denitch, a Serbian historian with
Croatian citizenship, observed that Tudjman had a symbiotic
relationship with Milosevic, each strengthening his own power by
painting the other as a satanic menace.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Serbian and Croatian presidents conferred several times
in 1991. The main topic was their plan to divide territories of
Bosnia-Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia, with Serbs taking
most of the southeast and Croats taking most of the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman confided to friends that he did not really hate Serbs,
but that he detested Bosnian Muslims. In May 1995 in London he told
Paddy Ashdown, a Liberal Democratic member of Parliament, that he
preferred Milosevic to Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Muslim leader, whom
he described as ``an Algerian and a fundamentalist.'' For the
public record he said, ``There are tendencies to create an Islamic
state in Europe, which is unacceptable to international sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an alliance with Izetbegovic brokered by the Clinton
administration in 1994, Tudjman sympathized with the Croatian
historians who held that Bosnian Muslims were ethnic Croats who had
converted to Islam under pressure from Ottoman rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman also enraged Croatia's Serbs _ there were 600,000 of
them, 12 percent of the population _ by ramming through a
constitution in 1990 that proclaimed Croatia ``the national state
of the Croatian nation.'' When the new Croatian authorities began
wholesale dismissals of Serbs from civil service jobs, Serbian
communities began arming themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the fighting began, Croatia evaded a U.N. arms
embargo imposed in 1991 on all parts of former Yugoslavia,
receiving tanks and artillery pieces from Germany and buying jet
fighters and helicopters from Russia and Ukraine. Germany's promise
of early recognition of Croatia's independence, declared in the
summer of 1991, also greatly helped Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Skirmishing between Croatian militias and Serbs spread through
the spring of 1991 and erupted into full-scale fighting in the
summer and fall. In late December 1991, after Serbian sieges of
Dubrovnik and Vukovar, Tudjman finally agreed to a cease-fire, but
in April 1993, growing more confident, his forces attacked the
Muslim-led army in central Bosnia in order to secure regions with
Croat majorities. After 10 months of fighting, the United States
brokered a truce that evolved into a fragile federation between the
Muslims and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In his capital, Tudjman lived luxuriously, indulging a taste for
champagne and caviar. For his official residence, he used Tito's
former villa, a grand house atop a hill overlooking Zagreb that
belonged to a Croatian Jewish family before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's style of rule included a heavy dose of public
appearances exhaustively covered by the state television channel.
``In the Croatian media his cult is much bigger than Tito ever
had,'' said Mihajlo Mihajlov, a Yugoslav scholar who shared
dissident platforms with Tudjman in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As president the burly, silver-maned Tudjman emulated Tito down
to his white commander in chief's uniform (replete with nine medals
he awarded himself in May 1995), and his enjoyment of Tito's yacht
and Tito's vacation palace on Brioni Island.
</P>
<P>
   Denitch wrote in ``Ethnic Nationalism'' in 1994 that Tudjman
``had all of Tito's vices and not a single one of his virtues.''

DEEP IN THE WILDERNESS, A GROWTH INDUSTRY IS BLOOMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY with BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERYL, Utah _ For parents like Mitchell and Jill Friedman of
Great Neck, N.Y., the decision to enroll a child in a wilderness
program for troubled teenagers is born of desperation, a last
chance to rescue a life endangered by drugs, crime or simply
aimlessness. In the Friedmans' case, the outcome was worth the
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful _ I'm crying,'' Friedman said this week at the
graduation of his son, Jeffrey, from the Redcliff Ascent Outdoor
Therapy Program. ``The last year has been hell. Every day he was
out of school, on the streets, somewhere, we were terrified. When
we got him here, we finally breathed easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey had just spent 83 days in the desert here in
southwestern Utah, in a minimalist world without music, television
or cellular phones. Like other wilderness therapy programs,
Redcliff tries to strip away bad habits, build character and
restore self-esteem by forcing teenagers to fend for themselves and
one another through a daily routine of hiking, campfire-building,
food preparation and latrine-digging, as well as high school course
work. Counselors lead the participants through quiet periods of
introspection each day, and psychiatrists and psychologists visit
once a week to measure progress.
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction of people like the Friedmans notwithstanding,
wilderness therapy has not been entirely trouble-free. In a widely
publicized episode last Saturday, eight Redcliff boys accosted two
counselors and fled into the desert. And over the last 10 years, at
least four teenagers have died in such programs. Further, some
experts question whether the approach provides any long-lasting
benefits to wayward youths, contending that the results of
``shocking'' them with outdoor hardships quickly wear off when they
return to their homes and, frequently, renew old habits with old
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the successes have apparently been common enough to make
this a growth industry. While the concept of wilderness therapy is
hardly new _ the Dallas Salesmanship Club opened one of the first
such camps for troubled youth 51 years ago _ it has exploded in
recent years. Where there were once just a few scattered operations
around the country, there are now hundreds of companies, most of
them in Western states.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the experts say, the programs' popularity
stems from a growing inability of public schools to deal with
severe behavioral problems or to identify signs of alienation that
lead to drug use or violence. More families are seeking alternative
solutions, and the robust national economy has enabled many to
afford them. (Redcliff charges as much as $350 a day, and some
teenagers stay for two months or more.) State and local courts also
use the programs, as an alternative to jail.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the precise number of such programs, or the
industry's rate of success. So many of the programs are new, their
services are provided in varied settings, and no scientific survey
has ever tried to measure their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Sklarow, executive director of the Independent
Educational Consultants Association, a nonprofit company in
Fairfax, Va., that helps families find solutions for their troubled
children, said the number of programs had grown to ``several
hundred,'' compared with fewer than 25 less than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a camp's population has swollen as well. Mitch Cole,
manager of the Redcliff administrative office here, said that as
recently as five years ago, only 16 teenagers were enrolled in the
program on any given day. Now as many as 64 are participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with children at risk is really a growth industry,''
said Helene Reynolds, an educational consultant in Princeton, N.J.,
who has recommended wilderness therapy programs, including
Redcliff, to her clients. (One of those clients, she said, was the
family of a boy involved in the assault on the counselors last
Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth has brought a hodgepodge of oversight. There is
no national regulation of the industry, and regulation by the
states varies widely. Two industry organizations are engaged in
accrediting or monitoring therapeutic wilderness programs for
health, safety and program content, but one, the Association of
Experiential Education, a trade group in Boulder, Colo., has
accredited only seven of the 165 of its members that offer some
form of therapy. And the other, the National Association of
Therapeutic Schools and Programs, in Savannah, Ga., which was
formed in January, has yet to develop any standards, although it is
working with 67 programs in 26 states.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Wells, executive director of the Koch Crime Institute, a
research organization in Topeka, Kan., said that while the outward
appearances were different, the underlying philosophy of wilderness
programs was the same as that of military-style boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic premise is that the lack of discipline and structure
in their life has led them to bad decisions,'' Wells said of the
participants. ``Therefore, if you provide them with the structure,
it will lead them to better decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, of Redcliff, conceded that wilderness programs were once
typically run by people who had more of a military background than
experience in therapy work. It was not uncommon, he said, to hear
stories of youths' being treated as if they were attending boot
camp.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he said, Utah and most other states have strict health
and safety regulations against the use of physical force, hazing or
food deprivation as a means of discipline. A misbehaving Redcliff
teenager who violates the rules by cursing will most likely be
punished by having to carry a small rock on the next hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, there's a constant reminder of breaking the rule,''
Cole said. ``It also teaches you that there are consequences to
your actions.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the last decade four teenagers, three of them in
Utah, have died at wilderness camps because of mistreatment or
abuse, said Bob MacDougall, who licenses the programs for the Utah
Department of Human Services. The last of the Utah deaths occurred
in 1994, he added, and all three companies involved in those deaths
are now out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Sutton of Ripon, Calif., whose daughter, Michelle,
died nine years ago after a week in a defunct Utah wilderness
program called Summit Quest, said counselors had accused Michelle
of faking flulike symptoms. Her death was attributed to
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   And after Nicholaus Contreraz, 16, died of a lung infection last
year at the Arizona Boys Ranch in Oracle, Ariz., his family won a
$1 million settlement of a wrongful-death lawsuit that claimed he
had been a victim of physical abuse at the hands of his counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other wilderness programs, Redcliff teaches its
lessons of respect, compassion and self-esteem against a tableau of
uninterrupted weeks, or even months, of hiking and camping through
580 square miles of rugged desert in southwestern Utah, where
nighttime temperatures in winter routinely fall below 10 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The campers are sent out with only necessities: Clothes
appropriate for the time of year, sleeping gear and food, which
they prepare for themselves and consume with utensils they carve
out of tree branches. They dig their own latrines.
</P>
<P>
   A Walkman? A portable radio? Forget it. Not even a wristwatch is
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Rules are strictly enforced, and they include taboos against
cursing, sarcasm and any questions about time beyond the present.
</P>
<P>
   Program officials say they have found that the spartan regimen,
which stresses teamwork over individualism and provides time for
intense personal introspection through individual and group
therapy, is the most direct way to save a wayward life.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said that through follow-up interviews with parents six
months after graduation, Redcliff officials estimated their success
rate at 70 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Friedman, who acknowledged that before he entered the
program his life in Great Neck had collapsed into daily use of
marijuana and indifference toward school, said he now easily
recognized the parallel between working with a group in the wild
and getting along with his parents and two older sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot more about how things I did affected the
group, like they affected my family,'' he said. ``In the group, you
have to work together. I realized that at home I was acting
selfishly, and it brought down the whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Chavin of Evanston, Ill., also graduated this week. His
parents, Scott and Judy Chavin, stared at him in near-disbelief
when he said, ``I don't feel like Todd anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've truly changed,'' he added. ``I feel totally different.
I'm happy again. I don't want to go home and smoke dope with my
friends. I want to move on with my life and become a man.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ One day after tying the legendary Bill
Shoemaker, Laffit Pincay Jr. raced past him Friday, becoming the
winningest jockey in thoroughbred history by picking up victory No.
8,834 in his 44,647th ride.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker had held the distinction of being the winningest
jockey for 29 years, but Pincay, who turns 53 on Dec. 29, took it
over by going virtually wire to wire aboard Irish Nip, a 3-year-old
maidshowed a liking for the Hollywood Park turf as well as
the champagne that Pincay's fellow jockeys sprayed in all
directions during a wild winner's circle celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I won the Kentucky Derby all over again,'' said a
beaming Pincay, who won that classic once, in 1984 on Swale.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Nip, a son of Irish River, was making his second career
start and was sent off as the 5-2 favorite in the 1 1/16-mile race.
He dueled for the lead with Laps n'Bounds down the backstretch,
inched clear turning into the stretch and won by two lengths,
paying $7.60 for a $2 bet to win. Pincay waved his fist in triumph
as he crossed the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laffit has conducted himself with dignity all through his
career, he's had ups and downs and he never gave up,'' said
Shoemaker, who watched the race in the jockeys room in his
wheelchair. ``He's ridden in rain and sleet and snow and never took
off a mount. I'm very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay said, ``Thank you, Shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration included the presentation to Pincay of a white
Porsche, driven into the winner's circle by his fellow Hall of Fame
jockey Chris McCarron. The car was a gift from four Southern
California race tracks, in appreciation of Pincay, who decided two
years ago to shoot for the record on the tough local circuit rather
than move to the softer competition of northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the trainers and owners who supported me my
whole career,'' Pincay said. ``And I want to thank Hooper, who gave
me the opportunity to come to this country and ride for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay was referring to Fred Hooper, now 102, who brought Pincay
to the United States from Panama in 1966 and launched his American
career at Arlington Park outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Pincay fashion, the jockey cut short a postrace
interview to ride his next scheduled mount _ Storm Dog _ who ended
up ninth in a 10-horse race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to disappoint anybody,'' Pincay said.
</P>
<P>
   The winning trainer, Richard Mandella, teamed with Pincay and
Lazy Lode to win the $400,000 Grade I Hollywood Turf Cup last
weekend. ``I didn't realize how special this would be until he got
to the eighth pole,'' Mandella said. ``I was cussing him when he
took him to the lead. But I was riding along with him down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony included video tributes by several Hall of Fame
jockeys, including John Longden, who held the record that Shoemaker
broke in 1970, and 46-year-old Pat Day, who is next in line with
7,614 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps going, Pat Day has a good chance to break Laffit's
record,'' McCarron said. ``You've got to have the dedication and
work ethic that Laffit has. Laffit could ride until he's 60. He
could win 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is one victory behind Pat Valenzuela for the current meet
lead at Hollywood Park with eight racing days left. A riding title
would be his 13th at Hollywood and first anywhere since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay said he hoped to ride ``one or two more years'' and did
not know what he would do after retiring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaker capped a remarkable comeback for Pincay, who
overcame the suicide of his first wife in 1985 only to be abandoned
by trainers once he turned 50. At the time, it was believed that
age and years of virtual starvation to make riding weight had
robbed him of his talents.
</P>
<P>
   But sticking religiously to an 850-calorie daily diet, Pincay
rededicated himself to chase Shoemaker. The mounts and victories
picked up, and the pace accelerated this summer.  &QL;

IRAQ RULES OUT A VISIT BY THE POPE; POLITICAL FACTORS ARE CITED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In the first major setback to Pope John Paul II's
ambitious travel plans for the millennium, the Vatican said Friday
that Iraq had ruled out a planned papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic leader, who has long dreamed of
visiting major biblical sites in 2000, had badly wanted to stop in
Ur, an ancient city in Iraq believed to be the birthplace of
Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   But Vatican diplomats were unable to reach an agreement with
Iraqi officials over a visit that the pope viewed as a strictly
religious pilgrimage, but that was fraught with political overtones
for both President Saddam Hussein and the United States, which had
lobbied against a papal visit, fearing it could lend legitimacy to
the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the hope that a visit to Ur could yet be resurrected,
Vatican officials gave a carefully neutral explanation Friday of
how their diplomacy with Baghdad broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraqi authorities have informed the secretariat of state that
the abnormal conditions in which Iraq finds itself due to the
embargo and the no-flight zone, as well as the general situation in
the region, do not permit a visit by the Holy Father to Ur to be
organized properly,'' the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed the embargo in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. American and British planes have patrolled
no-flight zones in north and south Iraq since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's announcement, a senior Vatican official
explained privately that the Iraqis appeared preoccupied with the
idea that the pope, by asking the United Nations to permit his
plane to fly into Iraq, would in some way legitimize the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican official said its envoys in Baghdad had explained
that the pope would not ask for permission, but would merely inform
the United Nations of his travel plans. But even though the pope
has often condemned the sanctions, that argument failed to reassure
Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government may also have feared that during his trip,
the pope would preach about human rights, as he does in almost
every country he visits. Baghdad gave a strong hint of its concerns
last fall, in a letter by Iraqi intellectuals published by the
state news agency, which lectured the pope on what he should say
during his visit, and expressed reservations about his message to
Christians in a predominantly Muslim culture.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials let it be known that they were offended by the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   American and British official visitors to the Vatican had
lobbied against the trip, fearing that a papal meeting with Hussein
would break the isolation imposed on Iraq. But the Vatican, which
rejected those overtures as unwarranted interference in its
affairs, was ultimately unable to overcome Baghdad's misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iraq, where preparations for the visit to Ur had already
begun, Catholic officials expressed their belief that the trip had
only been postponed, not canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Raphael I Bidawid of the Chaldean Church told the
Vatican's missionary news service, Fides, that concerns about the
pope's security had put off the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pope plans to visit the Holy Land in March, but there are
lingering questions about his trip to Nazareth, where the Catholic
Church is opposed to the building of a mosque next to the city's
main Catholic shrine.

KEEN COMPETITION FOR A GROWING NUMBER OF INTERNET USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ At a lavish party here in mid-November to
commemorate its introduction in Latin America's largest country,
the future in Brazil seemed bright for America Online. The top
Internet service provider rented a concert hall and treated 1,700
guests to champagne, hors d'oeuvres and a show by Carlinhos Brown,
the dreadlocked percussionist popstar.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later the outlook for America Online in Brazil, the
world's seventh-largest Internet market, is a bit clouded.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Loureiro, the president of AOL Brazil, abruptly left
the company amid differences with other executives. Loureiro's
departure came at the same time consumer protection authorities
were reported to be weighing the possibility of fining AOL as much
as 3 million reais, or about $1.4 million, after numerous
complaints over the alteration of online browsing systems by the
company's installation software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be that because of their tremendous growth in the
United States that they just packed their bags and headed to
Brazil,'' said Louana d'Oliveira, the president of Sky3, a
Florida-based consulting firm specializing in Latin America's
Internet industry. ``The need to brand their product beforehand, to
entice and educate consumers, didn't seem to be a priority in
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL's troubles reflect the tumultuous and highly competitive
environment that American Internet companies are facing as they
seek to expand their presence in other countries like Brazil.
Yahoo!, Microsoft, Telefonica and the New York-based StarMedia
Network have made significant investments in this country of 165
million people to lure clients to their services.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are eyeing Brazil's estimated 6.8 million
Internet users, which puts the nation behind Australia and ahead of
China and France when ranked by number of users, according to
Computer Industry Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people using the Internet in Brazil more than
doubled this year, with similar growth expected in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while other foreign companies were earlier in initiating
Portuguese-language portal sites or dial-up services in a push to
compete with domestic companies, AOL was a relatively late arrival.
When America Online did establish operations in Brazil as part of a
$200 million investment in Latin America with the Cisneros Group of
Venezuela, its partner in the region, the company chose to repeat a
strategy that helped to build its success in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this meant slick promotions and the distribution of
free CD-ROM installation kits that, in some cases, altered the
characteristics of browsing systems used to navigate the Internet.
According to some complaints, the installation software added
unexpected customization features to browsers and, in some cases,
routed users to America Online as their home page.
</P>
<P>
   Although AOL officials said that Loureiro's departure was not
related to problems from complaints, it was untimely since the
company was in the midst of a major advertising campaign to
familiarize Brazilians with its service.
</P>
<P>
   AOL maintains that the Brazil debut has been the most successful
in the company's experience in the United States or other
countries, with 65,000 customers signed up so far, and with usage
by these clients more than twice as much as forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company has established its entry without
resorting to price cuts, although competitors have been rattled
enough by the arrival of AOL to cut their prices. AOL charges 35
reais, or about $18, a month. Universo Online, the biggest Internet
service provider in Brazil with 600,000 customers, cut its prices
from 35 reais to 19.95 reais two days after AOL began service, and
smaller providers made similar cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's reliance on the CD-ROM software promotion to build a
customer base has stumbled. Aside from the installation complaints,
AOL learned recently that the Brazilian company that produced the
CD-ROMs accidentally released several hundred of them with music by
Raca Negra, a rock band, that not all the company's potential
customers would necessarily appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Herington, the AOL executive who is filling in as head
of the Brazilian subsidiary until a replacement for Loureiro is
chosen, said the company was moving fast to limit the damage from
its CD-ROM miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll alter our software if that's what's needed,'' Herington
said. ``We're ready to react fast to customer demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding AOL's problems in catering to the taste of the
Brazilian consumer, the company has been engaged in a yearlong
legal battle with a small Internet concern, Curitiba America, in
southern Brazil over the rights to its domain name. The case, one
of this country's first examples of litigation regarding trademarks
and addresses on the World Wide Web, has kept AOL from using the
domain name aol.com.br.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the case being resolved for another two years,''
said Luiz Edgard Montaury Pimenta, the lawyer representing AOL.

OROSCO RETURNS TO METS AS WINTER MEETINGS BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Less than an hour after he arrived on the
scene, Steve Phillips struck. The general manager who a year ago
brought the Mets Robin Ventura, Armando Benitez and Roger Cedeno
pulled off the first trade of baseball's winter meetings Friday.
But Jesse Orosco will not replace the offensive production that
John Olerud took to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jesse Orosco is coming home. The Mets, with whom the
42-year-old relief pitcher began life as a major-leaguer, got him
back by trading Chuck McElroy to the Baltimore Orioles. But the
swap will not rival the one that will send Ken Griffey Jr. closer
to home. Wherever that is, whenever that happens.
</P>
<P>
   This was an exchange of left-handed relievers who have had
better seasons than they had last season. Orosco had a 5.34 earned
run average in 65 games and walked 20 batters in 32 innings, but he
also struck out 35. McElroy, whom the Mets obtained from Colorado
last July 31, had a 5.50 ERA in 56 games, though he was better with
the Mets, at 3.38 in 15 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different,'' Orosco said in a conference
call, commenting on his return to the Mets 12 years after they
traded him to Los Angeles. Referring to an interleague game at Shea
Stadium, he added: ``When I went there two years ago, it was
tingling. I was nervous. This will be different. I'll be in a Mets
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco, who gained a career-high 31 saves in a Mets uniform in
1984 and was a postseason hero in 1986, had to approve the trade as
a player who has 10 years in the majors, including the last five
with the same team. He said he approved it because he liked the
makeup of the Mets. But he also approved it because he did not want
to pitch for the Orioles' new manager, Mike Hargrove, who was
Orosco's manager in Cleveland nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   After Phillips announced the trade, he was asked _ jokingly _ if
his work at the meetings was done. ``Obviously,'' he said,
laughing, ``we have a lot to do. We're going to be very busy
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' primary goals are to replace Olerud at first base and
to add hitting. While at the five-day meetings, he will talk to
agents for several free agents, including first basemen David Segui
and David Nilsson and outfielder Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's agent said Thursday that the Mets were seriously
interested in his client, who hit 95 home runs the past two
seasons, but that the Mets had not made an offer. They are waiting
to see what other teams might vigorously pursue Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   One player the Mets will not acquire is Carlos Delgado. The
Toronto Blue Jays signed Delgado, their first baseman, Friday,
giving him $36 million for three years. He had rejected their
previous offer of $12 million a year for five years, and they had
rejected his request for $38.25 million for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who last season hit 44 home runs and drove in 134 runs,
accepted less money because the Blue Jays added a provision that
will allow him to demand a trade after next season. If he makes
such a demand and the Blue Jays do not trade him by the following
Feb. 15, he can become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name hovering over the meetings is Griffey. The Mets
are among a very few teams that will at least talk with the Seattle
Mariners about the possibility of a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk to everybody,'' Phillips said when asked
specifically about his interest in Griffey. ``We'll see how we fit
with those teams. Seattle is one of those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have never told the Mets which of their players
they would want, and an executive familiar with the talks between
the teams said the Mets had not made an offer for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds continue to be considered the team most
likely to acquire the superstar center fielder. Jim Bowden, their
general manager, is scheduled to meet with Pat Gillick, the
Mariners' general manager, on Saturday morning. They have talked
many times by telephone the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball people believe the only thing blocking a trade is
Pokey Reese, the Reds' second baseman. The Mariners want him; the
Reds do not want to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question you'd love to have the other guy, but I don't want
to move Pokey,'' said Jack McKeon, the Reds' manager, who
acknowledged that he had no say in the talks. ``Pokey's a great
kid. I love him. But I don't have any control over it. They'll do
what they think is best for the club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets acquired Orosco because, Phillips said, he is better at
getting left-handers out than John Franco and Dennis Cook, the
other two left-handers in their bullpen. ``Jesse gives us better
balance in the bullpen with situational left-handers,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the four seasons before 1999, Orosco held left-handed batters
to a .166 average. But he was not as effective last season. They
hit .270 against him.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much difference economically in the trade. McElroy
has two years left on his contract at salaries of $1.35 million and
$1.45 million. Orosco will have a $1.1 million salary next season,
and the Mets have an option in 2001 for $1.3 million. But the
option will become guaranteed if Orosco pitches in 55 games next
season. The last time he didn't pitch in that many games in a full
season was 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Orosco was asked Friday how much longer he plans to play. He
said his agent and his wife were conspiring to get him to pitch to
age 50. ``I was laughing at it,'' he said. ``Now it's starting to
scare me.''

U.S. IS TRYING TO PUT TEETH IN INSPECTIONS OF IRAQ ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As disagreements between the United States and
Russia continue to delay action on a new arms inspection plan for
Iraq, independent disarmament experts are divided over how
important it is to try to put in place an airtight monitoring
system if the cost is security council unity against President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The council Friday put off a vote on the inspection plan until
Monday at the request of China, which, like Russia, has
reservations. But council members did extend the ``oil for food''
program in Iraq for six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a case where the best is the enemy of the
good,'' said Spurgeon M. Keeny, Jr., president of the Arms Control
Association, a Washington research organization that publishes Arms
Control Today. ``Obviously the best would be to get rid of the
Iraqi regime and find every last piece of equipment that
accumulated before the gulf war or since, but we can't get
international support for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeny, a former deputy director of the United States Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, advises the United States to be
flexible where possible to gain consensus, then ``claim victory and
get on with perfecting the continued inspection regime.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in an interview Friday as American and British
diplomats spent another day trying to narrow differences with
Russia, China and, on some points, France, in order to avoid a
Russian veto of the resolution creating a new weapons monitoring
commission for Iraq, where there have been no international
inspections for a year.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian veto would kill the plan, leaving in place economic
sanctions on Iraq that may become increasingly unenforceable. A
Russian abstention would advertise council divisions, a boon to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians argue that if _ a big if _ Iraq is judged to be
cooperating with a new inspection and monitoring system to be
installed by the proposed United Nations Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency within a given period of time or has met a predetermined
list of tasks, then sanctions should be suspended while further
inspection work goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants the arms inspectors to list tasks to be
accomplished after, not before, they begin work on the ground. In
the past, these demands on the Iraqis have included providing
documents, allowing interviews with Iraqi officials or opening of
new sites to inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and French complain that the wording in the
resolution, introduced formally Friday by the British, is not clear
enough about what the Iraqis are expected to do and is therefore an
invitation for Americans to move the finish line at will.
</P>
<P>
   The American representative, Peter Burleigh, disagreed, saying
that three paragraphs in the resolutions make it ``very clear what
needs to be done.'' He called the draft now being considered ``an
artful and constructive way of dealing with some difference of
opinion in the council.''
</P>
<P>
   But attempts to juggle wording to prevent a Russian veto worry
David Albright, president of the independent Institute for Science
and International Security in Washington and a former nuclear
inspector in Iraq. He notes as an example that an earlier provision
suggesting that experts could be drawn from Unscom, the previous
inspection commission, has been stripped from the final draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking out that language is certainly a warning,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough questions in the resolution that the next
steps are going to be critically important in determining the
effectiveness of the inspection regime,'' he said. ``Who will be
the head of the commission? Will Unmovic (the inspection team) have
sufficient experience to conduct inspections? Will their decisions
be constantly second-guessed by security council members, who will
have authority to approve or disapprove the inspectors' work
plans?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the former executive chairman of the inspection
team, said that the resolution seems to give the new commission far
less independence than he had. ``Its head will be supervised by
what can only be called a political board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Commissioners intended to oversee the commission
will have the right to review all its policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mandate seems right, but the instrument through which it
is to be achieved has been made far less independent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a unique disarmament commission as a tool of
policy was an interesting experiment, said Ruth Wedgwood, a law
professor at Yale. ``''When Unscom was founded it was a brilliantly
new form of multidimensional verification,'' she said. ``But the
experiment is somewhat spoiled already because any future target of
an Unscom inspection could take heart from Iraq's success in
breaking up the security council alliance.''

TEXT OF LETTER FROM BRADLEY'S DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BRADLEY-HEART) 
(js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is a letter to former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
from his doctor, Robert H. Heissenbutel. The letter, which was
dated Thursday, was made public Friday by Bradley's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I am writing to inform you about the results of your examination
on Dec. 3, 1999. At that time you were feeling well with no
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, you were found to have atrial fibrillation with no
precipitating cause, nor any cardiac disease identified. You were
cardioverted to regular sinus rhythm. Over the next two years you
had four episodes, and in 1998 you had two cardioversions. Since
May of 1998, after your third and last cardioversion, you have been
treated with Procanbid. Over this year-and-one-half you have had
two brief episodes of atrial fibrillation, which converted
spontaneously. The medication has been effective in preventing or
shortening the duration of episodes and has been well tolerated
with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   On examination your blood pressure was 118/68, pulse 55 _
regular. The physical examination was normal.
</P>
<P>
   In April of 1999 you had a routine colonoscopy with removal of a
small benign polyp. At that time your PSA was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Your recent laboratory studies included a normal CBC and
differential, urinalysis, ESR, glucose, liver function, kidney
function studies. Lipid profile: total cholesterol 161,
triglycerides 58, HDL cholesterol 58, LDL cholesterol 91
(excellent). Electrocardiogram; regular sinus rhythm, unchanged
from May 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On 12/3/99 you had stress echocardiography performed. Your
exercise tolerance was excellent and you had no symptoms at 91
percent of predicated maximal heart rate. There was no indication
of ischemia and your heart function was normal.
</P>
<P>
   In summary you have had, over the past three years, episodes of
atrial fibrillation, treated for the past year-and-one-half with
Procan, during which time you had only two short episodes, which
spontaneously reverted to regular rhythm. You have been evaluated
and found to have no structural heart disease. When you have atrial
fibrillation, you note an irregular heart beat but have no other
symptoms. Thus, this rhythm does not, in any way, interfere with
your ability to function. Other than the arrhythmia you have no
other health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years you have enjoyed maintaining a high level of
physical conditioning, which I would encourage you to continue.

NYSE AND NASD PROPOSE INCREASED MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR DAY
TRADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to concerns raised by stock clearing firms
and regulators, the New York Stock Exchange and the National
Association of Securities Dealers said Friday that they had
approved proposals to set special margin requirements for day
traders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, customers who engage in what the
exchanges called a pattern of day trading would be required to have
at least $25,000 in equity in their margin account at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, any trader who uses borrowed money _ who trades on
``margin'' _ needs a minimum of $2,000 in equity.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they raised the margin requirement, the exchanges
proposed to ease another rule.
</P>
<P>
   Traders who qualify for the new margin lending rules would be
allowed to borrow four times the amount of equity or cash in their
accounts. Currently, they can borrow just twice what they have in
equity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes would also, however, make it more difficult
for traders to lend each other money to meet margin requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges said the proposed changes would affect traders who
buy and sell the same stock four times in a five-day business week.
Many day traders will move in and out of individual stocks much
more frequently than that in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a logical thing to do because this sort of trading is
not well covered by current rules,'' said Elisse Walter, chief
operating officer of NASD regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes to NYSE Rule 431 and NASD Rule 2520 will be
submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval. A
comment period, which typically lasts three weeks, will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walter said the proposed changes could ``possibly'' be
implemented in the first three months of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the proposals was generally positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a win-win for all parties,'' said James H.
Lee, president of the Electronic Traders Assiociation, a trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects a truer balance between the margin requirement and
the actual level of risk in day trading. True insiders recognize
that a two to one ratio was just too stringent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the proposed rule changes would have more of an impact
on the 300,000 to 400,000 ``hyperactive'' individuals his
assocation estimates trade through electronic brokerages on the
Internet than a much smaller group of professional traders who work
at day trading brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hyperactive group tends to have much lower equity balances
in their accounts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mathison, a spokesman for Charles Schwab, said the
brokerage had no problem with what the Big Board and Nasdaq want to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were consulted before the proposed changes were announced,
and were supportive,'' he said. ``We think it will have a fairly
minimal impact on Schwab customers. Day traders do not make up a
very significant portion of our customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   The North American Securities Administrators Association, which
has called for increased scrutiny of day trading, was also
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading is a very risky behavior and higher margin
requirements may help reduce potential losses,'' Bradley K.
Skolnik, the association's president, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASAA endorses the rule proposals and urges the SEC to
approve them,'' the statement said.

NICCOLO TUCCI, 91, AUTHOR WHO WROTE OF CHILDHOOD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Russia, Mass., Calif.)   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Niccolo Tucci, an author best known for his
autobiographical fiction evoking a European childhood and a
wonderful and monstrous Russian grandmother, died Friday at his
home in Manhattan. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, the author of four books in English and three in Italian,
was a colorful, romantic figure with somewhat long hair, a silk
foulard and handmade suits from Huntsman &AMP; Sons of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does resemble an actor,'' his friend Mary McCarthy wrote in
an introduction to Tucci's book ``The Rain Came Last and Other
Stories.'' ``But he is also an opera singer, a conductor, a painter
of the old school. In any case, a maestro, a virtuoso.'' For many
years he was also a contributor to The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   In his writing Tucci tried to recapture the lost world of
childhood, and a lost patrimony. He was born in Lugano,
Switzerland, in 1908. His father, Leonardo, was a doctor. His
mother, Mary, came from a Russian banking family that had lost its
fortune during the Bolshevik Revolution. His parents, Tucci once
wrote, were ``fit to have children, not to tend them.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a child, the family moved to a home outside Florence
where Tucci received his early education. He was, he said,
``precociously illiterate.'' Initially, he wanted to be a
psychiatrist, but his father wanted him to study law. He managed to
learn six languages and spent a year in 1931 at Amherst College as
an exchange student.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled in a doctoral program at the University of
California at Berkeley, but he was, he said, converted to Fascism
by the writings of Giovanni Gentile and he returned to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he received a doctorate in political science from the
University of Florence, writing a thesis in defense of Mussolini's
doctrine, and then worked for Mussolini's propaganda ministry,
becoming head of a German-language radio station. He translated
Mussolini's speeches into German, and was rebuked in 1936 because
he had altered one of the texts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937 Tucci traveled to New York as ``a Fascist
propagandist,'' as he put it, and lectured on Dante for the
Italy-American Society. He became disillusioned with Fascism and
moved to New York permanently in 1938 with his wife, Laura Rusconi,
and their infant son, Vieri. The family settled on Cabrini
Boulevard in Washington Heights, and Tucci devoted himself to
anti-Fascist propaganda, translating and ghostwriting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Tucci took a job in Washington working on Latin American
policy for Nelson Rockefeller and writing anti-Fascist articles.
But he was disappointed by American politics, too, and left
Washington. He later wrote of his disenchantment in the
anarchist-leaning magazine ``Politics,'' edited by Dwight
Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   When Tucci applied for naturalization as an American citizen, he
was turned down because of his early Fascist sympathies and because
of his leftist political views. The historian Gaetano Salvemini
drew attention to his case, and after an eight-year lawsuit,
citizenship was granted in 1953 in a decision by Judge Jerome Frank
of the Circuit Court of New York, who called Tucci ``a greater
friend of Plato than of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 Tucci published his first novel in English, ``Before My
Time.'' ``I was born before my time,'' he wrote. ``When my time
came, the place was occupied by someone else; all the good things
of life for which I was now fit had suddenly become unfit. It was
always too early or too late.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the book is Tucci's Russian grandmother, known
as Grossmamachen, the tyrannical matriarch of a Russian family.
Portrayed by Tucci as both life-giver and destroyer, she travels
with an extensive entourage of servants, including a French
master-chef, a German butler, an administrator and her family
portraits and icons.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Cantarella, writing in The New York Times, said ``After a
brilliant first chapter which pinpoints with deft if uncharitable
wit its cast of characters, the book unfolds with almost Proustian
involution.'' She called the novel a ``genuine spellbinder.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came Tucci's ``Unfinished Funeral,'' the story of a
matriarch named Ermelinda, Duchess of Combon de Triton, Countess of
Villa Deati, who ensnares her family in a web of emotional guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 ``The Sun and the Moon,'' a semi-autobiographical work
about his parents' courtship and marriage, was published. In that
book, Tucci's father is nearly driven mad by his mother-in-law's
ways. All three books were edited by Tucci's son-in-law, Robert
Gottlieb, who was an editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster and Alfred A.
Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He insisted I marry his editor,'' the writer's daughter, the
actress Maria Tucci, said Friday. The books have been reissued by
Moyer Bell Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci also recounted his childhood years and those of his own
children in his short stories for The New Yorker, which is how
Gottlieb came to know his future wife, called Bimba in the stories.
Along with stories and books, Tucci wrote a play, ``Posterity for
Sale,'' which was produced at the American Place Theater in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci's wife died in 1989. In addition to his son and daughter,
he is survived by two grandchildren and his companion, Deborah
Pease, all of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci won the prestigious Viareggio prize for his collection of
stories ``Il Segreto'' (``The Secret''), which were written in
Italian. But when he was asked to list his awards for the
Contemporary Authors series, he refused to name the conventional
sort. Instead he gave as his ``honors' ``A letter from James Joyce
in 1924, praising me for my Italian fairy tales, a letter from E.B.
White to William Shawn in 1956, saying: ``One Tucci piece a year,
and The New Yorker is in the clear.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``First learn to write as if you were already dead,'' Tucci once
wrote in a piece of advice to young writers, ``and then you will
discover that you can write as if you were still alive.''

XEROX ANNOUNCES 4TH QUARTER EARNINGS WILL BE 40 PERCENT LOWER THAN
EXPECTED  
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Xerox Corp. stunned investors Friday by announcing
after the market closed that its fourth-quarter earnings would be
about 40 percent lower than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Xerox closed at $24.6875 but skidded almost 20 percent
to as low as $19.875 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, blamed the
disappointment on a range of problems, including Year 200 computer
fears that have caused customers to suspend capital investments, an
internal reorganization that Xerox has struggled with and economic
troubles in Brazil. The combination, he told analysts Friday, ``has
surprised us.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the announcement by the company, which is based in
Stamford, Conn., raises concerns about Xerox's attempt to transform
itself from a company making freestanding copiers into one that
sells digital printers connected to computer networks. Doing so
requires that Xerox reorganize to focus more on service and
outsourcing and that it compete against both longtime rivals like
Canon _ which is now doing well _ and new ones like
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   So far, observers said, the company has failed to accomplish
everything at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously seems like there are some very severe problems
within the company,'' said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst at
PaineWebber. Over the last year, Xerox's shares have lost more than
two-thirds of their value, falling from a high of $63.9375 on May
3.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement comes on the heels of a poor third quarter
in which Xerox's net profits declined by 11 percent, to $339
million, and analysts lowered their expectations for fourth-quarter
earnings to 66 cents a share, from an original high of 92 cents.
Thoman now thinks the company will earn closer to 40 cents per
share in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Reitzes said, ``Every problem seems to have
gotten worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is not likely to end with this century, either.
``The first quarter won't be a lot better than what we now see,''
Thoman said, noting that many of the problems will linger. He
added, however, that Xerox's profits should start to recover in the
second quarter and continue to do so throughout 2000.
</P>
<P>
   By their very nature, Year 2000 worries will soon end. Many
economists believe Brazil will begin to recover as well, and Thoman
said the company's reorganized structure will soon begin to
overcome its initial problems.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts seemed unwilling to give Thoman and his management
much benefit of the doubt. During Friday's conference call,
analysts chastised Thoman for not coming clean about Xerox's
problems sooner, wondered whether the future would hold more
unpleasant surprises and complained that he does not talk to Wall
Street often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman took over the top job in April, after leaving IBM in 1997
to become Xerox's heir apparent to Paul A. Allaire, its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the earnings shortfall will come from
higher-than-expected costs from the company's consolidation of its
36 administrative centers into just three, Thoman said. Because
Xerox did not dedicate enough people to handling the change, sales
people _ who are also in the midst of their own shift from covering
a geographic area to covering specific industries _ have spent too
much time dealing with internal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox is now making ``a full-court press'' to fix the
administrative problems, Thoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company is trying to shift toward
businesses that are growing by at least 10 percent a year, such as
the outsourcing of managing documents. Twenty-five percent of
Xerox's revenue now comes from such industries; by the end of 2000,
the portion should rise to 45 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Thoman said Xerox had little choice but to
attempt such wide-ranging changes. ``The market is moving
quickly,'' he told analysts. ``Customers are not going to wait for
us.''

CHINA TO GIVE YUGOSLAVIA MONEY FOR RECONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ China has signed a deal to advance the
Belgrade government about $300 million in cash and credits to aid
the reconstruction of Yugoslavia after the NATO bombing this year,
according to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the agreement was reached last week and that the
money would be spent on rebuilding and on buying electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond helping the staggering economy, the Chinese decision was
welcomed here as a sign of international support for Belgrade and
defiance of Western efforts to isolate the government of President
Slobodan Milosevic, which has been under sanctions since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   China has frequently sided with Serbia in its dispute with the
West, and it opposed the NATO bombing, particularly after the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade had been severely damaged by NATO
missiles and three of its citizens had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here quoted government officials as saying the
Chinese agreed to offer the money after having taken a 10-day trip
to see the bomb damage and on the condition that it be used solely
for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The $300 million will double Yugoslavia's foreign currency
reserves, said Mladjan Dinkic, chief coordinator for the opposition
G-17 group of independent economists. He suggested that the
government could also use the money to prop up the Yugoslav dinar,
which fell again this week, as well as to pay for electricity from
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is showing signs of being desperately short of foreign
currency. Imports have shrunk, and lines for basic staples like
milk and cooking oil are an everyday sight. The dinar trades on the
black market for one-third its official exchange rate.

AMERICA ONLINE AND WAL-MART IN TALKS TO CREATE MARKET ALLIANCE,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's biggest retailer and the nation's top Internet
access provider are in talks about forming a far-reaching alliance
to market each others' products and services, according to people
who have been briefed on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores, which is scheduled to introduce its redesigned
Web site in January, is looking for a partner that could send a
steady stream of traffic to bolster what has been a disappointing
trial on the Web, these people said. America Online, meanwhile,
sees in Wal-Mart access to a large pool of potential users for its
Web service, and a big stream of revenue if the retailer grows to
dominate the Web as it dominates conventional retailing. The terms
of the plan are sketchy, and both companies declined to comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about such a deal has gained currency for about a
month, but after a prominent stock analyst predicted Friday morning
that an announcement was imminent, stocks of both companies rose to
52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   One possible wrench in the deal is Microsoft, whose MSN access
service is a competitor to American Online and is still pursuing
Wal-Mart, according to one of those who had been briefed. America
Online and MSN competed head-to-head for a smaller contract with
Tandy Corp., which owns Radio Shack shops.
</P>
<P>
   The issuer of Friday's report, Richard L. Church, a stock
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, suggested two possibilities. The
first is a simple cross-promotion deal in which America Online,
which has roughly 20 million subscribers, advertises Wal-Mart's
products on its site and, in return, Wal-Mart promotes AOL's
service at kiosks in its 2,465 stores. Wal-Mart is experimenting
with kiosks in several locations.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility, confirmed by people briefed on the talks,
is a broader deal under which AOL would develop an Internet service
brand with Wal-Mart using the Wal-Mart name. Wal-Mart could even
offer a low-cost computer that would allow users access to the
Internet but not perform other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart stores attract some 100 milion consumers a week, with
an average family income of approximately $25,000. This is a large
pool of people, many of whom do not have online serivce and could
be looking for a service provider. Presumably, a Wal-Mart branded
site, with America Online handling the back end, would be ideally
positioned to gain the trust and business of such consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this announcement is that Internet
penetration, particularly in the mass market, could increase
significantly,'' Church wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Flickinger III, the managing director of Reach Marketing,
expects an arrangement to emerge in which Wal-Mart becomes a
branded Internet service provider. Along with gaining access to
Wal-Mart's customers through such a portal and through the stores,
he said, America Online might gain access to the retailer's
extensive credit card databases.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent deals between Internet service providers and
retailers provide an example of what the Wal-Mart partnership might
look like, though the analysts indicated that these arrangements
were far smaller than the one being discussed by America Online and
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the giant electronics retailer Circuit City
announced that it would give consumers $400 toward the purchase of
any products in return for signing up with Compuserve, an AOL
brand, for three years. The service costs $21.95 a month, and at
the end of three years the total cost would be $790.20.
</P>
<P>
   The Tandy agreement with Microsoft, which won out over America
Online, provides for Microsoft to set up boutiques in Radio Shack's
700 stores to promote its MSN service. In return, the software
company will provide $100 million to help the electronics retailer
build its Web presence.

   NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX REACHES YET ANOTHER HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks rallied to send the Nasdaq composite index to
another high, its fifth since Thanksgiving. The index rose 26.06
points, or 0.73 percent, to 3,620.23. The Dow Jones industrial
average, increased 89.91 points, or 0.81 percent, to 11,224.70, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks, climbed 8.93 points, or
0.63 percent, to 1,417.04.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of FreeMarkets, an online auctioneer for industrial
products, jumped 483 percent from its initial price of $48, to
$280, on its first day of trading. This was just a day after the
price of VA Linux Systems had an eightfold increase, setting the
record for the first day of trading of an initial public offering.

<P>
   KDD, Japan's largest international telephone service company,
said it was in talks with its faltering competitor DDI, and IDO, a

Japan's second-largest telephone company and intensify the
realignment of the country's telecommunications industry.

   HIGHER DAY-TRADING MARGINS SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns raised by stock clearing firms and

   LAWSUITS A CLICK AWAY ON INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites are sending users to other sites in record
numbers because they earn commissions if any of their users click
on them and then buy something. But this week those sites suddenly
found themselves at risk of violating a patent just granted to a
New York company, LinkShare. That patent gives LinkShare the right
to block anyone from using such an arrangement. LinkShare will not
say how it plans to enforce its patent rights. And in recent months
a number of other Internet companies have filed patent-related
lawsuits on other matters. Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo,
said: ``People are getting patents on things that are too general.
It's not healthy for patents to be used to stop other people from
doing business.''

   AOL'S BRAZILIAN OUTLOOK CLOUDED
</P>
<P>
   America Online seemed to have a promising start in Brazil with
customers there logging more Internet time than expected. But then
the president of AOL Brazil resigned amid differences with other
executives. And consumer protection authorities are reported to be
weighing the possibility of fining America Online as much as 3
million reais, or about $1.4 million, after numerous complaints
over the alteration of online browsing systems by the company's
installation software. Both of these moves have clouded the outlook

MOTHER WHO LEFT BABY OUTSIDE IS PUT ON DEFENSIVE IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, when a woman was arrested for leaving
her baby daughter outside a Manhattan restaurant while she had a
drink inside, she set off a trans-Atlantic debate about proper
parenting by contending that such behavior was accepted in her
native Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped, and the woman, Anette Sorensen, later
filed a civil rights lawsuit against New York City over her arrest.
Friday, in a stormy court session, she found herself on the
defensive as she explained her actions. In the climax of a weeklong
trial, Ms. Sorensen, 32, told a jury she had always been able to
see her daughter, Liv, through a restaurant window as the baby
slept on that night in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that she had gone into the restaurant in the East
Village with the baby's father for a drink because it was too
chilly. They left the baby asleep and bundled her up in blankets in
the stroller just outside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, weeping at times, testified in federal district
court in Manhattan that she felt only despair after being arrested,
separated from Liv, then taken to a jail cell and strip-searched.
``It's the worst thing I ever experienced,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a blistering cross-examination, a lawyer for New York City
contended that Ms. Sorensen had been drunk that night, that the
baby's father had been belligerent toward the police, and that both
had neglected the child.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyer, Patricia Miller, asked, ``Isn't it a fact
that a waiter came up to your table and told you it was too cold
for the baby to be outside?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not correct,'' Ms. Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller persisted. ``Isn't it a fact that a waiter came up to
you and told you that it was too noisy in the restaurant for you to
hear your baby outside?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the woman said no.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen and the baby's father, Exavier Wardlaw, a
playwright from Brooklyn, are each seeking tens of millions of
dollars from the city for its handling of the incident, which began
when a restaurant patron called 911 after seeing the child
unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Ms. Sorensen's lawyer, Michael Q. Carey,
has tried to elicit testimony supporting the notion that his
client's decision to leave her child asleep in the stroller
outside, which might have seemed foolish to a New Yorker, was
perfectly acceptable conduct in Ms. Sorensen's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume you are not familiar with the customs in Denmark,''
Carey told the jury on Monday. During the week, there was testimony
from a police officer that Ms. Sorensen had mentioned the Danish
custom to the police at the time of her arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city have challenged this notion at every turn,
noting that Ms. Sorensen had spent a great deal of time in New York
in a series of visits, and that Wardlaw, 52, is a citizen of the
United States and a longtime resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Carey asked Ms. Sorensen Friday to comment on the custom
``in Denmark with respect to leaving children outdoors to sleep in
a carriage,'' the city objected and Judge Harold Baer Jr. blocked
her from answering, saying the issue had been dealt with enough.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Sorensen nor Wardlaw would comment outside the court
about the case, which is expected to go to the jury on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Ms. Sorensen tried to recreate the trauma she
said she felt on the evening of her arrest and in the following
four days of separation from Liv, who was 14 months old and placed
briefly in foster care by the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Miller tried to undermine Ms. Sorensen's account,
suggesting in her questions that the mother had been more
interested in talking with reporters after her release than in
checking on her baby. At one point, Ms. Miller cited earlier
statements by Ms. Sorensen that she took Liv out in the stroller
``because otherwise I couldn't go anywhere. I had to be home every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller also showed the jury a large goblet, saying it was
like the one Ms. Sorensen drank from that night in the East Village
restaurant, the Dallas BBQ on Second Avenue near St. Marks Place.
Ms. Sorensen had testified that she and Wardlaw had each had a
margarita and a shot of tequila there and had earlier had
margaritas at a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a fact,'' Ms. Miller asked, ``that on May 10, 1997,
by the time the police officers arrived at the Dallas BBQ, you were
drunk?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that is not correct,'' Ms. Sorensen replied, looking
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, responding to questions from her own lawyer, said
she was a good mother and had been extremely worried about the
effect of the incident on Liv, who is now almost 4.
</P>
<P>
   A psychologist had advised her to talk about it with the child,
she told the jury, and she did, as if she were telling her a fairy
tale about a princess. She said she kept the stories ``very
short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' she said. ``I have done that several times.''

 &HT;    Affirmative action will end in 2001, Fla. regents agree
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The end of racial preferences in
university admissions will be phased in over two years, the Board
of Regents decided Friday, and private high schools may be allowed
to take part in the One Florida program.
</P>
<P>
   Racial preferences will not be used in undergraduate admissions
beginning with the fall 2000 freshman class, but the preferences
won't be eliminated from graduate and professional school
admissions until fall 2001, according to a set of rules the regents
unanimously approved in a telephone conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Although it ends affirmative action based on race, Gov. Jeb
Bush's One Florida plan guarantees students in the top 20 percent
of their public high school classes admission to one of the state's
10 universities. On Friday, several regents suggested extending
that guarantee to the top fifth of private and parochial school
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're discriminating against students in private high
schools,'' said Regent James Heekin of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   State University Chancellor Adam Herbert said he would research
the idea and present a recommendation to the board at its Jan. 21
meeting, when the regents will give final approval to Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert said, however, that it is probably too late to include
private schools for fall 2000 implementation. The chancellor also
suggested the racial makeup of private schools may not help reach
the One Florida goal of bringing more minorities into state
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure we don't do something inadvertently that
would make it more difficult to achieve diversity,'' Herbert said.
</P>
<P>
   He says the plan would bring an additional 400 minorities into
state colleges and it would allow admissions officers to look at
race-correlated factors _ such as the hometowns, high schools and
economic status of applicants _ when admitting students to preserve
diversity. Also Friday, Herbert said he is considering waiving the
additional tuition paid by graduate students from outside Florida.
A significant number of minorities in state graduate schools come
from out of state, and giving them an additional incentive to come
to Florida may help diversity efforts, Herbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost would be $16.4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns have been raised that One Florida would reduce the
number of blacks and Hispanics in graduate and professional
schools. Implementation was put off for a year in part to give
universities time to come up with alternatives to racial
preferences.

EWING HAS WINNING RETURN, AS KNICKS DEFEAT SIXERS 85-78  
(DW)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as the buzz in the building was building in
anticipation, just after Latrell Sprewell went crashing into bodies
along the gantlet of Knicks upon his introduction, out walked a
solemn Patrick Ewing Friday night, bathed in a raucous ovation at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He was back. Ewing walked out to join the circle of Knicks as
the starting center for the first time since June 1. He was focused
and unfazed by the deafening cheers.
</P>
<P>
   All the controversy surrounding Ewing _ from his standoffish
behavior with teammates to the $20,000 in fines he collected for
his inaccessibility with the news media this week _ was blocked out
by the Knicks' 37-year-old superstar. It was time to play.
</P>
<P>
   Play he did, although not to great effect, scoring seven points,
all from the foul line, and grabbing 10 rebounds in an 85-78 Knicks
victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance that bordered on clumsy _ as in a wild
turn-around jumper against a double team that missed by 2 feet high
off the glass _ but it did not lack for effort.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's tip-off, the euphoria of the opening
moments soon evaporated and Ewing was left for inspection. How
would he blend in with Sprewell and Allan Houston? How much could
be expected? Would he try too hard to be the old Ewing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he does well,'' Van Gundy said before the game, even as
Ewing fell back into his pregame routine, headphones on his head,
not saying a word as he bounced a basketball on the blue carpet in
the locker room. ``He deserves to do well. I hope he has immediate
success but the coach in me knows that's going to be very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven months without real-game action showed in Ewing's
languid reactions, oxygen-deprived gasps and somewhat pedestrian
defense as the game wore on. But considering his layoff and the
string of injuries that left him to play in just 79 of the team's
last 182 games, Ewing did a decent job. He struggled, but had some
contributing moments on the floor in some early defensive stands.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, for the most part, were not daunted by Ewing's
presence _ especially Sprewell. He sizzled along at his own pace,
and scored 20 of his 31 points in the first half. The only Knick
who seemed unsettled on the night was Houston, who shot 3 for 15
and finished with six points. The Knick with the most minutes to
lose upon Ewing's return, Marcus Camby, had spurts in which he took
over the game when Ewing went to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing happened Friday night to put an end to the questions
surrounding Ewing's estranged demeanor around the team this season.
Throughar, he has appeared angry at the organization, seemed
to feel unappreciated by his teammates and grumbled at members of
the team for commenting on his progress in returning from an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of underlying tension,'' Van Gundy said
before the game. ``Some of it we created ourselves, some
externally.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues are not past. With Ewing's return, inherent problems
tag right along. The more Ewing gets comfortable with his game, the
more minutes he will play and the bigger the squeeze placed on the
players who stepped into his place when he partly tore his
Achilles' tendon on June 1 during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was the force Indiana coach Larry Bird called the most
valuable player of the series when the Knicks eliminated the Pacers
and advanced to the league finals last season. With injuries to
Larry Johnson and then Ewing, Camby was the X factor throughout the
playoffs, finally getting his chance after weathering limited
minutes and a strained relationship with Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Ewing back on the floor, Camby wonders once again what
his place is on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know,'' Camby said before the game. ``Guys are
coming back off injuries and coming into the starting lineup. I got
hurt, came back and played, and I'm coming off the bench. Minutes
are going to be scarce. It's all about sacrifice. I just want to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll take any position, from small forward to center. Camby was
asked if there was a chance that Van Gundy would go big up front
and play him next to Ewing for heavy minutes. It's a theory that
has been batted around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff said the same thing about the big guards in the backcourt
in the past,'' Camby said. ``And it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an obvious tone of irritation in Camby's voice, and he
acknowledged that the unknown bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' Camby said. ``Just have to see how it all
works out. Yeah, Patrick deserves the benefit of the doubt for what
he's done for the organization. I don't know how it's all going to
pan out. It remains to be seen. I never want to rehash what went on
last year. I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's arrival has not been easy on anyone, including his
coach. Van Gundy has had to step delicately around Ewing, let him
make his decision to return in his own time and still tend to the
egos on the rest of the team. After 11 years with Ewing, Van Gundy
does not see a high-maintenance superstar who has been unresponsive
to the media. He sees a player who wonders when he is ever going to
get the respect he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is private,'' Van Gundy said. ``I don't think there is any
doubt. I just think he believes that the scrutiny about his role
and how he affects the team has been unfair and that very few other
great players have had their value to the team questioned as much
as he has. He is a great, great player and wants to be treated with
respect, and he deserves that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ENTER EWING, EXIT BARKLEY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Barkley steps away, and Patrick Ewing
returns. Here comes the center of attention. There goes the life of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just what the world needs _ another unemployed black man,''
Barkley joked the other night in Philadelphia, limping off to the
rest of his exceedingly improvisational life. It was just
coincidence that the ever-testy Ewing would within 24 hours inform
the Knicks that he was returning to the lineup for Friday night's
85-78 victory over Philadelphia at Madison Square Garden, setting
off predictable arguments and alarms.
</P>
<P>
   He's going to save the Knicks. He's going to ruin them. As
usual, as it has been for what seems like a quarter century now,
every discussion of Ewing had to be life and death, black and
white, polarized positions that begged for a sense of perspective,
and Barkley's humor.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of mine who is known for her keen metaphorical
observations compared Barkley the other day to the proverbial best
man, a slightly inebriated laugh track, helping the uptight
bridegroom down the aisle. It's too bad Ewing couldn't have had
such an alter ego around to usher him and the Knicks to a more
unified state of bliss.
</P>
<P>
   If Barkley made one enduring social contribution to the American
sports consciousness during his 16-year career, it was that the
modern athlete does not have to be defined by his sins, or his
sound bites. He survived an endless stream of risque commentary,
along with his share of public misadventures. He rolled with the
times, good or bad, dishing out as much to the news media as he
took. Barkley fed off the interaction that Ewing has hidden from,
which left us to form our opinions from what others have had to say
and report.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was supposed to be the next Bill Russell when he came to
the Knicks in 1985, a wildly hyperbolic standard for a man who
would spend the next half-dozen years suiting up alongside such
immortals as Pat Cummings and Eddie Lee Wilkins. In college, Ewing
indeed was the quintessential team player, the defensive anchor.
Role and perception can change quickly on a bad professional team.
In New York, Ewing would come to represent failure and hope
simultaneously, and subsequently would develop the thin skin and
ego that goes with those respective roles.
</P>
<P>
   He always got his way because there was never another way to go.
So here he is, at 37, with worn knees, bad feet, a rebuilt wrist
and his best collection of complementary talent, and we have to ask
if Ewing will be content to pursue his first championship with a
reduced role. Barkley would be the first to tell Ewing how lucky he
is just to have the opportunity for one more run. By the time the
battle-worn Barkley got to Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon was also a
shell of his once-great self. Barkley took a pay cut to accommodate
Scottie Pippen, and that didn't work out. Now he's even been
deprived of his own farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had his own rotten medical luck last season. The coach,
Jeff Van Gundy, didn't help by playing to his star's mentality and
pushing him too many minutes when he was out of shape. The team's
medical staff didn't cover itself with glory when it told him he
couldn't tear his Achilles' tendon during the playoffs. Ewing took
his time this season, and that was smart. After his gallant playoff
run last spring, the one thing that should never be questioned is
his desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing will always be respected, never beloved. Anyone who
refuses to sign kids' autographs at his own charity event doesn't
deserve to be. It has always been his way, his rules. They can fine
Ewing his whole salary; he will never be Barkley, life of any
Garden party, but it's time Ewing improvises, goes with the flow
that has been established with him on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of underlying tension,'' Van Gundy admitted
before Friday night's game. ``Some of it we've created ourselves,
and some of it is external.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Van Gundy's job to balance the equation; to make sure
Latrell Sprewell (doubtful) and Allan Houston (possible) don't
become passive; to keep Marcus Camby's minutes up and to have Larry
Johnson get his chances on the low post. To not be Ewing's enabler
first and Knick coach second.
</P>
<P>
   From Ewing, the Knicks need more rebounds and defense, fewer
shots and points. It's for his own good, as well as the team's. The
more the Knicks lean on Ewing in the coming weeks, the better
chance he'll be limping again by spring. It's very simple. They
don't need him to be the centerpiece. They need him to be the
missing piece. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a 59-count indictment in federal court in
Albuquerque, and in briefings for reporters, the government Friday
lowered a legal sledgehammer on Wen Ho Lee, accusing him of not
just being a scientist who inadvertently mishandled classified
materials but also someone who repeatedly and willfully compromised
America's most sensitive nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which officials said would ultimately involve reams
of technical evidence of illegal computer transfers, was intended
to counter what prosecutors fear might be Lee's best defense: the
argument that scientists routinely mishandled sensitive, classified
materials at the government's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the charged political climate surrounding the case,
the FBI and federal prosecutors are presenting evidence that they
say shows that the magnitude of the transfers, and the way in which
they were done, fits a pattern of illegal activity that
differentiates Lee from other federal employees who have
inadvertently mishandled classified materials.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not accuse Lee, a former scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, of giving nuclear information to another
country or even to any unauthorized individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors said he transferred secret information from
a classified computer network at Los Alamos into an unsecure
system, then copied much of the information onto portable,
high-volume computer tapes, some of which are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the files included thousands of pages of
documents related to the design, construction and testing of
America's nuclear weapons arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers and other supporters have said that he is the
victim of a selective, racist and highly politicized prosecution by
a government that has ignored other cases involving the mishandling
of classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Mark Holscher, on Friday indirectly attacked
Republicans in Congress who have pushed for a more aggressive
investigation of Lee, saying that ``it is particularly unfortunate
that the prosecutive decisions in this case have been influenced by
other branches of government whose political motives and agendas
are suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Holscher and other supporters of Lee's have pointed
to the case of John M. Deutch, the former CIA director, who was
investigated for mishandling classified information on his personal
computer. Deutch had his security clearance removed but was not
charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's position in the X Division at Los Alamos, which handled
the laboratory's secret work on nuclear weapons design, gave him
access to a computer network containing classified nuclear weapons
designs and related materials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators said, he had access to an
unclassified, or open network, and a third computer, known as
Machine C, that served as a bridge between the classified and
unclassified networks. Machine C was used by bomb designers when
they needed to use both classified and unclassified materials. It
allowed them to bring both kinds of materials together without
declassifying the secret material. When they were finished, the
designers were required to return the classified and unclassified
materials to their respective systems, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Lee misused Machine C in order to
unilaterally declassify thousands of pages of nuclear weapons
documents. He moved classified documents onto Machine C, erased the
classification markings on the documents and then moved them into
the unsecure, or open computer system, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a massive amount of declassifying without authority to
do so,'' a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee then copied the files onto high-volume computer tapes, the
indictment said. In 1993 and 1994, Lee copied about 380 of those
computer files onto nine portable computer tapes. Of those tapes,
two have been recovered by the FBI, while the other seven are
missing. In 1997, Lee copied classified data onto a 10th tape, but
that tape has been recovered, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Included on the copied documents were the so-called Legacy
codes, which provide mathematical approximations of U.S. weapons
designs.
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged that the transfers covered a range of
secret documents, including ``data files that contain information
relating to the physical and radioactive properties used to
construct nuclear weapons,'' information ``that includes
descriptions of the exact dimensions and geometry of nuclear
weapons used in connection with the design and simulated testing of
nuclear weapons, and the computer instructions to set up a
simulated nuclear weapons detonation.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the indictment said, Lee transferred information
concerning nuclear bomb test problems and yield calculations from
actual bomb tests as well as the computer programs needed to run
the design and testing files.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not random files, this is not general information,''
a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government began its investigation of Lee in connection with
China's apparent theft of secret data related to the W-88 warhead,
which was designed at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been the main suspect in that investigation for nearly
three years, but the FBI never found evidence that he committed
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In September, after determining that the initial inquiry into
the W-88 theft had been flawed and that it prematurely focused on
Lee, the FBI and Justice Department widened its investigation to
look for other possible sources for the leak.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the government said it determined that Lee had
violated security regulations at Los Alamos, and he was fired in
March. After he was dismissed, investigators said a search of his
computer turned up evidence of unauthorized transfers of classified
data and the government started a new inquiry to determine the
extent and possible damage from Lee's computer activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The FBI assigned teams of forensic computer experts to
reconstruct and review Lee's computer activities across several
networks throughout the Los Alamos complex.
</P>
<P>
   What the computer experts found, according to officials, was
that on Feb. 10, within two hours of when Lee had been told that he
had failed a polygraph examination, he began to delete hundreds of
computer files in the open system that contained the classified
data he had transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Lee also took one of the portable computer
tapes containing classified material, loaded the data onto a
server, deleted the information from the tape and then returned the
tape to his office. The result was that the tape did not appear to
contain any classified information.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI experts were able to reconstruct all of the deleted
files on that tape and elsewhere in the computer system, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of his office, the FBI also found two of the
computer tapes containing classified data and handwritten
instructions explaining how to accomplish many of the computer
transfers that Lee apparently had conducted, officials added.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have asked Lee's attorneys to account for
the missing tapes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said in a statement that he had offered ``to make Dr.
Lee available to a mutually agreeable polygraph examiner to prove
that at no time did he criminally mishandle any classified material
that was in his possession and that he did not provide any
classified information to any unauthorized parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Lee was innocent and that he was ``extremely
disappointed by the Justice Department's refusal to explore
approaches which would establish that Lee did not in any way
criminally violate the laws of the United States while working as
an employee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that Lee was not singled out unfairly by being
prosecuted for routine computer activities, government officials
said the FBI interviewed 700 employees at Los Alamos, including 400
current and former employees in the division where Lee worked.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose department oversees the
nuclear laboratories, has agreed to declassify some nuclear-related
information, in part to allow scientists from Los Alamos to testify
about the significance of the classified material transferred by
Lee.

PLANE WAS OFF COURSE BEFORE FATAL CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.) (lh) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HASBROUCK HEIGHTS, N.J. _ The twin-engine plane that plunged
into a backyard here Thursday evening, killing its pilot and three
passengers, was off course and approaching Teterboro Airport from
the wrong direction when it crashed, a federal investigator said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot was not following the instructions of the air
traffic controller,'' said Robert Hancock, the National
Transportation Safety Board's lead investigator in the crash. ``He
was not where he was supposed to have been. He was coming at the
runway from the opposite side.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the plane was off course, in generally clear weather, is
still unclear, Hancock said. ``He was given instruction,'' he said
of the pilot, who was flying into Teterboro from a small airport in
Virginia. ``The question is why that was not followed.'' Officials
said they were looking into a number of possible causes for the
crash, including a mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   During the pilot's approach to Teterboro, which is about a mile
east of the densely populated neighborhood where the crash
occurred, the pilot did not mention any problems with the plane or
its instruments to controllers, Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, the pilot did not suggest that he was puzzled by
the landing instructions from the air traffic controller. Hancock
said the pilot did not make any radio calls of distress or
emergency on his approach to Teterboro and did not exhibit any
``elevated level of concern'' in his last seconds of communication
with the controller.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Friday that they had not officially identified
the victims. But friends and family confirmed that they were four
Virginia residents: Paul A. Pedersen Jr., 37, a pilot and the
president of the Virginia aviation company that used the plane for
charter flights; Elaine Moses, 35, the company's office manager;
Chip Brierre, 41, and Cary Brierre, 40, a couple from Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it was unable to
confirm that the plane, a six-passenger Beech Baron 58TC, was being
flown by Pedersen, who was the president of Sundance Aviation Co.,
an air charter company that operates the Hanover County Airport in
Ashland, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency, James Peters, reported that the FAA
suspended Pedersen's pilot's license for 45 days in late 1997 after
a plane he was flying on Oct. 18, 1996, ran out of fuel and
crash-landed at night in Pasadena, Md. Pedersen suffered minor
injuries in that crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane involved in that incident, a Cessna 310Q, was flying a
cargo of film from Virginia to Baltimore-Washington International
Airport, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation, the safety board said the probable cause
of the 1996 crash was Pedersen's inadequate preflight planning and
inadequate management of the plane's fuel supply. In suspending
Pedersen's license, the FAA cited him for four violations,
including carelessly operating the plane and not having enough fuel
to fly to an alternate destination.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said there was no indication the plane that crashed here
about 5:30 p.m. Thursday had run out of fuel. He said there was an
odor of aviation fuel at the crash site, and he pointed out that
the plane burned for several minutes after the crash and then
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had left Hanover County Airport about 4 p.m. for the
90-minute flight to Teterboro. Hancock said there was nothing out
of the ordinary with the flight.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane approached Teterboro from the west, the controller
instructed the pilot to fly over the airport at 1,500 feet and
then, when east of the airport, to make a left turn to the north
and, a bit later, another left turn to approach Runway 19.
</P>
<P>
   The plane never flew over the airport, Hancock said. Instead, he
said, the pilot started approaching Runway 19 from the northwest
and started to make a right turn toward the runway. Hancock said
the controller repeated the instructions to fly over the airport.
Moments later, he said, apparently in response to that instruction,
the pilot made a very abrupt left turn, apparently to loop around
and approach the airport again from the west.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that turn, the plane crashed. Hancock said his
staff would study radar data to determine the plane's altitude when
it made the sharp left turn.
</P>
<P>
   National safety board technicians began examining the plane's
two engines Friday for any signs of malfunction. Other than the
engines and their propellers, the tips of each wing, both tires and
a piece of the tail assembly, little of the plane's wreckage
remained after the intense fire, Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash also injured three people on the ground and set a
garage on fire. Before it crashed, the plane clipped the side of a
house at 18 Central Ave., then exploded next to two large oak trees
in the backyard of the house behind it, at 21 Washington Place.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Riordan, who lives at 17 Washington Place, said she
thought the trees had stopped the plane from slamming into her
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We complain about all the leaves when they come down in the
fall, but if those trees weren't there ...'' Mrs. Riordan said, her
voice trailing off. ``They probably saved our lives. It was
horrible for the people on the plane. But God was looking over us.
This was our blessing.''

   The flights will give Vanguard seven daily departures to Chicago
and eight to Denver from KCI.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, based in Kansas City, currently has 21 flights a day
out of KCI.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Winter, Vanguard's vice president of marketing and
planning, said Vanguard's additional flights in its two focus
cities of Kansas City and Chicago had created more connecting
traffic to Vanguard's eight destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These flights enable us to build up our presence in these
markets during next year's peak travel season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard said the new plane would allow the carrier to start new
nonstop service between Pittsburgh and Atlanta. The carrier will
offer two round-trip flights daily in those markets next March.

DOCTOR FAULTS STUDY SHOWING THAT THOUSANDS DIE FROM MEDICAL
MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BUSINESS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Kansas City area physician says recent
claims that hospital medical errors kill 44,000 to 98,000 patients
a year is the result of suspect research.
</P>
<P>
   James Ruhlen, an internist practicing in Olathe, Kan., since
1975, related in a recent letter how the figures were so at odds
with his own experience he decided to review the research.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine report attributed massive numbers of
deaths to medical malpractice, which has prompted the National
Academy of Sciences to urge creation of a federal agency to monitor
medical safety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the institute's most puzzling charges was that health
care is significantly behind other high-risk industries in its
attention to safety issues. For most who have had recent experience
with America's health-care system, this revelation must certainly
have been as shocking as it was surprising. The occasional
anecdotal horror story aside, the general level of safety in the
U.S. health-care system has been widely perceived as the standard
by which systems throughout the world are measured.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, as a matter of fairness, it also seems anyone trying
to quantify malpractice deaths should also try to quantify lives
saved. It's possible, after all, that physicians in the U.S. are
victims of too much success. Life-saving procedures considered
miracles a generation ago have become routine. Americans are living
longer lives of higher quality because physicians and their
hospital support staffs are better trained and their equipment is
more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen criticizes the two studies as too few and too narrowly
based. Moreover, he says, they weren't based on random selection as
claimed. Therefore, the results appear to be extrapolations from
higher-risk patient samples.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen said that because one study selected only 31,000 of a
pool of 2.6 million records, the overweighting of high-risk
patients hugely amplified the potential for the sort of negative
numbers the research produced. In the other study, a similar
exclusion of lower-risk subjects ``tended to enrich the pool for
adverse outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   What calls the project's motivation into question was the swift
call for creation of more government oversight, particularly the
proposed mandate to report and publicly disclose medical errors.
This may sound reasonable, but it might put physicians in a box
that would diminish the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of Big Brother looking over everyone's shoulder is
how it would further encourage defensive medicine of the sort that
proliferating lawsuits already promote. The less willing physicians
are to treat serious ailments aggressively, the more such
reluctance might be to the patient's detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhlen's bottom-line contention is that the study vastly
overstated the problem because statistics from the Institute of
Medicine itself already showed a 50 percent reduction in
preventable deaths from 1984-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress does feel a need to do more,'' Ruhlen suggests,
``funding a truly random study of adverse events in hospital
admissions in 2001 might be a good place to start, to see if
another 50 percent reduction in preventable deaths and injuries has
already taken place, as I suspect (any such) study would show.''

JUDGE GIVES MEAT PLANT A REPRIEVE FROM CLOSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Texas issued a preliminary injunction Friday
prohibiting the Agriculture Department from shutting down a meat
plant that failed inspections, ruling that he needed to decide
whether the government had the authority to enforce new hygienic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, Judge, A. Joe Fish of U.S. District Court in
Dallas, said meat from the plant had not caused any outbreaks of
food poisoning and that if the company was shut down, it would be
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means inspectors for the government would not be
able to enforce its new food-safety program, which includes
bacterial tests, at the plant and could be forced to return to the
old poke-and-sniff method to detect spoiled meat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the judge's ruling, the agency said it would continue to
enforce the new standards in other plants.
</P>
<P>
   But Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy
group in Washington that filed a brief supporting the government,
said: ``This is a devastating setback for the new meat and poultry
program, which has shown significant improvement in salmonella
rates. It's unfortunate if one bad actor can ring down such a
successful program.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven F. Spiritas, president and chief executive officer of the
Texas company, Supreme Beef Processors Inc., said he was pleased
with the decision because ``the department had no justification to
take action against our company when we are producing safe and
wholesome meat products.''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Beef, which until the government's action supplied as
much as 45 percent of the ground beef used in the national school
lunch program, is the only meat processing plant that the
Agriculture Department has tried to close under the new standards.
The plant failed three inspections for salmonella contamination
over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   An Agriculture Department spokesman, Andrew Solomon, said the
government ``intends to pursue the matter fully because the
science-based food safety inspection system has proven effective.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Supreme Beef plant in Dallas will continue
to operate with an Agriculture Department seal of approval for
wholesomeness, even though the department says its meat may be
injurious to public health. On Nov. 30 the department tried to
close the plant by withdrawing inspectors, which are legally
required for meat to be sold interstate, after the company had
failed the tests. But Fish issued a temporary restraining order
that day, pending the hearing Friday that resulted in the
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks that salmonella in meat is a good thing,'' Fish
said. ``The question is whether the Department of Agriculture had
the authority to do what it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's slaughtering plant has also failed three
inspections, but the government has not decided if it will try to
close that plant, too. The slaughtering plant supplies one-third of
the beef that is ground at the processing plant.
</P>
<P>
   The new safety program requires companies to adopt the Pathogen
Reduction and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points method of
inspection. They must identify critical control points in the
production process where contamination is likely to occur and
implement plans to prevent contamination. They are required to
perform microbial tests for the presence of salmonella,
disease-causing bacteria that cause mild to severe gastrointestinal
distress and, in some, even death. The tests for salmonella
contamination are the government's only check to ensure that the
plan is actually controlling food hazards in the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says salmonella
is responsible for nearly 10 percent of illnesses and 30 percent of
deaths cause by food-borne disease. The agency estimates that there
are 553 deaths and 1.3 million illnesses from salmonella.
Statistics from the agency indicate that the level of salmonella
poisoning has been dropping since the new program went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But in its suit, the company called the testing program
``arbitrary and capricious'' and said the Agriculture Department
lacked authority to regulate salmonella, arguing that because
``salmonella is not an adulterant and because salmonella is
destroyed during normal cooking, the presence of salmonella is not
a public safety issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The national school lunch program canceled its contract with
Supreme Beef on Nov. 30.

TURKEY WILL JOIN EUROPEAN UNION DESPITE STRINGS ATTACHED TO THE
INVITATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ With neither side sure what lies ahead, Turkey shook
Europe's outstretched hand Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that your country is a candidate member of the
European Union,'' a smiling Javier Solana, the European Union
representative for foreign affairs and security, said as he emerged
late Friday night from a meeting with Turkish leaders in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are very, very happy, and I think your country is
also very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit responded to the European offer by
saying, ``There may be details that are hard for us to digest, but
in general the acceptance of our candidacy on equal terms is a
great success for Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be going too far. Since Turkey and the rest of Europe
have mistrusted each other for centuries, it was perhaps inevitable
that even a gesture of friendship like the one the European Union
offered in Helsinki earlier in the day would be viewed with
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   By opening the way for Turkey's eventual membership in the
European Union, the European leaders meeting in Helsinki brought
Turkey a step closer to realizing one of its most cherished dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But the conditions that seemed to be attached to the invitation
puzzled some people here. They might require Turkey to change its
approach to contentious issues like Cyprus and contested islands in
the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
   Turks seemed disposed to put the best face on this outcome and
claim it as a victory. Still, there was no jubilation here. What
might have been a moment for triumph and the blossoming of
friendship has turned out to be only semisweet.
</P>
<P>
   After the text of Europe's invitation was made public, there was
a surge of discomfort among Turkish diplomats and politicians. The
Turkish reaction registered in Helsinki, and European leaders
decided to send Solana immediately to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   His task was to ensure that Ecevit would fly to Helsinki for a
ceremony on Saturday that would formally open the way for Turkey's
possible entrance into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany,
both of whom visited Turkey last month, telephoned Ecevit Friday to
congratulate him on the European invitation and, not incidentally,
to encourage him to go to Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit agreed.
</P>
<P>
   If Turkish cabinet ministers had any doubts about accepting
Europe's offer, they did not betray them. All seemed relaxed and
jovial as they left a special meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Their tone reflected what seems to be the government's decision:
to accept the European Union's offer and to suppress impulsive
anger at conditions attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's take it or leave it, and I can't believe
they'll leave it,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of international
relations at Bilgi University in Istanbul. ``Among other things, it
would be a slap at Clinton. It would be telling him, `You came here
and offered us all these things, but we just will not budge.'''
</P>
<P>
   As distasteful as details of the European offer are to some
Turks, rejecting it would have been even less attractive. Such a
step could widen a deep historic breach that has only begun to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks, including senior government leaders, appeared to
share this concern. If they accepted Europe's offer, it might be
not because they liked it, but because they feared the alternative.

GROCERS NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BUSINESS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Grocers in Kansas City are wary of what to
say when it comes to preparing for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore it, and customers may forget about Y2K until the last
minute, risking panic and shortages. Embrace it, and a store runs
the risk of fanning the flames of Y2K panic now.
</P>
<P>
   With weeks to go before Jan. 1, 2000, grocers in Kansas City and
those who sell bottled water all say they have seen no evidence of
widespread stockpiling to prepare for Y2K. In fact, some experts
worry about public apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many retailers across the country have decided not
to use potential computer problems as a way to push sales of
batteries, canned goods, water and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of retailers out there are acting responsibly and
you're not seeing a lot of promotions that are geared toward Y2K
stock-ups,'' said Lisa McCue, a spokeswoman for the Grocery
Manufacturers of America in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies are saying they don't want to unnecessarily
scare consumers or take advantage of fear just to sell some extra
toilet paper,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect to find Y2K sales on canned goods at Hen House
or Price Chopper stores, said Mike Beal, chief financial officer
for Ball Foods, which operates 27 stores in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to promote Y2K sales and throw any fuel on
the fire of the Y2K scare,'' Beal said. Extra supplies from Ball's
wholesaler in Kansas City are only a day away in case of
last-minute buying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Same story at Hy-Vee Food Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have extra supplies of batteries, water and canned
goods,'' said Randy Ohm, operations manager at the firm's Shawnee,
Kan., store on West 63rd Street. ``But we don't plan to advertise
them as Y2K supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least two firms have taken a different approach, saying
they are simply promoting the recommendations of the American Red
Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 IGA food stores in the Kansas City area conclude a Y2K
sale that ends today on everything from Rodeo Buckboard Ham to
Strongheart dog food.
</P>
<P>
   By gearing the campaign to the first week in December, the
potential for last-minute panic purchases is diminished, said Dave
Chapman, president of Hometown Grocers, the firm that marketed the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to be thinking about Y2K so they will not be
unprepared,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   His projects manager, Sandy Malish, remembers the punishing ice
storm 15 years ago that left some Kansas City residents without
staples for as long as five days. She doesn't want Y2K to do the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, Schnucks Markets Inc. are advising grocery
customers that if they plan to stock up for Y2K, follow the Red
Cross guidelines and do it early to avoid long holiday lines at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Taking it a step further are the 33 7-Eleven convenience stores
in Kansas City. They will unfurl bright red ``Y2K Ready-4U!''
banners the day after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven expects to sell 40 percent more batteries this
December, see a 20 percent increase in the sale of first-aid kits
and sell as much water in December as they normally do in July.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience-store chain has increased its gasoline storage
supplies and has leased additional delivery trucks at strategic
locations across the country.
This Y2K week
</P>
<P>
   Monday: A Colorado official said the Public Service Co. of
Colorado may not be ready for Y2K because the company didn't spend
enough money on upgrades. Will James, a member of the governor's
Year 2000 task force, said not all of the company's power plants
are capable of running on ``future time,'' when internal clocks are
set to run past the Year 2000. The Public Service Co. disputed his
account, saying the plants are 99.9 percent ready.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: Companies that make computer anti-virus software warned
about a new kind of virus spread through Microsoft software used
for Internet chat rooms. The W95.Babylonia virus comes disguised as
a Y2K fix, making it the sixth known virus tied to the Year 2000
problem. When an infected user logs on to a chat room using MIRC
chat software, the virus gets sent as a Y2K bug fix to anyone else
in that chat room. If the user accepts the software, the virus will
install itself and later obtain several files from Japan. Those
files, in turn, affect the user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Russia's nuclear arsenal is free of Y2K problems,
said Vladimir Yakovlev, colonel general of the Russian Strategic
Missile Forces. In addition, the U.S. and Russia will have a live
videoconference link in case any problems occur at Russian nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   On a less serious note, Beer.com, an Internet site devoted to
the ``beer lifestyle,'' said its survey of 1,377 beer drinkers last
fall found that, in case of a power outage, 42.8 percent will keep
their beer cold by leaving it outside. However, according to the
survey, 30.6 percent don't care if their beer stays cold.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: U.S. factories will be hurt by Year 2000 disruptions
overseas, the National Association of Manufacturers said. Factories
here won't be able to import raw material and parts they need,
which will lead to a slowdown in economic growth and a widening of
the trade deficit, said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the industry
group. He also expects demand to drop overseas for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   From its bunker in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., the North American
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) announced it believes Santa Claus
is Y2K compliant. After all, according to the www.noradsanta.org
Web site, the Christmas crusader made it through Y1K unscathed.
``Millennium rollover? Been there, done that,'' the Kringle man
says on the NORAD site, while sporting an ``I survived Y1K''
T-Shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said it is
ready for Y2K. Year 2000 problems will not affect peacekeeping in
the Balkans, NATO officials said.

IRREGULAR HEARTBEATS CAUSE BRADLEY TO CANCEL APPEARANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add information from one of Bradley's doctors. Changes in
grafs 2, 3, 4 and 5)  
(lh) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, a candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination, canceled an afternoon of campaign events and went to a
hospital in Northern California Friday after a bout of irregular
heartbeats, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, the director of communications for Bradley's
presidential campaign, and one of the doctors who cares for him in
New York, said the irregularities corrected themselves before
Bradley, 56, received any treatment. He was expected to spend the
night in a hotel near San Francisco Friday evening and plans to fly
to Florida Saturday where he will resume his campaign schedule, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, J. Thomas Bigger, who is an expert in abnormal heart
rhythms at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, said in an
interview that Bradley's irregular heartbeat, known as atrial
fibrillation, was diagnosed in 1996, during his final year in the
Senate. She said he has been taking medication to keep his
heartbeat regular for the past 18 months, and has suffered two
brief episodes since then, neither requiring hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bradley nor his aides had previously disclosed the
condition. It is known as paroxysmal atritial fibriillailn because
it produces brief bursts of irregular heart rhythm. Bigger said,
adding that for Bradley it was a ``nuisance condition'' and that
extensive tests had shown no underlying heart disease. Bradley can
tell when his rhythm is abnormal, but condition has not caused
Bradley any serious symptoms, Bigger said.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger and Ms. Dunn said that Bradley's condition would have no
impact on his ability to campaign. The pace of the campaign is
expected to speed up in the new year, as the candidates push toward
the first voting of the primary season, the Iowa caucuses on Jan.
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to change his schedule at all,'' Ms. Dunn
said Friday evening. ``This is not new. It is inconvenient, but
there is no reason for him to change what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Bradley had not felt woozy or experienced
shortness of breath from the palpitations, just ``minor
discomfort'' in the chest. She described him as ``irritated'' that
he had had to cancel his afternoon events.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday evening, only Bradley's top campaign aides, his
family and a few close friends were aware of the condition. Ms.
Dunn said the campaign had intended to notify news reporters about
the condition next week, when they said they were planning to
release a letter from his doctor summarizing a physical examination
Bradley underwent last week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Doctors say atrial fibrillation is, in and of itself, usually
not a serious condition and can be kept in check with drugs. It can
be an indication, however, of underlying heart problems and can
lead to an increased risk of strokes. Consequently many people with
the condition take blood thinning drugs to protect against clots.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley's doctors have told him that he has no
cardiac problems. She also said he is not taking any anti-coagulant
drugs, an indication that Bradley's doctors think he is at a
minimal risk for a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush also suffered from atrial fibrillation,
which came to light in 1991 when he was rushed to a hospital after
feeling heart palpitations while jogging at Camp David, Md. Bush's
condition had been brought on by Graves' disease, which causes the
thyroid gland to produce too much hormone.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bradley, a star basketball player with the New
York Knicks between 1967 and 1977, has worked out at least three
times a week, usually on a treadmill or stationary bike, Ms. Dunn
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter summarizing a physical Bradley underwent on Dec. 3,
Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center said that other than his irregular heartbeat, Bradley had
``no other health issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been evaluated and found to have nonstructural heart
disease,'' Heissenbuttel wrote in the letter, which Bradley's
campaign released Friday night. ``When you have atrial
fibrillation, you note an irregular heart beat, but have no other
symptoms. Thus, this rhythm does not, in any way, interfere with
your ability to function.''
</P>
<P>
   Heissenbuttel also wrote that Bradley's heart irregularities had
no known cause.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said that Bradley's blood pressure was regular and
that he had passed a stress test. The letter also disclosed that a
``small benign polyp'' had been removed from Bradley's colon in
April. It said there was no evidence of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley first began to notice the most recent
palpitations on Thursday night after a day of campaigning in Los
Angeles. But one of his cardiologists, Dr. Edward Anderson of Palo
Alto, told him to wait 24 hours to see if the arrhythmia would
correct itself before seeking treatment. So he decided to continue
on to Sacramento and conduct his full day of campaigning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, he went to a fund-raiser in Sacramento, followed
by a press conference, an editorial board meeting at The Sacramento
Bee, then drove to Berkeley for another fund-raiser. But by early
Friday afternoon, the palpitations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   So at around 3 p.m., Bradley went to Sequoia Hospital in Redwood
City where he was met by Anderson. But before any treatment could
be performed, the palpitations stopped, Ms. Dunn said. He remained
in the hospital for at least an hour longer under the observation
of Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also canceled two fund-raisers in the bay area. And he
will miss a campaign trip to Seattle on Saturday, where he was to
hold a rally with Mayor Paul Schell, a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn refused to disclose where Bradley was staying
overnight, saying she wanted to protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment for an attack of irregular heartbeat is a mild
electrical shock known as a cardioversion. Between 1996 and 1998,
Bradley had four episodes of atrial fibrillation and received
cardioversions twice.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, he began taking the drug Procanbid to keep his
heart beat regular, Ms. Dunn said. Since then he has had three
bouts of fibrillation, including Friday's, none requiring shock
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Heissenbuttel said, ``the medication has been
effective in preventing or shortening the duration of episodes and
has been well tolerated with no side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Procanbid can cause nausea, vomiting and allergic reactions,
including rash.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said Bradley's wife, Ernestine, was in Iowa Friday
night campaigning and had no plans to go to California to be with
her husband. She said that Mrs. Bradley would continue with a full
day of campaigning in Iowa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bradley is scheduled to address the annual convention
of the Florida Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn sought to convey a mood of relaxed assurance during a
phone interview from Bradley headquarters in West Orange, N.J.,
cracking a few jokes about the flood of phone calls the office had
received. She said she had been long aware of Bradley's condition,
calling it ``no big deal.''

   VATICAN: IRAQ CALLS OFF PAPAL VISIT
</P>
<P>
   In a major setback to Pope John Paul II's plans for the
millennium, the Vatican said a papal visit to the city of Ur,
believed to be Abraham's birthplace, had been called off by Iraq.
The Vatican could not reach an agreement over a visit that the
Pope, 79, viewed as a pilgrimage but that was fraught with
political overtones for Saddam Hussein, and also for Washington.
The United States lobbied against the visit, fearing it could lend
legitimacy to the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: RAMP WORK TO CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   Overriding concerns that archeological ruins could be destroyed,
the government announced it would go ahead with a ramp to a Vatican
parking lot that was halted after workers stumbled on ancient Roman
frescoes. The ramp is not expected to be finished in time for
Vatican millennium celebrations on Christmas Eve. City officials
say it may be ready for Easter.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND: OPTIMISM ON ARMS
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the main
Protestant rebel group, a Canadian general overseeing disarmament
efforts expressed optimism that guerrillas would begin handing in
their weapons. Gen. John de Chastelain, who has met with the IRA,
said the rebels should set a disarmament timetable but that, if
necessary, the commission he heads would propose a schedule.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND: CALL FOR INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   Six rights groups, including Amnesty International, called for
an independent inquiry into the car-bomb killing in March of
Rosemary Nelson, a lawyer known for defending Irish republicans.
The groups said the mainly Protestant Ulster police failed to
protect her and said Britain bore some responsibility. The Northern
Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, said the killing was being
investigated and that he was confident British authorities would be
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: BASQUE EXTRADITION SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Spain said it would seek the extradition from France of a
suspected leader of the Basque separatist group ETA who authorities
say represented the rebels at failed peace talks with the
government last May. The suspect, Belen Gonzalez Penalva, wanted on
terrorism charges, was arrested in October, before the rebels ended
their 14-month-old cease-fire, blaming Madrid for undermining peace
prospects.

   CANADA: QUEBEC VOTE RULES
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to set rules for any future separatist vote in Quebec,
Prime Minister Jean Chretien introduced a bill giving Parliament
the power to decide whether an independence question was clearly
worded, and, in the event of a separatist victory, whether the
margin was large enough to justify breaking up Canada. Separatist
forces almost won the last referendum, in 1995, in part, Chretien
has said, because the independence question was vaguely worded.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: CRITICIZED ON RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   A report criticized Mexico for paying only lip service to human
rights. Prominent politicians have blamed human rights defenders
for a nationwide crime wave, said the report, issued by Human
Rights Watch, and the government deserves special censure for
ignoring recommendations offered by the United Nations and other
international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA: PRESIDENT SWORN IN
</P>
<P>
   Fernando de la Rua was inaugurated as the new president,
promising to lead a more transparent, austere government in an
effort to construct ``a new society based on ethics.'' The
62-year-old centrist implicitly criticized the outgoing president,
Carlos Saul Menem, for leaving a gaping deficit, adding, ``They
should have handed over power with the books in order.''

UCLA SUSPENDS FORWARD RUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has suspended reserve forward JaRon Rush
indefinitely for a possible violation of NCAA rules, the school
announced Friday. It gave no timetable for Rush's return, but
indicated the situation probably will not violate its NCAA
probation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rush's grandmother, Jeanette Jacobs, the situation
involves Rush's former summer-league coach, Myron Piggie, whom she
claims has been a bad influence on Rush and is one of the reasons
she encouraged Rush to leave his hometown of Kansas City, Mo., for
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly why I wanted him in college in Los Angeles,''
Jacobs said. ``But the Piggie situation has followed him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a sophomore, was excused from several practices last month
to testify in a trial involving Piggie. That situation is related
to the possible NCAA infraction, said a source close to Rush.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's basketball program is on NCAA probation until April 2001
for violations committed by former coach Jim Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   If a major infraction occurs during probation _ i.e.:
premeditated violations by coaches or the dreaded ``lack of
institutional control'' _ the Bruins could be subject to the death
penalty. However, UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said Rush's
situation involves only himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's that kind of thing,'' Dalis said when asked
about the death penalty. ``This has nothing to do with the team.
It's an individual matter regarding NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for a fact no member of the coaching staff knew about
it. The coaching staff found out about it from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen: ``If the university did not
know about the student-athlete's activity, then that's not an
institutional problem and it doesn't involve the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalis learned of the situation Thursday from a non-UCLA source.
He informed the Pacific-10 and the NCAA, then interviewed Rush for
30 minutes as part of an internal investigation. He indicated Rush
probably will miss a minimum of two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how lucky we get (with interviews),'' Dalis
said. ``If I decide to include the Pac-10, then I can't predict how
long it will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the situation could threaten Rush's status with the
team, Dalis said: ``It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 and/or NCAA will join the investigation only if Dalis
needs help interviewing and fact-finding. At the conclusion of his
investigation, he'll forward the information to the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Dalis described Rush as ``forthcoming but distraught'' during
the interview, which included UCLA faculty representative Donald
Morrison. Rush, who was not available for comment, will not
practice during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   His absence _ combined with Matt Barnes' academic suspension _
leaves the Bruins with nine scholarship players and just three
frontliners: center Dan Gadzuric and power forwards Jerome Moiso
and Sean Farnham.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who failed a summer school class, is eligible to return
after fall-quarter exams (next week) if he passes four classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His return is critical for our frontline depth,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard Ray Young probably will absorb Rush's playing
time (19 minutes per game). Young missed several weeks with a
partially torn thumb ligament, but played well against Iona and
Morgan State.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, who hasn't started a game, is UCLA's fourth-leading scorer
(11.3 points) and second-leading rebounder (4.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll miss from a basketball standpoint is ... his
overall energy, aggressiveness and toughness,'' Lavin said. ``There
are more minutes to go around because we have a shorter bench and a
smaller rotation.''

AREA WOMAN IS BEST-SELLING ARTIST IN DECORATIVE PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- When Vicky Howard was in third grade, her
teacher recognized her talent and encouraged her to become an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Howard took that advice, and today the Overland Park, Kan.,
woman oversees a growing decorative-products business that
generates about $35 million in sales annually.
</P>
<P>
   Her artwork, known for its detail, rich colors and whimsy, now
appears around the world on a variety of products, including a
throw with a bird she designed, which hangs in her third-grade
teacher's living room in Arkansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the best-selling artists on gift and decorative
products today,'' said Rick Yearick, who with his wife is Howard's
licensing agent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Howard's products can be found under her own label, the
Vicky Howard Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's snowmen, Victorian-styled gardens and holiday scenes
appear on some of the nation's best-selling giftwraps, paper
products, throws and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of our top sellers for Christmas items,'' said Jeff
Roach, a senior designer for C.R. Gibson, which produces decorative
paper products.
</P>
<P>
   He said her work has been so well-received that the company has
made the unusual move of featuring her Christmas tableware design
for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a very warm feeling when you look at her art,''
he said. ``You can relate to it. It reminds you of your
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who has been creating her own products for about 13
years, gets the inspiration for her watercolor designs from
childhood memories, Victorian postcards and her own back yard. She
lives in Overland Park in a reproduction of a Victorian home that
was built at the turn of the century for an Olathe pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   Howard often photographs the butterflies, flowers, birds and
wildlife in her wooded garden before spending hours painting them
with tiny brushes to capture every detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of ideas,'' she said. ``There is just a
shortage of time to get these designs on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In painting the snowmen, flowers and birds that have become her
trademark, Howard applies the watercolors in layers to make the
colors more brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   When the paintings are complete, her husband, Rex Howard, an
artist and computer designer, scans them into their computer.
</P>
<P>
   The designs are then reproduced on products for companies,
including Creative Papers by C.R. Gibson, the Manual Woodworkers
and Weavers, and Dimensions craft designs.
</P>
<P>
   Howard soon will be launching a line of T-shirts and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of our top five artists, and we have a worldwide
distribution,'' said Robin Nobling, licensing coordinator for
Manual Woodworkers and Weavers, which sells items including throws,
wall hangings, table runners and place mats. ``She's built up a
reputation through her style and images.''
</P>
<P>
   For the holidays, Howard especially enjoys painting traditional
themes such as snowmen, Santas and nature scenes. But she adds her
special touches, like robins wearing tiny scarves and earmuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find a different way to do a snowman,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her newest designs is of a snowwoman dressed in a green
hat, scarf, jacket and skirt, and carrying a basket with a
gingerbread man.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a degree in fine arts at the University of
Kansas, Howard worked as a graphic designer and art director at an
advertising agency in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   When her company relocated, she began to design her own line of
greeting cards, notepads and other products out of her Lenexa home.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled seeing the first popcorn tins she designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I would go into a popcorn shop, I would say, `That's
my artwork,' '' said Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Art Makers International represents Howard's designs and
sells them to vendors who produce different products. Howard's work
appears in gift shops, department stores and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   The designs come at an opportune time because of the boom in the
home-furnishing market.
</P>
<P>
   There's a trend toward cocooning, said Howard. As the pace of
life has become faster and more technological, people have
responded by making their homes more peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to surround themselves with things that are
comfortable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Howard isn't painting, she likes to visit small-town
antique stores, where she adds to her large collection.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles when she talks about her work and how much she loves
what she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what I loved to do as a child,'' she said.

JURY FAULTS ELECTRIC-FAN MAKER, WAL-MART IN TODDLER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In mid-July 1995, the Mason family of
Chillicothe, Mo., made some warm-weather adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Family members slept in the basement, a cool spot in the non-air
conditioned home. But one night Kevin and Laura Mason didn't want
to wake Ryan, their 15-month-old who had fallen asleep while
playing on his bedroom floor. So Kevin Mason put a fan about three
feet away, placed a pillow under Ryan's head and closed the door,
the family's attorney recalled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That night a blanket or a piece of clothing blocked the blades
of the whirring fan, and the next morning Kevin Mason found the
room ravaged by flames, lawyer Kent Emison said.
</P>
<P>
   The fan did not have a common fire-safety device, he told
Jackson County jurors this week, and that cost Ryan Mason his life.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County jurors on Thursday evening found the Taiwanese
fan manufacturer and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which sold the fan,
partially responsible for Ryan Mason's death and ordered them to
pay the Masons about $3.6 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart spokesman criticized the verdict and said the company
plans to appeal. There was no definitive proof in Wal-Mart's own
investigation that the fan caused the fire, John Bisio said.
</P>
<P>
   He added no attorneys or officials from the manufacturer _ Han
Chi Hang Company Ltd. _ showed up for trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sympathize for the family,'' Bisio said Friday. ``But at
the same time, we have to question this decision. The (jurors) are
acting on emotion. Unfortunately, by affiliation, we are being
punished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We vouch for the products we carry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Masons contended that the fan started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic theme of this case is very simple: These fans have
no safety features in the event of an electrical failure,'' said
Emison, referring to a device that can shut off a machine during a
malfunction. ``These could have been put into the fan for less than
a quarter per fan.''
</P>
<P>
   That technology, Emison said Friday, has been available since
the 1950s and is installed in appliances from coffee makers to hair
dryers.
</P>
<P>
   The Masons' ``hope is that this (verdict) will force all
manufacturers to put these safety features in fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Giles, a spokesman with the Consumer Product Safety
Commission in Washington, D.C., said the federal regulatory agency
had recalled several automatic coffee makers because they had been
built without thermal cut-offs and were deemed a risk to users.
Currently, he said, there are no mandatory federal standards for
electric fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are concerned about any electrical appliance or fan
that causes fires,'' Giles said. ``We would like to get the case on
this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan
Antonio Samaranch _ who has insisted on guiding reform of the
corrupt site selection system over which he presided _ has reacted
to revived interest in his fascist past with extraordinary
obtuseness.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, one day after a front-page story
in The Wall Street Journal recounted his ascent under Spanish
dictator Francisco Franco and his opportunistic molting into a
diplomat in the post-Franco era, Samaranch brazenly defended his
past and Franco's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said many times that this was many years ago and you
have to be a Spaniard'' to understand, Samaranch said. ``I was with
many, many Spaniards with Franco. He had the support of many
countries around the world. He did three exceptional things: He
kept Spain out of the war, he transformed Spain into an industrial
country, and he chose Spain's next leader, the king.''
</P>
<P>
   The relevance of Samaranch's paean to Franco resides not in its
revelation of antidemocratic political leanings but in its
illustration of a pattern of behavior. There have been many eminent
figures who served one of this century's tyrannies, saw the light,
admitted their errors, and worked to rehabilitate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Our quarrel with Samaranch at present is not his allegiance to
Franco but his allegiance to a corrupt and venal system that
brought shame and discredit on the Olympics during his wayward
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, at a meeting of the full membership of the IOC's
general assembly, Samaranch will be seeking approval of 50 proposed
reforms of the organization that he directed during its descent
into corruption. The reforms will include term limits for officers,
age limits, and a possible prohibition against members visiting
cities bidding to be selected as hosts for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Samaranch will be testifying to Congress about his
reforms. The one reform he has refused to make would be the most
salubrious: his resignation.

ASSAD'S ASSENT TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world has learned to be wary of pronouncements about a
breakthrough for peace in the Middle East. But if ever a true
turning point appeared to loom on the horizon, it was in the news
that Syria's brutal but prudent dictator, Hafez Assad, has told
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and President Clinton that he
is ready to resume peace talks with Israel at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Assad himself will not be coming to Washington next week to meet
with Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak because his health does not
permit him to travel. All parties understand, however, that having
Assad's foreign minister, Farouk Sharaa, stand in for him at the
Washington rendezvous with Barak is tantamount to Assad being there
himself. Until this week the Syrian ruler had insisted on a formula
for negotiations that would entail negotiations by lower-level
``professionals'' and a meeting of the political leaders only after
a final peace treaty had been signed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Assad has acquired a well-deserved reputation for
knowing exactly what he wants, negotiating stubbornly to get it,
and then honoring agreed-upon red lines, his decision to accept the
offered conditions for a resumption of peace talks should be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to negotiate a peace treaty now so the decks will be
cleared for his son, Bashar, to succeed him. Only Assad the elder,
with his impeccable Arab nationalist credentials, can make the
necessary compromises with Israel and also oblige Tehran to
tolerate a Syrian guarantee of Israeli security on its northern
border _ a commitment that will require disarming the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas who operate in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Assad also needs to act before the next American elections and
while Barak has a mandate to return captured Syrian territory. If
the shrewd master of Damascus seizes his opportunity, he will pass
to his successor a state at peace, one in the same American orbit
as Israel, Jordan, and Egypt. May the ailing tyrant have enough
time left to complete his historic pirouette.

   Once again mouse gives man a possible glimpse of his future _
this time in Italy, where researche olated a gene that triggers
aging. By eliminating that trigger in genetically engineered mice,
scientists were able to increase the animals' lifespan by about 30
percent. The experiment was reported in the journal Nature last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Could man do the same one day? Would he want to?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists doing the experiments at the European Institute of
Oncology in Milan, along with researchers at the Institute of
Pathology in Perugia, Italy, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York, say they found no side effects in mice bred
without the trigger protein responsible for oxidation, which
damages cells.
</P>
<P>
   In other longevity experiments, scientists have been able to
increase animal lifespan by decreasing food intake and slowing
metaolism, but the added years come at the cost of decreased
fertility and size.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers caution that gene-tinkering may also be shown to
cause harm eventually, but for now they are projecting the
tantalizing possibilities of a cream that might someday reverse the
aging process in the skin or a miracle drug that extends life _
Ponce de Leon's fountain in a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Such visions are irresistible, but will they, too, come at a
price? Earlier this fall Princeton University scientists engineered
a smart mouse that could outthink its average cousins in the lab. A
few years ago researchers at Northwestern University tinkered with
the ``clock gene'' in mice and lengthened the animal's day from 24
hours to 28. Putting these two developments together with the
longevity work, future human genetic engineers just might create a
race of brilliant workaholics who retire at age 200.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, a genius race will take oveand make anyone whohasn't
evolved do the work. Or the laboratory mice might be running the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Man keeps his eye on the laboratory cages, wondering what will
be next and if it will make things better, or worse, or both.

BUSH LEADS PRESIDENTIAL FUND-RAISERS IN MISSOURI, KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Republican George W. Bush, who remains the
runaway fund-raising leader among all presidential candidates, is
way ahead in Missouri and Kansas, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor pulled in $932,210 from individual donors in
Missouri through Sept. 30, more than three times as much money as
the second-place fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Bush was out front with $299,650, almost twice as
much as the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in second in both states was Bill Bradley, a Democrat who
hails from Crystal City, Mo. Bradley can take consolation in
knowing that his totals far out-distanced his Democratic rival for
the nomination, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley raised $306,700 in Missouri compared to Gore's $106,601.
In Kansas, Bradley raised $169,900 to Gore's $16,900.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, which cover individual donations of $200 or more,
were compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
group that monitors the presidential money race.
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent money raised only in 1999. Contributions
from political committees that represent special interests were not
included.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, Bush topped Bradley, but by a narrower
margin. Bush, the GOP front-runner, attracted $329,100 to Bradley's
$250,700. Gore came in third with $20,450.
</P>
<P>
   In the St. Louis area, where Bush's uncle, Bucky Bush, oversees
his statewide campaign, Bush raised the biggest portion of his
Missouri money: $596,610 to Bradley's $206,150. Gore was third with
$97,650.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``has a lot of good connections in the state of Missouri,''
said Missouri GOP spokesman Daryl Duwe. ``He has family here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage: One of Bush's chief fund-raisers, Jack
Oliver, worked for years on Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led in money-raising in the St. Joseph area with $13,750;
in Springfield with $76,750; in Columbia with $11,500; and in
Joplin with $15,750.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also led in each of Kansas' major metropolitan
areas. He pulled $59,700 out of Wichita; $16,250 from Topeka; and
$2,500 from Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche acknowledged that the former New
Jersey senator's close ties to Missouri helped. He said the
region's appreciation of blunt-speaking politicians such as Harry
S. Truman was another factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Missouri and Kansas like people who speak
plainly and directly about what they want to do,'' Wyche said.
``Whether they agree with (Bradley) on any specific issues, they
appreciate the candor and honesty they are getting from that
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley led Gore in every metropolitan area in the two states
except Springfield and Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Missouri nor Kansas ranked in the top five fund-raising
states for any of the nine presidential candidates. Bush, for
example, is drawing most of his individual money from his home
state of Texas, where he bankrolled $12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's top state was California where he brought in $3.3
million. Gore's leading state also was California, where he has
raised slightly more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   GOP hopeful Sen. John McCain looked to his home state of Arizona
for $927,300, his top total from any state.

THE ATTEMPT TO SMEAR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By releasing hundreds of pages of medical records to the press,
Senator John McCain put to rest rumors that never should have
started. The so-called ``whispering campaign'' suggesting that the
Arizona Republican is not emotionally fit to be president because
he was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years in Vietnam takes dirty
politics to the bottom of the sewer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the whispers false _ reports say he suffered no
residual mental problems, with one doctor stating that the senator
``had a very healthy way of dealing with his experiences'' _ but
the tales attempt to twist a plus into a hideous minus.
</P>
<P>
   News reports say these rumors come from McCain's enemies in the
Senate, though nobody will admit to starting them. Whatever the
source, they are intended to strip McCain of his fine military
record and the sacrifice he made for his country. Such a callous
attack is an affront to all military personnel and their families
as well as to civillians who have survived the ordeal of being
taken hostage by political terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The absurd suggestion that McCain could snap in the Oval Office
adds to public disillusion about the political process and
discourages people from running, the logic being: ``If they attack
courageous military service, what would they do to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Few people would be comfortable seeing their medical histories
reprinted in the newspaper. While McCain's openness is commendable,
the publication of his vitamin intake, his use of a nasal spray for
hay fever, and a report on benign polyps in his colon in 1995 go
way beyond what the public needs to know to make a choice about
national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations stand as a warning to whisperers _ and to the
media _ that there should be limits, even in politics, and that a
person running for office still has a right to a private life.
Restoring respect for the basic rules of fairness in what often
resembles an arena of gladiators will not only benefit all
candidates but is vital to the future of the democratic process.

THE PARENT TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're not Ozzie and Harriet, some folks will say, implying that
they've come a long way. But working parents are starved for the
kind of revolutionary progress that has turbocharged technology.
Parents face a Year 2000 economy hamstrung by decades-old
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple arithmetic gone awry, according to the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation. In the past, families had two jobs: Fathers did
paid work, and mothers did the unpaid work of caring for home,
children, and community. Today there are three jobs _ dad's paid
job, mom's paid job, and the work at home _ but still only two
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the third pair of helping hands? Typically, mothers do
double duty on the home and work shifts. But the real problem, says
Kathleen E. Christensen, director of Sloan's Dual-Career
Middle-Class Working Families program, is that it can still be too
much work no matter who's doing it _ even if dads always rushed
home to make dinner and start the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for innovations, the failies program gave out $million
in grants this year. It is premature to outline a master plan, but
the Sloan Foundation is studying change in three areas: at work, in
the design of homes and communities, and in federal and state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Take the distinction between full- and part-time work. It's a
1930s concept, Christensen says, that we haven't gone much beyond.
As for the self-employment, it can help parents cope, but
employment laws dating back to the 1930s and '40s don't always
protect them. They lack safety, health, and pension safeguards, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan is also looking at how to devise architectural and
community plans that lighten the physical and emotional load of
housework.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking off the paradigms of the past, the Radcliffe Public
Policy Center used a Sloan grant to look at the biotechnology
industry. Its newly released study points to good news: Biotech
appears to offer women scientists more equitable opportunities than
other careers. But there are also missed opportunities. As in other
industries, job flexibility is often overlooked or remains a
benefit that savvy individuals negotiate for rather than a common
workplace option.
</P>
<P>
   Many other issues deserve attention:
</P>
<P>
   --Flexible schedules. It's an old idea struggling to fly.
Flexibility benefits parents of young children and older workers
who would rather work a reduced number of hours than retire.
Instead of being part-timers, workers could have annual contracts
that spell out the number of hours to be worked a year, allowing
for day-to-day variations.
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure policies trickle down through the ranks. Radcliffe's
study quotes a human resources director as saying: ``Onlyhe top 10
people in the company are allowed to work at home. Below that, it
is not permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   -Update assumptions about productivity. Earlier this year, a
Boston Bar Association report pointed out that ``merit is usually
couched in terms of legal skills, client responsiveness, commitment
to the firm, and teamwork, but at least three of those four
attributes are, from the perspective of associates and many
partners, correlated with long hours and sacrifices of personal and
family time.'' No home-by-sixers need apply.
</P>
<P>
   --Analyze _ and learn from _ different industries across the
country. In addition to biotech, Sloan-funded projects are looking
at Silicon Valley workers, teachers, medical and computer
professionals, and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   --Look at the bottom line. Studies should continue to consider
how family-work changes affect profit and productivity so companies
can see where their healthy self-interest overlaps with employees'
needs.
</P>
<P>
   --Innovate. Sixty years from now, paid maternity or day care for
sick children could seem as ordinary as the two-day weekend _ but
only if experiments are conducted and studied now.
</P>
<P>
   --Encourage community ties. From coaching soccer to singing in
choirs, working parents enrich their communities. As the Radcliffe
report points out, future studies of the biotech industry could
reveal how employers can better support ``a complex web of
community-based connections.''
</P>
<P>
   The case can't be overstated. Families await the benevolent
earthquake that will help the world of work make 21st-century
changes.
