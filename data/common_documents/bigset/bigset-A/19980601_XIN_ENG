<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharazi will arrive here Monday on a two-day visit for talks with
Pakistani leaders on international, regional and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Kharazi will hold formal talks with his
Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan to exchange views on several
issues focusing on Afghanistan, a report by the News Network
International quoted officials from the Iranian Embassy as saying
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi is also likely to call on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and deliver him a special message from Iranian President Muhammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The report further said that the Iranian foreign minister and
the Pakistani leadership will discuss ways and means for the
resumption of Afghan peace talks which collapsed in Islamabad in
May.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi earlier planned to visit Pakistan in February but
postponed the trip due to the killing of two Iranian engineers in
Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi on February 21, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
He is likely to raise the issue of killing of Iranian nationals
in Pakistan during his forthcoming meetings with Pakistani
officials, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that some 11 Iranian nationals including two diplomats
have been killed in various terrorist attacks in Pakistan since
1988.

<P>
A Pakistani delegation visited Iran two weeks ago to apprise
Iranian officials of the cases of Iranian nationals killings, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Foreign Minister Predicts More Tests by India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani's foreign minister
said on Sunday that his country has no plan for additional
nuclear tests while India is preparing a new site for more
nuclear testing in early July.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with CNN's "Late Edition" program, Gohar
Ayub Khan said from Islamabad that "there is nothing in the cards
for a long time to come" with regard to nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
But he said he has "credible information" that India is "in
the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast somewhere
in the first of second week in July."
</P>
<P>
Khan said Pakistan is ready to sit down with an outside
mediator to try to resolve its problems with India and that U.S.
President Bill Clinton "should have the clout" to bring the two
sides together, particularly on the main issue dividing the two
neighbors, the disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, asked on NBC's
"Meet the Press" if the South Asian rivals would stage more
tests, said: "Obviously, we hope not. We have reason to think
that these two countries, India and Pakistan, as they ponder the
mistakes that they have made over the last couple of weeks, will
understand that they have not enhanced their security. They have
diminished it. They have not enhanced their standing in the
world. they have diminished it."
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligency sources said on Saturday they had detected no
sign that either Pakistan or India was preparing for further tests.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Quicken Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Association of
Manufacturers (ZAM) Sunday urged the Zambian government to
quicken privatization of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), the Zambia News Agency (ZANA) said.
</P>
<P>
ZAM even called on the government to sell some mines at a
give-away price to save the country's economy from collapse.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ZANA in Lusaka, ZAM Chairman Mark
O'Donnell said that in view of an apparent shortage of buyers for
Nchanga and Nkana mines, the largest mines in Zambia, they should
be sold at any price as long as the country could benefit from
the long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
"The government's offer should not just be cash on the table
but what the new investment would do to the country," said
O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government should not insist on selling the
mines at higher prices because even at much lower offer, the
economy could benefit as the new capital investment could boost
production and employment in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
Any further delay in the privatization of ZCCM, a major
foreign exchange earner for Zambia, could spell doom for the
country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZAM chairman pointed out that a number of companies whose
sustainability depends on ZCCM are already struggling financially
and they could collapse when ZCCM grinds to a halt.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to look for a reputable and
world-class business partner to buy the mines at low concessions
for the sake of recapitalizing ZCCM and turning the mining
conglomerate into a viable economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations to privatize Nchanga and Nkana mines are
undergoing between the Zambia government and the Kafue
consortium, an international company.
</P>
<P>
But Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said that the Zambian
government will never sell the mines at a give-away price.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- After triggering a nuclear arms
race in South Asia by detonating five nuclear devices, India on
Sunday proposed that all nuclear weapons states and the
international community open negotiations for a nuclear weapons
convention.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued this evening by the Ministry of External
Affairs said that the convention is necessary to deal with these
weapons in a global non-discriminatory framework as the other two
weapons of mass destruction had been through the biological
weapons convention and the chemical weapons convention.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, India expressed its displeasure with the
United Nations Security Council statement for what it called
"references against New Dehli." The Security Council in a
statement on Saturday urged India and Pakistan to call a
moratorium on nuclear testing and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislature Warns of No-Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Sunday warned of a no-confidence vote if the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) failed to formulate the 1998
budget within two weeks, Israeli Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The PLC, announcing the decision in the West Bank city of
Ramallah Sunday, asked the PNA to report the progress on the
formulation of the budget to it in the coming two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 28 lawmakers of the 88-seat council, including
several members of Arafat's own Fatah faction, signed a petition
in favor of a no-confidence vote to protest the PNA's failure to
work out the 1998 budget, carry out long-promised reforms against
corruption and mismanagement, and enforce laws passed by the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Apparently to stave off the vote, Arafat signed Thursday five
minor laws passed by the PLC. And a panel on reform has reportedly
been set up.
</P>
<P>
Any no-confidence vote would be the first since the council was
elected in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, political observers here said that the PNA will
survive the no-confidence vote if it comes true because the
majority of the PLC supports Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Even if the motion did pass, it could only lead to a cabinet
reshuffle by Arafat.

<HEADLINE> One Lebanese Civilian Killed by Israeli Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops fired a missile near
a village in south Lebanon, killing a Lebanese civilian and
wounding another Sunday afternoon, Lebanese National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The missile crashed on the edge of the Arbsalim village, north
of the Israeli occupied security zone, hitting the two shepherds,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
One of them died after being taken to the hospital in the
southern port city of Sida, it said, adding that a number of their
herds were also killed during the Israeli shelling.
</P>
<P>
The attack came just hours after the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, launched a series of offensives at Israeli
positions in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualty has brought the number of Lebanese civilians
killed and wounded in clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops
to 10 and 44 respectively since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aims of protecting its
northern areas from guerrilla cross border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has since spearheaded a guerrilla war to try to drive
1,200 Israeli troops and their Lebanese militia allies out of the
occupied zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Japanese Joint
Chiefs of Staff Kazuya Natsukawa arrived here Sunday on an
eight-day official visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said the visit, the first ever by the
top Japanese military leader, would be packed with "numerous
meetings" with Russian military officials.
</P>
<P>
While in Moscow, Natsukawa will meet Russian Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev, chief of the General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin and
commanders-in-chief of the three services of the Russian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said the number of official meetings "substantially
tops the traditional framework of visits of such a level."
</P>
<P>
The trip was made at the initiative of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who agreed
at the first informal meeting in Krasnoyarsk last November on an
exchange of visits at the level of the chiefs of general staffs.
</P>
<P>
After Moscow, Natsukawa will go to Vladivostok to meet fleet
commander Mikhail Zakharenko and Primorye governor Yevgeny
Nazdratenko.
</P>
<P>
No joint documents were planned for signing during visit,
Itar-Tass said. The last protocol on bilateral military
cooperation was signed on April 29, 1996 in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice President Leaves for Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan left for Algeria on Sunday to rally international support
for his country's call for lifting of United Nations economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Ramadan told the Iraqi News Agency (INA) that
his mission is part of the efforts to inform leaders of friendly
countries about Iraq's ties with the U.N. Security Council and the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) overseeing disarmament of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan, as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's envoy, will brief
Algerian leaders on the impact of the crippling sanctions on the
Iraqi people and the need of the U.N. Security Council to honor
its obligations toward Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
He will convey a message to Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
from Saddam on Iraq-Algeria relations, the current Arab situation
and the importance of joint Arab actions to encounter United
States threats and conspiracies against Iraq and the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said the Security Council should start to carry out
paragraph 22 of the U.N. resolution 687, which provides the
condition on lifting of the trade embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the economic sanctions on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. Only when the UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq has destroyed all the weapons of mass
destruction, will the world organization lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan praised Iraq's "outstanding relations" with Algeria,
saying they will witness broader progress in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He hailed Algeria's support for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After Algeria, Ramadan will travel to some other Arab
countries, the agency said. But it did not elaborate.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Sunday that most Arab countries have endorsed a Palestinian
proposal to hold an Arab summit to coordinate stances on the
stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Gaza from a two-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), Arafat told reporters that "very important effort"
is being made to convene the summit very soon because of the
critical situation the peace process is facing.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say when the summit would be held.
</P>
<P>
Due to the deadlock in the peace process, Arafat has called for
an Arab summit to work out a unified position to encounter
Israel's intransigence and hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
He has intensified his efforts for the summit after the United
States failed to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to accept a proposal on Israeli withdrawal from 13.1
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Jordan and the UAE have voiced support for the
summit. Latest reports said that the summit is likely to be held
early June in Egyptian capital Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis have been
in a standstill since March 1997 when Israel started construction
of a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want as capital of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Still at Crossroads: Executive Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) is still at a crossroads 23 years after
its establishment, Executive Secretary Mouhammadou Ousmane has
said.
</P>
<P>
Ousmane made the remarks in his weekend message in Abuja to
mark the establishment of the sub-regional body on May 28, 1978,
the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He remarked that though ECOWAS has achieved a lot in the past
23 years, there is still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
Ousmane noted that ECOWAS has made great advance in the sphere
of economic integration, especially in the areas of trade
liberalization and harmonization of customs documents,
regulations and procedures.
</P>
<P>
He cited the free movement of people and the introduction of
the ECOWAS travel certificate as the most notable achievement,
saying that the ECOWAS traveler's check would soon be launched
to facilitate trade transactions.
</P>
<P>
In the area of transport, he said that 83 percent of the
trans-coastal and 87 percent of the trans-Sahelian highways have
been completed, while the communications sector has improved
considerably following the completion of the INTELCOM (I), which
links capital cities in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, ECOWAS has made significant progress in its drug
interdiction effort, the executive secretary said, pointing out
that this has been acknowledged by the United Nations
International Drug Control Program.
</P>
<P>
Ousmane commended the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG
for keeping the peace in the sub-region, especially in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these achievements, he stressed the need to
implement decisions taken by the organizations's leaders so as to
prepare the group for the rapid changes sweeping the world and
for the third millennium.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Short of Strategic Grain Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
purchased 43,000 tons of maize worth 1.5 million U.S. Dollars for
the strategic grain reserve this season, failing to hit the
target of 150,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Hamimu Hongo, an official with the Food Security Department in
the President's Office, said that the department is not able to
buy more maize as only one billion shillings has been given by
the treasury.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke at a food security workshop here
Sunday, said that maize is still in abundance in many
parts of the country but the funds released for the purchase of
strategic grain reserve have been used up.
</P>
<P>
H. Missano, an official from the Tanzania Food and Nutrition
Center (TFNC), said that about seven million people in the
country face food insecurity chronically. She suggested that
people should plant drought-resistant crops such as sorghum,
cassava and sweet potatoes and improve their grain storage
facilities and exploit forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Representatives at the workshop, which was organized by the
Christian Council of Tanzania, have also suggested people to eat
banana and other fruits so as to increase food supply and avoid
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was struck by a drought in 1997 and floods at the
turn of the year. In this season a lot of areas are expected to
have a rice harvest, but the government feels it difficult to
provide food relief to all disaster areas as a lot of roads have
been damaged by floods.

According to reports reaching here, Arafat said on Sunday in
Gaza that "most but not all Arab countries" have agreed to an
emergency summit to close ranks and face up to Israel's
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has held talks with leaders of some Arab countries,
including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), on the proposed summit. Egypt, Jordan, the UAE and
Saudi Arabia have reportedly agreed to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been in a standstill since
March 1997 when Israel started construction of a Jewish settlement
in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have also been stalled over Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that Israel withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank. But Israel has not accepted the
proposal, citing security concerns. It maintained that it will
hand over no more than 9 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Wants to Study Clinton Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Susan McDougal said she would
have to carefully study President Bill Clinton's testimony before
attesting to whether he spoke the truth in denying knowledge of
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal told NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday in a phone
interview, "I would have to actually have his testimony in front
of me and go through it line by line before I would be willing to
put myself up to say he told the truth."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month her attorney, Mark Geragos, on the same
program, said McDougal, who has refused to provide testimony to
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, would tell a jury that Clinton
had spoken the truth in her 1996 fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
"I would want it to be the actual absolute truth before I would
do that, and I couldn't do that today," she said about confirming
Clinton's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal served 18 months for civil contempt for refusing
to testify to Starr's Whitewater grand jury. That term ended in
March and she began serving a two-year term for fraud in the
Whitewater real estate case.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal also denied statements in a recently published
book quoting her late husband Jim McDougal as saying that
President Clinton, at an April 1996 meeting, offered him immunity
in exchange for his cooperation in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
"I was with Jim every second from the moment we entered the
White House until the time we left the White House and I can tell
you that conversation never occurred," she said.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals were partners with Bill and Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the Whitewater development when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas.

<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
switched on the transmission button of the country's first
telecommunications satellite, the Nilesat 101, on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak gave the go-ahead at one of Nilesat's main control
stations in the 6th of October City, about 30 kilometers southeast
of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The start of the satellite operation crowned a three-hour
ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the Egyptian Media Day,
which was beamed live by the Egyptian television.
</P>
<P>
According to Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif, there
will be 50 general and specialized television channels, open and
encrypted, to be viewed by Egyptians and Arabs by the use of
small, low-cost dishes over a 90-day experimental period.
</P>
<P>
Nilesat was launched by the Ariane-4 Rocket from the Korou air
space in French Guyana, South America on April 28. It is being
tracked by five ground stations in Egypt, France, South America
and Australia.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An Islamic organization and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) have expressed deep concern for the
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan and urged them to take
measures to keep security and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Secretary
General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference Ezzidine
Laraki said that his organization "has always been looking forward
to the establishment of a nuclear-free region in South Asia," the
Kuwaiti News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Laraki called on the international community to press India and
Pakistan to sign a non-aggression treaty to guarantee security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He, in the meantime, warned against using nuclear tests as a
pretext to attack Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Saturday, the UAE emphasized that
the nuclear tests of India and Pakistan will not serve the
interests of security and stability, but rather aggravate the
tension in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
It called on the two countries to exercise restraint and
resume peace talks to defuse tension and maintain regional peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
The UAE called for comprehensive ban on nuclear tests and
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, in response to India's five nuclear tests on May 11
and 13, set off five nuclear devices on Thursday and another on
Saturday. The nuclear tests of the two countries have sparked
concern and condemnation in the international community.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reacts Strongly to British Report on War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Monday reacted strongly to a
report carried by the Sunday Times over British plans in case of
war on this divided East Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that Britain is planning
the biggest airlift of 250,000 people from Cyprus since the
Second World War because of mounting fears over war if the
Cypriot government proceeds with the deployment of Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Cypriot government spokesman Christos
Stylianides said in a written statement Monday that such actions
do not contribute to good bilateral relations, adding that the
government decision to deploy the anti-aircraft missiles would not
change.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the Russian-made surface-to-air
S-300 missile system in January 1997, which is expected to be
deployed later this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal was criticized by the U.S., Britain and some other
countries, and met strong opposition from Turkey, which has
threatened to destroy the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Cypriot government "is aware of the
position of the British government regarding the delivery of the
S-300 missiles to Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that the British government was
officially informed of the purchase of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described the leaking of information by the
British Defense Ministry about plans they have developed in the
event of a crisis in Cyprus as "unusual."
</P>
<P>
"Those who have leaked the information to the press
underestimate our intelligence and determination as well as the
Cypriot people's dignity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has repeatedly stated that this
defensive missile system will not be deployed if there is
substantial progress in efforts toward a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<P>
Entrants had to attend a quiz on July 2 to test their knowledge
on food and environmental hygiene as well as the environmental
hygiene facilities and services provided by the Council, according
to a spokesman for the Health Education Unit of the Regional
Services Department (RSD).
</P>
<P>
Those who have completed the program will be issued a
Certificate of Award and will have an opportunity to take part in
the Food Hygiene Carnival set for February next year and other
education activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that through visits and training, participating
students will be more aware of the importance of environmental
hygiene, be able to understand more about themselves and have
their life skills further enhanced," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Released Kaunda Vows to Continue with Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Released Zambian former president
Kenneth Kaunda said here Monday that he will continue with his
civil disobedience campaign and be a political rival of President
Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Lusaka High Court, Kaunda told reporters and
thousands of supporters immediately after his release that he
will continue to be a "thorn" in the side of his successor and
political foe, Chiluba, who took power from Kuanda in the 1991
multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
"I am still an active politician. I will continue with my
civil disobedience campaign because I was born that way," shouted
the 74-year-old former leader amid the deafening cheers of his
jubilant supporters.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, also leader of Zambia's largest opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP), launched a countrywide civil
disobedience campaign after he was disqualified as a presidential
candidate because of his foreign parentage.
</P>
<P>
The white-beard veteran statesman who led Zambia to
independence from Britain in 1964 and ruled the country for 27
years walked to freedom from the court Monday morning after the
state dropped all charges that he knew about a coup plot last
October.
</P>
<P>
The release was offered by Chiluba as a deal on condition that
Kaunda agrees to step down from politics, The Post, Zambia's
leading independent newspaper, Monday quoted UNIP and the state
house sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, some western diplomats believed that the release is a
deal brokered by South African President and leader of African
National Congress Nelson Mandela who spent years in exile in
Lusaka as Kuanda's guests, during the years of apartheid in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who was out of Zambia when the coup took place, was
arrested last December for alleged involvement in the foiled
military coup staged by dozens of junior army soldiers who
attempted to topple the Chiluba government. Kaunda has been
denying the allegations and insisting that he is "innocent".
</P>
<P>
He was transferred to house arrest days after his arrest under
international pressure but later was charged with misprision of
treason.

elderly by encouraging public housing applicants to live with
elderly members.
</P>
<P>
The HA's Rental Housing Committee (RHC) approved here on Monday
to further improve the existing two priority schemes which

the elderly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HA currently has two elderly priority schemes -- the
Families with Elderly Persons Priority Scheme (FEP) and the
Special Scheme for Families with Elderly Persons (NFEP).

<HEADLINE> Israel Fails to Decide on Pullback from West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet held a
session on Monday to discuss a further troop withdrawal from the
West Bank, but made no decisions.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
briefed the ministers on the current talks with the Palestinians
and the United States on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to convince all the ministers to accept a U.S.
proposal aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly proposed that Israel withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for the
fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Jerusalem said that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has urged Israel to make a decision on the
troop pullback in a few days.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, a
leading hawk in the rightwing Likud coalition, has expressed
opposition to the proposed scope of withdrawal, saying that any
pullback of more than 9 percent would jeopardize the security of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu suggested in the meeting that Sharon and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai meet Abu Mazen, deputy head of
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to discuss the issue. But
Sharon and Mordechai rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meir Sheetrit, Likud whip of Knesset (parliament),
Monday proposed that Netanyahu bring the issue of withdrawal to
the Knesset, despite the objection of the right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
He said that opposition Labor party would support the
government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In response, Labor Knesset member Haggai Meron said that Labor
should provide a safety net for the government on this issue.
</P>
<P>
But another Labor member Shevah Weiss opposed it, saying that
the Netanyahu government can not bring peace to the country and
the Labor should bring it down.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Exchange Index Drops Below 1000-Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE)-100 Index plunged Monday to an all-time record low as the
bourse reacted strongly to last week's nuclear tests by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 index dropped 128.76 points drastically Monday to
close at 911.44 against last Thursday's close of 1040.20 points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the reason for Monday's crash was mainly the
decision by the government to freeze foreign currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that these restrictions were lifted for
foreign investors who were trading in the stock exchange, the
overall impact has been very negative and foreigners are taking
out their money when they can," they say.
</P>
<P>
Soon after a decision was taken Monday morning to re-open the
bourse, the market saw some heavy selling.
</P>
<P>
The KSE index continued its decline throughout the day and
finally closed at a record all-time low. After the close, the
board of the KSE went into a meeting to decide what course of
action to adopt on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total volume of 52.98 million shares were traded on Monday
against 78.6 million shares traded in the previous trading day.
The market was closed on Friday on account of bank holiday.
</P>
<P>
There were 10 gainers and 95 losers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders expected the market to continue its downward slide on
Tuesday in the absence of any positive news or indicators.

<HEADLINE> Killing, Abduction Continue in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Killing and abduction activities
by freelance gangs escalated Monday in the Somali capital
as part of the on-going violence and lawlessness in the country.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed and five others wounded when
unidentified gunmen opened fire indiscriminately on a public
transport bus in south Mogadishu early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the bus, the first from the animal
market after the morning prayers, had been awaited by several
gunmen at Ali Kamin junction where the bus wound to drop some of
its passengers.
</P>
<P>
The attack is said to be a retaliatory move taken by armed
militiamen annoyed by a similar bus theft in south Mogadishu a
few days ago by members of the sub-clansmen of the owner of the
attacked bus.
</P>
<P>
The bodyguard of the bus managed to return fire and jumped
over the bus to defend it from the offenders until the neighbors
came out to help him.
</P>
<P>
The driver and conductor of the bus were also seriously
wounded in the incident. All those injured were rushed to a
nearby voluntary hospital for treatment. The ambush has been one
of the bloodiest vehicle-jacking attempt in recent weeks in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sheikh Omar Nur Omar (Awdhegle), a local aid worker
serving the French aid agency, Action Contra Le Faim (ACF), has
been abducted by unidentified gunmen in south Mogadishu on
Saturday. Local staff members of ACF said he was taken away to
an unidentified locality in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The ACF aid workers said they are still looking for him trying
to establish a string of information reaching for Sheikh Omar
Awdhegle who had been in charge of the financial affairs of the
agency in Mogadishu. The reason for the abduction is not known
to anyone, however, close friends attributed the abduction to a
contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Sheikh Omar Awdhegle is abducted
by Somali gunmen. On September 11, he was kidnappe by gunmen
and released two days later on what the agency termed as
non-conditional release.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of the aid worker came at a time when the main
faction leaders of the capital are calling for the return of the
international expatriates back to Mogadishu following their
evacuation for safety after 10 aid workers of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were kidnapped in north
Mogadishu in mid April.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders are becoming powerless in dealing with the
growing insecurity in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The aid worker's abduction is also taking place at a time when
serious cholera outbreak is further spreading in the Somali
capital and its surrounding areas as well as many other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
ACF is one of the five member team of the cholera task force
in collaboration with Mogadishu's joint health authority.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-elect Joseph
Estrada Monday committed to prioritizing the attainment of peace,
the modernization of the armed forces and the improvement of the
living standards of the soldiers and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Estrada bared the three top priorities in defense and security
matters during a closed-door meeting with outgoing President Fidel
Ramos and top military officers in what was considered one of the
briefings initiated by Ramos for the incoming administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration is determined to enhance the
security and military capabilities of the armed forces by fully
implementing the long-term modernization of the forces.
</P>
<P>
However, incoming Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado clarified
that the next administration cannot immediately release the funds
for the purchase of two modern planes for the armed forces as
requested by outgoing presidential national security adviser Jose
Almonte.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the next administration will still have to review
the terms of the sale and determine whether the modern planes will
play a key role in the modernization of the military.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Estrada committed to pursuing the peace
process by continuing the peace talks initiated by the Ramos
administration with the rebels in the country.
</P>
<P>
"My incoming administration is determined to pursue the peace
process, more so the implementation of peace and development
programs that would spell the lasting solution to these
insurgencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to fulfill the pledge in the election campaigns,
the President-elect said he would also push for a package of
measures to improve the living standards of soldiers and AFP
personnel.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier meeting, Estrada was briefed on the national
security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada gained an overwhelming victory in the May 11 elections.
He would assume office on June 30 when Ramos' term expires.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Holds Talks With Belorussian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister General
Chi Haotian, in talks with his Belorussian counterpart General
Alexander Chumakov here today, said that China is satisfied with
the current friendly cooperation between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
This is Chumakov's first visit to China. Chi, who is also
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and a state
councillor, expressed his belief that this visit will push the
friendly and cooperative ties between the two armed forces to a
new height.
</P>
<P>
Chi said relations between China and Belarus have developed
rapidly in recent years, and the two countries have only common
interests, without conflicts of fundamental interests, and they
share a consensus on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed appreciation for Belarus' support for China on
the issues of human rights and Taiwan. He noted that the
development of bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in
various sectors is not only in the fundamental interests of the
two peoples but is conducive to peace and stability in Asia,
Europe and the world as a whole, as well as to the
multipolarization of the world.
</P>
<P>
Chi said relations between the two armed forces is increasingly
enhanced with the development of country-to-country relations, and
China has always taken a positive attitude toward developing
relations between the two armed forces
</P>
<P>
Chi said that China is ready to make concerted efforts with
Belarus to advance the multi-level and multi-sector friendly and
cooperative ties oriented toward the 21st century between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the status of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA), Chi noted that PLA is subordinate to and serves the
economic construction of the country, adheres to the policy of
fewer but more professional troops according to China's actual
conditions and resolutely carries out the decision announced by
President Jiang Zemin to reduce the PLA by another 500,000
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Chi also briefed the guests on China's domestic situation, its
foreign policy and its views on current international situations.
</P>
<P>
Chumakov said that China plays an extremely important role both
in Asia and the world as a whole, and Belarus is keen to
develop close ties with China. He noted that a strong relationship
of friendship and cooperation between the two countries has been
forged, under the care of the two heads of state, and the two
countries share common understandings and stances on various
international issues.
</P>

bolster the friendly and cooperative ties between the two armed
forces, adding he hoped that the existing friendship and

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Defends Interest Rate Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 1 (Xinhua) - Malaysia's central bank said
Monday that its interest rate policy continued to be aimed at
balancing the need to maintain price stability and a stable
exchange rate while ensuring productive activity.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, (an) appropriate macroeconomic policy,
including (an) interest rate policy, is important for overall
confidence of the economic and financial system," Bank Negara, the
central bank, said in a statement on its current monetary stance
in light of issues that have been raised on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
It said that at the current interest rates, this balance was
being addressed within the comprehensive set of policies adopted
in December 1997 and March this year.
</P>
<P>
In promoting macroeconomic, financial stability and the
recovery of the economy, Malaysia has relied on a broad spectrum
of measures other than interest rates alone, it said.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing that borrowing costs had increased during the
current period and produced strains on the overall economy,
Malaysia also considered exchange rate stability to be an
important element in the recovery process, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of late, there have been calls from many quarters for lending
rates to be lowered in order to stimulate an economic recovery as
they contend that the current rates at around 16 percent were
stifling businesses and had caused the cost of doing business to
rise.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that in the current environment, inflationary
pressures needed to be contained so as to preserve the domestic
purchasing power, especially for the lower and medium income
groups.
</P>
<P>
It said that containing inflationary pressures and promoting
exchange rate stability were necessary to rebuild market
confidence and maintain international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"At the current interest rate level, the real rate of return on
deposits (after taking into account the expected rate of
inflation) is being maintained at levels prevailing before the
crisis," the bank said, adding that this has allowed savings in
Malaysia to continue to be efficiently mobilized through the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Appropriate interest rate levels were also necessary to contain
the outflows of funds, it added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said several initiatives had been taken to
correct the distortions that have resulted in lending rates being
higher than necessary despite a tighter monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
It said initiatives had also been taken to provide productive
sectors with access to financing at reasonable rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz wrapped up his two-day visit to Syria
Monday and left for Jordan, the second leg of his current
three-nation tour aimed at coordinating stances on a proposed Arab
summit.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Abdullah held talks with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad and Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam on ways of
breaking the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that Abdullah exchanged views with
Syrian leaders on the convening of an Arab summit. They also
discussed the adoption of a unified Arab stance toward the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Syria is part of a regional tour, which
will also take him to Egypt. The trip is aimed at coordinating
positions on holding an emergency Arab summit to deal with the
Israeli intransigence and hardline policy on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Media reports have said that most Arab states have agreed to
the convocation of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources said that Syria and Saudi Arabia have
identical views on the need for an Arab summit in view of the
delicate and sensitive conditions prevailing the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was also seeking to rectify the relations between
Syria, on the one hand, and Jordan and the Palestinians, on the
other.
</P>
<P>
The relations have been cool due to the Palestinians' efforts
to make peace with Israel since 1993 and Jordan's signing of a
peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Announces Expansion Plans for Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Federal Express (FedEx) of the US
revealed a packet of expansion plans here today that will improve
its express pick-up and delivery service within China, including
adding another cargo gateway to the company's business network and
opening three customer service centers in China.
</P>
<P>
"China is a huge market geographically, and the express segment
continues to grow faster than almost any other in the world. For that
reason, we are eager to see a more expanded FedEx business here,"
said John Quinn, vice-president of FedEx's Greater China and
Mid-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to Quinn, Chinese customers can count on an expansion
of flight coverage by the end of this year. In addition to the
current flights to Beijing and Shanghai, FedEx is adding a flight
to Shenzhen in Guangdong Province later this year, making the
city the third China cargo gateway served by the company.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, on June 4 FedEx will launch three more customer
service centers in China -- in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
respectively. Several toll-free telephone numbers are also being
introduced in the centers, to provide easy access for customers
in neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
FedEx currently serves more than 30 countries and regions in
the Asia-Pacific region with approximately 5,000 employees. The
company started express operations early in 1984 through local
agents, and was authorized by the Civil Aviation Administration of
China as the only US-based all-cargo carrier with an operating
permit for direct US-China services.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince in Jordan for Preparation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz arrived here Monday on the second leg of his
diplomatic tour to prepare an Arab summit on the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince will meet Jordan's King Hussein and
Crown Prince Hassan late Monday night, the official Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Minister
of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani confirmed on Sunday that such a
Arab summit will aim "to overcome Arab divisions."
</P>
<P>
In principle, Jordan supports the idea of holding an Arab
summit, provided that it delivers a positive message, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and bilateral
cooperation has been conducted in the fields of trade, airport
construction and water supply.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cooperation, Jordan joined the Arab chorus of
condemnation of the Israeli government for its refusal to
implement the peace accords it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince arrived from Syria, where he urged the
United States to back a just and legitimate settlement to the
long-stalled Mideast peace process and called on Israel to
acknowledge Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times Monday quoted anonymous Arab
diplomats as saying that the Saudi crown prince's visit to Amman
aims to reconcile the views of Syria and Jordan, which fears that
an Arab summit will put brakes on its normalization of ties with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
His diplomatic efforts followed the visit of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) to garner support for such a summit aimed at forming a
united front against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Saturday visited Saudi
Arabia and put forward comprehensive proposals for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit might be attended by Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Oman,
the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Jordan Times quoted
reports from Cairo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
for more than a year over the construction of a Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem. Recent efforts by the U.S. failed to
bridge the gap between the two sides after Israel refused a
U.S. proposal calling for a 13.1 percent of Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Determine Tempo of Mass Extinction 250 Million Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and US scientists have
jointly determined the tempo of a mass extinction of life more
than 250 million years ago. About 90 percent of species on Earth
disappeared in a period of 200,000 years.
</P>
<P>
This was the conclusion of scientists who tested zircon from
Late Permian and Early Triassic rocks from Leping County in
east China's Jiangxi Province. The results of the study have been
published in the US journal ``Science''.
</P>
<P>
"New studies show that the catastrophe was more violent than
people believed before," said Jin Yugan, a researcher at the
Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The peak period of the disaster was less than 200,000 years, a
wink in the 4.6 billion-year history of the earth," said Jin.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the climate of the earth was dry and hot during
the disaster, with rivers and lakes drying up, forests wiped out,
the sea level down to a record low, about 85 percent of the
species living in the oceans and 70 percent of the vertebrate
genera on land snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
"The mass extinction at the end of Permian Age was the most
profound in the history of life, surpassing the one symbolized by
the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago in terms of
its scale and impact on the evolution of life," added Jin.
</P>
<P>
The earth has witnessed five such huge mass extinctions in its
history, and the cause remains a mystery. Some scientists believe
they were caused by the impact of asteroids or comets.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happened, it happened very quickly," said Douglas
Erwin of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington,
D.C., who also took part in the joint research.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Remains Unbeaten in Volleyball World League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- As the preliminary round entered
halfway, Brazil became the only unbeaten team after six matches
with lots of surprises emerged from the men's volleyball world
league till Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Pool A, Cuba experienced defeat for the first time in the
competition as they lost both matches against Spain. Spanish home
team performed its beat matches until now, with an overwhelming
3-0 win in the first match and a more tight success in the second,
achieving victory in the tie-break with the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
After the second match, Spanish coach Juan Diaz was
delighted: "Today's match is the one we were all waiting for. This
victory reinforces our conviction that with work we can obtain our
best competitive shape."
</P>
<P>
The players of Bulgaria dedicated thier double victory against
South Korea to coach Stefan Sokolov who had his 41st birthday this
weekend. After the second match, Sokolov said "The Korean team
played very well and used good combinations in attack, but we won
thanks to our strong team spirit."
</P>
<P>
In Pool B, Italy and the Netherlands shared honors in their
double header. In Rome, more than 10,000 spectators witnessed the
3-0 victory of the Orange team against their favorites who were
never able to enter the match. Dutch coach Toon Gebrands said that
"our goal was to win one match against Italy to get the access to
the semifinals. We did it and we are very happy."
</P>
<P>
The situation turned over in Siena's crowded Sports Hall when
the Italians struck back and beat the Olympic champions 3-0 in the
second match.
</P>
<P>
Big surprises in Argentina where local team defeated by Greece
3-2, 3-1. The Greeks who took advantage of good services and
better defence also won the second match, showing an impossible
equation to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In Pool C, Brazil attracted a record attendance of 14,650 in
Rio de Janeiro against Russia. After five matches in this
competition without losing a single set, the South American
conceded the first one to the Russian during their second match,
winning yet easily the double header.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Radames Lattari said that he preferred the
second match because his players had to face a stronger resisting
from the opponent. "I want to give experience to my youngest
players because I know the matches will be harder in Europe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Poland shared the points, with a 3-0 victory for
the host team in the first match and 3-2 success of the visitors
in the second.
</P>
<P>
The Polish coach Ireuneucz Mazur said "I must say that we were
surprised twice during this weekend: first Friday when the
Yugoslav had their almost strongest line-up and the second when
some of the best players did not appear today. Still, now we can
see the importance of Grbic brothers in the Yugoslav team. Their
absence enabled us to stabilise our game and little by little win
this second match. I am very happy for it."

<HEADLINE> India's 1998-99 Defense Budget Increases Over 14 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- India's 1998-99 budget for
defense has increased by over 14 percent from the previous year's
360.99 billion rupees (9.38 billion U.S. dollars) to 412 billion
rupees (10.70 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1998-99 budget (from April 1,1998 to March 31,
1999) to Parliament here Monday, Indian Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha said that he would consider further increase in the
budgetary support during the course of the year, if necessary.
"There can be no compromise in our defense preparedness," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan allocation for Department of Atomic
Energy is being enhanced by 68 percent from 8.28 billion rupees
(0.22 billion dollars) to 13.91 billion rupees (0.36 billion
dollars) and the plan allocation for the Department of Space is
being raised by 62 percent from 8.5 billion rupees (0.22 billion
dollars) to 13.81 billion rupees (0.36 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Atomic Energy has made bigger contributions
to India's five successive nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The total Central plan outlay in the 1998-99 budget is at
1,051.87 billion rupees (27.32 billion dollars) from last year's
810.33 billion rupees (21.05 billion dollars) while the total
expenditure is estimated at 2,681.07 billion rupees (69.64 billion
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first regular budget of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP)-led government in the wake of economic sanctions imposed on
India by The United States, Japan, etc. after it conducted its
five nuclear tests recently.
</P>
<P>
According to a government's economic survey in 1997-98, the
economic situation in the country was in bad shape. Overall
economic growth slowed down to 5 percent in 1997-98 and
agricultural growth was negative. Growth of industrial production
also slackened to 4.2 percent and export growth registered less
than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, India's fiscal deficit worsened to 6.1 percent
of GDP, the capital market remained in the doldrums and
infrastructure bottlenecks continued to plague the economy,
according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh to Urge Elections Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prince
Norodom Ranariddh said Monday that he will called for a delay of
the coming elections if voter registration is less than 80 percent
and the access to media is not made equal.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while traveling to the eastern province of
Kompong Cham, about 200 kilometers from Phnom Penh, to register
for the coming Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
"We will urge a delay of the elections if voter registration is
less than 80 percent, and media access to all political parties is
not equal," Ranariddh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The National United Front (NUF), consisting of Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC and other opposition parties, have threatened to boycott
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration is from May 18 to June 15.
</P>
<P>
According to National Election Committee's (NEC) estimates, 30
percent of more of the five million eligible voters registered in
the first week.
</P>
<P>
A report in Monday's Cambodia Daily said FUNCINPEC could still
be declared ineligible for the elections if the Ministry of
Interior was to withdraw approval on grounds that FUNCINPEC still
had its own army, which is forbidden by political party law.
</P>
<P>
Troop reintegration talks between the government and the forces
loyal to Ranariddh were at a deadlock because each side accused
the other of not being serious about reintegration.

<HEADLINE> China's Electronics Industry Faces Major Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's electronics industry is
to undergo major restructuring to help it shed surplus capacity and
concentrate resources on hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Beijing-based Research Center of the Computer
and Microelectronics Industrial Development (CCID) said that the
household electronic appliance sector is plagued by overcapacity,
while a huge market for hi-tech products is yet to be tapped in
China.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's color TV production lines have a total
capacity of more than 45 million color TV sets every
year, but only 46.1 percent of the capacity is used.
</P>
<P>
Only 50.1 percent of the country's production lines of
refrigerators are working. The rate is even lower for factories
making air-conditioners, range hoods, vacuum cleaners and
washing machines.
</P>
<P>
Local industry experts say that the Chinese government has
adopted a policy of letting market competition regulate the
electronics industry, but it has not adopted effective measures
to prevent over-lapping investment in similar projects.
</P>
<P>
For example, since the beginning of the 1990s, several
localities such as Tianjin, and Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong
provinces have set up color TV production bases capable of turning
out millions of sets every year. A joint venture in Shanghai
alone has a production capacity of three million sets a year.
</P>
<P>
However, the hi-tech sector of the country's electronics
industry lacks such large-sized enterprises. The biggest personal
computer (PC) producer in China, the Legend Group, turned out
400,000 PCs in 1997, while the domestic market for PCs was
increasing by one million every year.

HARBIN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A products-processing park for
exports to Russia went into operation today in the Economic and
Technological Development Zone in this capital city of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The park is the first in the country specializing in products
for export to Russia, and features integrated technological
development, production and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The park will make use of resources from northeast China and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and overseas enterprises located in the park will
enjoy preferential policies granted by the Chinese government,
involving tax reduction and exemption for raw material imports,
storage of goods and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
The park is expected to improve and increase China's exports to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 enterprises with overseas funds from 26 countries
and regions have been set up in the park involving more than 1.3
billion US dollars in total investment.

<HEADLINE> China's Electronics Industry Faces Major Restructuring (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By April this year, the number of China's mobile telephone
users had exceeded 16 million. The figure is still growing at an
annual rate of 100 percent. However, China will not put into
operation its first wholly-owned mobile phone plant until
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
China now produces less than one fourth of the eight billion
integrated circuits that it uses every year. About 80
percent of those made in China are from plants wholly or
partially owned by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the imbalance of product structure has
become a major restricting factor for the electronics
industry. They said that overcapacity in certain sectors is a
waste of resources. Therefore, the industry has no way out apart
from restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Market competition has already forced a number of local
electronics giants to readjust their development strategies. Major
TV manufacturers such as Changhong, Hai'er and TCL have diversified
their business into information technology. They have developed
new products such as digital TV sets and multimedia computer
terminals.
</P>
<P>
There is a rising trend in the industry for computer and
electronic appliance manufacturers to mix their businesses.
</P>
<P>
An official from the former Ministry of the Electronics Industry
said that the industry has two major issues to address: One is to
beef up local enterprises' research and development muscle; the
other is to increase input into commercialization of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, China should place manufacturing of
whole sets of computers on the basis of self-developed integrated
circuits, so as to foster its own copyrighted products.
</P>
<P>
China's electronics and integrated circuits industry had a
total output of 380 billion yuan (about 100 billion US
dollars)-worth in 1997. The figure is expected to reach 700
billion yuan-worth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, profits in the industry had remained flat
as output kept increasing. As a result of restructuring, the
industry saw an 10.8 percent increase of profits before tax in
1997 over 1996.

<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Forest Department of Bangladesh
will launch a nation-wide tree planting campaign on June 15, the
national news agency BSS reported Monday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Iran to Intensify Efforts on Afghan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said here Monday that Pakistan and Iran will intensify
their joint efforts for the acceleration of the Afghan peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Gohar, who greeted his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi at
the Islamabad airport Monday afternoon, said in a statement that
the Iranian foreign minister's visit "is part of regular high
level consultations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"Our talks would follow up on the discussions held between our
leaders on the sidelines of the 5th Summit of the Economic
Cooperation Organization in Almaty last month," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would particularly focus on the situation in Afghanistan
with a view to promoting intra-Afghan dialogue and a peaceful
solution of the conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would seek to intensify our joint efforts for the
acceleration of the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss the expansion of bilateral trade and
economic linkages including the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline and oil
refinery projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The general security situation in the region, arising out of
the recent developments, would also come under review, he said.
</P>
<P>
In early May, Afghanistan's Taliban militia and their rival
Northern Alliance held here their first face-to-face talks in over
a year under the auspices of the United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference. However the talks were
suspended as the two sides refused to make any compromise with
each other.

<HEADLINE> China to Build National Science Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China is to construct a national
science think tank on the basis of the existing Academic
Committees of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"The CAS academic committees comprise the most authoritative
scientists. Therefore they should play a more active role in
helping the country," Lu Yongxiang, president of CAS, said
today at the ninth conference of CAS academicians.
</P>
<P>
"The national science think tank should be China's highest
academic assessment body," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological groups are needed to join the
consultation and decision of lots of strategic and foresighted
issues concerning the country's development, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
China's many successful science promotion plans, including the
12-year development program, the science funding system and
Project 863 for high-tech enhancement, all originated from the
proposals of CAS academicians and CAS Academic Committees, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to introduce a scientific and democratic
system for all-round decision-making," Lu stressed.
</P>
<P>
"CAS must build the most influential consultative body for
the country's decision makers," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The credibility and authoritativeness of CAS academicians should
be further promoted, Lu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met
here today with a delegation from the European Parliament (EP)
specializing in relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that China and the European Union (EU) have long had
good cooperative relations. The NPC and the EP also have frequent
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
According to Zou, it is understandable for China and European
countries, whose social systems and ideology are different, to
hold different opinions on certain matters. "Through bilateral
exchanges, the two sides can seek common ground while leaving
differences aside so as to further understanding and develop
cooperation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Per Gahrton, an EP parliamentarian and head of the delegation,
told Zou that the members of his group are representatives of six
EP parties from eight out of the 15 EU member states. They have
exchanged views with the Chinese side on economic, environmental,
global security and human rights issues. "The EU is willing to
further such ties with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gahrton and his party are here as guests of the NPC Standing
Committee.

<HEADLINE> ``China to Be Scientific Power by 2050'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Lu Yongxiang, president of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said today that China is
expected to meet advanced world scientific and technological
standards by 2050 and become a strong power in this sphere.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a work report at the Ninth Conference of CAS
academicians that opened today, Lu said Chinese scientists and
researchers will handle key scientific issues involving the
national economy, social development and national security by
themselves at that time, and basically meet the needs of the
knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
He said China will be a moderately developed nation in the
middle of the next century, and the CAS has formulated a scientific
development strategy in line with Deng Xiaoping's requirement that
"scientific and technological work must take the lead."
</P>
<P>
In 10 years' time, the CAS will put more effort into some key
fast-developing scientific topics with Chinese characteristics,
while China will also try to increase its capability of improving and
absorbing technology, and combine science and the economy better, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, insufficient input still restrains China's
scientific and technological development, Lu said, adding that to
solve the problem requires joint efforts of the government,
enterprises and various social sectors in addition to the
scientific sector itself.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A tornado that struck South Dakota without warning on
Saturday night has wiped out most of a small farming community,
killing six people and destroying its post office, fire station,
library, bank and all four churches. The region was also pelted
with hail the size of chicken eggs.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States would support new international financial
aid to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin if Russian
could not meet its short-term debts, President Clinton said,
because a meltdown of the ruble could threaten the stability of
the government there.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton may drop his court appeal on executive
privilege Monday, possibly short-circuiting independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr's bid to bring the case directly to the Supreme
Court, but also allowing Starr to summon senior White House aides
back to the grand jury, sources close to the situation said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign ministers from the five major nuclear states, which
are the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France, are expected to
demand that India and Pakistan agree to halt tests, keep nuclear
warheads off missiles, avoid transferring technology, order a
moratorium on production of bomb material, and begin Kashmir talks.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
A day after spawning a tornado that killed six people and
destroyed tiny Spencer in South Dakota, a massive storm system
moved through the Northeast Sunday, punishing the region with more
twisters, hail and rain. The six people died Saturday in Spencer
brought the national tornado death toll this year to 121 -- the
worst since 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A MD-82 plane today left
Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, for
Niigata City in Japan, which means another regular flight linking
Northeast China and Japan has opened.
</P>
<P>
China opened flights between Shenyang, capital of Liaoning
Province in Northeast China, and Osaka, Japan, on May 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The once-a-week new flight is economical and convenient
for passengers, according to an official of the Shenyang-based
China Northern Airlines, which operates the flight.
</P>
<P>
The economic relationship between Heilongjiang and Japan has
made rapid progress over recent years. Statistics show that the
province's export volume to Japan reached 385 million
U.S. dollars-worth in 1997, and Japanese business people had
invested a total of 400 million U.S. dollars in Heilongjiang by
the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Moi Calls for Revitalizing Kenya's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Monday called strongly for revitalizing the country's battled
economy when celebrating the 35th anniversary of self-governance
in pomp and color.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people poured into downtown Nairobi's Uhuru
Park in the morning of Madaraka Day to observe grand celebrations
featured by a march-past by members of the Armed Forces, a
fly-past by Kenya Air Force jets, and songs and colorful
traditional dancers.
</P>
<P>
The day marks the occasion when Kenya secured internal
self-government from the British colonialists and was firmly on
course to independence six months later on December 12, 1963.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation, Moi said the most critical challenges
Kenya faces are poverty and high unemployment rate. More than 45
percent of Kenya's nearly 30 million population now live below
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved much during the past 35 years but the war
against poverty has yet to be won," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment has been on the increase mainly because of the
economic difficulties we have experienced since the beginning of
this decade. The situation has been further worsened by reduced
levels of investment," Moi noted.
</P>
<P>
The president listed measures to reduce "excessively high
interest rates," improve tax revenue collection, strengthen
combats against corruption and crimes as top priorities in the
nation-wide efforts to jump-start the economy and the security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for closer cooperation in eastern Africa,
saying Kenya has always been ready to devoted itself to mediating
in regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Moi also expressed concern about the rising tension between
Ethiopia and Eritrea over a border row, adding that Kenya is
willing to assist in finding a peaceful solution to their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff General Daudi Tonje, cabinet ministers
and foreign diplomats were present at the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> China's Policy on Comprehensive Public Security Control Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's implementation of
comprehensive management of public security is totally correct and
a fundamental solution to the law and order problems in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee and of the CPC Central Committee
Secretariat, made the remark at a conference today of the Central
Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, when the central leadership decided to step up
comprehensive management of public security, the policy has been
well implemented throughout the country, noted Luo, who is also
chairman of the committee,
</P>
<P>
As a result, social stability has been safeguarded and the
people feel more secure, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is a crucial part of comprehensive management to crack down
on serious criminal activities that threaten public order, Luo
said, stressing that the "strike hard" principle should be
maintained, so as to keep high pressure on crime.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will give priority to combatting serious
criminal activities such as robbery, murder, causing explosions,
gangsterism, drug-related crimes and theft, according to Luo.

HANOI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's gross domestic product
(GDP) growth is expected to be between 6.5 percent and 6.8 percent
in the first five months of 1998, compared to 9.1 percent in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Government Office Lai Van Cu said exports in
the five months increased by 10 percent to stand at 3.86 billion
U.S. dollars. The government earlier predicted the increase to be
from 25 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline could be attributed to weak demand and lower
prices, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The official also said foreign direct investment in the first
five months dropped sharply, and if the situation did not improve,
investment for the whole year was expected to be only 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars, compared with 4.5 billion dollars last year.

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that a large number of young scientists and engineers
should be nurtured to meet the needs of science and technology
development in China and the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Arabs Favor Single Stand Towards Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Arab world is increasingly
intended to form a unified stance to save the dying peace process,
visiting Arab League (AL) chief said monday.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters here
that contacts are still needed to hold a proposed Arab summit on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri on regional situation, especially the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world intensified efforts to help reactivate the
stalled peace process after the failure of the latest round of
U.S. peace mediation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalemated since March
last year because of Israel's expansion of settlement in East
Jerusalem and the delayed withdrawal of troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Arab summit is designed to hammer out an action
plan to deal with Israel's intransigence, Abdel-Meguid said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Leading officials at all levels
should take the lead in carrying out the anti-extravagance rules
recently formulated by the Central Commission of the Communist
Party of China for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
In the next few months, local Party committees and governments
should work harder to achieve the anti-corruption goals set by
the commission.
</P>
<P>

During his stay in Guangxi, Wei visited a number of local
villages, factories and hi-tech development projects and held
talks with local officials.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Wei urged local authorities to deal with major
corruption cases and punish corrupt officials. Analyses should be
made of typical cases, so as to sum up the experience in this
sphere and educate officials, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for International Efforts to Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Monday urged the international community to intensify efforts to
save the dying Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Facing up to any failure in the current bid to save the peace
process is not only an Arab responsibility but also an
international one," Moussa was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the initiative formulated by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chriac
to call for an international conference on the Mideast
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
He said "the initiative is one of a series of moves which we
should resort to in certain circumstances and when it becomes
necessary to study alternatives for immediate political action."
</P>
<P>
His words came as the Arab states are undertaking intensive
contacts for an Arab summit to unify stance among Arab countries
toward Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
last year because of Israel's expansion of settlement and the
much-delayed troop redeployment in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Citing security reasons, Israel firmly turned down a
U.S. proposal calling for Israeli troops withdrawal from 13
percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the ongoing consultations at various levels among
Arab states all have shown the Arab coordination in tackling the
current difficulties in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Israel for "wasting peace opportunities one after
another," Moussa said "a firm stance" should be taken towards
Israel's "provocative" attitude.

<HEADLINE> Feature: British Expatriate Working for SAR Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- When Hong Kong's Postmaster
General Robert Footman attended an Asian Pacific Postal Union
(APPU) meeting in Vietnam in September last year, it was a big
surprise for many people to see a European face in the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the British expatriate sat at the table
representing China at the APPU.
</P>
<P>
"There was a feeling of historic change. That's a very powerful
feeling so you'll take photographs," Footman recalled while
showing photographs of that special moment.
</P>
<P>
"It felt quite strange, suddenly for me, to represent China.
But you don't feel that strangeness after a few minutes when you
sit down and join it (the Chinese delegation)," Footman told
Xinhua at his office in Central.
</P>
<P>
Footman said the Chinese delegation was a "very friendly" one
and he already knew some mainland colleagues before joining it.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a big surprise for many people to see him with
the Chinese delegation, adding that his friends from other postal
administrations "had a broad smile on their face" and "recognized
that it was really a change."
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty a surprise, but it was very positive," said
Footman, who has served various government posts in more than 20
years of public service.
</P>
<P>
Appointed Hong Kong's postmaster general in late 1995, Footman
stayed in the post after Hong Kong's handover to serve the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the changes brought to Hongkong Post by the
handover, Footman said that since July 1, 1997, representatives
from Hongkong Post have continued participating in the activities
of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and the APPU as members of the
Chinese delegation. Formerly, Hong Kong joined the British
delegation at UPU meetings and was an observer with the APPU.
</P>
<P>
"Those were changes brought by the handover for us in the post
office. From my point of view that (the post-handover arrangement)
worked very well," Footman said.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Post has been playing a significant role in Hong
Kong's development as a leading commercial, financial and
industrial center, by offering reliable, efficient and universal
services, Footman said.
</P>
<P>
Operating as a trading fund department, Hongkong Post remains a
separate postal administration after the handover, which means
"business as usual," said the 45-year-old SAR official.
</P>
<P>
"We set our postal rates so we continue to have Hong Kong
rates, we issue our stamps, carry out our financial arrangements
with other postal administrations and sign new agreements, and I
continue to meet colleagues in other administrations," Footman
said, adding that this is exactly what the "one country, two
systems" concept has suggested.
</P>
<P>
And for the public of Hong Kong, Footman said, "Life has
continued very much after July 1 as it was before July 1."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the transition year had an impact on nearly
every government department and service, in the sense that "the
workload went up." The year meant a lot of extra work in
particular for the 5,900 staff members of Hongkong Post.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of things to do, Footman said, like the
design of the new definitive stamps which can be used both before
and after July 1, to replace the old ones bearing the British
queen's head.
</P>
<P>
The new definitive stamp series, featuring a stretch of the
waterfront of the Hong Kong Island, has a neutral design with no
connotation of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"It was not difficult, but it was extra work. There were a lot
of little things like that," Footman said, who highly appreciated
the work attitude of his staff.
</P>
<P>
From time to time workload doubled, but staff didn't, he said.
During the five-day holiday spanning the handover, Hong Kong post
offices were open for the issue of special stamps and souvenir
sheets. At least 4,000 staff were reported for duty during that
period.
</P>
<P>
Recently there was a large volume of mails coming from the
first Legislative Council elections of the SAR and quite a few of
deliveries were required on Sundays just to clear the mail
backlog.
</P>
<P>
Having a family tradition of working overseas, the Cambridge
graduate came to Hong Kong and joined the government as an
administrative officer in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Before being appointed to head Hongkong Post, which he
described as "an extraordinary organization," Footman had served
in a number of government departments which gave him a wide range
of experience that "few careers can give."
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky that I have a lot of very exciting and challenging
jobs over the years. I'm very happy. In the foreseeable future I
will continue to serve the Hong Kong government," Footman said.
</P>
<P>
He married a Hong Kong Chinese, now a judicial administrator,
and has two sons.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Chairman on Situation in the Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Maldivian President and SAARC
Chairman Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on Monday called upon all parties
concerned to exercise maximum restraint and make every possible
effort to contain the situation in the region following separate
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the recent developments in the region, Gayoom
said that SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
was set up with the important aim of promoting the welfare of the
peoples of South Asia, improving the quality of their life,
enhancing collective self-reliance and contributing to mutual
trust among the seven member countries.
</P>
<P>
A number of significant and positive steps towards the
achievement of these goals had been taken in the past 13 years,
and in particular, during the 9th SAARC summit held in May 1997 in
Male, capital of the Maldives, said the statement from the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, in view of the momentum and hope generated by that
summit for the acceleration of the SAARC process, it is
unfortunate that recent developments in the sub-continent have led
to increased tension in South Asia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan carried out six nuclear tests on May 28 and 30 in
response to the five nuclear tests conducted by India on May 11
and 13, raising fears of a nuclear arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
"As the current chairman of SAARC, I call upon all parties
concerned to exercise maximum restraint, and to make every
possible effort to contain the situation," Gayoom said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the parties to begin the process of informal
political consultations agreed upon at the 9th SAARC summit in
order to create a climate of confidence and trust in the region,
which he said would allow regional cooperation to go ahead
unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Senior Scientist Lists Major Science Events in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
President Lu Yongxiang today reviewed the major events in
China's scientific development in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference attended by CAS academicians, Lu said
that the century has witnessed unprecedented scientific and
technological developments around the world, and that mankind's
scientific thinking and methods have matured.
</P>
<P>
He noted that reform and opening-up over the past two decades
have pushed China's scientific and technological development to
a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The president listed the following ten major events in the
process of China's science development in this century:
</P>
<P>
First, along with the New Culture Movement early in the
century, a number of scientists returned from overseas and
some institutions of higher learning were established, which laid
the foundation for modern scientific development in China.
</P>
<P>
Second, with the setting up of scientific organs, including the
Central Research Institute and the Beiping (-- old name of
Beijing) Research Institute in the late 1920s, the foundations of
the basic disciplines of mathematics, physics and chemistry were
laid, and China's scientific undertakings began to get on a
regular track.
</P>
<P>
Third, the newly-founded People's Republic of China in 1949
decided to organize the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which pooled
large numbers of outstanding scientists and invited back many
scientists living overseas. A national science and technology
system with CAS at the core was formed.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, in 1956 China worked out and began to implement a
12-year science program, founding a number of new science and
technology research centers, and establishing a basic
framework for science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, China's petroleum industry took off, mainly due to the
efforts of Chinese scientists and engineers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, the development of nuclear weapons and China's own
man-made satellite not only safeguarded national security but also
boosted the self-confidence of the Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Seventh, achievements such as the development of synthetic
bovine insulin and research into Goldbach's conjecture showed the
world the ability and creativity of the Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Eighth, the Report Outline of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
was mapped out in 1975, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Ninth, a national congress on scientific development was
held in 1978.
</P>
<P>
And tenth, the development of science and technology in China
has entered a new period since the country's introduction of
overall reform and opening to the outside world, and the reform of
the science and technology system.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the theory that "Science and technology
constitute a primary productive force", which was put forward by
Deng Xiaoping a dozen years ago, has greatly boosted scientific
undertakings in China.
</P>
<P>
"People in science and technology circles have reached
the consensus that the pace of building a new scientific and
technological system in China must be quickened in the face of
economic globalization and the forthcoming knowledge-based
economy," Lu Yongxiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
here Monday appointed three economists as senior economic advisers
to help the government reverses the economic downturn, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic issues are given top priority, the government is
determined to deal with them," State Secretary/Minister Akbar
Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
The three senior economic advisers, Widjojo Nitisastro, Ali
Wardhana and Frans Seda, were tasked to given suggestions to the
head of state and ministers under the Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry on how to solve the crisis and
future economic issues, Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of unrests have gravely aggravated the economic
crisis in the country, as reflected by the steady decline of the
rupiah which is now only worth a quarter of its 1997 value. Many
factories have stopped production, unemployment is continue rising
and the cost of daily necessities have now hit an exorbitant
level.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a fact-finding visit to Indonesia last Saturday,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Asia Pacific Director Hubert
Neiss said he has no reason to doubt forecasts that the battered
Indonesian economy could contract 10 percent or more in 1998.

LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's detained former president
Kenneth Kaunda who has been charged with misprison of treason here
was set free Monday morning together with his security chief Moyce
Kaulung'ombe after the state withdrew its case.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka high court judge Japhet Banda said the court forgave
Kaunda and his security chief the offenses they committed 10
minutes after the court opened. Kaunda was charged with
concealing knowledge of a coup plot last year.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who led Zambia for 27 years from independence until
he was ousted by Frederick Chiluba in multiparty elections in
1991, denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of supporters of Kaunda and his opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) were signings and dancing out
the court as soon as Kaunda walked out of the court.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda,74, was detained last December for alleged involvement
in last october's foiled military coup which aimed to topple the
elected Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
he was formally charged together with his security chief with
misprison of treason, the legal term for not reporting knowledge
of a treasonous act, last February. Junior army officers staged
an abortive coup attempt against Chiluba in October.
</P>
<P>
Some people believed that freedom for Kaunda, who has been
under house arrest for most of the time since his detention, came
as part of a deal brokered by South African President Nelson
Mandela.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to hold donors
conference in London soon to help children affected by the war in
Sierra Leone, a report reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, the U.N.'s special representative for children
and armed conflict, was quoted as saying this Saturday in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, at the end of his four-day
visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, who met President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and members of
parliament in his visit, said he was appalled "to see a
congregation of unaccompanied children emerging from bushes with
no clothes, no food" during his visit to Daru in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about all children in armed conflicts
situation not only child soldiers, ex-combatants or displaced but
also those who have lost their limbs and those who have been
traumatized," he added.
</P>
<P>
Afflicted by years of civil war, Sierra Leone is now one of
the poorest country in the world.
</P>
<P>
The country's military junta, who overthrew elected president
Kabbah last May but was driven out from Freetown in February this
year, is still fighting the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG in the east. The war has produced tens of thousands of
refugees and displaced people.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Pay to Raise ADB Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would pay 475
million Rand (93 million U.S. Dollars) over the next eight years
to finance its increased stake in the African Development Bank
(ADB), Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Marcus announced last week South Africa's intention to raise
its share-holding in the ADB to six percent from one percent
after the bank's share holders struck a deal to increase its
general capital by 35 percent and to change the bank's voting
structure.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's pledge amounts to a contribution of 7.4 billion
Rand (1.45 billion Dollars) to the Abidjan-based bank, Business
Day paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 475 million Rand to be paid over the first eight years,
about 67 million Rand (13 million Dollars) will be paid every
year in the first five years and 45 million Rand (8.8 million
Dollars) will be paid annually in the remaining three years.
</P>
<P>
Marcus described South Africa's move as reflecting a profound
confidence that the bank, after three years of institutional

<HEADLINE> Philippine President-Elect Cleared in Slaying Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Justice of the
Philippines Monday finally cleared president-elect Joseph Estrada
of any link with an alleged plot to assassinate outgoing President
Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Under-Secretary Jesus Zozobrado
made a recommendation to Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello saying
there was no sufficient evidence to link Estrada to the alleged
plot.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was dragged into the alleged slaying plot during
election campaigns. One of his top aide said Estrada smuggled
high-power guns into the country and ordered him three times to
kill Ramos in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Estrada denied the allegation, saying the aide
was being investigated by policemen for involving in kidnappings.
When the national police looked into the alleged plot, the aide
fled to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the presidential candidate of the main opposition
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipinos (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), won a landslide victory in the May 11 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Estrada will be sworn in on June 30 when Ramos' six-year term
expires. Ramos was banned by law to seek a second term.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Increase Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kampala has received approval from
donors to increase the share of defense spending in the coming
1998/99 budget, the first time the World Bank to allocate
substantial funds from the national budget to defense spending.
</P>
<P>
However, the government did not release the exact figure.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Ministry of Finance were quoted by national
press as saying that donors have pledged 250 million U.S. Dollars
as budgetary support to Uganda in the new financial year
beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget is to be presented on June 11, 1998 by the new
Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Gerald Sendawula.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general sense of agreement from the donor
community that the government may spend substantial amounts of
money on defense because we recognize the problem of insecurity
in parts of the country," said Randolph Harris, the World Bank
resident representative in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
He noted that donors were satisfied the defense expenditure
would not encroach substantially on funds earmarked for social
programs like education, health and road rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The defense spending reportedly takes the lion's share of
Uganda's budget, followed closely by universal primary education,
transport and health.
</P>
<P>
The government is intensifying its fight against the rebels of
the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) in the north and those of the
Allied Democratic Forces in the west.
</P>
<P>
Recent infiltration into Kitgum and Gulu districts in north
Uganda by LRA rebels spearheaded by Joseph Kony hit headlines and
army units have been dispatched to the areas from other districts
in a decisive campaign against the rebels.

CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Last Friday's fall on Wall Street
and lower Asian bourses dragged the Australian share market to a
weaker finish Monday amid thin trading.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark All Ordinaries Index ended 26.6 points, or almost
1 percent, softer at 2689.1, but up from its intra-day trough of
2675.2.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70.25 points on Friday to
8,899.95, capping off a volatile week in which 214 points were
slashed from the index.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the Nikkei shed 349.75 points or 2.2 percent to close
at the day's low of 15,321.03 due to renewed worries about the
health of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said concerns over how New York and Asian markets would
perform this week dominated local investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"The market is just extremely cautious right now and much will
depend on what happens offshore over the week," Reynolds &AMP; Co's
Peter Struk said.
</P>
<P>
He said market speculation was resurfacing over a possible rate
cut in Australia, which helped the All Ordinaries' partial
recovery.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was contained to 231.88 million shares valued
at 697.75 million Australian dollars (432.6 million U.S. dollars),

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar on the Slide Again as Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was pushed
back below the 62 U.S. cent level Monday as the Japanese yen
continued to plunge against the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local currency fell as low as 61.88 U.S. cents before
stepping back up a little to close at 62.02 U.S. cents from
Friday's close of 62.34.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank senior manager for foreign exchange Kurt
Magnus said the Japanese yen/US dollar exchange rate was very
close to its previous record low, reached on July 5, 1991, of
139.35.
</P>
<P>
"We've just hit that now," he said moments before the close of
the market locally.
</P>
<P>
Magnus said the Australian dollar continued to be used as a
proxy for weakening Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
"The interrelation between the Japanese yen and the Aussie
remains at historically high levels and any weakness in the yen
will see weakness in the Australian dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the Japanese yen fell against the U.S. dollar it would push
the Australian dollar back to last week's near-12 year low of
61.65 U.S. cents, Magnus said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar was at 86.20 from
86.41 against Japanese yen and 1.1022 from 1.1107 against German
mark.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- New Chinese Ambassador to India

Narayanan here Monday and the two sides exchanged views on

</P>
<P>
Zhou first conveyed President Jiang Zemin's greetings and good

</P>
<P>
The Indian president recalled the long-standing friendship and

countries.
</P>
<P>
"Both our countries have the foresight and the wisdom to

problems between us that cannot be resolved."

<HEADLINE> HK Determined to Protect Intellectual Property: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government is determined to protect
the creative talent of both local people and overseas investors,
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Seizures of pirated optical discs in the first five months of
this year, amounting to more than 28 million, exceeded those made
in the entire 1997, the top leader of Hong Kong told the opening
ceremony of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
Asian Regional Symposium.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, held in HKSAR for the first time,
focuses on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the
context of implementing the Agreement of Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property (TRIPS) under the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Effective enforcement can only flow from good laws. Our set of
laws on protection of patents, designs, trademarks and copyright
works is one of the most complete and modern in the world," Tung
noted.
</P>
<P>
"That, of course, is not enough in itself. Like many other
economies, we face considerable challenges in our efforts to
enforce these laws," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Tung pointed out that, on top of the legislative and
enforcement efforts, the government "will do more in educating our
traders not to take part in illegal activities which infringe
intellectual property rights, and our general population not to
demand cheap, pirated or counterfeit goods."
</P>
<P>
The departments concerned have been reaching out to secondary
school students and the community to help them understand the
importance of intellectual property protection, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, co-organized by the WIPO and the Intellectual
Property Department of the HKSAR, is attended by more than 100
professionals.

and stability in the region, Zhu noted.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Three Ruling Party Alliance Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three-party ruling alliance
of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) and the New Party Sakigake broke up Monday with the
SDP's departure.
</P>
<P>
The SDP formally decided to quit the four-year-old ruling
coalition at a meeting Saturday of its lawmakers of both houses of
the Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Saturday, the SDP mentioned differences
between the LDP and the SDP over an anti-corruption bill and the
cabinet approval of new Japan-U.S. defense cooperation-related
bills without the SDP's agreement.
</P>
<P>
The SDP's decision to quit the alliance ends the tripartite
system which dates from the establishment in June 1994 of the
three-party coalition government with the then SDP leader Tomiichi
Murayama as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting of the heads of the three parties Monday morning,
SDP chairwoman Takako Doi conveyed her party's decision to leave
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake has also decided to leave the alliance at the end of
the current session of the Diet, scheduled to last through June 10.
</P>
<P>
No immediate change in the country's governing structure is
expected as the LDP controls a majority in the powerful House of
Representatives (lower house), analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, however, may experience some difficulties in the House
of Councillors, where the ruling party lacks a majority, they said.
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, leader of the LDP, succeeded Murayama as
prime minister in January 1996 but the SDP and Sakigake maintained
the three-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
After the launch of the second Hashimoto cabinet last
September, the two parties remained as the LDP's non-cabinet
parliamentary allies.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks to Go On Under New Philippine Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) - Peace talks between the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) and the administration of new Philippine
President Joseph Estrada will continue even if the process might
be delayed a little.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Monday by a high-ranking MILF official amid
fear and speculations by various sectors regarding the fate of the
peace process under the new government.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chair for political affairs and also
chairman of the MILF peace negotiating panel, said over a local
radio station that they are only awaiting signals from their
counterpart in the government to continue the talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the reshuffling plan of the new government for the
peace negotiators would affect the pace of the talks, Jaafar said
he is confident that though it would delay the process a bit, the
plan surely would not bring the negotiations back to square one.
</P>
<P>
So far, the only concrete result achieved in the talks is the
cessation of hostilities between the MILF forces and the Armed
Forces of the Philippines, including the Philippine National
Police.
</P>
<P>
Before the May 11 national elections, the government and MILF
peace panels got entangled with the issue of the identification of
some 43 MILF rebel camps in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait: GCC's Role Important in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has said the cooperation
among Gulf countries has played an important role in the region's
handling of various challenges.
</P>
<P>
In a statement commemorating the 17th anniversary of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), the Kuwaiti cabinet said the
organization has satisfactorily brought the countries together in
meeting challenges.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example, the statement which is available Monday said
the GCC members were united against Iraq's aggression of Kuwait in
1990, contributing to the liberation.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also expressed the confidence that the GCC will
continue to strengthen solidarity among its member states and
peoples.
</P>
<P>
GCC, an economic, political and defense alliance, was founded on
May 25, 1981. It groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
A GCC Secretariat report issued to marking the anniversary
report also highlighted the organization's vital role in
maintaining well-established relations among member states.
</P>
<P>
The council held a distinguished and united position among
Arab, Islamic and international organizations and forums including
the United Nations organization, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Complaint Phone Greatly Helps Shenyang People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Common people in Shenyang,
northeast China's Liaoning Province, can turn to a complaint phone
call for help when they are in difficulties.
</P>
<P>
China's first complaint center, established late January in the
industrial city, has helped solve problems on water, electricity
and gas supply, environmental protection and others for local
residents, according to center's officials.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of operation, the complaint center
dealt with more than 30,000 complaints. A retired government
official had fretted about the housing problem for over 10
years. After he tried to dial 2211, or the special complaint phone
number, his problem was handled properly by relative official
departments.
</P>
<P>
Complaints collected by the center have also helped City Mayor
of Shenyang Mu Suixin know better about conditions of the people
and public feelings. He said that the complaint phone is a good
helper for him to run the city and understand what is going on
among the people.
</P>
<P>
All the complaints have been recorded in particular
computers. Then the center urges official departments to handle
them within a limited period.
</P>
<P>
Many residents said that the city authorities care much more
about their daily life.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shenyang has set up a complaint network, which
connects district and county governments, and official departments
in charge of urban utilities.

CHENGDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Lushan County in southwest China's
Sichuan Province will be built into a demonstration ecological
county for the country's mountainous regions in next several
years, the provincial government said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reports Heavy Loss by Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, where one in four smokes, has
complained of a great loss caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Anti-Smoking Society President Mohammad Shreim told a
seminar Sunday that smoking costs Jordan at least 166 million
Jordanian dinars (about 234 million U.S. dollars) a year in
economic and public health losses.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held to mark the International Anti-Smoking Day.
</P>
<P>
The figure was far more than the sum of revenues collected from
domestic cigarette production and imports, Shreim was quoted by
the semi-official Jordan Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's cigarette imports stand at 90 million dinars (about
127 million dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
Smokers in Jordan, accounting for nearly one-fourth of its 4.5
million inhabitants, spend 134 million dinars (about 190 million
dollars) on cigarettes every year, Shreim said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ali Khan, who represents the World Health Organization
at the seminar, said that Jordan has also found common grounds
with other Middle East countries in the fact that the majority of
its youths have slid into smoking.
</P>
<P>
The fact predicted a worse picture of economic and public
health situation for the kingdom in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has enacted law banning smoking in public places, but
many people ignore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, smuggling of foreign-made cigarettes is rampant in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Air France Pilots Start Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- All the pilots of Air France began an
indefinite strike Monday, 10 days before the start of the
Football World Cup finals to be held in France.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are protesting a plan by the company's management to
 cut their salaries by 15 percent in exchange for the company's
stocks.
</P>
<P>
They are also protesting the non-application of an agreement
signed earlier which abolishes salary disparity between young and
old pilots.
</P>
<P>
The traffic of Air France was almost non-existent Monday
morning, while only one plane flew from the Orly airport in Paris
to Corsica and another from the Charles de Gaulle airport to
Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
Air France cancelled 90 percent of its long-distance flights
from Paris, and 75 percent of medium-distance flights.
</P>
<P>
On the international airlines, it is expected to guarantee one
plane to Africa and three to the United States.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 passengers who have booked Air France plane seats
on their way home from the Pentecost holiday are expected to be
stuck on their way or change to trains and cars.
</P>
<P>
Two other French air companies, the private AOM and Air Liberte
have few extra seats to offer, although they plan to open more
home flights from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The state railway company SNCF also said its train seats are
fully ordered.
</P>
<P>
Air France, which has invested millions of francs to be
designated as the official air transporter for the Football World
Cup finals, said that they will guarantee the transport of the
national football teams even if the strike continues.
</P>
<P>
But the transport of fans and spectators will not be
guaranteed, it said.

<HEADLINE> China's Two Oil Groups To Grow Larger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to enlarge its
two leading oil groups by adding designated number of local
petroleum companies and fueling stations to each of them.
</P>
<P>
The information is learned from a signing ceremony here
recently on China National Petroleum Corporation's (CNPC) control
of all oil companies in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The move is considered as a major reform measure to adjust
industrial structure, streamline petroleum management system and
improve petroleum circulation.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform plan, which has been approved by the
State Council, CNPC and China National Petrochemical Corporation
(SINOPEC) will control all oil and gas fields, oil refineries and
petrochemical enterprises, and fuelling stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
CNPC will focus on exploration and production of oil and gas,
whereas SINOPEC will prioritize the production of petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
In line with the reform plan, the State and Chemical Industry
Bureau under the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) has
been set up.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the two giant oil enterprise groups will
enter the ranks of the world's top 500 companies in terms of sales
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, concerned provinces, municipalities,
autonomous regions, as well as cities enjoying an
independent-budget status are urged to cooperate closely with CNPC
or SINOPEC and finish all handover affairs before June 30.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Holds Talks with His Turkish Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
has voiced that the Chinese government attaches importance to its
relations with Turkey and will join it in pushing forward
bilateral friendship and cooperation on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
In his talks here today with Turkish Deputy Primer Minister
Bulent Ecevit, who arrived here on May 30 as guest of the Chinese
government, Qian said that the two countries should keep exchanges
at various levels and strengthen coordination and cooperation in
regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both China and Turkey are countries with a long
history and they enjoy a traditional friendship, Qian said that
the Chinese side is satisfied with the smooth development of
Sino-Turkish friendly and cooperative relations in various fields
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for Turkish government's
efforts in developing Sino-Turkish relations and for Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz's recent statement to the effect that
developing relations with China is one of the stresses in Turkish
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that the establishment of a long-term and
stable Sino-Turkish friendship and cooperation oriented to the
21st century is not only in the fundamental interests of the two

<HEADLINE> 10 Wounded, 110 Arrested in Lebanon's Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 10 Lebanese were wounded
on Sunday in clashes among the knife or club waving supporters of
rival candidates in the second round of Lebanon's first local
elections in 35 years, the Daily Star newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The scuffles had led to the arrest of 110 people in North
Lebanon governorate. In the first round of polls in the
governorate of Mount Lebanon, the country's central province, 14
people were detained for fist fight.
</P>
<P>
But Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr put the best face on what
he termed a "trouble-free" day by saying the army and security
presence had quickly quashed the incidents.
</P>
<P>
The government has been seeking to maintain a peaceful
electoral atmosphere in order to avoid further violence or
disturbances which Lebanon had suffered during its 1975-1990
sectarian civil war.
</P>
<P>
During the polls, armored personnel carriers mounted with
machine guns were stationed on major intersections and troops
stood outside the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates have begun to criticize the government's
irregularities and interference in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Ex-premier Omar Karame accused Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of
engaging in vote-buying in the contest of Tripoli, the nation's
second largest municipality after the capital of Beirut. He
expected the results to be announced Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's elections started on May 24 and will continue on the
following two Sundays in Beirut, eastern province of Bekaa Valley
and South Lebanon. The Israeli-occupied border strip is not
included in this elections.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the hottest race will take place in
the polls in Beirut where at least a third of the whole population
live.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Agrees to Concessions for Ugandan Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
and the Kenya Revenue Authority have extended concessions to
Ugandan importers using Mombasa, Kenya's commercial hub and a
leading Indian Ocean port in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The changes include the cancellation of 100 percent
verification of Uganda-bound containerized cargo, the East
African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move follows a visit last month to Kenya by Ugandan
Minister Abel Rwendeire to complain about trade barriers which
frustrated Ugandan traders importing goods through Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan customs officials would put seals on Uganda-bound
containers as soon as they arrived at the port, but should there
be any sign of interference with the seal, the containers would
be subject to verification.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan clearing agents welcomed the scrapping of the 100
percent verification, which they blamed for the loss and damage
of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Mboya, the KPA resident representative in Kampala, said
the concessions have been introduced to bring the Ugandan
shippers to the same queue with their Kenyan colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan cargo enjoys an eight-day free period for
documentation, compared to four days for Kenya's imports.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan imports also enjoy four-day free storage, while Kenyan
imports are allowed for two days.
</P>
<P>
The KPA also agreed to allocate a special area for
Uganda-bound containers at the Mombasa container terminal.
</P>
<P>
"Given the congestion at the port, it may not be easy to
provide the required space now. However, it was agreed that the
KPA will undertake to provide that space in between three and six
months," said Mboya.
</P>
<P>
Before Rwendeire's visit, executives of the Uganda Clearing
and Forwarding Agents Association have met with the chief of the
Kenya Revenue Authority.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan importers and clearing gents requested the KPA to
give tariff concessions, provide a special storage area for
Uganda-bound containers and issue motor inspection reports to
Ugandan motor vehicle importers.
</P>
<P>
The agents also complained about pilferage at the port.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mboya said measures have been taken to improve
security at the port, including stricter controls at entry and
exit gates, improved surveillance and sealing of unauthorized
routes.
</P>
<P>
The KPA plans to put an electric fence around the perimeter
wall and to build watch towers at the vehicle section.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Launching of Mir Gyro Thrusters Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The launching of gyro thrusters of
the Russian Mir space station, originally scheduled for Monday
morning, has been put off until the afternoon, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The gyro thrusters, which automatically maintain the station's
pitch and attitude to ensure that the solar panels generate
maximum power, failed after the station's main computer was
replaced with a new one Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The old main computer aboard the Mir crashed on Saturday night,
for the second time this year. The first computer crash occurred
on January 2.
</P>
<P>
As the mission control center in Korolyov near Moscow could not
have the solar panels reoriented toward the sun with the gyro
thrusters, Mir's orientation will be maintained by the engines of
the station itself.
</P>
<P>
Before the orientation returns to normal, the cosmonauts will
have to conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
The latest malfunction has caused alarm on whether the
scheduled docking with the U.S. Discovery shuttle would go as
planned, but flight commander Vladimir Solovyov told the Interfax
news agency that the computer failure would not hinder the U.S.
mission.
</P>
<P>
The situation "is not so complicated" and Mir's solar panels
are generating sufficient energy for the station's operation,
Solovyov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia has notified the U.S. mission control in
Houston, Texas, of Mir's readiness to receive the mission to be
launched from Cape Canaveral Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo Monday
on renewed uncertainty about the domestic and other Asian
economies.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted 349.75 points or
2.23 percent from last Friday's close to finish at 15,321.03.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 24.79 points or 2.03 percent to
1,196.70.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 320 million
shares, unchanged from Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nikko Securities was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Following the release late last week of gloomy Japanese
economic figures for March and April, an 8.0 percent drop in new
vehicle sales in May from a year earlier, which was reported
Monday afternoon, depressed the Tokyo market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Plunges on the Hong Kong and Taibei bourses also weighed on
Tokyo stocks, they said.
</P>
<P>
Shares were sold almost across the board. Of the 1,335 issues
listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered gainers 889 to 222
gained, with 135 remaining unchanged.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A exhibition center of listed
companies has been put into operation in the Pudong New Area of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is located at the Lujiazui Financial and
Trade Zone, is mainly established by the newspaper of Shanghai
Securities, to help the listed companies improve their public
images and have access to business information.
</P>
<P>
China has currently had 800 listed companies. With the rapid

of such a service center may be fairly useful, according to local
experts.
</P>

"We will move some of our major departments into the center, in
a bid to provide better services for the listed companies," said
Wang Yuchun, general manager of the Shanghai Shenying Wanguo

<HEADLINE> Illegal Foreign Falcon Hunters Punished in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The police in northwest China's
Gansu province has punished nearly 1,000 foreigners who
broke Chinese laws to catch China-protected falcons.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial public security department
attributed the large number of foreign illegal hunters to the
rising price for falcons in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Falcons are pets of overseas millionaires, since they can guard
houses and property, search for mines, and deliver messages.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, many Pakistanis, who came to China
in the name of tourists, catched and purchased a great number of
falcons in the Hexi Corridor in Gansu.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese laws, local policemen recently confiscated
their hunting tools and gave them fine penalties. Some involving
in crimes have even been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Train Its Own Seamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will soon
start training its seafarers to conform with international
maritime requirements as the International Safety Management
(ISM) Code deadline of July 1 draws closer.
</P>
<P>
So far only 130 out of Kenya's 5,000-strong seamen have
received training that could enable them to survive the ISM Code
deadline, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major maritime nations around the world have promised tough
measures against any ship that fails to comply with the ISM Code,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Merchant Shipping Superinterdent Captain John Martin
Odhach, was quoted as saying that plans were under way for
seafarers to be issued with acceptance certificates to enable
them to work on foreign ships.
</P>
<P>
The planned course, which he said would be held at the Kenya
Ports Authority-owned Bandari College, will be conducted in line
with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) course
modules.
</P>
<P>
Odhach said arrangements were also being made to have locally
registered vessels audited and issued with relevant certificates.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan seafarers have long expressed concern about the recent
implementation of new training standards set by the IMO through
the revised Standards of Training and Certification and Watch
Keeping.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Seamen's Association of Kenya claimed that some
Kenyan seafarers have lost their jobs on ships under German,
Singporean and British flags as a result of the new convention.
</P>
<P>
"Many more are likely to follow and we urge our government to
come to our aid," the association's Secretary-General John Ayanga
said.
</P>
<P>
The associ was reportedly to be raising 35 million
Shillings (64,000 U.S. Dollars) to train some of its 5,000 plus
members, most of whom are at Bandari College, a local maritime
institute.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan seamen have always complained of poor pay in foreign
ships, earning only 200 Dollars a month compared with their
foreign colleagues who earn between 450 and 600 Dollars, due to
lack of training.
</P>
<P>
The new IMO demands could increase cases of stowaways from the
region as potential seafarers unable to obtain employment on
foreign-registered ships will be tempted to get aboard illegally.

<HEADLINE> Russian Financial Crisis is Over, Says Kiriyenko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko has said that the most dangerous moment of Russia's
financial crisis has gone, the Interfax news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the NTV television on Sunday evening,
Kiriyenko said the anti-crisis program he announced last Friday
was working.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the main cause of the crisis was a sharp fall
in the world market prices for oil and gas, Russia's principal
export items, which led to "the worsening of the financial
position of leading companies -- the main taxpayers."
</P>
<P>
Another cause was the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and
its inevitable reverberations in Russia, which "in light of huge
debts, is very dependent on the world financial system today," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Strikes, social unrest and political conflicts between
executive and legislative bodies in the country all contributed in
the eruption of the financial crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said it is almost useless to toughen tax collection
or even introduce more taxes to raise the budget revenues. The
budget revenues will increase with the production growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has no plan to raise the tax burden of
enterprises in normal operation. However, tough measures will be
introduced for those in debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the government to increase income and cut
spending to overcome the current difficulty, Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
Russian ex-premier and economist Yegro Gaidar, in a separate
interview with the television on Sunday, said because of the
correct moves by the Central Bank and the government the financial
situation has started to improve.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The lesson was very useful and the government program
was aimed at solving the grave structural problem with a better
budget policy."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Charity Fund Helps 50,000 Needy Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Charity Fund has
helped more than needy 50,000 families since it was set up four
year ago, according to sources with the fund.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the fund has raised 166 million yuan
(20 million US dollars) and spent a total of 59 million yuan (7.1
million US dollars) on charity projects for the elderly people,
poor students and families in need.
</P>
<P>
More than eight million yuan (964,000 US dollars) has been
spent on education and training programs, by establishing 13
training bases around the city and 25 kinds of professional
training courses.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 10,000 laid-off factory workers have been
re-trained and half of them have found new jobs. Approximately
3,000 poor students have received grant-in-aid from the charity
fund.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the fund, 80 orphanized children in Shanghai
have found their "temporary homes" with local families, while 31
others have been adopted by foster parents.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Zhongren Apartment for the elderlies which has
just been completed with some 88 million yuan (10.6 million US
dollars) from the fund, along with a nearby recreation center
built one year earlier, will become the largest housing project of
its kind for the senior citizens in the municipality.
</P>
<P>
The fund is expected to train another 10,000 factory lay-off
workers by the end of May next year and assist additional 10,000
needy families before the Spring Festival sets in early next year,
according to a person in charge of the fund.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Can't Afford AIDS Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has imported some anti-AIDS
drugs but they cannot reach average AIDS patients in Uganda
because the drugs are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, which are selling at between 12,000 and 15,000 U.S.
Dollars in the east African country, are beyond the means of
ordinary patients who earn some 100 Dollars a months.
</P>
<P>
The newly-imported drugs, including saquinavir, ritonavir,
indinavir and nelfinavir, can not only slow down the
multiplication of the HIV virus but also reduce its concentration
in the blood, downgrading AIDS from a terminal illness to a
chronic disease, the latest edition of East African weekly
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has adopted a multi-sectoral approach
in its fight against AIDS, putting main energy and money on
information and education to increase people's awareness of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Ministry of Health, 10 percent
of Uganda's population are infected with the virus and some
500,000 patients have died since the first case was reported in
the country in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Uganda AIDS Commission, Omwony Ojwok,
said there are over 30 million people infected with HIV/AIDS
worldwide, 60 percent of whom are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Globally, 10,000 new infections are occurring daily and 90
percent of all new cases during 1997 are in the sub-Sahara
region, he added.

In recent years, the city has successfully relieved over 200

<HEADLINE> Uganda Chooses Power Dam over Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has ended
its hesitation over building a power dam or developing tourism at
the Bujagali Falls in Jinga east of here by choosing the latter.
</P>
<P>
Monday's East African weekly based in Nairobi quoted Fred
Kallisa-Kabagambe, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of
Energy and Minerals, as saying that the government thinks
electricity is a more urgent priority for the country's economy
than a white water rafting project.
</P>
<P>
"It is a question of priority. You cannot have rafting and
remain in darkness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier studies showed that the Bujagali was the best place
for a hydro-electricity dam with minimal impact on the
environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between the United States and Uganda, the
power station to be built will cost 460 million U.S. Dollars and
have a capacity of 290 megawatts of electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's demand for power stands at 230 mw, of which the
Uganda Electricity Board produces 180 mw.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Finance said the Ugandan
economy would have been growing at nine percent instead of the
current seven percent, had it not been for power shortages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a New Zealand-based water rafting company said the
falls is the best place for water rafting, adding that it will
generate up to 25 million Dollars a year, more than 20 percent of
the country's tourism income.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Aggressors' Military Maps on China Made Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 150 military maps drawn by
Japanese before their aggression on China (1937-1945) were
recently made public in this capital city of central China's Hubei
province.
</P>
<P>
Local residents say the maps have offered new evidence for
Japanese long-premeditated aggression war against China.
</P>
<P>
All the counties and cities and most towns in the province are
indicated on the maps, which are drawn to the scale of 1:50,000.
</P>
<P>
For instance, on the map of Qianjiang county, all the villages,
towns, mountains and rivers in the county and its neighboring
counties are carefully drawn.
</P>
<P>
Most of the maps bear the word "military secrets" on
the right top and "Land Survey Department" on the left
bottom.
</P>
<P>
Experts say most of the maps are drawn by Japanese and some
are made by Chinese but collected by Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaiyuan, a historian who last year released some
important documents about Japanese atrocities in China, said: "It
is very obvious that the Japanese army drew the maps for their
aggression on China."
</P>
<P>
The oldest of those maps was drawn in 1929. "So they had
prepared for the war for at least eight years," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The maps were found by a retired official of a bus company on a
flea market in the city.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Reclaim Land from Taklimakan Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have reclaimed 600,000 million
hectares of arid land and opened up 26,000 hectares of farmland in
Taklimakan Desert in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 farmers have resettled in Hotan, southern tip of
China's largest desert.
</P>
<P>
Over 40,000 hectares of diversiform-leaved poplars and 93,000
hectares of Chinese tamarisks in the reclaimed land have formed a
shelterbelt network in the area, which used to suffer from most
serious windstorms in the country.
</P>
<P>
When 35-year-old Abudul Keram resettled in the desert area four
month ago from an oasis, he was not sure if his family could have
a living there.
</P>
<P>
After he saw that his newly planted forage grass and trees
around his courtyard were growing very well, he became confident
of his future. He said he can not only have more farmland, but
also can breed more cattles for his new home.
</P>
<P>
Liu Minting, an expert in the field of desertification control,
said that Hotan Prefecture has become an area that witnesses
China's most tangible achievements in desert reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Hotan has won an award from the United Nations Development
Program for its efforts in desertification control.
</P>
<P>
Liu said experiments have indicated that grain crops can be
grown two years after forage grass, trees and melons are
planted. otherwise grain crops would be buried by floating sands.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that another key factor involved in the desert
reclamation is the installation of water-saving irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
With his help, some farmers in Hotan introduced Israel's drip
irrigation technique in an orchard and the local government has
decided to spread the foreign technique.
</P>
<P>
Half of Xinjiang's land are desert or desertification
land. More than two thirds of the Taklimakan Desert are located
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Exports on Rise in Central China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The value of exports in central
China's Henan Province is expected to rise by 10 percent this year
from some 2.23 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 local exports grew at an average of 13.6 percent in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Besides general and traditional commodities, Henan will add to
its export list completed equipment as well as machinery and
electronics products, which are expected to contribute over 25
percent of local exports by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the export of textiles, light industrial goods and
farm and sideline produce will also be on rise.
</P>
<P>
Henan province now boasts more than 300 enterprises with rights
to manage export trade and will strive to develop 30 exporters
each earning over 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange every
year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, local exports in the first four months of this
year went down slightly from the same period in 1997.

JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to
propose a staged and conditional pullback from up to 15 percent of
the West Bank at a weekly cabinet meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is acting under an unofficial deadline set by United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, which requires
Israel submit its ultimate redeployment plan to Washington by the
end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Illegal Oil Dealers Turn to L. Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Dealers in illegal trade in oil
products in Kenya have turned to Lake Victoria to transport their
goods following a crackdown on them by security authorities.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown was ordered by President Daniel arap Moi in late
February, when he said that traders caught dumping fuel meant for
export should be arrested, the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The racket involves businessmen collecting oil products from
the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC)'s Kisumu depot, ostensibly for
export, which enables them to avoid paying millions of Shillings
in duty, and dumping them on the local market.
</P>
<P>
The traders fabricate tankers, which are then mounted onto
boats to ferry their products.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government loses about 1.4 million Shillings (about
23,000 U.S. Dollars) for every 60,000 liters -- the capacity of
an average tanker -- of oil dumped on the local market.
</P>
<P>
Security officials and Kenya Railways Corporation said they
had received complaints from Uganda and Tanzania, to which the
illicit trade had extended.
</P>
<P>
Nyanza Provincial Commissioner Peter Raburu confirmed last
Tuesday that there would be a crackdown on governmental officials
who issued the traders with documents to facilitate their
business.
</P>
<P>
Raburu ordered an immediate ban on transportation of oil
products by boat across the world's second largest fresh water
lake.
</P>
<P>
Regional Traffic Superintendent of Kenya Railways Festus Araka
said his organization has suspended any transfer of oil products
from trucks onto boats at all beaches on the Kenyan side of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
Oil products will now only be exported in Kenya Railway
tankers and ferried by the four specially designated vessels that
ply the lake.
</P>
<P>
The initial crackdown came immediately after Moi's order which
has resulted in nationwide arrests of traders engaged in the
illegal business and those operating unlicensed fuel stations.

SHIJIAZHUANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The inflow of overseas
investment in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei
Province, has grown at an annual rate of 50 percent since 1993 and
hit 502 million US dollars early this year.
</P>
<P>
The city set up its first overseas-funded enterprise in 1980
and the number of operational overseas-funded businesses reached
533 early this year. Last year, these enterprises generated 180
million US dollars in foreign exchange from exports and earned 654
million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, the overseas investment has been mainly
used to reform the state-owned enterprises and upgrade their
products.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang has trade contracts with over 100 countries and
regions, and the number of transnationals having investment in
the city has exceeded 20.

<P>
BUCHAREST, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Spain claimed the European
Under-21 Soccer Championship on Sunday, edging Greece 1-0 in the
final with a bizarre goal in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
Greece created several scoring opportunities during the whole
match but failed to change the point.
</P>
<P>
Spain snatched the chance when Ivan Perez headed home a bizarre
goal in the 65th, scoring on a stray corner kick by Juan Carlos
Valderon which slipped through the hands of Greek goalkeeper
Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos.
</P>
<P>
Greece missed a chance to equalize in the 81st minute when
Vasileios Lakis found himself alone in front of Arnau but overshot
the goal from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
It's the second championship title for the Spanish, who beat
Italy in the 1986 final on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
In the match for bronze, Steffen Iversen scored twice as Norway
downed the Netherlands 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Norway opened the scoring in the 17th minute on a rebound,
kicked in by Iversen after Dutch goalkeeper Jim van Fessem cleared
Andreas Lund's low shot from six meters.
</P>
<P>
Iversen made it 2-0 in the 74th minute with a superb lob over
Van Fessem from eight meters.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Constructing Flood-Control Command Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province has been stepping up efforts to build a province-wide
modern flood-control command network.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, prospecting and designing of two
separate microwave telecommunications projects at Dahuofang and
Liaobei reservoirs, with a total investment of 15 million yuan,
are carried out.
</P>
<P>
The two projects, which are important parts of the projected
modern flood-control command network this northeastern province
wants to build, will be completed next year.
</P>
<P>
The microwave telecommunications project at Taizi River,
another important part of the future flood-control command network
and costing an investment of 20 million, has been just finished
and has passed appraisal.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province also plans to build a new
microwave telecommunications project in the province's central
area in bid to use modern flood-control command network facilities
to screen the eastern and central areas where Liaoning's floods
are nurtured.
</P>
<P>
Local flood-control command offices of the province's 14 cities
will be connected by computers this year. Computerization at the
provincial flood-control headquarters will be completed within
this year.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has started to upgrade more than 300 local
flood-reporting stations since 1996 and has so far finished half
of the work, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
He added that Liaoning will see a great improvement in the
efficiency of its efforts to combat floods when the modern
flood-control command network is built, coupled with the use of
the public telecommunications network.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Chalk up Double Wins in Prefontaine Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- American world champions Maurice
Greene and Marion Jones produced excellent results to take double
wins each in the Prefontaine Classic Grand Prix athletics meet in
Eugene, Oregon of the United States, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Greene kept his word to beat the men's 100 meters world record
with in a blazing 9.79 seconds -- one of the fastest clockings in
history -- but only upset to see the trailing wind of 2.9 meters
per second was well over the legal limit of 2.0.
</P>
<P>
Greene's training partner, Ato Boldon of Trinidad, was second
in 9.89.
</P>
<P>
Greene went on to do big later, beating world record-holder
Michael Johnson of the United States in the 200 meters with a
clocking of wind-aided 19.88 seconds. This time the wind was
recorded at 2.1 meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won the women's 100 meters at the world
championships in Athens last year and clocked a year's best 10.71
early this month in China, ran a wind-aided 10.78 to win the 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old muti-talent shifted to the long jump following
her sprint win, soaring a mingty 7.31-meter leap, a wind-legal
mark that is the best in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
If not for the wind, Greene said, Donovan Bailey's 100 meters
world record of 9.84 seconds would have fallen.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been broken," Greene said. "It would have been
broken."
</P>
<P>
It matched the third-fastest 100 meters ever under all
conditions, behind Obadele Thompson's 9.69 at altitude and Carl
Lewis's wind-aided 9.78 in 1988 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Andre Cason ran two wind-aided 9.79 clockings during the USA
Track and Field Championships here in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Greene was especially pleased with his victory over Johnson in
the 200.
</P>
<P>
Johnson is "the best 200 runner in the world. It's always great
to run against the best," Greene said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever go anywhere to lose. When I step on the line, I
expect to win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who ran a world-leading 10.71 seconds in China earlier
this year -- second-fastest of all-time behind only Florence
Griffth-Joyner's world record of 10.49 -- said she was pleased
with Sunday's performance.
</P>
<P>
"The time was OK," Jones said. "I'm happy with it.
</P>
<P>
"Considering this is like the start of the summer, it's a good
way to start. The crowd here is awesome. It prepares me for
Europe."
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jones's long jump, the IAAF Grand Prix meet
produced several marks that are the best in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 5,000, Kenyan Luke Kipkosgei outlasted countrymen
Julius Gatahi and Simon Maina, clocking 13:07.83.
</P>
<P>
In the men's mile, Kenya's Daniel Komen attempted to become the
first person to run under 3:50 on American soil. He settled for
the second-fastest mile ever in the United States, 3:50.95, best
in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
In non-Grand Prix events, American world champion Allen Johnson
won the 110-meter hurdles in a world-leading 13.12 seconds, and
Maria Mutola of Mozambique won the women's 800 in 1:58.66, also a
world-leading time.

<HEADLINE> Minor Quakes Still Possible But Not Major Ones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of minor
earthquakes in Beijing still exists, but that of serious ones
measuring above five on the Richter Scale is very little in the
near future, according to a Chinese leading seismologist.
</P>
<P>
Ding Jianhai, director of the Earthquake Warning Center
attached to the State Seismological Bureau (SSB), said, "Although
the earthquake measuring 3.4 on the Richter Scale hitting around
Fengtai District early this morning was slightly bigger than the
two ones last night, it does not mean that bigger, destructive
ones will follow up."
</P>
<P>
"All the three quakes are the normal adjustments of the
Zhangbei earthquake happened in north China early this year."
</P>
<P>
Ding added that quakes measuring from three to five on the
Richter Scale shocking regions within 200 km around Zhangbei in
Hebei Province are all normal adjustments.
</P>
<P>
"No adjustments in the area will be abnormal, and could
probably mean major quakes later," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that minor earthquakes will not threaten Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing was hit by two minor quakes measuring 3.1 on the
Richter Scale at 7:37 and 7:42 Sunday evening, followed by another
one measuring 3.4 on the Richter Scale early this morning. Tremors
were felt in Fengtai, Haidian and Shijingshan districts.
</P>
<P>
These were the first quakes that can be felt happened in the
capital this year. Beijing has been hit by one to three such
quakes every year since 1996. Its Tongxian County in the east
suburb was shocked by a quake measuring 3.1 on the Richter Scale
on December 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau is keeping a close eye on the
crustal movements around Beijing, home to China's most advanced
earthquake monitoring network which can record slight quakes
measuring as low as one on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
"Each slight irregularity will be compared with past records,
and analyzed," said Ding, adding that experts have regular
meetings on earthquake forecasting.
</P>
<P>
"The State Seismological Bureau will issue its forecasts to the
public when quakes measuring above five on the Richter Scale are
possible to take place."
</P>
<P>
Records show that the capital has never been hit by earthquakes
measuring above seven on the Richter Scale.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pak Arms Race Threatens SAARC: Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear arms race between India and
Pakistan would threaten the existence of the seven-nation SAARC
(South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation), a press report
Monday quoted speakers as saying at a seminar here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The economic hardship descending on the two countries would
make way for an integrated economic cooperation in the region for
their very existence, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul
Hasan Chowdhury pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on sub-regional cooperation in South Asia was
organized by the Bangladesh Institute of international and
Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
Following the incidence of nuclear tests, the SAARC had been
posed with a new question, Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative to cooperation," the state minister
said. Bangladesh as a pioneer of the SAARC would pursue "very
productively" to put together all resources and bring about an
attitude of economic escalation in the SAARC region.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear tests are hardly conducive to regional cooperation,"
Professor Abul Kalam of International Relations of Dhaka
University said. The nuclear tests by India, followed by Pakistan,
infused "a fear of cold war in the region".
</P>
<P>
A massive fall in the region's external funding for economic
development would also follow, Kalam predicted.
</P>
<P>
"A far-sighted leadership with vision and perspective can only
translate the dream of the people of the region into economic
cooperation," Kalam stressed.
</P>
<P>
The future of the SAARC had become uncertain in the context of
detonation of nuclear weapons by both India and Pakistan, former
bureaucrat Mujibul Huq pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Asia Oil &AMP; Gas Conference Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Third Asia Oil and Gas
Conference opened here Monday to deliberate the impact of the
Asian economic turmoil and political issues and forge and enhance
relationships.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the two-day conference, Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the economic crisis in East Asia calls
for a fundamental re-think about many of long-held assumptions in
the region and poses a challenge to the region's capacity to cope
with globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is not to deny the region's achievements in the
past decade, especially in the socio-economic field, and there is
no reason to doubt that East Asia can rise again in the future
provided we seize the moment to institute long-delayed reforms
that would rid our economic and political systems of excesses and
abuses."
</P>
<P>
The immediate challenge is in finding the best way to restore
investor confidence in the region, he said, calling for the region
to act as one in resolving the crisis and warning slow recovery in
one country would drag down others and indeed the region.
</P>
<P>
"One lesson that we can draw upon from this crisis is that we
are closely interlinked and interdependent. Thus it is imperative
that we work together in revitalizing regional economies," Anwar
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On Asia's oil and gas industry, Anwar said the industry
benefited tremendously from the region's rapid growth during the
last decade and the future is still promising as Asian energy
demand, despite the crisis, is expected to remain robust.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the World Bank, the Asia-Pacific
region's energy demand is likely to exceed one third of the global
total by the year 2010. Hence, the biggest challenge facing the
energy industry in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the
oil and gas industry, lies in meeting Asia's seemingly insatiable
appetite for energy.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 participants from 28 countries and regions are
attending the conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Sunday launched the old-age allowance program to help the
elderly people and remove poverty from rural areas of the country,
press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of old men and women in the southwestern
town of Tungipara Sunday, Hasina said the government had taken up
such a program so that the neglected rural poor could be benefited
directly.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to remove all sorts of discrimination,
exploitation, poverty from rural areas of the country," she said
before handing over the pass books of the allowance program to the
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the elderly people would receive 100 taka
(about 2.2 U.S. dollars) each per month.
</P>
<P>
The money, even though very little, would help them raise their
status in the family and society, make them feel that they were
still important, she added.
</P>
<P>
On the first day, about 450 old people of Tungipara received
their allowances, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government had enlisted over 400,000 people from
4,479 unions under 461 sub-districts of the country to bring them
under the scheme.

Romania's previous biggest bank note had a denomination of

Bank leaders do not think the issuance will contribute to
high inflation rate, which the Romanian government vowed to rein

</P>
<P>
Though considering it an ambitious target, bank experts agree
the inflation rate this year would be remarkably lower than 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
and Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Ung
Huot left here Monday for Vietnam for a two-day official visit at
the invitation of Vietnamese Premier Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to hold talks with Vietnamese officials on the
issue of Vietnamese immigrants in Cambodia, the common land
border, the overlapping areas of rich maritime resources as well
as bilateral trade, culture and education relations.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot is also expected to review the Vietnam-Thailand
agreement that touches upon Cambodia's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached on August 9, 1997, dividing the
maritime boundary between Vietnam and Thailand in the Gulf of
Thailand, including their new continental shelf boundary as well
as the boundary between their economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Foreign Ministry sent a diplomatic note to Thailand
and Vietnam on February 7, protesting the agreement for violating
its sovereignty. Early last month during his official visit to
Bangkok, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen also expressed his
objection to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Survive in Game 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan scored 28 points
and Toni Kukoc added 14 of his 21 in the third period as the
Chicago Bulls held off the Indiana Pacers 88-83 in the decisive
game of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who lost three of their previous four games in the
series and were forced to the brink of elimination, kept cool and
sharp in the final minutes, beating the Pacers 4-3 and earned a
rematch with the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. Game 1 is on
Wednesday in Salt City.
</P>
<P>
"We came out a little tense, a little nervous, but came back in
the ballgame and we knew we were in a fight," Jordan said. "A lot
of people say we sit back and wait for me but today everybody had
to step forward and do it."
</P>
<P>
The battle was a cliff-hanger and it all came down to the final
five minutes. Jordan and the team displayed intensity and control,
scoring nine of the game's final 13 points.
</P>
<P>
The game was tied 79-all going into the final five minutes, and
that is when the Bulls showed their rich experience. Scottie
Pippen, who scored 17 points, made a jumper after grabbing one of
Chicago's 22 ofensive rebounds, and Jordan drew a double-team and
fed Luc Longley for a corner throw.
</P>
<P>
Jordan suffered a poor shooting accuracy in the first period,
scoring only two points, but finished the first half with 15, and
the Bulls led the half time 48-45.
</P>
<P>
Besides 28 points, Jordan also grabbed nine rebounds, eight
assits and two steals. Kukoc contributed 13 of 21 points in the
third quarter, followed by Pippen's 17 points, 12 rebounds, three
assistes and two steals.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller led Indiana with 22 points, shot in all his first
three-pointer balls, but failed to do anything in the fourth
quarter as Jordan guarded him tightly.
</P>
<P>
Chicago dominated the rebounding by grabbing 50 to Indiana's
34. The pacers looked sharp at the start, building up a 20-7 lead
en route to a 27-19 advantage after one period.
</P>
<P>
Jordan surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career playoff scoring
record of 5,762 points in the second quarter. When the Indiana
missed eight of its first 10 shots in the quarter to fall behind
40-33, the Pacers fate was doomed.
</P>
<P>
Facing Utah next Wednesday, Jordan said: "Utah is back there
waiting for us and they have the homecourt and it'll be even
tougher. A day off will gives us a chance to clear our minds and
focus."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The 12th Asia-Pacific
Roundtable opened here Monday with a call for finding ways and
means to remove deep-seated suspicions and hostility between
states.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day Roundtable themed "Confidence Building
And Conflict Reduction", Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said, "Few moments are more challenging than the present"
for talking about confidence building and conflict reduction and
calling for finding ways and means to remove deep-seated
suspicions and hostility between states.
</P>
<P>
"We believe only civil society can provide a framework for the
removal of suspicion and distrust and heal the wounds of history.
Thus, the promotion of civil society must be the prime concern of
diplomacy in Asia," he said in his keynote address.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also Malaysia's finance minister, said a healthy
state-civil society relationship will contribute to the reduction
of differences in political practices, strengthen the marketplace
and promote freedom, and a culture of democracy, founded on
"universal principles of liberty", is the sine qua non for peace
in this world.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian economic crisis came about because of an
incompatibility between the Asian national systems and the
international system.
</P>
<P>
More than 230 people from 20 countries in the Asia-Pacific
region and international institutions are attending the
Roundtable.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Plywood Exports to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign exchange
earnings from plywood exports is expected to decline 25 percent
this year, caused by sluggish demand and a reduction in
production, According to The Jakarta Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the Association of Indonesian Wood Panel
Producers (Apkindo) expected that the country's foreign exchange
earnings from plywood exports is about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars
this year, compared with 3.58 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Apkindo chairman Abbas Adhar said that many Indonesian plywood
producers cut their production this year following sluggish demand
and an increase in production costs.
</P>
<P>
"If the market remains unfavorable throughout the year, plywood
exports are expected to stand at about 2 billion U.S. dollars, a
record low since 1990," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the world's biggest plywood producer, turning out
10 million cubic meters of plywood annually. Last year, Indonesia
exported 7.58 million cubic meters of plywood and set the target
to export 8 million cubic meters this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the declining volume of Indonesian plywood in the past
few months, Abbas said, some plywood importing countries had
started buying plywood from Malaysia, the world's second biggest
plywood producer.
</P>
<P>
But Abbas is optimistic that Malaysia will not replace
Indonesia's position due to its higher prices. "Malaysian plywood
is more expensive because the price of their logs is higher than
ours," Abbas added.

YINCHUAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Xihaigu in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, one of China's impoverished
areas, have notably improved their life with the help of a
free aid project by the World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The WFP project, coded 4071, was started in 1994 in 13
townships in three counties, is aimed at improving local natural
conditions and help farmers escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
By now, WFP has provided 51,049 tons of grain, with local
governments injecting 30 million yuan of investment as well as
labor services.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 9,236 hectares of hillsides have been transformed
into terraced fields, 8 reservoirs reinforced, and 2,274 hectares
of irrigated land added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, per-capita farmland has been raised from 0.04 ha to
0.1 ha, with annual grain output and farmers' per-capita net
income growing by 50 percent and 78 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some environment-friendly projects have also been built,
and accordingly, a 484-square-kilometer area has been improved to
reduce 1.41 million tons of eroded soil annually.
</P>
<P>
The project has also boosted construction of local
infrastructure and applications of practical farming
techniques. More than 60,000 farmers have been trained to use such
techniques.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate to Take Off Because of Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's housing industry is
expected to generate more than 0.5 percents to gross
domestic product (GDP) this year and beyond, according to a senior
State economist.
</P>
<P>
Hu Shaowei, the economist with the State Information Center,
said pending housing reform will increase housing's role in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The boost in housing investment since the beginning of this
year and the possible increase in housing consumption after July 1,
when China abolishes the welfare housing distribution system, will
be two major forces to achieve the 0.5 percent in GDP growth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China invested 52.1 billion yuan (6.3 billion U.S. dollars) in
its real estate sector in the first four months this year, up 12.7
percent from the same period in 1997. The investment in April
alone rose 19.1 percent from last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with more than 50 million square meters of
apartments standing empty nationwide -- the fruit of billions of
dollars in bank loans -- there is ample supply available after the
planned housing reform.
</P>
<P>
The reform could unleash vast demand for residential housing,
which was suppressed by the welfare housing system and
insufficient development of the commercial residential housing
market, said Gu Yunchang, vice-director of the policy and research
center of the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
China's housing reform will have three major tasks --
abolition of welfare housing distribution, building the secondary
market and improvement of the residential housing construction
industry.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Conditional Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Sunday that the U.S. will endorse additional international aid
for Russia to stablize its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Clinton expressed U.S. support for aid to
Russia from such multinational institutions as the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The United States endorses additional, conditional financial
support from the international financial institutions, as
necessary, to promote stability, structural reforms and growth in
Russia," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said he based his decision on his conversations with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and consultations among other U.S. and
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated his backing for a new economic program
Russia announced Friday, which includes the ruble supports.
</P>
<P>
The program will "strengthen the fundamentals of the Russian
economy and foster maintenance of a stable ruble," stressed
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A senior administration official insisted the statement does
not foreshadow a bailout for Russia such as those arranged through
the international lenders for more troubled countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The focus was on providing support from international firms and
on Russia's efforts to raise resources from the private sector,
said the senior official who briefed reporters here on Sunday on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say when the IMF would provide the aid
to Russia or how much there would be.
</P>
<P>
"We are in active dialogue," he said. "It's too early to know
amounts or precise methods, which will depend very much on how the
situation evolves."
</P>
<P>
Russia has not requested financial help, and direct bilateral
assistance from the United States is not anticipated, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Russia's government announced a new reform program,
which includes a crackdown on tax dodgers and a stepped-up effort
to collect taxes, so as to ensure enough cash to pay workers and
fund social programs.

<HEADLINE> Property Projects put on Hold in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic and political
uncertainty has put more commercial property projects on hold in
the second quarter of this year, according to a study published
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest study, issued by property consultants First Pacific
Davies Indonesia (FPDI), showed that many projects stopped as
economic and political uncertainty mounted.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of projects have been suspended for an indefinite
period, while others have slowed down and have revised completion
dates," the study said.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector has been worst hit, with almost all new
retail projects put on hold until 2001, according to the study.
Some 93 percent of the nearly 475,000 square meters of retail
developments previously planned have now been suspended.
</P>
<P>
In the office sector, over one million square meters or 66
percent of the confirmed developments have been put on hold.
Delayed projects are expected to increase to 84 percent of the
confirmed developments by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the hotel sector, most of the hotel projects put on hold are
four-star hotels. Construction of 72 percent of the three-star
hotel developments is going on, the study said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Allows Philippines to Post Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government may be
allowed to post a budget deficit this year instead of a surplus,
as long as it is able to post a current account surplus.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had indicated that it may
be willing to accept a budget deficit "for as long as the
Philippines posts a current account surplus", the Philippine Star
Monday quoted Assistant Finance Secretary Gil Beltran as saying.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission which conducted a review of the country's first
quarter economic performance over the weekend found the country's
monetary performance satisfactory, but the fiscal sector below
par.
</P>
<P>
The national government had projected a 5 billion pesos (128
million U.S. dollars) budget surplus this year, but first quarter
cash budget performance was quite poor, registering an 11.7
billion pesos (300 million dollars) deficit instead.
</P>
<P>
The government's main revenue generating agencies have failed
to reach their revenue targets partially because of the regional
currency crisis which resulted in lower income tax payments by big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
Despite these setbacks, Beltran remains optimistic that the
government can still post a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
The basis for optimism, according to Beltran, is the
improvement in the country's macroeconomic indicators which would
allow the government to realize some savings.
</P>
<P>
Beltran cited the downward trend in Treasury bill rates and the
stability of the Philippine peso in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Market Recovered from Stagnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate market had
recovered from a year of stagnation by the end of April, suggested
the China Real Estate Comprehensive Index.
</P>
<P>
The Index climbed up to 100.81 points in April, up 1.76 from
March or up 2.59 points from April, 1997, according to a report
from the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months, the real estate investment totaled
52.1 billion yuan (6.3 billion US dollars), a year-on-year
increase of 12.7 percent. This growth rate was higher than that of
infrastructure and renovation, and higher than March's growth rate.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the country started housing construction of
34.78 million square meters, up 44.0 percent from the same period
of 1997, and 11 percent from that in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sales price rose continually in the past several
months as a result of surging demand. The average sales price for
commercial housing was 2,091 yuan per square meter in February,
2,124 yuan in March and 2,258 yuan in April.
</P>
<P>
Though the acreage for land development continued to drop as a
result of the country's restriction on non-farming use of land,
the decrease rate slowed.
</P>
<P>
The index is expected to pick up further in the first half of
this year, the report said.

families nationwide and has helped reduce the number of
poverty-stricken households.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Urged to Restore Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais
called on the new government to take steps to overcome the
economic crisis, according to press reports here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture in
Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of the capital, Sunday, Rais also
called for public support to the new government.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair to blame everything on the new government as many
of the difficulties are a legacy of the previous government, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The new government led by President B.J. Habibie was
established on May 22 after Soeharto resigned.
</P>
<P>
"What would be fair, in order to set the economic wheels moving
again in the shortest possible time, is giving an opportunity and
support for economic-restoration programs," Rais said.
</P>
<P>
This stance, he said, does not mean the campaign for better
order in the political, legal and constitutional system should
stop.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the country's second largest Moslem organization
reiterated that a general election should be held soon.
</P>
<P>
"State policies, including in the economy, are, after all, the
final results of an interaction of various interest groups,
political forces, the business circle as well as the bureaucracy,
which all operate in a certain legal-constitutional order," Rais
said.

<HEADLINE> Aussies Retain Field Hockey World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Holders Australia came from one
goal down to beat hosts the Netherlands to retain the World Cup
trophy at this year's tournament for women in Utrecht on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Australia beat the Netherlands 3-2 while Germany downed
Argentina with a similar scoresheet to finish third at the 12-team
tourney.
</P>
<P>
In the previous cup tourney four years ago, Australia blanked
Argentina 2-0 to win the cup.
</P>
<P>
Ellen Dubbeldam-Kuipers grabbed an opening-minute chance to put
the hosts on the scoreboard and the Dutch held on to the early
lead with a partisan chanting by home fans.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champions, however, proved their form and flair in
the sport by more than offseting the deficit as Alyson Annan and
Julie Towers netted two goals within two minutes in the 22nd and
24th to turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
Juliet Haslam, a 29-year-old 2000 Olympic coordinator, put the
game further away from the hosts with a 56th-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
A 62nd-minute goal scored off a penalty corner by defender
Julie Deiters re-kindled the hope of the Dutch side to steal the
coveted trophy from the Aussies.
</P>
<P>
But the Australians held on to their lead until the final buzz.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands won the women's World Cup five times and
finished runners-up twice.
</P>
<P>
In the day's placing games, Olympic silver medalists South
Korea defeated New Zealand 4-3 to finish fifth behind Argentina
while South Africa outshot the United States 4-2 on the penalty
spot after their scoreless regular play. The World Cup debutants
from Africa were placed seventh.
</P>
<P>
Ninth through 12th places went to England, Scotland, China and
India that played their playoffs a day earlier on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Edge China 72-70 in Basketball Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BREMEN, Germany, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania, helped by guard
Loreta Berukstlene's 18 points, held off Chinese counterparts'
strong rally to win their first second-run game 72-70 on Sunday at
the women's world championship for basketball.
</P>
<P>
China, led by center Zheng Haixia with 24 points and 11
rebounds, had a chance to equal or win the game at last several
seconds as Jiang Xue, who scored a 3-pointer with 30 second left
to make it 70-72, missed her another 3-pointer attempt, sending
Lithuania to take two team standing points from the game.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians, whose best center was injured before the
championship and who had lost three games to the United States,
Japan and Russia, played a tough game throughout and led the first
half 38-32.
</P>
<P>
China opened the second half with 14-0 run within 3:30. The
Chinese scored four 3-pointers in the span, with forward Yangli
and guard Zheng Dongmei each hitting two.
</P>
<P>
However, the European champions levelled the score 52-52 on
Berukstlene's basket with 11:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
Exchanging lead several time, Lithuania seemed to win the game
when it took over 72-67 with four minutes to play. But Jiang Xue's
3-pointer made Lithuania in danger.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with our performance especially at the
beginning of the second half," said Ma Yuenan, Chinese head
coach. "Our team are young and need experience. Now we will
prepare for the game against Japan and we will go all out for a
win."
</P>
<P>
China, only 1-4 holders in group E, play Japan Monday while
Lithuania meets Spain.

<HEADLINE> German, Iranian Foreign Ministers to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
and his Iranian counterpart Kamal Charrasi have agreed to meet on
June 10 in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. Special General
Assembly in a bid to mend bilateral relations, the German Foreign
Ministry announced Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The June 10 talks had been agreed upon by the two foreign
ministers during a telephone conservation on Sunday, the foreign
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Iran entered into a diplomatic dispute in April
last year after a German court ruled that Iranian leaders had
ordered the killings of four Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin
restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ruling prompted European Union countries to withdraw their
ambassadors to Teheran and suspend the so-call critical dialogue
with the country.
</P>
<P>
After a seven-month standoff, the two sides agreed to put an
end to the crisis and all EU ambassadors had returned to Teheran
by November last year.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone talks on Sunday, Kinkel and Charrasi
agreed to make efforts to further improve relations. They also
expressed satisfaction at the results of a recent high-level
contact between German and Iranian officials in Teheran, the
German foreign ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leaders Reject Royal Party Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and
Martin McGuinness turned down an invitation on Sunday to a Belfast
garden party at which Prince Charles will be guest of honor,
according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that members of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of Irish Republican Army, have been invited to the
Hillsborough Castle garden party, the main social event of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein said its leaders would not go because of the Prince's
links to the British Parachute Regime which was responsible for
Derry's Bloody Sunday killing of a dozen Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam earlier in the day
defended her decision to invite Sinn Fein leaders to a Northern
Ireland garden party, arguing that the invitation had been part of
the peace process in the province because Sinn Fein had signed up
to the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The decision to invite the meeting between Adams and Charles,
however, sparked outrage from opposition politicians in Britain
and from Protestant Unionists who said Mowlam was being
insensitive.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble said: "I think the
secretary of state will be relieved at their absence, particularly
after the republican-orchestrated violence in Portadown."
</P>
<P>
He added that the only time Sinn Fein leaders could be invited
would be when they ceased to be terrorist leaders and became
democratic ones.
