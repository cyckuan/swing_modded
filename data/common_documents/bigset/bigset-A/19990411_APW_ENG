<HEADLINE> Mets' Piazza on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Mike Piazza wasn't happy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to go on the disabled list,'' the All-Star  
catcher said today after the New York Mets put him on the 15-day 
disabled list because of a sprained right knee. ``I felt like I 
could play in a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, injured during a rundown Friday night, was sent to New  
York the following day, and an MRI revealed a sprained ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets team physician Dr. David Altcheck examined Piazza on Sunday  
and confirmed the medial collateral ligament in Piazza's right knee 
had been sprained, though he found no damage to the posterior 
cruciate ligament, as first had been thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor made it clear that if I do play, and I run the  
bases and suddenly have to change directions it could be a full 
tear and that would mean surgery,'' Piazza said from New York 
during a telephone conference call. ``Considering that possibility, 
I figure that this is for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have won both games that Piazza has missed and will  
have to make due without him for 2-3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets outfielder Bobby Bonilla acknowledged that Piazza's absence  
from the New York lineup will be hard on the team's fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might be a little disappointed with Mike not being there  
tomorrow,'' Bonilla said, looking ahead to Monday's home opener. 
``You know, you'll have a lot of kids wanting to see him play, but 
it's a pretty good baseball team. We shouldn't really miss a beat, 
which will be nice for Mike. He can feel comfortable to make sure 
he gets back on time and make sure he does it right. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, acquired last year from the Florida Marlins after he  
left the Los Angeles Dodgers, is starting a $91 million, seven-year 
contract. He is hitting .429 (9-for-21) with two homers and a 
team-leading eight RBIs.

	More US Jets Headed for Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has announced that 82 U.S. planes  
will join NATO forces now conducting airstrikes over Yugoslavia. 
Allies were expected to add dozens more aircraft within days. ``The 
addition of these aircraft will allow us to ... expand the number 
of strikes over any 24-hour-day period,'' Pentagon spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon said. But it could take a month for 24 Apache attack 
helicopters to be ready for use from a base in Albania. Their 
introduction would mark an escalation of the war and for the first 
time allow close-to-the-ground, direct strikes against Serb troops 
and tanks during persistent bad weather.

	Mother of Captured GI Breaks Down  
</P>
<P>
	MONTEBELLO, Calif. (AP) -- The mother of one of the American  
soldiers captured on the Yugoslav border broke down at a ceremony 
attended by hundreds yesterday. ``He went on a mission of peace. 
This was not supposed to happen,'' Vivian Ramirez said of her son, 
Army Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez. Ramirez, 24, Staff Sgt. Christopher 
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 22, 
of Huntsville, Texas, were captured March 31 while patrolling the 
Yugoslav-Macedonia border. Shouts of encouragement for Mrs. Ramirez 
came from the audience of about 300 people gathered before the 
veterans memorial at Montebello Park.

	FAA Tests Computers for Y2K Trouble  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has passed a  
live test of its new fixes to correct the year 2000 computer bug. 
The test involved the forwarding of computer clocks at Denver 
International Airport to the hour of midnight Dec. 31, 1999. An air 
traffic controller and the pilot of an approaching F-A-A plane then 
held a conversation that safely bridged the gap of the new century. 
Officials say the computers were able to read the new year 
successfully. The year 2000 glitch stems from computers not being 
able to read the date properly, a problem some officials believe 
could disrupt air traffic.

	India Tests Nuclear-Capable Missile  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Defying appeals from the United States  
to put its nuclear program on hold, India has tested an upgraded 
version of its intermediate-range missile. Information Minister 
Pramod Mahajan told a hastily summoned news conference that the 
Agni II ballistic missile was successfully launched at 10 a.m. 
local time (12:30 a.m. EDT). Indian news agencies quoted government 
officials as saying Pakistan was given advanced warning. The test 
comes after India conducted a series of underground nuclear 
explosions last year that prompted Pakistan to respond with tests 
of its own, raising international fears of a nuclear arms race 
between the two belligerent nations.

	Gore Says Draft Won't Be Reinstated  
</P>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told a Boy Scout  
yesterday there were no plans to reinstate the draft, despite the 
NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. The draft question by 
14-year-old Joe Wiesneski, was the most pointed about the conflict 
in Kosovo posed to Gore at a campaign fund-raiser. ``There is very 
little support for moving away from the volunteer Army,'' Gore 
said. President Clinton has repeatedly said he had no plan to send 
ground troops to fight in Kosovo.

	Welfare Rolls Fall Again  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President yesterday used the latest report of  
shrinking welfare rolls -- cut nearly in half since 1993 -- to prod 
Congress for child care, housing and transportation programs that 
he said will move even more welfare recipients into jobs. He also 
announced final regulations that give states greater leeway in 
using federal welfare grants to set up such programs themselves. 
Nationally, just over 7.6 million Americans were receiving public 
assistance at the end of December, down from almost 8 million at 
the end of September and 14.3 million in 1994. 

</P>
<P>
	Home of Suspected Chinese Spy Raided  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents searched the New Mexico home of  
a suspected spy who was fired from his job at a Los Alamos nuclear 
laboratory last month. The raid yesterday at the single-story brick 
and wooden home of Wen Ho Lee pierced the tranquillity of the 
suburban neighborhood where the Taiwan-born American scientist 
lives. ``There was a lot of commotion going on. People were driving 
by, neighbors were outside and agents were coming and going,'' said 
a neighbor who also works at the Los Alamos laboratory.

	Two Groups To Submit Bids for A's  
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Two investment groups will make bids to  
buy the Oakland Athletics this week, a team representative said. 
The groups will submit separate bids on a one-time offer to buy the 
franchise for $120 million, according to a representative of the 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority in the potential sale. 
Local government officials are worried that the A's may move, 
possibly to San Jose.

<HEADLINE> Masters Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- It was a Masters double for Spain with Jose  
Maria Olazabal winning the title and countryman Sergio Garcia 
taking the low-amateur medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, the British amateur champion, became the first European  
to gain the honor Sunday by shooting a 1-over-par 73 in a round 
that included four birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it makes Spain proud,'' said Garcia who finished with a  
7-over-par total of 295. ``It's something I wanted to do. And I 
played a good round in the most difficult of our four days here. 
It's exciting to know I'm the first from Europe to win low-amateur 
at the Masters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia beat out a contingent that included Georgia Tech junior  
Matt Kuchar, who finished in the top 25 at Augusta last year; Tom 
McKnight, the finalist in the U.S. Amateur; and U.S. Public Links 
champion Trevor Immelman of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot in my first Masters,'' Garcia said. ``I  
learned you have to have a lot of patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight, a petroleum distributor from Virginia, was two shots  
back of Garcia after a 77. McKnight knocked Garcia out of the U.S. 
Amateur. Hank Kuehne, who beat McKnight for the U.S. Amateur title, 
didn't make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar shot a final round 78 to finish 11-over. Immelman shot 79  
for a plus-17 total. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia wouldn't say when he plans to turn professional.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait until I get back to Spain and talk it over  
with my family,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manny Zerman of South Africa was the first foreigner to win  
low-amateur and that was in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The amateur must play all four rounds to win the medal.  
England's Trevor Homer was low after two rounds in 1974 but missed 
the cut. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *60s TOO TOUGH ALL FOUR DAYS:* There's a Masters record even  
Tiger Woods hasn't broken, and it's still safe. 
</P>
<P>
	No player has ever shot in the 60s all four rounds. Woods came  
close when he won the tournament with a record 18-under-par in 
1997. He shot in the 60s the last three rounds, but a first-round 
70 when he went out in 40 and came back in 30 kept him from the 
exclusive all-60s club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greens here are too elusive for anyone to shoot in the 60s  
in all four rounds,'' said two-time champion Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NORMAN'S BALL FOUND AND HEADED FOR CHARITY AUCTION:* The ball  
that Greg Norman lost at the 12th hole on Saturday was found by CBS 
commentator Bobby Clampett and is headed for charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball, a Maxfli XS with the number 0 and the word ``SHARK''  
on it, was found deep in the Asiatic jasmine behind the 155-yard, 
par-3 hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was embedded pretty deep,'' said Clampett, who had the  
tower assignment on No. 12. He got permission to look for the ball 
at the end of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman had to go back to the tee. His third shot found the green  
and he sank a long putt for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *11TH HOLE TAKES ITS TOLL:* The 11th hole is the start of Amen  
Corner and it was the one that terrorized players the most in the 
final round of the Masters. The par-4 played to a 4.6 stroke 
average, highest at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Hogan once said of the hole: ``If you ever see me on the  
green in two, you know I pulled my second shot. The play is to the 
right, where it's safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman made a long birdie putt there and Jose Maria  
Olazabal got through the hole with a par. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval's hopes died when he made double-bogey there by  
hitting a ball into the water. England's Lee Westwood also made a 6 
on the 455-yard, par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Contenders Bob Estes and Steve Pate each bogeyed.  
</P>
<P>
	Masters officials raised the green two-feet so they could bring  
in a tough pin position near the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Most players tried to play safe to the right, but it left them a  
tough chip looking directly at the water. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFENDING CHAMPION O'MEARA FALLS SHORT:* Defending champion  
Mark O'Meara said it would take a miracle for him to 
come-from-behind to win a second green jacket. He got a 6-over-par 
78 instead. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara's rounds of 70-76-69-78 left him 5-over 293 for the  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the way I defended my championship,'' O'Meara  
said. ``My putter was off this week. But I hung in there good until 
today. I tried to give it a great defense but I just didn't play 
that well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FRANCO GETS ANOTHER INVITE:* Top 16 finishers are invited back  
to the Masters next year and that includes Carlos Franco of 
Paraguay, who is playing his first year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 16 finishing list with Masters champions excluded are  
Franco, Greg Norman, Steve Pate, Davis Love III, Bob Estes, David 
Duval, Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood, Nick Price, Jim Furyk, Colin 
Montgomerie, Brandel Chamblee, Bill Glasson, Scott McCarron, Brandt 
Jobe, Lee Janzen and Justin Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ties are included in the calculations.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TIGER NOT ON THE PROWL:* Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, was  
never a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished with a 75 for a 289 total, one-over.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hit a lot of great shots and a lot of ugly ones,'' Woods  
said. ``I just didn't make the putts or give myself a lot of 
opportunities.''

<HEADLINE> Would-Be NYC Burglar Hangs Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who broke into a clothing store through  
the roof caught his sweater on a piece of metal and accidentally 
hanged himself, police said Sunday. His body was found by the 
store's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrence Adams, 55, apparently tried to enter the store to  
burglarize it when he became entangled, ``causing him to hang 
himself,'' said Officer Lee Tracy-Ader, a police spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no other details, but news reports said the owner of  
the Dum Dum Boutique discovered the body when he arrived Saturday 
morning to open the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams apparently had lowered himself to a rear window but became  
trapped as he tried to slip between metal bars, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post said Adams had a record of arrests for  
burglary. It quoted his wife, Ann Marie, as saying he was a Vietnam 
veteran who still carried a bullet in his back.

<HEADLINE> Failure of WTO Talks Deprives China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- By failing to agree with Washington on  
joining the World Trade Organization, China avoided the pain of 
exposing its industries to foreign competition but missed a chance 
to expand exports and modernize. 
</P>
<P>
	State banks and companies remain shielded behind walls of  
tariffs and import bans, along with farms that employ hundreds of 
millions of Chinese but are inefficient and not competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of talks in Washington deprived visiting Premier Zhu  
Rongji of a potent weapon to push forward his sweeping free-market 
reforms that have cost millions of jobs in an attempt to turn 
around money-losing state industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joining the WTO would have forced China to reform at a faster  
pace. Zhu Rongji still can do it, but China will move at its own 
pace and reform bit by bit,'' said Li Kui Wai, an economist at the 
City University of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Other losers included Chinese telecommunications and high-tech  
companies that would have gotten better access to investment and 
foreign technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the WTO, which regulates world trade, would give  
China a say in global trade rules and protect it from unilateral 
trade sanctions. For textiles, steel and some other goods, that 
would mean an end to U.S. import quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although China agreed to drop bans on U.S. wheat and citrus even  
without membership, farmers were spared for now from competing with 
other, cheaper agricultural imports. A reform advocate said that 
while the latest concessions will hurt some farmers, China will 
benefit from the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the price China must pay. In the long term, this will  
help to promote agricultural modernization,'' said Chi Fulin, 
director of a government think tank, the China Institute for Reform 
and Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Most countries already give China the low tariffs and other  
trade privileges it would get in the WTO. But Chi said membership 
still could help Beijing secure those stable trade terms and force 
Chinese companies to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joining the WTO will do more good than bad, although China  
will face more competition and risks,'' he said by telephone from 
his office in the southern city of Haikou. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 years of on-again, off-again talks, China appeared  
increasingly intent in recent months on membership and showed new 
willingness to offer concessions. Beijing licensed more foreign 
banks and insurance companies and agreed that even without WTO 
membership, it would allow more foreign airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
	But some officials and academics argued China was giving up too  
much. They feared that too big a foreign presence could destroy 
companies, leading to layoffs and social upheaval that might 
threaten communist power. 
</P>
<P>
	Radical market-opening moves could widen growing gaps in wealth  
and income. Cheaper imports would deliver lower prices for 
consumers but undercut farm towns and areas dominated by state 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Danger spots include state banks, which have only just begun  
reforms meant to free them of an avalanche of bad loans to failing 
state firms and make them profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators have resisted giving foreigners more than a tiny  
slice of the financial industry, for fear diverting savings from 
state banks could cause a financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is really reluctant to open its financial markets,  
because they don't want to lose control,'' said Li. 
</P>
<P>
	Other weaknesses are service industries ranging from travel  
agencies to insurance, where Chinese companies lag in technology 
and skills. 
</P>
<P>
	China had said it would need grace periods of up to 20 years to  
phase out protections for agricultural and service industries. 
</P>
<P>
	China already has tried to inject competition into the market on  
its own. While Zhu was in Washington, Beijing announced it was 
breaking up state-owned China Telecom, the phone monopoly, into 
four companies to spur innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet without the reassuring framework of WTO rules, it will get  
harder to attract investors already skittish because of the Asian 
financial crisis, said Li, the Hong Kong researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	That could wind up knocking up to 1 percent off economic growth  
over the next two to three years, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign investment is not free these days. So in a sense,  
China suffers for that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returning From Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is returning from its spring break,  
with Republicans planning a publicity offensive for their 
tax-cutting goals but facing the likelihood that the war with 
Yugoslavia will overwhelm their message. 
</P>
<P>
	With April 15 -- the day income tax returns are due -- falling on  
Thursday, Republicans are ready to appeal to voters by a focusing 
on their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers, due back at the Capitol today, should approve a  
fiscal 2000 budget blueprint this week allowing $800 billion in tax 
cuts over the next decade. And there will be other votes and events 
aimed at rallying disgruntled taxpayers to the GOP cause. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Republicans acknowledge that with NATO's conflict with  
Yugoslavia in its third week, it will be tough to attract the 
attention they would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier to ride a wave then to make a wave, and this  
is a particularly hard wave to ignore,'' said Tony Blankley, a 
political commentator who was press secretary to former House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers themselves also will be concerning themselves with the  
fighting in the Balkans and the flood of refugees it has spawned. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders planned to meet with President Clinton  
tonight to discuss the crisis, and a larger group of legislators 
will get another White House briefing Tuesday. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen plans to testify to House and Senate committees on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Congress began its two-week recess a day after the  
bombing started, there are certain to be speeches galore on the 
subject. Quick votes seem unlikely, but Rep. Tom Campbell, 
R-Calif., planned to introduce resolutions today aimed at forcing a 
House vote on whether U.S. military action should continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the first to say it was a  
mistake to rule out ground troops, said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press'' that he would seek a Senate resolution authorizing the 
president to use whatever means necessary to complete the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic to know we are  
not going to stop the air war if that doesn't work,'' Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Kosovo distraction, Blankley and other Republicans  
say the GOP would be wise to press ahead with its tax agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the No. 4 House GOP leader, said  
despite the country's concern with the crisis and U.S. troops, 
``America also wants us to try and do the business of the country 
in a professional manner. Part of that is doing what the American 
people want us to do, and part of that is cutting taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along those lines, Republican leaders hope to resolve relatively  
minor differences in separate budgets the House and Senate have 
approved so Congress can pass a compromise by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Their biggest remaining disputes include whether to use Social  
Security's massive surpluses to also shore up Medicare, and how to 
use any additional surpluses expected to be projected this summer. 
Clinton's signature is not needed for the congressional budget, 
which sets levels for future tax and spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday -- tax deadline day -- the House plans to debate a  
longtime conservative favorite: a constitutional amendment that 
would require three-fifths majorities in the House and Senate for 
approval of tax increases. It is sure to fall short of the 
two-thirds majority that constitutional amendments need but will 
help Republicans call notice to their anti-tax agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats also hope to win publicity for one of their  
causes, but they face the same obstacle as Republicans from the 
higher-profile fighting in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Democrats plan to begin circulating a petition  
demanding a vote on legislation revamping campaign finance laws by 
limiting expenditures. It will take the signatures of 218 
representatives -- a bare House majority -- to force the vote, and 
with just 211 Democrats some GOP support will be needed to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	In other congressional action planned this week:  
</P>
<P>
	--Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose investigation of  
Clinton led to his impeachment, will testify Wednesday before the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which is considering whether 
to renew the independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House will debate a bill that would let local officials  
challenge census counts before they become final. Democrats say the 
measure could cause endless delays in the 2000 count.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Clouds Holocaust Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two thousand people gathered at a Manhattan  
synagogue Sunday to commemorate victims of the Holocaust while 
remembering that ethnic persecution continues in Europe today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnic cleansing, genocide, is happening as I speak,'' said  
Benjamin Meed, president of the American Gathering of Jewish 
Holocaust Survivors. ``It can happen to anyone, to any group of 
people. The slaughter of Kosovo and in other places must be brought 
to an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, Holocaust survivors, Jewish leaders and  
politicians gathered with several hundred others on Sunday at the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance to observe Yom 
Hashoah, or Holocaust Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles gathering also served to open an exhibit  
chronicling the life and work of 90-year-old Wiesenthal, the famed 
Nazi hunter who spent 53 years seeking nearly 1,100 German war 
criminals around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiesenthal resides in Austria and did not attend the event.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York ceremony opened with four dozen Holocaust survivors  
-- all of them women dressed in black, and many of them elderly -- 
lighting candles in memory of those who perished. 
</P>
<P>
	It was dedicated to the SS St. Louis, a ship that set sail from  
Europe 60 years ago and was denied entry by both Cuba and the 
United States. Most of the 937 refugees on board were Jews; they 
were sent back to Europe and only 240 survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think for the moment what was going through the minds of the  
Jews as they stood on the boat able to see the lights of Miami,'' 
said New York Gov. George Pataki, adding: ``Our government should 
have known they would likely be condemned to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, Holocaust survivor Morris Shulman was among  
those attending. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Germany in 1917, the 82-year-old Jewish cabinetmaker  
considers his liberation from the Buchenwald concentration camp a 
rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freed 54 years ago exactly. April 11, 1945, at about 1  
o'clock. I weighed 72 pounds,'' said Shulman, whose parents, three 
sisters and two brothers were killed in concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Pausing to smile, he added, ``It's a joyful day. My second  
birthday.''

<HEADLINE> Forklift Driver Makes $1M Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Still working as a forklift driver at age  
78, Matel ``Mat'' Dawson is more than a workaholic. He's also a 
philanthropist who has donated more than $1 million to universities 
and charities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson's latest gift, a $200,000 scholarship grant to Wayne  
State University, put him over the million-dollar mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just do this because I want to give back,'' Dawson said. ``I  
want to leave a legacy. I want people to say good things about 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 59 years at Ford Motor Co., Dawson could have retired  
decades ago. Instead, he spends his time moving heavy loads with a 
fork lift at Ford's complex in Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
	He works 12-hour days, sometimes seven days a week, snapping up  
all the overtime that is available. His $23.47 hourly salary plus 
overtime give him potential earnings of $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy money,'' Dawson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dawson has given $440,000 to Wayne State, $200,000 to Louisiana  
State University-Shreveport, $230,000 to the United Negro College 
Fund and almost $150,000 to churches, community colleges and the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	The native of Shreveport, La., has given most to create  
scholarships, which he stipulates must be given on a need basis to 
students of every race and background. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mat is a true altruist,'' said Donald Ritzenheim, Wayne  
State's interim vice president for development and alumni affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson lives in a one-bedroom apartment and drives a 1985 Ford  
Escort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've owned big homes and big cars and that don't excite me no  
more,'' Dawson said. ``I just want people to say that I tried to 
help somebody.''

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Returns to Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Operatic superstar Luciano Pavarotti was given  
a standing ovation when he returned to this gambling haven after a 
14-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti smiled broadly, extending his arms toward the crowd of  
12,500 that cheered his appearance Saturday night to christen the 
Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first concert here since March 1985, when he  
performed at the city's Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. A year earlier, he 
performed at the Riviera Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti appeared fit and happy as he launched into Giacomo  
Puccini's ``Addio, Fiorita Asil'' from ``Madame Butterfly,'' the 
first of a series of arias on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, which paid $50 to $450 each for the evening's  
entertainment, roared its approval with each number, prompting 
Pavarotti to exclaim, ``Thank you, thank you, thank you.''

<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Classic Cat claimed his second stakes  
race since joining Bob Baffert's stable today, winning the $150,000 
San Bernardino Handicap by 3 1/2 lengths over defending champion 
Budroyale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Gary Stevens and carrying 122 pounds, Classic Cat  
covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 3-5 on a muddy track and paid $2.80 and 
$2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale, ridden by Garrett Gomez and carrying 119 pounds,  
crossed the finish line eight lengths in front of Klinsman and 
returned $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there were only four entries, there was no show  
wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the sixth in 15 lifetime starts for Classic Cat and  
was worth $90,000, raising the career earnings of the 4-year-old 
son of Mountain Cat to $1,197,000.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Boarding Pass Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An $8 Titanic boarding pass that survived the  
ill-fated voyage along with its passenger has fetched $100,000 at 
an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer was Jeffrey Trainer, an Allentown, Pa. collector who  
is in the trading card business. 
</P>
<P>
	The price began at $5,000 on Saturday and zoomed to $100,000 in  
less than a minute, said Cheryl Gorsuch, co-owner of the Tacoma 
antique store where the auction was held. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer said he would ``hoard the ticket for a little while and  
enjoy it.'' The passenger, Anna Sofia Sjoblom, had ``kept it for a 
while, so I may, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The document -- an undamaged immigrant inspection card that  
served as a boarding pass for Titanic's third-class passengers-- is 
believed to be the only such ticket in existence. Its price on 
Saturday makes it among the most valued of the ship's memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sjoblom, of Finland, had pinned the boarding pass inside her  
jacket for the 1912 voyage. She had borrowed the $8 Titanic fare 
after she and three friends were bumped from the Adriatic, another 
ship in the White Star Line. 
</P>
<P>
	Titanic sunk on Sjoblom's 18th birthday. She made it onto a  
lifeboat that also reportedly carried White Star Line chairman J. 
Bruce Ismay. The pass, still pinned inside her jacket, stayed dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sjoblom's three friends died.  
</P>
<P>
	When she arrived in America, Sjoblom headed west with her uncle,  
finally settling in Tacoma. She married and raised two children in 
Olympia, and died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Her pass had been packed away with old photographs and postcards  
until a widower of Sjoblom's grandniece sold it to the antique 
store about six months ago, Gorsuch said. She would not say how 
much she paid or anything else about the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	But how it got to such a distant relation has left Sjoblom's  
direct descendants perplexed. Their varying theories have the pass 
vanishing long ago with Sjoblom's first husband, or being taken by 
a curious high school student whom Sjoblom lent a box of voyage 
keepsakes sometime in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never saw him again,'' said Sjoblom's daughter, Evelyn  
Hendrickson, 84, who attended the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives considered making a bid to bring the ticket back into  
the family, but William Hendrickson, Sjoblom's grandson, said the 
family couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think all the luck in our gene pool was used up  
when my grandmother got on that lifeboat,'' he told The News 
Tribune of Tacoma.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Fans Clash With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigerian fans and riot police using whips  
or bamboolike canes clashed overnight in the capital following 
Nigeria's defeat in the World Youth Soccer Championship, it was 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, many on horseback, waded in against fans who hurled  
bottles and cans at the Nigerian team bus as it left National 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence was reported in several areas of the sprawling port  
city throughout the night, the newspaper Thisday said. There were 
no reports of arrests or details on the number injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria lost 2-1 to Paraguay in this tournament for players  
under 20 years old. Nigerian coach Tunde Disu was fired within an 
hour after the game and had a police escort when leaving the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Nigeria's second defeat, and many thought it would lead  
to its elimination in the tournament, the first this country has 
held at the international level. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Nigeria remained in contention following results from  
later games Saturday. The Nigerians advance to the second round and 
on Wednesday play Ireland in the northern city of Kano.

<HEADLINE> Study: Ads Soaring on Prime-Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Keep those remotes handy -- the amount of ads  
cluttering up prime-time television is soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	An average hour of prime-time TV contained 15 minutes, 44  
seconds of advertising last November, a jump of 25 seconds over the 
year before, according to a study released Sunday. It was the most 
ad time ever recorded since two trade groups began measuring in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	At 16:27, ABC had the most ``clutter'' during an average  
prime-time hour among the top four networks. Fox had been the 
network leader in ad time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ABC and NBC pack in nearly five minutes more of ads and  
promotions into a prime-time hour than they did a decade ago, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an indication of a business in trouble,'' said Jon  
Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom, an ad buying firm. With 
viewership declining, the networks need to sell more ads because 
they can't promise their sponsors as many people will see their 
message as they did in the past, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Programming costs have been going up at the same time, forcing  
network executives to look harder for more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising community is concerned that the commercials will  
have less of an impact on viewers because there are too many of 
them, said Stuart Gray, senior vice president of audience research 
for the ad buying firm BBD&AMP;O. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really think that people are going to stop watching  
television because there are too many commercials,'' Gray said. ``I 
think it will have the effect of causing viewers to use the remote 
even more than they are using it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daytime network television is even more cluttered. The networks  
added 11 seconds of commercial time last year to crack the 
20-minute barrier: one-third of each hour in daytime is taken up by 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Network news programs and late-night shows had fewer commercial  
messages, on average, in 1998 than they did the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	E! Entertainment Television, TBS and MTV ranked among the most  
cluttered cable networks last year, all with just over 18 minutes 
of ad time during an average hour, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandel said he saw instances of a cable station running an  
eight-minute commercial break during the airing of a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part is that they're ruining the viewing experience,  
they're ruining the advertisements' effectiveness and they're not 
getting anywhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was prepared by the American Association of  
Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers, 
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Guillen Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle Mariners rookie infielder Carlos Guillen  
will miss the rest of the season because of a torn ligament in his 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, 23, tore the anterior cruciate ligament hurt Saturday  
night after tagging out Tony Phillips in a rundown. Guillen started 
all five Mariners games this season. He played the first three at 
second base and moved over to shortstop after All-Star Alex 
Rodriguez was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is sidelined 4-6 weeks following surgery on his left  
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second serious knee injury that Guillen has sustained.  
He tore the posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee at Oakland 
on Sept. 17 and missed the final two weeks of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen was placed on the 15-day disabled list and the Mariners  
recalled Giomar Guevera, 26, from Tacoma. They also signed Domingo 
Cedeno, a 31-year-old free agent, to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Guevara played two games with the Tacoma Rainiers of the Pacific  
Coast League, both at shortstop, and started Sunday's game against 
the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno, 31, spent spring training with Oakland and hit .140. To  
make room, the Mariners optioned reliever Eric Weaver to Tacoma. He 
appeared in two games for the Mariners, pitching a scoreless inning 
against the A's on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bid City, IOC Share PR Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The public relations firm helping the International Olympic  
Committee repair its scandal-battered image has been hired by 
organizers of Toronto's effort to win the 2008 Summer Games, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Toronto's bid committee means that Hill &AMP;  
Knowlton Inc. will represent both the IOC and a city that must 
lobby the IOC for the right to hold the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In its April 12 edition, PRWeek magazine reported that Hill &AMP;  
Knowlton has been chosen over Edelman, GPC Canada and Grey 
Advertising subsidiaries GCI Group and APCO Associates, who pitched 
jointly for the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Evensen, coordinator of Toronto's bid, told the magazine  
that the bid committee had no reservations about any possible 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill &AMP; Knowlton also has stressed that representing competing  
for the Toronto account while representing the IOC did not pose a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls by The Associated Press to two representatives  
of Hill &AMP; Knowlton were not returned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is struggling to clean up its image in the aftermath of  
the bribery scandal involving Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 
Winter Games, and any apparent conflict of interest could hurt that 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	PRWeek quoted Len Brooks, a business ethics professor at  
Toronto's Rotman School of Management, as saying that Hill &AMP; 
Knowlton should erect a ``firewall'' between its IOC and Toronto 
teams, including separate filing and computer systems, to prevent 
the sharing of information that could give the bid committee an 
unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill &AMP; Knowlton's involvement with the Toronto bid committee  
while simultaneously representing the IOC was first reported in 
February by The Wall Street Journal. At the time, Hill &AMP; Knowlton 
spokesman Ron Hartwig said no company employee involved in the IOC 
job can work on the Toronto effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Toronto, other cities seeking the 2008 Summer Games  
include Beijing; Paris; Osaka, Japan; and Seville, Spain. Others 
considering making a bid include Cairo; Istanbul; Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia; and Buenos Aires.

<HEADLINE> MedPartners, California Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- State negotiators have reached an agreement  
in principal that would hold MedPartners Inc. responsible for debts 
and claims against its California subsidiary and permit more than 
100 clinics seized by state regulators to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which must be approved in U.S. Bankruptcy Court  
and state Superior Court, would end the state's monthlong battle 
with Alabama-based MedPartners over concerns that the financially 
troubled company would leave the state without paying its bills, 
and leave more than 1 million enrollees shopping for new doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on how the agreement will be carried out still must be  
negotiated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	General terms of the agreement were announced from Sacramento  
Friday after attorneys for both sides battled in a Los Angeles 
courtroom over the legality of the regulators' March 11 seizure of 
MedPartners Provider Network, the California subsidiary that 
manages business affairs for 117 clinics and more than 1,000 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also calls for the clinics to be sold to  
``financially viable'' third parties. State officials said they 
would urge MedPartners to sell the clinics to California-based 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	MedPartners Inc., squeezed by a falling share price and doctor  
discontent, said in November that it was quitting the physician 
management business. The company planned this year to sell or spin 
off 238 physician clinics and more than 13,000 affiliated doctors 
in 42 states.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Officials at the Nasdaq Stock Market said today  
it has successfully completed a series of tests designed to make 
sure there will be no problems when the year 2000 arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	``After extensive and rigorous testing, we have every reason to  
be extremely confident that there will be no serious disruptions in 
our services, and that investors will be protected,'' said Gregor 
Ballor, the executive vice president and chief information officer 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent 
company of Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computers software interprets years in a two-digit format,  
such as ``99'' for 1999. The concern is that unless software is 
modified, computers in various industries will malfunction when the 
calendar changes from ``99'' to ``00,'' which may be interpreted as 
1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market conducted a series of live tests over four  
weekends in March and April, running more than 170,000 simulated 
transactions for nine securities products for the period Dec. 
29-31, 1999, and Jan. 3, 2000. Making sure applications were Year 
2000 compliant cost about $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Both NASD and the stock market said they would continue to  
monitor internal systems as the millennium nears.

<HEADLINE> DWI Case Changes State's Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- New Mexico's most infamous  
drunken-driving case did more than shatter the lives of the Navajo 
driver and the woman and three young daughters he killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In six years marked by survivors' grief and hung juries, it has  
changed the way people think about drinking and driving in a state 
that has ranked for years as one of the worst in the nation for DWI 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the state closed all 234 drive-up liquor windows.  
This year, it required drivers with more than one drunken driving 
conviction to install ``ignition interlocks,'' which measure a 
driver's blood alcohol and prevent a vehicle from starting if he or 
she has been drinking. In 1994, it lowered the legal blood-alcohol 
limit from 0.10 to 0.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who championed the changes credit the crusading  
perseverance of Nadine Milford, whose mid-life serenity was ripped 
apart Christmas Eve 1992. She cannot forget that while others 
opened presents that Christmas Day, she was planning a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a warm, fuzzy Grandma with a job at a Christian  
school,'' Milford says. ``I was happiest when I had a child to 
hold. That's what my whole life consisted of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The warm fuzziness vanished that Christmas Eve, along with the  
legal career of Gordon House, then 32, a criminal justice graduate 
who worked with troubled Indian teens. 
</P>
<P>
	House, the father of two, spent the day in Albuquerque, shopping  
and drinking. He would later testify he consumed 7 1/2 beers. That 
night, his red pickup truck ended up on the wrong side of 
Interstate 40 -- heading east in the westbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	House drove the wrong way for 12 miles, sometimes at speeds up  
to 90 mph, before colliding head-on with a car carrying Milford's 
daughter, Melanie Cravens, 31,and three granddaughters -- Kandyce, 
9, Erin, 8, and Kacee, 5 -- killing all four. Cravens' husband, Paul 
Woodard, was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	House, who claimed that a migraine headache, not beer, caused  
his disorientation, was tried three times in 1994 and 1995 on 
vehicular homicide and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trials at Taos ended in hung juries on the homicide charges,  
although House was convicted at the first trial of driving while 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	At the third trial, moved 300 miles away to Las Cruces, he was  
convicted on four counts of vehicular homicide and sentenced to 22 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	House spent 291 days in prison, then was released in 1996 on  
appeal. A year later, the state appeals court tossed out his 
convictions on grounds the trial should not have been moved. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state Supreme Court last month reinstated the  
convictions, and House returned to prison last Tuesday. His 
attorney, Ray Twohig, plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Milford began lobbying for tougher DWI laws within two weeks of  
the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a novice, she soon became a participant at legislative  
hearings, public meetings and rallies where drunken driving was the 
issue. Today, she heads the state's Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
organization and is among the most visible lobbyists at the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Mimi Stewart of Albuquerque says Milford was a major  
factor in getting lawmakers to close the state's drive-up windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a constant presence. She won't let people forget what a  
heartbreak it was to lose almost her entire family,'' Stewart says. 
``If there had not been a Nadine Milford, I don't think this case 
would have received so much continuing attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the timing of the crash and who was involved  
contributed immense notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Christmas Eve. It's an Indian driving the wrong way on  
the highway, and the people in the other vehicle that died are four 
whites,'' says Dr. Paul Guerin, a criminologist with the University 
of New Mexico Institute for Social Research. Guerin's doctoral 
dissertation examined fatal motor-vehicle accidents in New Mexico 
from 1982 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gathers much more press because it's an Indian killing  
whites,'' Guerin says. ``There have been other cases where Indians 
kill Indians, but it occurs in a rural area and it doesn't get as 
much publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race has been an issue throughout the case, subtly or otherwise.  
Twohig says House was made a scapegoat for the state's DWI problem. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico ranked first in DWI fatalities in 1996 and second in  
1995. In 1997, the last year for which statistics are available, 
New Mexico had dropped to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Twohig restated his thesis last week after House was returned to  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people seem to think that sending Gordon to prison or  
seeing him taken away has a beneficial effect. That it has 
something to do with ending the case or it has a healing effect,'' 
Twohig says. ``I don't think people get healed by inflicting pain 
on others. Those who are looking at this incarceration as a way to 
help themselves had better look elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some feel House and his family -- wife, Sue, son Ryan, 12, and  
daughter Leatricia, 9 -- have suffered enough and criticize 
Milford's work to keep him behind bars. Milford responds that her 
crusade is about justice, not racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``You walk in my shoes and tell me his pain is deeper than  
mine,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the changes her campaign wrought have provided any  
solace, Milford answers, ``You bet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly what I live for. For being visible about this  
issue. The year my children died there were 274 people killed in 
DWI crashes (in New Mexico). Last year, there were 169.''

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Gas Prices Up 14 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Less than two months ago, consumers were  
enjoying gasolines prices averaging under $1 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	But a combination of seasonal demand, OPEC cuts in crude oil  
production and fires at California refineries has since pushed 
prices more than 20 cents higher -- with no relief in sight, an 
industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three weeks alone, pump prices have jumped 14 cents  
per gallon. In California over that same period, the average jumped 
43.11 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices jumped, leaped, exploded -- your pick,'' said analyst  
Trilby Lundberg, who runs the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas 
stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average price for all grades and services on Friday  
was $1.2281 -- a 14.12 cent hike from the last survey three weeks 
ago. On Feb. 21, the average price was only 99.8 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's cheapest gas was in Atlanta, where self-serve  
regular unleaded was going for 95.30 cents, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardest hit were motorists in California, where the average  
price for regular unleaded was $1.6390. Explosions at two 
refineries -- including one at a Tosco Avon refinery Feb. 23 that 
left four workers dead -- have helped send prices soaring in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorist Geoff Leonard, of San Francisco, groused about the  
price hike while filling the tank of his Volvo station wagon at a 
Chevron station on Sunday. The price tag: $18.68 for 10 1/2 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' said Leonard, 42. ``It's the largest increase  
I've seen since the early '80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though refinery problems should disappear soon and the supply  
picture is normalizing, Ms. Lundberg saw no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big picture is that even if prices in California and the  
nation should peak soon, we are unlikely to see those ultra-low 
1998 price levels any time soon,'' she said.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's bombing of Serb targets in  
Kosovo continued today, despite the Orthodox Easter holiday. 
Yugoslavia reported six civilian deaths and 23 injuries in this

include a father and his 1-year-old daughter. According to Yugoslav 
officials, 300 civilians have been killed and 3,000 injured during

	Some Work Deaths Preventable  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Of the estimated 1.1 million work-related deaths  
occur each year, many could be prevented by better safety measures. 
That's according to the International Labor Organization, which 
said nearly 300,000 of these deaths stem from exposure to hazardous 
substances which caused cancer, heart and respiratory disease, the 
U.N. labor organization said. The ILO said an estimated 600,000 
lives each year could be saved if safety and information practices 
were improved.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A combination of aspirin and  
cholesterol-lowering drugs used to prevent heart disease may also

the common medicines appear to offer a potent -- if unintended -- 
shield against the cancer. The work is based on a new analysis of 
cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins, already used by 
millions of Americans to keep their hearts healthy.

	Television Bursting With Ads

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The number of ads cluttering up prime-time

hour of prime-time TV contained 15 minutes, 44 seconds of 
advertising last November, a jump of 25 seconds over the year 
before. Daytime network television is even more bloated by ads. The 
networks added 11 seconds of commercial time last year to crack the 
20-minute barrier: one-third of each hour in daytime is taken up by 
commercials.

Spaniard, who once used to cry himself to sleep and wonder if he 
would ever walk again, admitted that wearing the tournament's 
trademark green jacket a second time was an achievement that never 
crossed his mind. Olazabal shot a final round 1-Under-Par 71 for a 
two-stroke win over Davis Love to win his second career Masters.

<HEADLINE> Sponsors Jump on Y2K Promotions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Memo to entrepreneurs looking to make a buck off  
millennium mania: You're too late. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the century will be sponsored, patented, copyrighted  
and trademarked by several marketing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are hundreds of individuals and companies cashing in  
on the date change, a few savvy companies have decided to get rich 
by licensing the phrases that define 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Want to use ``01-01-00'' on a mug? Talk to Kenneth Walker. His  
company, Walker Group/Design, owns the trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``Y2K'' throw pillow? Call Hanna Irwin of Looking Glass  
Partners in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Year 2000'' has been snapped up by Planet Marketing Inc.,  
so don't get any ideas about that ``I survived Year 2000, and all I 
got was this stupid T-shirt'' T-shirt without first giving them a 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty of '01-01-00' is that it does several things,''  
said Walker. ``It says Jan. 1, 2000. It's digital, the language of 
computers. And it represents the computer glitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The computer glitch is the so-called Y2K bug, which arises from  
the use in early computer programs of a two-digit format to express 
a year. Such computers could read the ``00'' of 2000 as 1900, which 
could cause a variety of failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer experts say the problems probably will result in  
isolated minor inconveniences at most. Others fear a global 
economic meltdown, accompanied by food shortages and the collapse 
of the nation's power grid. 
</P>
<P>
	However it all turns out, marketers know there's cash to be had  
by trademarking millennial phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's company has 28 trademarks filed or registered covering  
``01-01-00.'' Irwin has 45 trademarks filed or pending for ``Y2K'' 
and related phrases, including ``The end of the world as we 00 
it,'' and ``Uh 00h.'' On its Web site, www.y2kstuff.com, the 
company says it has more than 550 categories of items trademarked 
for Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The phrase ``millennium bug'' has 18 trademarks against it, some  
held by Looking Glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's company has licensed 01-01-00 to 55 licensees, is seen  
in Bloomingdale's, Sears and Penney's. He plans to expand to 
Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that the millennium is not just another century,'' he  
said. ``It's going to be the biggest celebration the world has ever 
seen, and it means different things to different people. For some, 
it's a summation of the past. For others its an affirmation of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at it as a celebration.''  
</P>
<P>
	He'll have reason for a rosy outlook if his business plans work  
out. He projects about $60 million in revenue by 12-31-99 -- which 
no one has trademarked. Yet.

<HEADLINE> Princeton Researches Fusion Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAINSBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Scientists using the country's newest  
experimental nuclear reactor believe they're gaining ground in 
their efforts to develop a safe and inexhaustible power source for 
the next century -- fusion energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Spherical Torus eXperiment, or NSTX, at the  
Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory in this central New 
Jersey suburb already is impressing both officials supporting 
fusion research funding and the physicists and engineers working on 
the nationwide collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NSTX is an enormous example of the potential'' of the  
technology, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said recently. ``It 
brings us closer to the reality of fusion energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fusion, the process that powers the sun, involves slamming  
special forms of tiny hydrogen atoms together at very high 
temperature and pressure in a plasma, a hot mass of electrically 
charged gas similar to the substance inside a fluorescent light 
bulb. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say harnessing the power released when the atoms fuse  
will one day provide a clean energy source far safer than today's 
commercial nuclear fission reactors, which split apart large, 
radioactive atoms. The fuel, hydrogen atoms removed from water, is 
plentiful. In addition, the fusion process can't cause a 
``meltdown'' reaction and doesn't contribute to air pollution, acid 
rain or the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory director Robert J. Goldston said the radioactivity  
produced by a fusion reactor is 100,000 times less than in an 
equivalent fission reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossil fuel supplies are expected to run low in 50 years, and  
many scientists hope fusion will be a major energy source before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the year 2100, either we're going to be real toasty and  
under water (from flooding induced by global warming), or we're 
going to have a completely different energy system,'' Goldston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But perfecting the technology to control a self-sustaining  
``burn'' of nuclear fuel will take decades and cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Meanwhile, physicists across the country say 
progress has been slowed in recent years by the federal 
government's inadequate financial commitment: just $27 million 
annually for the NSTX project and $227 million a year for the 
country's entire fusion research program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Magnetic fusion research is eminently worthwhile because it  
solves an energy problem,'' yet it's not a high priority for the 
government, said Patrick Diamond, a University of California-San 
Diego physics professor whose research focuses on turbulence in 
reactor plasmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Limiting that turbulence, which quickly cools down the  
multimillion-degree plasma and stops the fusion process, is one of 
the biggest challenges to physicists and a major focus of the NSTX 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond and his Princeton colleagues are particularly worried  
that, under pressure from Congress, the administration has reduced 
participation in a planned international collaboration on the next 
generation of reactor to basically consulting with scientists in 
Russia, Japan and a European consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	The only U.S. facility for the project was shut last year and  
there is no funding for the collaboration in the proposed budget 
for fiscal year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The physicists worry this country could end up paying for rights  
to use the technology, rather than being able to sell it to 
less-developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Washington's push for smaller, cheaper reactors, the  
compact NSTX is particularly attractive, compared to the 
gymnasium-sized fusion reactor it replaced here, Goldston said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor was shut down two years ago  
after 15 years of breakthrough experiments that included producing 
a record-setting 10.7 million watts of power, about 100 million 
times the level reactors were able to generate in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tokamak reactor would cost nearly 15 times as much to  
build today as the $24 million NSTX, which uses much of the same 
peripheral equipment that was part of Tokamak. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of NSTX was completed on budget and months ahead of  
schedule, Richardson noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet, in two days of preliminary experiments in February,  
the machine produced nearly six times the current targeted for 
those first runs. That proved the reactor could create a plasma 
with its giant magnets and just one of its heating systems, which 
uses an electrical current, like a toaster or space heater. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians now are installing the second, a radio frequency  
heating system that works like microwaves, and will begin 
experiments in earnest in July, said Masa Ono, the project 
director. Come January, experiments will halt while workers connect 
neutral beam injectors, which shoot super-heated particles into the 
plasma. 
</P>
<P>
	Experiments then will run for several years, after which the  
project team of scientists from the lab and 13 other U.S. research 
facilities will use what they have learned to adjust the machine 
for optimal performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being more economical to build than its predecessor,  
NSTX has a removable central core containing some of its most 
complex equipment, so repairs or upgrades to the reactor can be 
done in days instead of months, limiting downtime, according to Al 
Vonhalle, the project's head of technical operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another advantage is its slightly different shape. The Tokamak  
reactor also was a torus, or doughnut shape, while this ``spherical 
torus'' is shaped like a ball, with a very narrow central core. 
Researchers believe that configuration will allow for higher 
pressures in the plasma, something needed to keep fusion reactions 
going much longer than the several-second pulses achieved so far. 
</P>
<P>
	NSTX is one of a handful of this type of reactor with different  
design variations recently built or under construction in the 
United States, England, Russia and Japan. The Princeton scientists 
believe their machine has some significant advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ours will be the most powerful in the world,'' Goldston said.  
``We'll have the most heating and the longest pulse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond believes, however, that a reactor in San Diego and one  
under construction at University of California-Los Angeles are ``at 
least as promising'' as NSTX. Comparing findings from the different 
reactors should allow for more advances in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not fusion reactors can compete with other energy  
sources in a few decades, Goldston notes the research generates 
valuable spinoffs. That includes using plasmas to make better 
computer chips, sterilize medical equipment, make luminous display 
panels more efficient and provide a lightweight fuel for rocket 
thrusters in space ships and on satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	An explanation of fusion and how fusion reactors work:  
</P>
<P>
	WHAT IT IS -- Fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars,  
occurs when very light, superheated hydrogen atoms, in gas form, 
collide at high speed and fuse. The reaction yields slightly larger 
atoms and atomic particles called neutrons that carry away heat 
energy released in the process so energy that can be used to make 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, today's nuclear plants are powered by fission, in  
which very heavy radioactive atoms are split apart, releasing 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	RESEARCH GOAL -- Researchers must harness more energy from a  
fusion reactor than the power needed to run it. The reactor must be 
fairly economical to build and operate, so it can compete with 
other energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
	TIMETABLE -- The United States began its fusion research program  
in 1951 and had aimed to have commercial reactors operating soon 
after 2030. But federal funding cuts have slowed progress, 
jeopardizing that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW REACTORS WORK -- Using powerful magnetic forces and a  
combination of high-tech heating methods, magnetic fusion reactors 
make the nuclei of special forms, or isotopes, of hydrogen fuse 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	A thimbleful of hydrogen gas is injected into the reactor  
chamber and heated to hundreds of millions of degrees -- many times 
hotter than the sun's core -- by electrical current, microwaves and 
neutral particle beam injectors to create a hot, electrically 
charged gas mass called a plasma, similar to the substance inside a 
fluorescent light bulb. Giant magnets then create a magnetic field 
confining that plasma as if in an invisible container. The charged 
molecular particles collide at high speeds and many fuse, releasing 
heat energy. That energy is carried across the magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
	In a future commercial fusion reactor, the energy would be drawn  
off using a heat exchanger to make electricity.

<HEADLINE> Largest Airport Creator Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- England's Sir Norman Foster, whose creations  
include the world's largest airport in Hong Kong and the British 
Museum's Great Court, on Sunday won the Pritzker Architecture 
Prize, the discipline's highest honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The prestigious award, which includes a $100,000 grant and a  
bronze medallion, honors a living architect whose work demonstrates 
a combination of talent, vision and commitment. Announced Sunday by 
the Hyatt Foundation, it will be presented in Berlin on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's, in a way, a recognition of the importance of  
architecture and the role it plays in all our lives, either in an 
individual building or in the relationship between the quality of 
our environment and the quality of our lives,'' Sir Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	His creations include a 214,000 square-foot Center for Clinical  
Sciences Research at Stanford University and the Millennium 
Pedestrian Bridge across the River Thames in London that connects 
St. Paul's Cathedral, the Tate Gallery of Modern Art and the Globe 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	``At whatever scale, from a glass elevator to an airport, his  
vision forges the materials of our age into a crystalline, lyrical 
purity that is highly personal, brilliantly functional, and ... 
just downright beautiful,'' said Pritzker Prize jury chairman J. 
Carter Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Norman was knighted by the Queen of England in 1990 and was  
appointed to the England's Order of Merit in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pritzker prize was established by the Hyatt Foundation in  
1979.

<HEADLINE> Nets Retire Williams' No. 52 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Buck Williams, a blue-collar power  
forward who set 10 team records in eight seasons in New Jersey, had 
his No. 52 retired by the Nets today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special honor,'' Williams said before his number was  
raised to the rafters at the Continental Airlines Arena. ``I think 
every athlete thinks in terms of having their number retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony took place at halftime of the Nets' game against  
the New York Knicks. A first-round draft choice of the Nets in 
1981, Williams started his career in New Jersey and ended it this 
year after two seasons with New York. In between were seven seasons 
with the Portland Trail Blazers, with whom he twice went to the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	While Williams had fond memories of his time in New Jersey, many  
of his thoughts Sunday focused on the Knicks' struggles and the 
plight of coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose job reportedly is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is a phenomenal coach,'' Williams said. ``The Knicks  
would be doing themselves an injustice to fire coach Van Gundy. I 
think he has worked harder than a lot of the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few people outworked Williams during his 17-year NBA career. He  
is the Nets' all-time leader in scoring (10,440), rebounds (7,576), 
games (635), minutes (23,100), field goals made (3,981), field 
goals attempted (7,234), free throws made (2,476), free throws 
attempted (3,818), offensive rebounds (2,588) and defensive 
rebounds (4,988). 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he got the most out of his talent and that's what you  
want to be able to say to every athlete,'' said Hall of Famer 
Willis Reed, a Nets senior vice president who coached Williams in 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' fondest memory with the Nets came in the spring of  
1984 when New Jersey eliminated defending champion Philadelphia in 
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Nets center Mike Gminski said no one story or event can  
sum up Williams' career. He was just a player who showed up every 
night and gave everything he had. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amazing thing, and most people don't realize this, is that  
he was a power forward and he never weighed more than 225 pounds,'' 
Gminski said. ``He was so strong inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five other Nets players have had their numbers retired -- Drazen  
Petrovic (3), Wendell Ladner (4), John Williamson (23), Bill 
Melchionni (25) and Julius Erving (32).

<HEADLINE> Final Opening Day for Tiger Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- There once was an old hay market at the corner of  
Michigan and Trumbull. 
</P>
<P>
	That old hay market gave way to Bennett Park, which opened in  
1896. That gave way to Navin Field, which opened in 1912 and later 
became Briggs Stadium and Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Tigers play the Minnesota Twins tomorrow, it will mark  
the last home opener in Tiger Stadium. The team will move a few 
blocks away to Comerica Park to start the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it's going to be awful hard on me, because I've spent  
every year of my adult life ... at Briggs Stadium and Tiger 
Stadium,'' Hall of Famer Al Kaline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Harwell, the beloved announcer who has been broadcasting  
from the corner since 1960, has been in the radio booth for two 
World Series championships at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparky Anderson came along in 1979 and managed the Tigers for  
the next 16 seasons. Under him, the Tigers won two division titles 
and a World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The current manager, Larry Parrish, remembers the night when  
Sparky -- who never once played the outfield -- robbed him of a home 
run. It happened while Parrish, then playing for Texas, was facing 
Jack Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack threw me a fastball away and I hit it pretty good to  
right field,'' Parrish said. ``It went out of the ballpark. I ran 
around the bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Sparky stepped out of the dugout, arguing the ball went  
foul before leaving the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually got the home plate umpire to overrule the first  
base umpire, and call it a foul ball,'' Parrish said. ``I had to go 
back up there and hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, a fan made his way to the clubhouse and wanted  
Parrish to autograph the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that he'd caught it, and he was sitting two rows  
inside the foul pole, in fair territory,'' Parrish said. ``So, 
Sparky got a home run taken away from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most famous game came in the 1934 World Series, when  
St. Louis outfielder Ducky Medwick had to be pulled by baseball 
commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Fans threw garbage at Medwick 
after he crashed into Detroit third baseman Marv Owen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have played in the World Series nine times, winning  
four. Detroit also has held three All-Star games, including the one 
in 1971 in which Reggie Jackson homered into the light tower on the 
right-field roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much history in that place,'' Anderson said. ``It  
went all the way back to basically when Cobb played ... Gehrig and 
Ruth, all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett Park, the stadium's forerunner, was mainly a covered  
grandstand. Hundreds of fans crammed bleachers erected across the 
street. They were only slightly deterred by cloth drapes blocking 
their sight behind the outfield wall. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1911, team owner Frank Navin razed the old stands and built a  
new facility. Navin Field opened to a 6-5 Detroit victory before a 
crowd of 24,384 on April 20, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	Also opening that day was Fenway Park in Boston, which next year  
will be alone as the oldest stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of Navin Field -- widely regarded as the beginning of  
Tiger Stadium -- should have been a front-page story. But the 
sinking of the Titanic five days earlier was still hot news. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1923, the original stands were double-decked. Walter Briggs  
took over the club after Navin died and added a second level to the 
bleachers and the right-field pavilion in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, Cherry Street, the northern boundary, was closed,  
enabling another expansion that essentially enclosed the park. It 
was renamed Briggs Stadium, held 53,000 and looked pretty much as 
it does today. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'll miss least is the bullpen,'' reliever Todd Jones  
said. ``To me, it's a cross between a submarine and a prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, as a lover of baseball lore, Jones will be as sorry as  
anyone to see the club move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the place,'' he said. ``But more than that, I love how  
much it means to people.''

	HOLLYWOOD (AP) -- You might say motion pictures got started with  
a sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences chorused ``God bless you'' when they saw Thomas  
Edison's grainy, black-and-white film of his employee, Fred Ott, 
sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Or was it a kiss that really got movies going?  
</P>
<P>
	A film short, ``The Kiss Between May Irvin and John C. Rice,''  
intrigued many, but one writer found the first celluloid smooch 
loathsome, ``magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated 
thrice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some credit New York's Latham brothers and their films of boxing  
matches. Others point to the basement screening room in Paris where 
the Lumiere brothers first showed that moving images, even silly 
ones of people falling off horses, could be projected on a screen 
to draw thousands curious enough to pay a franc. 
</P>
<P>
	These pioneers worked their magic in the decade before the 20th  
century began. But their early efforts were mostly novelties, 
proofs of laboratory hypotheses, technological tricks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1903, Edwin S. Porter, production head for Edison's Black  
Maria studio, showed what movies could be. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's 12-minute ``The Great Train Robbery'' carried a story  
from beginning to end, and filled it with exciting action and 
clever stunts. The most startling came when an outlaw pointed his 
six-shooter straight at the audience and fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen went red, and women swooned.  
</P>
<P>
	If that scene was the progenitor of what the movies would  
become, we all know its descendants, all the places we've never 
been and people we've never met but swear we can remember: 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta as a wall of flames in ``Gone With the Wind.'' A shower  
curtain slowly ripping down in ``Psycho.'' The chilling menace of 
``Jaws'' that still keeps some out of the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke that choked us during Normandy beach assaults, from ``The  
Longest Day'' to ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The slow-motion bullet 
hail that finally stopped ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' The 
nails-in-the-dashboard car chases of ``Bullitt'' and ``The French 
Connection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has lived in the 20th century carries a portable  
library of film images, unrealities so real they sometimes crowd 
out actual memories. 
</P>
<P>
	A grapefruit in the face. A top hat and a ducklike walk. A dance  
around a rainy lamppost. A rider silhouetted as the sunset fades to 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's roll the credits for this art form that is called the  
greatest of the century. Who produced and directed this spectacle? 
How did we all hire on as extras? 
</P>
<P>
	In 1908, the same year that Edison and other major East Coast  
producers formed the Motion Picture Patents Co. to protect their 
inventions, the Selig company filmed ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' 
in Santa Monica, the first major production away from New Jersey 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracted by the nearly year-round sunshine, other producers  
flooded into Los Angeles, many settling in a sleepy citrus-growing 
suburb called Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early silent films, actors were not listed by name.  
``The Biograph Girl,'' known only by her studio, became so popular 
that the public demanded her name, Florence Lawrence. Thus the star 
system was born. 
</P>
<P>
	What was a star? Royalty, statesmen and great authors achieved  
fame, but they were known only as distant figures. People saw movie 
stars as endearing, comic and daring characters on the screen, and 
the desire to know more about them became insatiable. The studios 
were more than pleased to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-born Gladys Smith, a child actress who became known as  
Mary Pickford, started at Biograph in 1909 at $40 a week. By 1916, 
Adolph Zukor was paying her $10,000 a week, plus a $300,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusting for inflation, Pickford was possibly the highest paid  
actress ever, and she became an important force in Hollywood when 
she helped found United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon such stars as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian  
Gish and Rudolph Valentino were filling theaters and earning huge 
salaries. Everyone, from the ordinary to the exalted, succumbed to 
the movies' spell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is like writing history with lightning,'' President Woodrow  
Wilson commented after seeing D.W. Griffith's 1915 epic, ``The 
Birth of a Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A keen storyteller, Griffith virtually invented the motion  
picture form with his use of closeups, longshots, changed camera 
angles and intercutting. While ``Birth of a Nation,'' a Civil War 
spectacle, became the most successful movie of its time, the 
Kentucky-born director was assailed as a bigot for his portrayal of 
blacks and his benign depiction of the Ku Klux Klan. Black 
activists and white racists clashed in Boston and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies' power to stir deep feelings was harnessed during  
World War I as studios produced propaganda films such as ``The 
Beast of Berlin'' and other flagwavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Business was booming in Hollywood -- now freed from Edison's  
monopoly by the Justice Department. The Roaring '20s brought the 
consolidation of the business into all-powerful major studios, most 
of them controlling chains of theaters. The leaders: Adolph Zukor 
of Paramount Pictures; William Fox, 20th Century Fox; Louis B. 
Mayer, MGM; Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner, Warner Bros.; Carl 
Laemmle, Universal Pictures; Harry and Jack Cohn, Columbia 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the boom, scandals taught the sad consequences  
of making actors seem more than human. 
</P>
<P>
	The wholesome young star Wallace Reid fell victim to drugs and  
alcohol and died at 32. Director William Desmond Taylor was 
murdered in his home, and investigators disclosed two famous 
actresses were his lovers. Comedian Roscoe ``Fatty'' Arbuckle was 
tried three times before being acquitted in the party death of a 
starlet. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's puritans raged against Hollywood as a modern Sodom  
and Gomorrah, and alarmed film bosses hired Republican politician 
Will Hays to clean up the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Actors were required to sign morality clauses that would cause  
their firing if their behavior brought public obloquy. The Hays 
Office enforced a censorship code over film content. For more than 
40 years, filmmakers worked within rules that prohibited anything 
that couldn't be seen by the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1927, MGM's Mayer invited 36 industry leaders to a banquet at  
which he proposed forming an academy to enhance movies' prestige. 
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, 270 movie notables attended a dinner where the  
Academy bestowed awards. Today's broadcast of the Oscars -- said to 
have been named by two-time winner Bette Davis because the 
statuette's behind resembled that of her then-husband, producer 
Harmon Oscar Nelson -- draws an international audience estimated by 
the academy to be near 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Academy Awards were for silent films. But there was a  
special award that year, too -- to Warner Bros. for pioneering the 
use of sound in ``The Jazz Singer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences cheered when Al Jolson said, ``Wait a minute, wait a  
minute. You ain't heard nothing yet.'' Within a year, the silent 
film was dead. Dialogue brought a new sophistication to the screen 
and made musicals possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater attendance skyrocketed, and studios thrived.  
</P>
<P>
	Even the Depression of the 1930s couldn't halt the industry's  
prosperity. Movies with upbeat titles -- ``The Gay Divorcee,'' 
``Gold Diggers of 1933'' (and '35 and '37), ``Pennies From Heaven'' 
-- distracted Americans from their daily woes. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Hollywood mobilized all its forces. Stars  
like Clark Gable, James Stewart, Tyrone Power donned uniforms, and 
still other actors went on tour to entertain troops and sell war 
bonds. The industry made propaganda and training films. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops and war workers hungered for entertainment, and Hollywood  
produced glitzy musicals and raucous comedies, as well as films 
like ``Wake Island'' and ``30 Seconds Over Tokyo,'' depicting 
Americans' valor in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the people's war. It is our war. We are the  
fighters,'' Henry Wilcoxon says in ``Mrs. Miniver'' in 1942. 
``Fight it, then. Fight it with all that is in us, and may God 
defend the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	War's end brought vast change in Hollywood, as in so many areas  
of life. The year 1948 marked the beginning of the end for the 
studio system. 
</P>
<P>
	In that year, film exhibitors began to notice that their  
theaters were empty on Tuesday nights. Why? People were staying 
home to watch Milton Berle on television. Over time, as TV assumed 
its dominant place in entertainment, movie theaters across the 
nation closed, especially the downtown palaces erected during the 
lush years. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping to speed this trend was the government's decision that  
the film giants constituted a monopoly, controlling production, 
distribution and exhibition of movies. They were ordered to get rid 
of one of those functions, and chose to sell off their theater 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting leaner times saw studios auction off real estate,  
costumes and props. Film libraries were sold to TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Striving to innovate, companies introduced wide-screen  
techniques such as Cinerama, CinemaScope, even 3-D movies (One 
movie poster gushed: ``Jane Russell in 3-D -- this film will knock 
BOTH your eyes out!'') But audiences complained the glasses 
required to achieve three dimensions gave them headaches, and the 
fad passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Hollywood innovation -- animation -- flowered in the  
century's middle years. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney's characters, starting with Mickey Mouse who made  
his talkie debut in 1928's ``Steamboat Willie,'' created a genre 
along with an entertainment empire. From classic features such as 
``Snow White'' and ``Bambi,'' with their lush depictions of golden 
good and fiery evil, to modern fables like ``The Lion King,'' often 
carried by Oscar-winning songs, Disney introduced children by the 
millions to the magic of movies. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't all, folks. If Disney's cartoons could be  
strait-laced, Warner Bros. offered saucier and often more 
sophisticated fare from that ``qwazy wabbit'' Bugs Bunny and his 
pals, many given voice by Mel Blanc. Later animators didn't even 
aim first at young children: Witness features like ``Who Framed 
Roger Rabbit?'' and TV series like ``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mid-century brought a darker time, too, as a Cold War chill  
swept through 1950s Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist  
Party?'' Those words uttered by Red-hunting congressmen still haunt 
American filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of writers, directors and actors had joined the Communist  
Party, some briefly, in the radical 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refused to testify and went to prison. Others acknowledged  
their membership and named names. Anti-communist film leaders, such 
as Screen Actors Guild President Ronald Reagan, helped supply the 
FBI with names of suspected party members. 
</P>
<P>
	The studios blacklisted suspects, denying them work. The  
blacklist lasted for 15 years, ruining many lives, and bitterness 
remains today. Many protested when a special Oscar was given this 
year to director Elia Kazan, (``On the Waterfront,'' ``A Streetcar 
Named Desire'') who had long been shunned by the Hollywood 
establishment for naming names. 
</P>
<P>
	Postwar American filmmakers began to feel creative competition  
from abroad. The neorealism of Rossellini, Antonioni, De Sica, 
Fellini and other Italians electrified audiences and critics with 
their raw studies of the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Truffaut, Vadim, Godard, Chabrol and other French directors in  
the late 1950s brought forth the New Wave. Their films were 
intensely personal, and could deal explicitly with nudity and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Jack Valenti, new head of the producers association,  
persuaded the company heads to dump the Hays Production Code -- 
which had frowned on Mae West's wiggle, outlawed words like 
``virgin'' and initially held up ``Gone With the Wind'' because of 
Gable's line, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the producers adopted a rating system. A flood of sexy  
movies ensued. The X-rated ``Midnight Cowboy'' even won an Academy 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consider a period of about two decades starting in the  
early 1960s to be a golden age for American and British 
moviemaking. Among highlights: 
</P>
<P>
	``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Tom  
Jones,'' ``Mary Poppins,'' ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' ``The 
Pawnbroker,'' ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' ``The Graduate,'' 
``A Man for All Seasons,'' ``The Sting,'' ``Two for the Road,'' 
``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``The Lion 
in Winter,'' ``Planet of the Apes,'' ``They Shoot Horses, Don't 
They?'' ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Patton,'' ``The Last Picture Show,'' ``The 
Godfather,'' ``Sounder,'' ``Deliverance,'' ``American Graffiti,'' 
``Nashville,'' ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Star Wars,'' ``Alien,'' ``Raging 
Bull,'' ``The Deer Hunter'' and ``Apocalypse Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, as teen-age Baby Boomers experimented with drugs and  
sexual liberation and staged campus protests against the war in 
Vietnam, ``Easy Rider'' portrayed the counterculture -- through a 
pair of hippie bikers on the road -- and showed it could be 
profitable. The movie, directed by Dennis Hopper and produced by 
Peter Fonda, cost less than $400,000 and grossed $40 million 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio bosses decided there was a youth market out there, and a  
new generation of actors, writers and directors emerged to 
revitalize movies for this audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Spielberg and George Lucas stood out. With ``Jaws''  
(1975), Spielberg began his string of blockbusters. ``Star Wars'' 
(1977) established Lucas' genius for applying special effects to 
adventure. Together they created the hugely successful Indiana 
Jones trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hollywood's century wound down, industry economics shifted  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major studios struggled. MGM, which once boasted ``more  
stars than there are in the heavens,'' sold its historic Culver 
City lot as it tried to survive. Nearly defunct, United Artists 
folded into the newly diminished MGM. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studios were snapped up by international corporations.  
Japan's Matsushita bought MCA/Universal and later sold it to the 
Seagram Co. Sony acquired Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures. Viacom 
absorbed Paramount, and Warner Bros. merged with Time Inc. 
Publisher Rupert Murdoch took over 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses keep climbing. The average production cost of a movie  
today is $52 million. On the revenue side, videocassette sales now 
add millions, along with ticket sales abroad. ``Titanic'' alone 
earned $1 billion, though that box office reflected some adolescent 
girls' dozen or more trips to see Leonardo DiCaprio. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether in a love story like ``Titanic'' or an adventure like  
the latest installment of the ``Star Wars'' epic, a ``prequel'' 
that uses cutting-edge technology to recast the cliffhangers of 
early filmmaking, Hollywood still relies on its time-tested 
alchemy: turning bright flickers of light and imagination into 
gold.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A list of the 25 most significant stars and  
star pairings of the century, chosen by Associated Press 
entertainment writers and editors for their contributions to the 
art and lore of the American motion picture: 
</P>
<P>
	-- CHARLIE CHAPLIN: The first great international movie star, a  
comedian whose artistry remains timeless. He and Buster Keaton 
defined screen comedy for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MARY PICKFORD: She was called America's Sweetheart, but her  
sentimental films captured the world. 
</P>
<P>
	-- LILLIAN GISH: D.W. Griffith's favorite actress, she starred in  
his greatest films as well as others she produced. 
</P>
<P>
	-- DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS: A superb athlete with breathtaking stunts,  
he joined his wife, Mary Pickford, and Chaplin to form United 
Artists. With Erroll Flynn, he created the role of swashbuckling 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
	-- RUDOLPH VALENTINO: Women swooned over the first film matinee  
idol. His death at 31 contributed to his legend. 
</P>
<P>
	-- GRETA GARBO: She combined brooding drama and offscreen  
remoteness to create an aura of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	-- STAN LAUREL and OLIVER HARDY: The greatest comedy team, with  
perfect slapstick timing and a wonderfully bumbling sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
	-- CLARK GABLE: His manly looks and unquestioned authority made  
him the No. 1 screen hero for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JAMES CAGNEY: His vitality and machine-gun delivery captured  
the tempo of the gangster era. He hoofed his way to an Oscar as 
George M. Cohan. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JUDY GARLAND: If Garbo concealed; Garland revealed. One of the  
great screen show-stoppers and heartbreakers, in song, drama and 
comedy. A generation later, Barbra Streisand continued that 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	-- CARY GRANT: Who could have imagined that a former vaudeville  
acrobat named Archie Leach would become the ace practitioner of 
high comedy? 
</P>
<P>
	-- KATHARINE HEPBURN and SPENCER TRACY: Her idiosyncratic manner  
and Yankee briskness bolstered a long career that earned her a 
record four Oscars. He brought naturalness to the screen, often in 
sophisticated sparring with Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	-- FRED ASTAIRE and GINGER ROGERS: As Hepburn once said: ``Fred  
gives Ginger class, and she gives him sex appeal.'' The 
incomparable musical team. 
</P>
<P>
	-- BETTE DAVIS: An intelligent actress with a wide emotional  
range, her screen presence was electrifying. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SHIRLEY TEMPLE: A little girl's sunny optimism captivated the  
Depression generation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- HUMPHREY BOGART and LAUREN BACALL: He was a true original and  
an early portrayer of the anti-hero whose acting skill was little 
recognized until later in his career. Slender, stylish, cynical and 
smoky-voiced, she was his leading lady onscreen and off. They were 
married from 1945 until his death in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JOHN WAYNE: Larger than life on and off the screen, he became  
the epitome of the valiant frontiersman in a series of classic 
westerns. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JAMES STEWART: The quintessential American hero who could play  
a surprising range of roles. Except villains. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MARLON BRANDO: A student of the Method at the Actors Studio,  
his seemingly impromptu style influenced a generation of actors. 
With Laurence Olivier, one of the screen's greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MARILYN MONROE: Blazing across the sky like a comet, she  
redefined sex appeal, then disappeared before she could prove her 
worth as an actress. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SIDNEY POITIER: The first black actor to win an Oscar (Hattie  
McDaniel was the first black actress to do so), he destroyed 
Hollywood stereotypes by playing normal black Americans with 
dignity and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JACK NICHOLSON: His sly cynicism fitted perfectly into an era  
of disillusion. With Robert De Niro, one of the two great actors of 
the late 20th century, screen descendants of Brando. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MERYL STREEP: Like Nicholson, she has earned 11 Academy  
nominations and two Oscars. Her powerful performances were notable 
at a time when worthy roles for women were in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: His appeal defines international  
superstar; he and Sylvester Stallone were the first great high-tech 
action heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MICKEY MOUSE: A true star though only celluloid, he is the  
timeless original of a genre, animation, that won hearts young and 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	These 25 films are among the greatest movies every made. The  
alphabetical list was composed by movie reviewers of The Associated 
Press: 

</P>
<P>
	``THE AFRICAN QUEEN'' (1951): Directed by John Huston, this film  
has it all: exceptional performances by Katharine Hepburn and 
Humphrey Bogart; beautiful photography; romance, adventure, 
politics and humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``ALL ABOUT EVE'' (1950): A witty, caustic and brilliantly  
written backstage look at American theater. Great performances all 
around from Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, 
George Sanders, Hugh Marlowe and Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe has 
a cameo. 
</P>
<P>
	``THE BICYCLE THIEF'' (1948): Vittorio De Sica's simple and  
affecting tale of a man whose job depends on his bicycle, is one of 
the best examples of Italian neorealism. Grainy black and white 
gives the movie the feel of a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``CASABLANCA'' (1942): We'll always have Paris, and ``As Time  
Goes By'' will never fade. Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman. Sydney 
Greenstreet. Claude Rains. Paul Henreid. Peter Lorre. Dooley 
Wilson. War. Nazis. Love. Honor. Valor. 
</P>
<P>
	``CITIZEN KANE'' (1941): Orson Welles' masterpiece employed  
outstanding film techniques such as lifelike ``deep focus'' and 
quick cuts, and had the stunning cinematography of Gregg Toland. 
</P>
<P>
	``DUCK SOUP'' (1933): Incredible satire. The Marx Brothers at  
their best: Check out the mirror scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``THE GODFATHER'' (1972): Francis Ford Coppola's masterful epic  
about a Mafia family. Brilliantly acted, filmed and directed. The 
Corleone family saga continues in the equally excellent ``The 
Godfather, Part II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``GONE WITH THE WIND'' (1939): Scarlett and Rhett. Prissy and  
Mammy. Melanie and Ashley. 'Nuff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``THE GRADUATE'' (1967): A beautifully crafted comedy from Mike  
Nichols that tweaked the generation gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``THE GRAND ILLUSION'' (1937): A lyrical and eloquent film from  
Jean Renoir, that goes beyond an exploration of war to embrace 
themes of class and character. 
</P>
<P>
	``GREAT EXPECTATIONS'' (1946): David Lean's exceptional  
translation of the Dickens novel. A stunning blend of characters, 
story, place and time, rich in detail and haunting images. 
</P>
<P>
	``HIGH NOON'' (1952): Intense, psychological Western with a  
peppy theme song from Tex Ritter, ``Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My 
Darlin','' and a mesmerizing performance by Gary Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	``HIS GIRL FRIDAY'' (1940): Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in  
the smartest of the newspaper movies, Howard Hawks' snappy remake 
of ``The Front Page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``LAWRENCE OF ARABIA'' (1962): Another David Lean masterwork.  
Who can forget the scene that introduces Omar Sharif to the film: A 
dot on the desert horizon grows larger and larger until it becomes 
a man on a thundering horse, his Bedouin robes fiercely flapping in 
the breeze. Great cinematography and thrilling performances, led by 
Peter O'Toole. 
</P>
<P>
	``M'' (1931): Fritz Lang's early talkie is a terrifying tale  
about a child killer. Shadow and light were never used more 
memorably. Peter Lorre's character, trapped by a mob, screams over 
and over, ``I can't help myself!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``METROPOLIS'' (1926): A silent film fantasy by Fritz Lang set  
in the future, with incredible art direction and scenery. The 
movie's many admirers included a then-obscure demagogue named Adolf 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	``PATHS OF GLORY'' (1957): Stanley Kubrick examines military  
structure. With ``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' one of the most 
powerful antiwar movies. Sickening battle scenes. Strong 
performances from Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker and George Macready. 
</P>
<P>
	``POTEMKIN'' (1925): A Sergei Eisenstein film that runs just  
over an hour about the Russian upheaval in 1905. The Odessa steps 
sequence was copied by Brian De Palma in ``The Untouchables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``PSYCHO'' (1960): An icon of horror. Alfred Hitchcock draws us  
into the dark Bates Motel (every room with shower), run by Anthony 
Perkins, cold as a knife blade. Bernard Herrmann's score adds 
excruciating tension. 
</P>
<P>
	``SHERLOCK JR.'' (1924): Long before Woody Allen's ``Purple Rose  
of Cairo,'' Buster Keaton starred as a movie projectionist who 
steps into the screen of a film and interacts with the characters. 
A brilliantly maneuvered silent film. 
</P>
<P>
	``SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS'' (1937): The first animated  
feature, Walt Disney's lambent take on a fairy tale. Even if you 
can't name all the dwarfs, you still remember their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOME LIKE IT HOT'' (1959): Musicians Jack Lemmon and Tony  
Curtis, witnesses to a mob hit, flee by joining an all-female band. 
This show is anything but a drag, especially when Marilyn Monroe 
appears. 
</P>
<P>
	``STAR WARS'' (1977): Talk about a hip ``Flash Gordon.'' High  
tech cliffhangers, fun, adventure, cool imagination and very 
special effects from George Lucas' magic kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY'' (1968): Arthur C. Clarke wrote the  
screenplay (from his own book) for Stanley Kubrick's 
genre-shattering alien film. Out-of-this-world special effects won 
an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	``THE WIZARD OF OZ'' (1939): A Kansas cyclone spins Judy Garland  
over the rainbow to a magic world that only reminds her, ``There's 
no place like home.'' Unforgettable turns by Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger, 
Jack Haley and Margaret Hamilton as the quintessential witch.

<HEADLINE> Arena Chairman Meets With Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- He flew to New York, smoked Cuban cigars  
with Michael Jordan and told him that buying into the Charlotte 
Hornets would be good for the team, good for the city and good for 
the prospects of a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Then John Fennebresque, the head of the New Arena Committee,  
flew home to criticism from people who wondered why he tried to 
sell Jordan on Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Jordan that I was there for the city,'' Fennebresque  
said. ``That's why I was there. I wanted to keep the Hornets in 
Charlotte. We needed a new arena to be uptown and Michael Jordan's 
involvement as a 50 percent owner could make the job a whole lot 
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others believe he should have stayed at home March 19.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was stupid, wrong, and ridiculous,'' said Al Rousso,  
at-large City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
	Rousso objects to spending public money to promote ``a private  
multimillionaire's enterprise.'' He's angry that Fennebresque, 
chairman of a council-appointed committee, agreed to meet privately 
with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fennebresque's allies say that politicians and the public should  
be grateful that he is channeling his energy and talent into the 
arena project. Fennebresque, they say, makes things happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``John is my lawyer,'' said Hugh McColl Jr., chairman and chief  
executive of Bank of America. ``I could have chosen anyone. He gets 
things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fennebresque said the meeting was merely advisory. ``I was not  
negotiating with Michael Jordan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets owner George Shinn has said that his talks with Jordan  
are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Would Fennebresque meet with Jordan again?  
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt a further meeting would be as confidential as this one  
was,'' he said. ``Then I can tell all the people in politics that 
they can be jealous right from the start.''

<HEADLINE> Freehold Suspends 3 Harness Racers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The nation's leading harness driver and  
two other top drivers at Freehold Raceway have been suspended for 
six months and fined $500 each as a result of ``unsatisfactory'' 
performances last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Racing Commission handed down the penalties  
Saturday against George Brennan, the leading driver in North 
America, and Jim Morrill Jr. and Howard Parker, ``due to a lack of 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission launched an investigation after a March 10 race  
generated ``suspicious'' wagering payoffs, officials said. In that 
race, Brennan finished last (eighth) on My Dream Come True, the 2-1 
second choice. Parker on Bo Knows Matt (7-1) finished seventh, and 
Morrill was fifth on Neirda No, the 7-2 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting trifecta paid only $92.50 although the No. 1  
horse, World Class Storm, an 8-1 shot, won the race and the No. 3 
horse, Letsgo Sparkle, a 29-1 shot, finished third. The favorite, 
the No. 2 horse, The Shawnster, also 2-1, was second. The 1-2 
exacta paid $26.40 although the winner returned $19. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges learned that one bettor wagered heavily on the 1-2  
exacta and the 1-2-3 trifecta. An investigation revealed that the 
bettor was Parker's chauffeur, who transported him from Freehold to 
the Meadowlands daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The bettor earned $24,000 for his wagers, but has been unable to  
collect $6,000 because the judges ordered the pari-mutuel windows 
closed when they became suspicious of the payouts. The bettor, who 
was not identified, has hired an attorney to have the winnings 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan insisted on Sunday in a telephone interview with The  
Associated Press that all he did was follow the race instructions 
given him by Joe Krajczewski, the trainer of My Dream Come True. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me to race from behind, to take him off the gate and  
that's exactly what I did,'' Brennan said. ``I do it 20 times a 
day. For those two minutes those people are my employers, and it's 
my job to do what they say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan said he was asked to take a polygraph test by state  
officials and he said it showed he answered truthfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reputation is on the line,'' Brennan said. ``I'm going to  
try to (fight). It's unfortunate. I'm the leading driver at 
Freehold, one of the leaders at the Meadowlands and the leading 
driver in North America. I just don't feel too good about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan plans to discuss the suspension and a possible appeal on  
Monday with Joe Faraldo, a New York City-based attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, 31, of Howell, is Freehold's leading driver with 94  
victories and the national leader with 171. Morrill, 34, of 
Freehold, is fourth at Freehold with 51 victories, and Parker, 40, 
of Freehold, fifth with 46. All three are in the top 10 in the 
Meadowlands' driver standings. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties extend to Garden State Park, which like Freehold  
is owned by Pennwood Racing Inc. Brennan, Morrill and Parker will 
not be allowed at Freehold or Garden State. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also ordered that the trio face a year of  
probation when they return in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker and Morrill were not available to comment on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bob Dylan Concert Ticket Sales Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- Tickets to Bob Dylan's upcoming concert in  
the city where he was born aren't exactly moving like a rolling 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October's concert by the 1960s folk-rock poet at the Duluth  
Entertainment Convention Center arena was his first major gig ever 
in his hometown. Fans snapped up tickets in less than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, promoters put 25,000 tickets for Dylan's July 3  
concert with Paul Simon on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday, and sold 5,000 
in the first 25 minutes. But a half-hour later, the arena's lobby 
was nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans did camp out, but nothing like the 7,700 who lined up  
early to buy tickets for the October show, said Craig Samborski, 
the arena's entertainment director. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth and his family  
moved to nearby Hibbing when he was 6. Past attempts to stage a 
concert here had all fallen through.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Finally Hits Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Seems like old times -- Sammy Sosa and Mark  
McGwire homering on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa ended a 1-for-20 slump with a 441-foot homer to center  
field in the ninth inning of the Chicago Cubs' 9-6 loss to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer -- Sosa's first since he hit No. 66 on Sept. 25 in  
Houston -- came in the Cubs' sixth game of the season. Before 
homering, Sosa was 0-for-10 with five strikeouts during the 
Pirates' three-game weekend sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit five homers in the final three days last season  
to edge Sosa 70-66 and set the record, hit his second of the season 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah? That's good,'' Sosa said. ``For me, I don't worry  
about it anymore. Last year is over, we are in 1999 now. I cannot 
come down here every day thinking about 1998, it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit a Mike Williams fastball on a 0-1 pitch into the  
netting in Three Rivers Stadium's lower center-field seats. In his 
first four plate appearances Sunday, Sosa was 0-for-3 with two 
strikeouts and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Slow starts are nothing new for Sosa, who hit only one homer in  
the Cubs' first 10 games last season. He hit 65 in their final 153 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pitching me more carefully this year than ever,'' Sosa  
said. ``It feels great to get the first one. I was looking for 
anything up there. The home run came and I appreciate it, but I was 
looking for a base hit, anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa is hitting only .095, but manager Jim Riggleman expects the  
National League MVP to get untracked soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who led the majors with 12 homers during spring training,  
and put on a show during batting practice Sunday, at one point 
hitting five straight long home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hit a couple of (long fly balls) to right field yesterday,  
and that usually means good things are going to happen,'' Riggleman 
said. ``Sammy Sosa's going to have another great year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa drew a nice ovation after homering, in part because the  
solo shot didn't threaten the hometown Pirates' victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great the fans haven't forgotten me yet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby Preps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Not long after trainer Nick Zito watched Wondertross finish  
sixth in Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland, he was shouting, ``Go, 
Adonis, go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Zito listening to the live call, Adonis won the Wood  
Memorial on Saturday at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with Adonis and disappointed with Wondertross,''  
Zito said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will go after his third Kentucky victory -- following Strike  
the Gold (1991) and Go for Gin (1994) -- with at least Adonis and 
Stephen Go Even, winner of the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes on 
March 27 at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito said Wondertross developed a breathing problem in finishing  
sixth in the Blue Grass won by Menifee and his Derby status was yet 
to be determined 
</P>
<P>
	While Menifee and at least the next four finishers in the  
eight-horse Toyota Blue Grass -- Cat Thief, Vicar, Kimberlite Pipe 
and Lemon Drop Kid -- are headed for the Derby on May 1, so is 
Valhol, who had not won a race until the Arkansas Derby on Saturday 
at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kentucky Derby is the crown jewel of all of them,'' said  
Valhol's owner, James Jackson, who has raced claiming horses for 
years. ``It's breathtaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Racing for only the third time, all this year, Valhol won the  
Arkansas Derby by 4 1-2 lengths over Certain and paid a winning 
mutuel of $62,80. Torrid Sand finished third in a field of seven 
3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Day, who had ridden Cat Thief and Arkansas Derby and Answer  
Lively, fifth in the Arkansas Derby, dodged a lot of 
second-guessing for his decision to ride Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was the colt's fourth victory in five career starts,  
he had finished second in the Tampa Bay Derby in his previous 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	About his choice to ride Menifee ($17.40) in his 1 1-4-length  
victory over Cat Thief, Day said, ``When it was all said and done, 
we thought this horse had a lot of room for improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He made the choice to go with Menifee,'' Arthur Hancock III,  
breeder and co-owner of Menifee, said of Day's decision. ``Good 
choice, Pat.'' 
</P>

	Adonis ($8.40) ran the fourth fastest Wood Memorial, covering 1  
1-8 miles in 1:47 3-5, two-fifths of second off the stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew Adonis was a good horse,'' owner Ernie Paragallo  
said. ``Adonis is bred to run a mile and a quarter or a mile and a 
half (the distance of the Belmont Stakes).''

<P>
	Adonis, wearing blinkers for the first time at the suggestion of  
jockey Jorge Chavez, won the Wood by two lengths over Best of Luck 
for his third victory in his last four races. Cliquot finished 
third in the 11-horse field.

<HEADLINE> Drug Aids in Hepatitis B Cirrhosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome PLC today released new data  
indicating its drug Zeffix may help prevent chronic hepatitis B 
sufferers from developing cirrhosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The data from three large clinical studies showed a smaller  
proportion of chronic hepatitis B patients treated with Zeffix 
progressed to cirrhosis, or liver scarring, compared with those 
treated with placebo or interferon-alpha. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were presented at the annual meeting of the European  
Association for the Study of the Liver in Naples, and supported by 
other data showing additional Zeffix benefits, Glaxo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 1.8 percent of Zeffix-treated patients progressed to  
cirrhosis, compared with 7.1 percent placebo-treated patients and 
9.5 percent of those treated with interferon-alpha. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo said the results showed a continued increase in the  
incidence of e-antigen seroconversion -- an immune response to the 
virus that is thought to predict long-lasting remission of the 
disease -- and a continued reduction in levels of viral replication. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeffix is available in the Philippines, Canada and the U.S. and  
approved in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Pakistan and New Zealand. 
Regulatory applications have been made in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis B is a potentially fatal liver disease -- the  
ninth-most common killer worldwide. About 350 million people are 
long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus and nearly one-third 
are expected to develop progressive inflammation of the liver, 
leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, therapies for chronic hepatitis B were limited to  
interferons, which are injected and can lead to unpleasant side 
effects.

<HEADLINE> Good Samaritan Attacked in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDOVER, Mass. (AP) -- A man who tried to help a motorist whose  
truck had rolled was punched in the jaw by the accident victim, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought maybe he was in shock,'' said John DeFronzo, 33. ``I  
didn't know how to take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFronzo said he saw the accident on Interstate 495 on Friday  
and stopped to help the driver, who apparently had lost control of 
his Chevy pickup truck and rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFronzo said when he initially approached 19-year-old Robert  
Lebel, the accident victim punched him in the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebel then allegedly warned DeFronzo and other motorists to stay  
back and then came after DeFronzo with a tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
	He then stole the pickup truck of another man who had stopped to  
help, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Lebel after finding him watching television in  
the living room of a house he allegedly had broken into. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebel faces charges that include assault and battery with a  
dangerous weapon and carjacking.

<HEADLINE> Ford Accepts Vietnam Rememberance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Former President Gerald Ford recalls  
April 1975 as the toughest month in his presidency, but is 
gratefully accepting a symbol of those days for his namesake 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The staircase from the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam that was climbed  
by hundreds of evacuees fleeing the war-torn nation in 1975 now 
stands as a permanent exhibit at the lobby of the Ford Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's a monument of hope and not despair for it  
symbolizes man's undying desire to be free,'' Ford said at 
Saturday's opening of ``The American Century'' exhibit at the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy in what is now Ho Chi Minh City has been razed. The  
United States intends to build a new consular office in its place. 
Only the 18 metal steps from the sixth-floor staircase remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides American personnel and military, more than 6,000  
refugees were airlifted from the rooftops of the embassy compound 
in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit includes Charles Lindbergh's flight suit, FDR's  
wheelchair, Truman's briefcase, the Wright brothers' stopwatch, a 
Ku Klux Klan robe and the safety plug from the atomic bomb that 
leveled Nagasaki.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays put Homer Bush on the  
15-day disabled list today with a finger injury that could keep him 
sidelined up to a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, obtained from the New York Yankees in the Roger Clemens

<HEADLINE> Sosa Glad To Be at Wrigley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- They've spruced up Wrigley Field, given the  
scoreboard and flagpole a touch of paint, replaced some old seats 
with more comfortable ones and erected a statute outside the old 
ballpark in memory of Harry Caray. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar ivy may still be dead-of-winter brown and the air  
will be plenty chilly when the Chicago Cubs open their home season 
Monday against the Cincinnati Reds, but no one will be happier to 
return to ``The Friendly Confines'' than struggling Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be good not only for me but for everybody,'' Sosa  
said, looking to his first home appearance since winning the 1998 
National League MVP. ``Opening day is always big. It's going to be 
fun to go back there. Even though we've been playing for a week, 
home is home. That's always special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa will sprint from the third-base dugout just before the  
first pitch, head straight to the right-field bleachers and then 
veer off to the left at the last second like a jet. The fans will 
cheer, bow and chant his name, just before he blows his familiar 
kiss and then pitter-patters his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	What the bleacher bums will really be looking for -- besides a  
nine-inning excuse to have fun -- is a Sosa homer. And so far in 
1999, they have not been plentiful, especially after his 
unforgettable 66-homer season a year ago and his 12-homer spring. 
Sosa finally hit his first homer Sunday against the Pirates, but is 
just 2-for-21 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm swinging much better. It's going to come,'' Sosa said as  
the Cubs played in Pittsburgh before heading home. ``I never get 
down on myself. I've been here before. This isn't the first time it 
happened to me. I got 600 at-bats to catch up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April has never been a big month for Sosa. After his homer  
Sunday, he'd hit 29 of his 274 career homers in the season's first 
month. Last year he set a major league record with 20 in June, 
seven more than he had in April and May combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit 35 homers last season at Wrigley and 31 on the road.  
But he actually batted higher (.315 to .300) and had more RBIs 
(81-to-77) away from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he will be the center of attention Monday and that's how  
he likes it.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Says Retirement is Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hobbling through the dugout using a fungo bat as  
a cane, Don Zimmer insisted he was serious: He will walk away from 
a half-century in baseball if his bum right knee does not get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do it,'' the New York Yankees interim manager said  
before Sunday's 11-2 win over Detroit. ``This is no fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, 68, returned this year for his fourth straight season as  
manager Joe Torre's bench coach. He had arthroscopic surgery in 
early March to repair torn cartilage, but the pain is still so bad 
that he's considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never gone through anything like this,'' he said. ``I've  
got to think about something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer was hoping a cortisone shot would ease the discomfort,  
though he admitted that might help for only 10 days or so. As it 
is, he's been taking Tylenol on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I wake up and think it's going to get better, and it  
doesn't get any better,'' he said. ``If I have to have a new knee, 
a plastic knee, I'd do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said only his loyalty to Torre and the Yankees has kept  
him in place. He became manager after Torre was diagnosed with 
prostate cancer in mid-March, and is certain his knee did not have 
time to heal before he took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asked to do a job,'' Zimmer said. ``Somebody has to make  
decisions, and Joe wanted me to do it. George (Steinbrenner) wanted 
me to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre had surgery last month, and hopes to return by early May.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming back if he's going to retire,'' Torre joked  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Zimmer has been limping around. He no longer  
watches batting practice from behind second base, as he likes to 
do, because it's too hard to get out there and back. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer has been part of the baseball scene since he began  
playing pro ball in 1949. A former All-Star infielder, coach and 
manager, Popeye has been all over the majors and minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even with the World Series champions off to a 5-1 start and  
looking as strong as ever, Zimmer is adamant that he would leave if 
the pain does not go away. 
</P>
<P>
	And remember, Zimmer has simply called it quits before.  
</P>
<P>
	On June 6, 1995, while he was a bench coach for the Colorado  
Rockies, he snuck up behind manager Don Baylor in the fifth inning 
of a game against St. Louis, whispered ``Good luck the rest of the 
way,'' and walked out of Coors Field into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Late that year, Torre asked him to be the Yankees' bench coach  
and Zimmer eagerly accepted. His bad knee, though, has him thinking 
this could be the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'd do, but I can't go on like this,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Badgers' Dayne Not in Scrimmage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin held a full-contact scrimmage  
without tailback Ron Dayne, who has a history of getting injured in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But if coach Barry Alvarez hoped to protect Dayne from the  
injury jinx by keeping his star running back on the sidelines 
yesterday, Dayne was ready to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go harder in practice because I don't have a chance  
to scrimmage,'' he said. ``I feel like I have to practice harder 
just to let the younger guys and the guys that don't know that I'm 
still there, that I'm doing everything with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend scrimmage was the first of the spring training camp  
for the Badgers, who will have Dayne for his senior year next 
season because he chose not to enter next weekend's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne, who has set 34 school records, hopes to set Big Ten and  
NCAA career records for rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 5,091 yards and needs 499 to pass Archie Griffin for  
first place on the all-time Big Ten list. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the NCAA does not recognize bowl games in its  
record-keeping, it has Dayne for 4,563 yards. That puts him 1,716 
behind Ricky Williams of Texas, who had 2,124 yards last season en 
route to the Heisman Trophy and a career total of 6,279 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne says surpassing Williams was a big motivation for spending  
another year at Wisconsin rather than going pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get the record because I came back and it's  
something to shoot for,'' Dayne said. ``It will make me play 
harder.''

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Cameroon 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAUCHI, Nigeria (AP) -- The United States, behind two goals from  
Taylor Twellman, beat Cameroon 3-1 on today to advance to the 
second round of the FIFA World Youth Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Bocanegra had the other goal for the Americans, who play  
Spain on Thursday in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people are shocked by how well we have played, but we  
haven't shocked ourselves,'' midfielder Steve Cherundolo said. ``We 
know we are a good team and today we proved it by beating a another 
very good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States finished with six points in Group E, as did  
Japan and Cameroon, all with 2-1 records in the Under-20 
tournament. With the tie broken by goal difference, Japan finished 
first, the Americans second and Cameroon third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to sit back and watch your team when they are  
playing well,'' U.S. coach Sigi Schmid said. ``Today we played 
well, and tomorrow we'll go back to work so we'll play well in the 
second round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans opened the scoring in the 39th minute. Twelman,  
with only goalkeeper Bayiha Ndjama to beat, took a pass from Lee 
Morrison and fired in a low shot from 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 58th minute, Bocanegra scored on a header. Francisco  
Gomez lobbed a free kick from the right edge of the penalty area, 
and Nick Garcia headed it to Bocanegra. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameroon scored in the 64th minute when Francis Kioyo drove a  
free kick from just inside the area through the defensive wall and 
beneath diving goalkeeper Tim Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	Twellman sealed the victory in the 80th minute when he burst  
into the box and shot past Ndjama. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were big and physical, as you can see from his ice bag on  
my head,'' Twellman said. ``We knew this going into the game, and 
dealt with it very well, I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four teams divided into six groups started the 52-game  
tournament on April 3. The final is April 24 in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigerian fans and riot police using whips or bamboolike canes  
clashed overnight in Lagos following Nigeria's 2-1 loss to 
Paraguay, it was reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigerian coach Tunde Disu was fired within an hour after the  
game and received a police escort when leaving the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence was reported in several areas of the sprawling port  
city throughout the night, the newspaper Thisday said. There were 
no reports of arrests or details on the number injured.

<HEADLINE> FAA Confident in Y2K Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Convair Three-Niner approaches the runway at  
Denver International Airport, and also an imaginary boundary: the 
dreaded start of Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	It is moments before midnight, in a crucial test of the Federal  
Aviation Administration's computer system. The clocks in the 
airport control center are about to turn from Dec. 31, 1999, to 
Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The controller calls out, ``Time is one minute prior to entering  
the new millennium in our test systems. How do you read this 
transmission?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the Convair replies: ``Loud and clear, and if we  
disappear off the screen, it means we went into the next 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A minute later, after the clocks hit Jan. 1, 2000, and the plane  
remains a radar blip on approach to Runway 16, the controller calls 
back, ``You are now flying in the Year 2000 in our test system. How 
do you read this transmission?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reply: ``It's loud and clear. It went right through the  
sound barrier very nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it went late Saturday and early Sunday, as the FAA tested its  
Y2K computer fixes. Checked were systems that control radar screens 
and radio transmissions, ground traffic, airport weather reports 
and the status of landing lights and remote radio beacons. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines also was on hand, testing its own Y2K fixes. The  
carrier, the nation's largest, beamed imaginary Year 2000 flight 
plans from its headquarters in Chicago to Gate B-41 at Denver 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials held a dress rehearsal March 27 and conducted  
lesser drills on three other occasions. But the weekend test was 
the first one open to reporters. It was intended to bolster public 
confidence in the nation's aviation system as the century crossover 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Official results will be released Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who stayed up well past 2 a.m. to  
watch the four-hour test, was pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, you had to watch the clock to be aware it was  
changing,'' Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Long, head of the FAA's Y2K program, told agency workers  
before the test: ``Our success will be gauged by the fact that 
nothing will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way many older computers are programmed, some  
software interprets years in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 
1999. The concern is that unless software is modified, computers in 
various industries will malfunction when the calendar changes from 
``99'' to ``00,'' which may be interpreted as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a special concern in aviation, where computers track  
airplanes from takeoff to landing. Some travelers have sworn off 
flying as Dec. 31, 1999, turns to Jan. 1, 2000, fearing planes may 
collide or fall out of the sky because of computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those on hand for this weekend's test was Kenneth Mead,  
inspector general of the Transportation Department. In the past, he 
has been critical about the FAA's preparation for the Year 2000 
changeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to a year ago, I have a much higher confidence  
level,'' Mead said after the test. ``My guess is that a lot of 
attention will shift to airport readiness, international readiness, 
to smaller entities in the air carrier business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mead said he is concerned that parts of Eastern Europe, Africa  
and Asia are not adequately preparing their computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably fly on January 1 in U.S. airspace,'' Mead said,  
``but I'm not going to fly in foreign airspace where there are 
these unknowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, the State Department is expected to release a list of  
countries it suggests avoiding around New Year's because of air 
control computer questions.

<HEADLINE> Attack Suspect Faces Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Only one of the four people initially  
charged in the vicious beating death of gay college student Matthew 
Shepard remains standing as a major prosecution target -- Aaron 
McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	Now prosecutors, armed with damaging statements from McKinney's  
girlfriend and his former co-defendant, are preparing for a summer 
trial that aims to sentence to death the man they say was Shepard's 
chief tormentor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've certainly gone over the facts, the law in the case,''  
prosecutor Cal Rerucha said about McKinney. ``That will definitely 
be a death penalty case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, co-defendant Russell Henderson pleaded guilty and  
avoided a possible death penalty. His and McKinney's girlfriends 
face minor charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, was found  
lying on his back Oct. 7, his hands bound beneath him, his feet 
tied to a fence, blood streaming from an ear and caked on his face. 
He'd been left on the prairie for 18 hours in near-freezing 
temperatures. He died five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a Nov. 19 preliminary hearing pointed toward  
McKinney as the main aggressor, and his statement to police that he 
beat Shepard ``two or three times, probably three times with fists 
and about six times with a pistol'' has been regarded as highly 
damaging to his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But now McKinney's lawyers must also deal with Henderson's  
statement, made after he pleaded guilty to felony murder and 
kidnapping last Monday. He admitted tying Shepard to the fence but 
said he tried to stop the bludgeoning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew looked really bad, so I told him to stop hitting him,  
I think he's had enough,'' he said. McKinney then turned on 
Henderson and struck him in the face with the gun, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of McKinney's attorneys, Dion Custis, said Henderson had  
lied in court, trying to win concurrent life sentences rather than 
the two back-to-back sentences he received -- or lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public needs to realize that this is a 21-year-old facing  
the death penalty, and he would say or do anything to avoid the 
death penalty,'' Custis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Custis nor co-counsel Jason Tangeman would discuss trial  
strategy in detail, but Custis indicated part of it would aim to 
save McKinney from lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Tangeman, ``We always consider a plea bargain in any  
criminal case, whether you're dealing with DUI or a capital case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's lawyers ``have a monumental task'' in overcoming  
Henderson, who might testify against McKinney, said Denver-based 
legal analyst Andrew Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that happened Monday helped the prosecution,'' he  
said. ``Henderson has two life sentences now and is going to spend 
the rest of his life in jail, so it's hard to argue the prosecution 
gave Henderson a great deal in exchange for his testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By cutting a deal with Henderson, prosecutors saved an  
undisclosed portion of the $141,000 his trial would have cost. But 
in McKinney's case, they appear ready to pursue a full trial, now 
scheduled to start Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Henderson plea makes it less likely there will be  
a plea agreement,'' Cohen said. ``If you insisted Henderson get two 
life terms and you think McKinney had a much larger role in the 
murder, then how do you justify giving him a similar sentence?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's hearing shed no new light on the motive behind the  
attack on Shepard or how much Shepard's homosexuality may have 
played a role in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's attorney said it was not a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was targeted because he was believed to have some money,''  
said Wyatt Skaggs. ``That's a very simple motive. It's called 
robbery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Renna, director of community relations for the Gay and  
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said she found that 
explanation implausible. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone's going to rob a person, they hit them over the  
head, take their wallet and leave,'' she said. ``You don't do what 
they did to Matthew for a wallet and a pair of shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha, the prosecutor, who played down the gay issue during  
jury selection for Henderson's trial, said it would likely figure 
prominently in McKinney's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``How excited I am to hear (the answers) I don't know,'' said  
Romaine Patterson, a close friend of Shepard's. ``I think they'll 
be harder to hear than anything. ... It's going to be a pretty ugly 
ordeal.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Opener Big Day for Alomars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Only Albert Belle has been booed louder at  
Jacobs Field than Robbie Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, however, will never again have to feel the wrath of  
Cleveland fans like he did during the 1996 AL playoffs when they 
taunted him for spitting at umpire John Hirschbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer an Oriole or a villain, Alomar is with the Indians  
now, and when he's introduced as Cleveland's new second baseman 
Monday at the home opener, he won't hear a single negative peep. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans in Cleveland are really faithful to their team and  
they have knowledge about the other team,'' Alomar said Sunday in 
Minnesota before the Indians won their fifth straight, 9-8 over the 
Twins. ``Whenever I played there I understood that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' 1999 home opener against Kansas City won't be much  
different from opening day '96, '97 or '98. Jacobs Field, sold out 
for all 81 home dates again this season, will be packed for the 
293rd straight time. And for the fourth straight year a flag 
celebrating an AL Central division title will be raised before the 
first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alomar makes this year's opener a special one -- for the  
Alomars and the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since they played together for the San Diego  
Padres in 1989, Robbie and his brother, Indians' catcher Sandy 
Alomar, are teammates once again. When they take their positions in 
the field before the top of the first Monday, their father, Sandy 
Sr., will be in the crowd watching his boys on the same team again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opening day at home is another chance to play with my brother,  
on the same team and on the same home field,'' Robbie Alomar said. 
``It's going to be special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Alomar's addition gives the Indians a lineup comparable  
to the World Series champion New York Yankees and has Cleveland 
fans believing they will get their first World Series title since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
	After six games, it's easy to see what all the excitement is  
about. The Indians are coming home on a tear, having gone 5-1 on 
their season-opening road trip. Their three-game sweep this weekend 
in Minnesota was their first there since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	They're averaging 9.7 runs per game and lead the AL in virtually  
every offensive category. Of the six starters to face them thus far 
this season, not one has gone beyond 4 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be a little discouraging for an opposing pitcher  
to look at our lineup before a game,'' Richie Sexson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Burba, who using a nasty splitter struck out 10 in just six  
innings against Anaheim last week, will start the opener for 
Cleveland against Kansas City left-hander Jose Rosada. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled,'' Burba said. ``It's nice to get that  
assignment. It'll be a first for me. I'll be excited, but I'll be 
nervous too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burba missed a chance to pitch Cincinnati's home opener last  
season when he was traded by the Reds -- the team he grew up rooting 
for -- to the Indians the night before. He's not worried about a 
similar fate this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year is forgotten,'' he said. ``I'm not looking at this  
start as a makeup for last year. It was just a coincidence, one of 
those things that happens in baseball. I think people made too much 
of my being upset. I don't even think about it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Former Indians pitcher and longtime broadcaster Herb Score,  
seriously injured in a near-fatal car accident last October, will 
throw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... For the second straight 
year, Native American protesters will demonstrate against the 
Indians use of their Chief Wahoo mascot outside the ballpark. Five 
were arrested last season when they attempted to burn Chief Wahoo 
in effigy. Last Friday, those protesters filed a lawsuit against 
Cleveland police claiming their civil rights were violated. ... The 
Royals went 5-1 against the Indians in spring training. ... David 
Justice hasn't played since straining his left calf muscle in the 
season opener. ... Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel, who sat out 
Sunday's game with a sore quadriceps, has No. 14 written on his cap 
in honor of fellow Venezuelan Andres Galarraga. Galarraga is being 
treated for cancer and is expected to miss the year for Atlanta. 
``He's the Big Cat and I'm the Little Cat,'' Vizquel said.

<HEADLINE> One Dies in Black Reunion Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A year after a police shootout marred  
Black College Reunion, two shootings and two stabbings left one 
person dead and three in the hospital Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Grover of Jacksonville, died Sunday night at Halifax  
Medical Center, nursing supervisor Judith Dyke said. Ansie Pierre, 
24, of Miami, was found wounded in the stomach at a nearby motel 
about 100 yards away. He was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting began after an argument about a drink that was  
poured on someone's girlfriend, Daytona Beach Mayor Bud Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, a Daytona Beach woman was stabbed in the  
neck following an argument at the Desert Inn. The victim, 
identified as Shaneta Leshawn Jones, 20, was upgraded from critical 
to stable condition Sunday at Halifax Medical Center. No arrests 
were made, although Davis said a suspect was identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the violence, the host city's mayor from declared the  
weekend a success Sunday. Mayor Bud Asher said the incidents were 
isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to let it spoil the good things that happened  
at BCR,'' Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black College Reunion started in 1984 as a small gathering of  
students from historically black Florida A&AMP;M University in 
Tallahassee and nearby Bethune-Cookman College. It now competes 
with Atlanta's Freaknik as the place to go for a ``black spring 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruising, partying and ogling members of the opposite sex are  
the primary activities of the event, which drew an estimated 
100,000 celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
	A stabbing Saturday in Ormond Beach, about 5 miles northwest of  
Daytona Beach, resulted in the arrest of an Orlando woman, who was 
charged with aggravated assault for allegedly wounding a man from 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Jordan, 21, of Birmingham, Ala., was listed in  
satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
	As of early Sunday, police had made more than 300 arrests, 12  
for firearms possession and related charges. They wrote about 2,400 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 329 arrests were made and 926 citations were written  
over the three-day event. A man was killed and four police officers 
were wounded in a shootout that year.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra in As Pinch Hitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, resting  
a strained left hamstring for the fourth straight game, struck out 
as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning of today's 5-4 loss to the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra hadn't played since Wednesday night's victory over  
Kansas City. But with two outs and one on, he batted against Devil 
Rays closer Roberto Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, who rallied from a 4-0 deficit to tie the game, had  
fallen behind in the eighth on Danny Calyburn's solo homer off 
Derek Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortstop may return to the starting lineup as soon as  
Tuesday's home opener against the Chicago White Sox. He didn't 
second-guess manager Jimy Williams' decision to use him in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked if the opportunity presents itself, could I swing the  
bat? I said sure. I tried to go out there and do a job, try to pick 
the team up. I didn't do it,'' Garciaparra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it was the right thing to do,'' Williams said. ``Hey,  
we're down one run. I sent up a very good hitter. It just didn't 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Actress Tries To Keep Life Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With her newfound fame, Reese Witherspoon is  
learning that it's harder to keep her personal life private. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old star of ``Pleasantville'' and the upcoming film  
``Election'' is pregnant with the child of ``Cruel Intentions'' 
co-star and fiance Ryan Phillippe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really daunting, but I think it would be really spoiled  
of me to sit here and say, `Oh, yeah, I don't want people to know 
anything about my personal life,'' Witherspoon says in Sunday's 
Daily News. ``There are sacrifices you make in this business, and 
some of them are fortunate, and some are unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress thinks both she and Phillippe are ready for grown-up  
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a challenge, something life wanted us to face,''  
she said. ``It really does put your life in perspective and 
suddenly you think no movie could be more important that what I'm 
doing now.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Seeks To Rescue Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A $250 million missile-warning  
satellite that was left stranded in a useless orbit had the Air 
Force scrambling Sunday in an attempt to rescue it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't given up,'' said Patsy Bomhoff, a spokeswoman at  
Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. ``They're working around the 
clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Support Program satellite was launched Friday aboard  
an Air Force Titan rocket. It was the first flight of a Titan IV 
since a spy satellite was destroyed in a $1 billion explosion 
shortly after liftoff last August. 
</P>
<P>
	If the satellite cannot be salvaged, the failed mission will  
have cost taxpayers $682 million, including the rocket cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titan did its job in its long-awaited return to flight. But  
an upper-stage motor apparently malfunctioned and left the 
satellite in a highly lopsided rather than circular orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said the Boeing-built motor separated as  
planned from the satellite seven hours after liftoff, but it was 
unclear whether it fired properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers worked throughout the weekend, trying to  
figure out what went wrong. They were in contact with the satellite 
but unable to determine its condition, Bomhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to get the satellite in a position where they  
can work with it and control it,'' she said. ``They're trying to 
come up with solutions, trying different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was intended for a 22,300-mile-high orbit, where  
it was to have joined other Defense Support Program spacecraft in 
detecting missile and rocket launches as well as nuclear 
detonations. The 2 1/2-ton satellite is equipped with 6,000 infrared 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials insisted before Friday's launch there was no  
rush for the new satellite, even with the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
They said the existing Defense Support Program network is providing 
complete, worldwide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites were instrumental in tracking Scud missiles  
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 19th Defense Support Program satellite built by TRW  
for the Air Force, which has been launching the spacecraft since 
1970. Another DSP satellite isn't scheduled to go up until 
December.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo Braces for Abortion Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- One week after October's sniper killing of  
Dr. Barnett Slepian, a prominent obstetrician who performed 
abortions, abortion opponents said they would target his clinic and 
others with major protests in six months' time. 
</P>
<P>
	Their Operation Save America is now just days away, and hundreds  
of demonstrators are expected to show up outside clinics, 
bookstores and high schools in upstate New York from Buffalo to 
Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think God has chosen Buffalo as a battleground where He's  
going to fight abortion with great strength,'' the Rev. Robert 
Behn, director of Last Call Ministries, said in his announcement 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and national organizers have sent out 60,000 invitations  
and Operation Rescue has encouraged people to ``storm the gates of 
hell'' in Buffalo from April 18 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders say the event also will denounce what they consider  
other ills of society, such as teen sex, pornography and school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Local participants are being encouraged to take a more prayerful  
approach than they did during the raucous clashes of the 1992 
Spring of Life, which resulted in about 625 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no way to know if out-of-towners will follow suit,  
and law enforcement officials are taking no chances. Erie County 
has built a temporary jail in an armory to hold any demonstrators 
who refuse to give their names so they can't be taken before a 
judge to have bail set. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have spent months making plans, studying tactics used at  
other demonstrations and gathering intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would prefer to deter problems,'' Police Commissioner Rocco  
Diina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1992 protests, violence against abortion providers has  
escalated markedly from trespassing and minor altercations to 
clinic bombings and shootings. Besides Slepian, whose Oct. 23 
killing remains unsolved -- although a rifle was found buried on his 
property last week -- eight other doctors have been shot at since 
1993. Two of them died: Dr. David Gunn in 1993 and Dr. John Bayard 
Britton in 1994, both in Pensacola, Fla. Several nurses, 
receptionists and security officers also have been killed or 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blame the violence on restrictions -- such as the 1994  
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act -- which they say keep 
peaceful demonstrators away from clinic doors while prodding the 
more radical abortion opponents into violence. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is seeking even  
stronger restrictions on protesters: buffer zones of up to 60 feet 
from clinic doors as well as limits on the use of megaphones or 
bullhorns. A federal judge is considering the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Some leaders of the 1992 Spring of Life have softened their  
approach, saying it's time to find a new way to deliver their 
message. The Rev. Robert Schenk said the time of blockades and 
linking protesters with chains has passed. 
</P>
<P>
	But there has been no softening of the approach of Operation  
Rescue National, the anti-abortion group which has been promoting 
the demonstrations in Buffalo as ``a flash point for the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The giant of child killing will never come to an end by  
political resolution or building bridges to the enemy's camp,'' a 
January newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the issue, abortion-rights advocates have  
been holding ``clinic defense training'' sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're well-trained and we're ready,'' said Carolyn Taggart,  
who led a recent session.

<HEADLINE> Recounting Lincoln's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the most chilling moment of his crowded  
evening, correspondent Lawrence Gobright walked into the 
flag-draped box at Ford's Theatre and took charge of the pistol 
used by John Wilkes Booth to shoot Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	``A man standing by picked up Booth's pistol from the ground,''  
Gobright recalled. ``I exclaimed to the crowd below that the weapon 
had been found and placed in my possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy officer demanded it. Gobright refused and held the .44  
caliber, silver-mounted derringer for the police. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporter examined the carpeted presidential box, observed  
the darkening blood on the buttoned back of Lincoln's rocking 
chair, noted the rip in the Treasury flag that draped the railing. 
Later investigation showed it had been made by Booth's spur as he 
leaped to the stage and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Just minutes before, Gobright had been alone at the office of  
The Associated Press on Pennsylvania Avenue, leafing through a 
newspaper. An excited friend burst through the door shouting ``that 
the president had been assassinated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story tumbled out. The friend had been in the audience at  
Ford's. A gunshot was heard over the roar of a laugh line in the 
third act of the comedy, ``Our American Cousin.'' The president 
slumped forward. Mary Lincoln screamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gobright got the gist of the story, ran into the telegraph  
office and filed ``a short special'' that is still quoted as a 
model of terse story-telling. 
</P>
<P>
	``WASHINGTON, Friday, April 14, 1865. The President was shot in  
a theater to-night, and is perhaps mortally wounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pennsylvania native, Lawrence Agustus Gobright took his first  
Washington newspaper job in 1834 during Andrew Jackson's 
administration. The AP hired him shortly after its founding in 
1848. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Civil War, Gobright reported the maneuvers of the  
politicians and the ``gunpowder news'' of battles. He had wrestled 
with the official censor, once having to water down an account of a 
Confederate invasion of Maryland even though his story was clearly 
no news to the invaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But early in the war, other reporters complained that the censor  
waved Gobright's stories through while spiking theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoned before the House Judiciary Committee, Gobright gave  
what has been called one of the first descriptions of objective 
news writing. He volunteered that the news service's practical 
determination to be factual, non-political and impartial might have 
given it an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dispatches are merely dry matters of fact and detail,''  
Gobright testified. ``Some special correspondents may write to suit 
the temper of their own organs. ... I try to write without regard 
to men or politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over four years Gobright had come to know Lincoln well.  
</P>
<P>
	He had often witnessed the president's determination never to be  
bested in the telling of a funny story. But he had also seen an 
agitated Lincoln in the Army telegraph office, his face ``ghastly'' 
in the gas light, his hands and legs shaking, his mournful voice 
repeating, ``bad news, bad news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the second week of April 1865 was jubilation time. Lee  
surrendered his army to Grant on Sunday the 9th. Lincoln had been 
thronged by freed slaves while visiting Richmond. Gobright had seen 
him at the White House on the 10th proposing the band play the 
Confederacy's ``Dixie'' because ``we have lawfully captured it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Lincoln lay lengthwise on a boarding house bed across 10th  
Street from the theater, unconscious, his breath labored, doctors 
shaking their heads at the somber Cabinet members crowding the 
small room. Gobright sped around town, also picking up details of 
the attempted assassination of Secretary of State William H. 
Seward, and returned to his office to tell the fuller story. 
</P>
<P>
	``With trembling and nervous fingers,'' he began to write, in  
chronological order as dictated by the style of the day. He did not 
mention the gunshot until the second sentence of the third 
paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, sentence after sentence, it was all business: the mortal  
wound in the back of the president's head, the flight of the 
still-unknown assassin, the attack on Seward, the ``wild 
excitement,'' the evidence of ``a preconcerted plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afterwards surprised that I had succeeded in  
approximating so closely all the facts in those dark 
transactions,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pawn Shop a Jewel in Beverly Hills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Here in the land where appearance  
is everything, even pawn shops have publicists. 
</P>
<P>
	At Beverly Loan Co., fortressed by a burly guard and two  
security doors, the Zimmelman sisters want to drum up business at 
the 61-year-old brokerage they inherited from their father. 
</P>
<P>
	So they hired a firm to blitz news organizations with  
tantalizing tidbits about their rich and famous clients -- an actor 
who tried to pawn his Oscar, a princess who traded crown jewels for 
cash and a producer who needed seed money for his new film. 
</P>
<P>
	Helaine, 53, and Jean, 50, won't reveal names. But they want it  
known that a socialite seeking cash can pawn her Picasso discreetly 
in their central Beverly Hills shop, which sits in an unobtrusive 
bank building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We protect our customers,'' Helaine said. ``We like what we  
do. We have families who have been coming to us for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shop's showroom doesn't display the pawn-shop staples of  
long-forgotten guitars or cheap, dust-dulled wedding bands. 
Instead, there is Lalique crystal, Erte statuettes, paintings by 
Marc Chagall, Joan Miro and David Hockney, and glass cases crammed 
with diamonds and gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters say their work is a service, and ask: Where else can  
you get a six-figure loan with no credit check and no questions? 
</P>
<P>
	But there is one rather official question: Do the goods belong  
to you? Even here, brokers must submit to police a description of 
the hocked item and the pawner's thumbprint to ensure against 
thievery. 
</P>
<P>
	And the ritzy shop hues to a pawn-shop truism: Even in Beverly  
Hills, what people pawn can hint of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters recently bought a gold dental bridge from a man who  
said it once belonged to a relative.

<HEADLINE> Post-War Kosovo Scenarios Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When NATO bombs and missiles stop striking  
Serb military targets across Yugoslavia, what might the political 
map of the Serbian province of Kosovo look like? And who will be 
living there? 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign policy analysts suggest four leading scenarios for the  
province's future once the conflict between the military alliance 
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces ends: 
</P>
<P>
	--A NATO-led force accompanies ethnic Albanians back into Kosovo  
after Serb army and police forces pull out of the province. This is 
the most optimistic picture and tracks the Clinton administration's 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian Kosovars, a majority of the province's population,  
would live in peace but in a devastated land that would need 
international help to be rebuilt. Living under NATO or U.N. 
protection for at least several years, the Kosovars may or may not 
gain the autonomy NATO is pushing for -- or the independence for 
which they have been fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milosevic's forces hunker down and absorb the NATO pounding  
while mopping up their ethnic cleansing campaign, which could slow 
or even stop. Serbs have swept about half the 2 million people out 
of Kosovo since February 1998 -- the majority since NATO airstrikes 
began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO could declare it has achieved its military goal of  
degrading Serb forces until they no longer threaten Kosovars in the 
province, which once was 10 percent Serbian. Refugees in 
neighboring nations or European camps might never return. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milosevic negotiates a peace deal -- perhaps with the help of a  
friendly nation such as Russia -- to withdraw Serb forces from all 
or part of Kosovo and allow refugees to return under international 
protection. This could result in a real or de facto partition along 
ethnic lines or demilitarized zones. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters Sunday, Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright did not rule out a partition of Kosovo, so long as there 
are ways to protect Orthodox Christian sites. But Defense Secretary 
William Cohen and White House chief of staff John Podesta, in 
separate television interviews, dismissed any idea of partition. 
</P>
<P>
	--NATO airstrikes, alone or with ground troops, drive Serb forces  
from Kosovo. President Clinton has repeatedly ruled out ground 
troops for such an operation, although a growing number of members 
of Congress want him to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians could return, enjoying de facto or real  
independence with a demilitarized no-man's land between Serbia and 
Kosovo guarded by international peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	But war is messy and politics unpredictable, and almost anything  
can happen -- from the war spreading to neighboring Macedonia and 
Albania and beyond, to the Western-leaning Montenegro government 
splitting from Yugoslavia, leaving Serbia alone in the onetime 
six-nation federation that mostly dissolved in earlier this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long, drawn-out chess game. We may know two or three  
moves in advance, but not much beyond that,'' said Janusz Bugajski, 
director of East European studies at the private Center for 
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Cordesman, also at the center, said none of the possible  
outcomes is ``particularly attractive'' because the United States 
and NATO would be left more deeply entangled in the Balkans than 
ever, and for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	For four years, 30,000 NATO peacekeepers have been stationed in  
Bosnia and no end is in sight for their mission. Proposed for 
Kosovo is a 28,000-member NATO-led force, including 4,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs and the most radical elements of the Kosovo Liberation  
Army also will likely continue fighting in pockets of Kosovo or 
Yugoslavia and seek to rearm for future war -- the Yugoslavs with 
the aid of Russian nationalists and the KLA with possible help from 
Muslims in Iran, Cordesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosnia and Macedonia -- both former Yugoslav states -- could be  
further destabilized as the possibility of Kosovo independence 
remains ``a time bomb,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivo Daalder, a former White House official who worked on Bosnia  
matters, views the most likely outcome under current conditions as 
partition of Kosovo populated by returned ethnic Albanians, 
allowing both NATO and Milosevic to declare a measure of victory. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO would not accept Serb control of a Kosovo emptied of most  
of its ethnic Albanians because it would be too great a blow to the 
19-nation alliance on its 50th anniversary and in its first 
offensive military campaign, said Daalder, now affiliated with the 
Brookings Institution.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits Second Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire homered for the first time since  
opening day, connecting for his second off Jason Bere of the 
Cincinnati Reds on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With two outs and none on in the first inning, McGwire lined a  
first-pitch fastball from Bere over the left-field wall, a drive 
estimated at 394 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd been 3-for-14 with four walks, two strikeouts and one RBI  
since hitting his first homer off Milwaukee's David Weathers in the 
fifth inning on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, McGwire homered in each of the first four games to  
tie the major league record set by Willie Mays in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit only one home run against the Reds last year, No. 60  
off Dennis Reyes on Sept. 5. For his career, he has three homers 
and five RBIs against the Reds, going 10-for-49 (.204). 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Weathers, Bere was among McGwire's 70 victims last year.  
McGwire hit No. 29 on June 8 at Comiskey Park when Bere was 
pitching for the Chicago White Sox. Bere was released by Chicago 
and claimed on waivers by Cincinnati last July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Mondesi of the Los Angeles Dodgers began the day with the  
major league lead in home runs with four.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Accused of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to  
an Olympic gold medal, has been accused by one of his former figure 
skaters of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, one of the sport's premier coaches, said he was  
``shocked and deeply dismayed'' by the ``unsubstantiated 
allegations.'' He said through his lawyer that his accuser is 
emotionally troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Maurizi, who skated for Callaghan and later became a  
colleague, said in a story in The New York Times on Sunday that 
they began having sex in 1981 and he now thinks he was exploited. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan denied having a sexual relationship with Maurizi, the  
newspaper said. Callaghan contends the accusations are a ploy to 
rob him of his skaters at the Detroit Skating Club, where he had 
been director of skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan's lawyer, Dean Groulx, said Sunday his client ``always  
considered Craig to be an invaluable member of his extended 
family.'' Groulx added that Callaghan and his wife hope Maurizi 
``will be able to resolve his emotional problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Callaghan does not wish to comment further because ``he  
has too much respect for the figure skating community to publicly 
debate the merits of Mr. Maurizi's unconfirmed allegations, a 
debate which could only harm the sport and its great individual 
competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Disbrow, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association,  
said Maurizi informed him last month of the accusations. Disbrow 
said his organization cannot act until it receives a formal 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi planned to submit the complaint in a few weeks, the  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disbrow was in Sweden for a weekend competition and attempts to  
reach him there were unsuccessful. Messages were left at his home 
and office outside Minneapolis, and another call to figure 
skating's headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo., was not 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi, now 36, said the relationship started after Callaghan  
moved to Philadelphia to coach. Maurizi, who began working with him 
when he was 13, finished fifth nationally in pairs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, I thought the sex was consensual,'' Maurizi told  
the Times. ``Now when I look back, I don't think it was consensual. 
I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a boy or a girl, a 
coach should never have sex with a student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi never reported any misconduct by Callaghan before. He  
told the newspaper he is able to discuss the matter now because of 
the support of his wife and therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said it spoke with Callaghan for four hours at his  
office in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and interviewed four dozen 
skaters, coaches, officials, agents and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this,'' Callaghan said. ``The allegations  
are awful. I can't believe I worked my butt off for kids to be 
successful in skating to be better people and this stuff happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, with Maurizi assisting, coached Lipinski to a 1998  
Olympic gold medal. He also coached Todd Eldredge to five national 
titles and a world championship. He and Maurizi split as coaching 
colleagues last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, there have been only four years in which Callaghan  
didn't have one of the top three skaters in either the men's or 
women's singles in the U.S. national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nicole Bobek and Eldredge won national titles in 1995, he  
became the first coach in 45 years to train the men's and ladies' 
champions in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, 53, is married with a grown daughter. He resigned as  
director at the Detroit Skating Club in March, telling the Times he 
was tired of the travel and coaching grind. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Johns, executive director at the club, told The Oakland  
Press of Pontiac, Mich., that Maurizi first spoke to him about the 
matter in March. Johns described Callaghan as a ``model coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Maurizi plans to leave the Detroit club for one in  
Boston but has yet to resign. Johns said he has spoken with 
Callaghan about returning to the Detroit club as a part-time coach.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower in Early Tokyo Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen in early  
trading Monday as the greenback faced selling from overseas 
investors. Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.52 yen in early trading, down 0.44 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late Friday level of 
120.98 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 163.55 points,  
or 0.97 percent, to 16,692.08 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the index gained 8.94 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, Japanese exporters sold the dollar above  
121 yen, while Japanese trust banks and importers were buying the 
currency at the low 120-yen level, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors largely ignored the results of the Tokyo  
gubernatorial election Sunday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shintaro Ishihara, a former transport minister and controversial  
author known for his hawkish, nationalistic views, won the vote in 
a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.70 yen in early  
trading, down from 130.43 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell as players took profits,  
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	High-technology and blue-chip shares, including Sony Corp.,  
Toshiba Corp. and NEC, were mostly lower on worries about earnings 
outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns were fueled in part by Compaq Computer's warning  
Friday in the United States that first-quarter earnings would fall 
below analysts' estimates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also concerned that New York share prices may be  
struggling to maintain their strength, said Yoshiyuki Higashi, 
manager of investment information at Taiheiyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.76 points, or 0.95 percent, to 1,330.15. 
The TOPIX fell 2.16 points, or 0.16 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unquoted early Monday. It finished Friday at 1.610 percent 
and was priced at 101.66 yen.

<HEADLINE> Sci-Fi Film 'Matrix' Takes in $22M / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The eye-popping science fiction adventure  
``The Matrix'' remained No. 1 at the box office with $22.2 million 
and spring break crowds gave Drew Barrymore's back-to-school film 
``Never Been Kissed'' a strong $11.7 million opening, estimates 
showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix,'' starring Keanu Reeves in the special  
effects-filled story of a computer hacker who finds out that 
reality isn't what it seems, has emerged as the year's second 
breakout hit -- after ``Analyze This'' -- grossing $72.9 million in 
just two weeks. It slipped only 20 percent last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But not even the wizardry of ``The Matrix'' could pull the year  
out of its post-''Titanic'' syndrome. After a momentary upturn when 
``The Matrix'' opened, the overall box office was once again down 
last weekend, this time 4.4 percent, from last year's weekend, when 
``City of Angels,'' ``Lost in Space'' and ``Titanic'' were going 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	With many of the nation's young people on vacation last week,  
youth-oriented films predictably dominated the top 10 -- with a 
mixed bag of results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never Been Kissed'' led the pack with the best opening for a  
film starring Miss Barrymore since ``The Wedding Singer'' in early 
1998. The hip-hop comedy ``Foolish'' opened with $2.26 million in 
tenth place for an impressive per-screen average of $7,410 -- even 
though its studio, fearing bad reviews, didn't screen the movie for 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new film, the Sundance Film Festival favorite ``Go''  
opened with a somewhat disappointing $4.7 million for sixth. Sony 
is now counting on strong word of mouth to keep the critically 
praised rave-scene film from plummeting into oblivion when most 
kids go back to school this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two big winners at the Academy Awards continued to pad their  
grosses. Best picture ``Shakespeare in Love'' collected $2.2 
million and best foreign-language film ``Life is Beautiful'' 
grossed $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Howard's comedy ``EDtv,'' however, has shaped up as the  
year's biggest disappointment, suffering in part from too many 
comparisons to last year's successful ``The Truman Show.'' ``EDtv'' 
plunged 51 percent to collect $2.2 million with a paltry 
per-location average of $882. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $22.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $5.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Analyze This,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Go,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Forces of Nature,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Twin Dragons,'' $2.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Doug's 1st Movie,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Foolish,'' $2.26 million.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Comes Clean on Corked Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jason Grimsley has finally come clean.  
</P>
<P>
	The pitcher was the one who crawled through the bowels of  
Comiskey Park five years ago to replace the corked bat of teammate 
Albert Belle that was being held in the umpires' room. 
</P>
<P>
	The confession by Grimsley, then with the Cleveland Indians and  
now with the New York Yankees, was reported Sunday in The New York 
Times, clearing up one of baseball's ongoing mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went sky diving once, and I can compare it to that,''  
Grimsley said before Sunday's game between the Yankees and Detroit. 
``The adrenaline rush I got from that caper was just like jumping 
out of an airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good news for Grimsley, too: No disciplinary action is expected.  
</P>
<P>
	``I regard it as history,'' said AL president Gene Budig, at  
Yankee Stadium to present the Yankees with their World Series 
championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first inning of a Cleveland-Chicago game on July 15,  
1994, White Sox manager Gene Lamont was tipped off that Belle, then 
with the Indians, had a corked bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamont challenged the use of the bat and umpire Dave Phillips  
took it and put it in his locker. The Indians panicked, knowing the 
bat was indeed corked. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley, 6-foot-3 and a slim 180 pounds, volunteered for the  
mission to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was mission impossible,'' Grimsley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that he took a cork-free bat belonging to  
Paul Sorrento -- all of Belle's bats were corked. Grimsley said he 
knew there was an escape hatch in the ceiling in the clubhouse and 
figured there was also one in the umpires' dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of an unidentified Indians' employee, he navigated  
his way to the spot. Crawling on his belly, a flashlight in his 
mouth, he finally found it, dropped down on a refrigerator and 
swiped the bat from Phillips' locker. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart was going 1,000 miles a second,'' Grimsley told the  
Times. ``I just rolled the dice, a crapshoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the umpires immediately suspected foul play --  
the bat, after all, bore Sorrento's name. The American League even 
spoke of bringing in the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Indians were told that if they supplied Belle's bat  
there would be no punishment for the switch. Belle received a 
10-game suspension that was reduced to seven games on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the American League clearly acted appropriately at  
the time,'' said Budig, who replaced AL president Bobby Brown on 
Aug. 1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Which leaves only one question: Why, after all these years, did  
Grimsley decide to speak up? 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asked whether I would tell the story if there would be  
no repercussions,'' Grimsley said. ``I figured it was about time.''

<P>
	A storm system spread rain and snow across the Great Lakes on  
Sunday and pushed a line of showers and thunderstorms across the 
Middle Atlantic States. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain stretched from Wisconsin across Michigan into Canada.  
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures were low enough to change the rain to snow across  
far northern sections of Wisconsin and Michigan, with up to 5 
inches of snow falling overnight in parts of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front extending from the heart of the storm curved  
through upstate New York and Pennsylvania and southwestward along 
the Appalachians. Hail more than a half-inch in diameter was 
reported near Westmoreland, Pa., the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	As that line pushed eastward, showers and scattered  
thunderstorms spread through the Appalachians into North Carolina, 
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, a second storm system spread light to moderate rain  
over parts of California. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain changed to snow in the Trinity Mountains of northern  
California, the Sierra Nevada and some mountains around the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a few, light, isolated showers and thundershowers  
developed over Texas and from Alabama into northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's temperatures around the Lower 48 ranged from a morning  
low of 9 below zero at Yellowstone National Park to an early 
afternoon reading of 85 at Pompano Beach, Fla. The lowest wind 
chill was 9 below at Yellowstone in Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Credits Doctor at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- After winning the Masters on Sunday, Jose  
Maria Olazabal wanted to share it with the German doctor who saved 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who captured his second green jacket with a two-stroke  
victory over Davis Love III, was out of golf for 18 months because 
of foot problems that were mistakenly diagnosed as rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain already was apparent when Olazabal won his first  
Masters in 1994. It became unbearable near the end of the following 
year, and he didn't pick up a club in '96 -- often confined to a 
sofa at his Spanish home. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal feared he wouldn't be able to walk again, much less  
play golf. That year, he watched the Masters on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not very pleasant, watching the rest of the players  
playing the Masters, knowing you have a right to be here and not 
being able to play,'' he said. ``That made it really hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, while in Germany to be fitted for a special shoe, he  
was treated by Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. The doctor told 
Olazabal the problem wasn't in his feet, prescribing a painful 
exercise program and injections for his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the problem was caused by two faulty  
vertebrae, which were pinching nerves affecting his feet. Soon, the 
pain began to subside, and Olazabal returned to golf in the spring 
of '97 at a tournament in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Olazabal thanked the doctor who cured his foot  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without him, I wouldn't be standing here,'' he said. ``I think  
I won this tournament because of him. He did a wonderful job with 
me, and I want to thank him from here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will thank him personally because I think this victory, part  
of it, belongs to him, too.''

<P>
	BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) -- Bristol Motor Speedway's reputation for  
producing an abundance of scrap metal was the main topic at the 
drivers' meeting held 90 minutes before the start of today's Food 
City 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know this is a tight track. We know there's going to be  
some bumping and grinding,'' NASCAR events director David Hoots 
told the drivers. ``But we also have a penalty box. We've got this 
old penalty box, and we'll use it if we have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several drivers were involved in repeated incidents, including  
Kenny Irwin, Jerry Nadeau and Dick Trickle, but no one was sent to 
the penalty box. The only sanction involved Ricky Craven, who was 
held in the pits briefly for exceeding the pit-road speed of 35 mph 
while coming in to get his wrecked car repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	The most serious crash occurred when Nadeau cut down in front of  
Bobby Labonte, setting off a chain-reaction wreck behind them that 
significantly damaged the cars of several contenders, including 
Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy who caused half the yellows finally took us out,''  
Stewart said of Nadeau. ``He was bound and determined he was going 
to crash some good cars, and he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nadeau, who was three laps down at the time, wasn't about to  
accept complete responsibility for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going by a lapped car, Bobby Labonte, and it looked like  
he was pushing real bad,'' Nadeau said. ``I might not have given 
him enough room, or he might have pushed into me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays appeared to show Labonte holding his line and  
Nadeau turning in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just a victim of circumstance,'' Labonte said.  
</P>
<P>
	The race was slowed by seven caution flags for 57 laps, limiting  
Rusty Wallace's average winning speed to 93.363 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in any of the wrecks.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	FRESH DRIVER: Kyle Petty, who finished eighth, tried to make  
light of the fact that he had failed to qualify for two of the six 
previous races this season -- including the most recent event two 
weeks ago in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't surprised we ran well,'' said Petty, one of nine  
drivers who wound up on the lead lap. ``You've got to remember, 
I've missed two races this year, so I've been rested up for 
Bristol.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPENCER'S PAIN: Jimmy Spencer, still smarting from rib injuries  
suffered in a late-race crash at Texas, made it halfway through the 
Bristol race before giving way to relief driver Steve Grissom. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer radioed to his team that he was ``hurting everywhere,''  
and when he pitted under caution on lap 252 he needed assistance to 
get out of his car. He was placed in a waiting golf cart and driven 
to the infield care center, where he was examined and released. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BLAST FROM THE PAST: Stewart, who started fourth and led for 55  
laps, was trying to become the first Winston Cup rookie to win at 
Bristol since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The victorious rookie driver that year? Some guy named Dale  
Earnhardt, who went on to win another 70 races, not to mention 
seven Winston Cup championships. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	DALE'S DAY: Speaking of The Intimidator, Earnhardt started last  
on the 43-car grid Sunday because he crashed his primary car in 
Saturday's final practice session and had to switch to a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt steadily worked his way through the pack and spent the  
last half of the race running as high as sixth. He wound up 10th, 
the last car on the lead lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only got about 15 laps of practice on that backup car, and  
the crew really did a great job getting it ready,'' he said. ``My 
hat's off to them.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Hit Low Point With Just 49 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- There were indications in January of what was  
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Floyd called his first practice and then had to cancel it.  
Why? The Chicago Bulls didn't have enough players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, during a season of humiliating how-low-can-you-go  
scenarios, the once-proud team just 10 months removed from its 
sixth NBA title has reached the basement of professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	One would swear the scoreboard at the United Center was  
malfunctioning Saturday night, choked by some computer glitch. 
Nope. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game with the Miami Heat ended, it showed the Bulls  
beaten 82-49, marking the lowest scoring output for any NBA team 
since the inception of the shot clock in the 1954-55 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine points in 48 minutes!  
</P>
<P>
	``It just hurts. There's nothing else you can say. It just  
hurts,'' said Toni Kukoc, who shot 4-for-16. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for good defense -- or inept offense -- came  
last June in Game 3 of the NBA Finals when Michael Jordan, Scottie 
Pippen and Dennis Rodman led the Bulls to a 96-54 rout of the Utah 
Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Jordan, who scored at least 50 points by himself 38  
times during his career, Pippen and Rodman are no longer around. 
They must be shaking their heads in disbelief at what has happened 
to the team they once represented, one headed for the draft 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Just eight days earlier, the Bulls were blown out by the Orlando  
Magic, a 47-point loss that was the worst in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't go and hide,'' said veteran Ron Harper, who'd been  
out 10 games with a sprained knee before returning for Saturday 
night's embarrassing escapade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never enjoy sitting through something like this,'' Floyd  
said. ``When you play against a great defense, that creates 
frustration. I hope we can be there someday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can live with this easier than the Orlando game when we were  
giving up layup after layup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat, the NBA's leader in field goal defense (no team has  
shot 50 percent against them all year) smothered the Bulls from the 
outset. They ran off the game's first 15 points and Chicago 
couldn't score until Mark Bryant hit a free throw nearly eight 
minutes into the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be the last point of the night for Bryant, who  
aggravated a shoulder injury. Without him and Brent Barry, 
sidelined with a sprained ankle, the Bulls had no chance. None. 
They had eight points in the first quarter and just 23 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys just got on them and tried to keep Toni out of it,''  
Miami coach Pat Riley said, insisting he was not out to set any 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not into the history of the Chicago Bulls. They're a team  
rebuilding with a lot of draft picks and cap room for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Mourning, frustrated in previous playoffs by the Bulls,  
both in Charlotte and Miami, blocked seven shots and had 19 points. 
He said the past had nothing to do with the Heat's performance, one 
that limited the Bulls to 18 field goals -- another NBA low -- and 
23.4 percent shooting -- just off the NBA worst of 22.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no payback. We just like to win,'' Mourning said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sympathy at all out there. If they had a chance,  
they'd do it to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat will have another opportunity Tuesday night. That's  
when the Bulls visit Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a game you're looking forward to,'' Floyd said.

<HEADLINE> Two Shootings at Student Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A year after a police shootout marred  
Black College Reunion, two shootings and two stabbings left four 
people in the hospital Sunday, one in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have that many people in such a condensed area,  
sometimes these things happen,'' said Officer Sherri Davis, a 
spokeswoman for Daytona Beach Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Black College Reunion started in 1984 as a small gathering of  
students from historically black Florida A&AMP;M University in 
Tallahassee and nearby Bethune-Cookman College. It now competes 
with Atlanta's Freaknik as the place to go for a ``black spring 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruising, partying and ogling members of the opposite sex are  
the primary activities of the event, which drew an estimated 
100,000 celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating whether the two shootings were  
connected because both were reported at about 4 a.m. on the same 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men, Craig Grover of Jacksonville, was shot in the  
head. He was listed in critical condition at Halifax Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ansie Pierre, 24, of Miami, was found wounded in the stomach at  
a nearby motel about 100 yards away. He was listed in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Police questioned three men in connection with the shootings,  
but no immediate arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, a Daytona Beach woman was stabbed in the  
neck following an argument at the Desert Inn. The victim, 
identified as Shaneta Leshawn Jones, 20, was upgraded from critical 
to stable condition Sunday at Halifax Medical Center. No arrests 
were made, although Davis said a suspect was identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the violence, the host city's mayor from declared the  
weekend a success Sunday. Mayor Bud Asher said the incidents were 
isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to let it spoil the good things that happened  
at BCR,'' Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stabbing Saturday in Ormond Beach, about 5 miles northwest of  
Daytona Beach, resulted in the arrest of an Orlando woman, who was 
charged with aggravated assault for allegedly wounding a man from 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Jordan, 21, of Birmingham, Ala., was listed in  
satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
	As of early Sunday, police had made more than 300 arrests, 12  
for firearms possession and related charges. They wrote about 2,400 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 329 arrests were made and 926 citations were written  
over the three-day event. A man was killed and four police officers 
were wounded in a shootout that year.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stewards declared Worthy Crane a non-starter in  
today's fourth race at Aqueduct after he was inadvertently left 
behind at the starting gate when the race began. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically all my mistake,'' NYRA starter Bobby Duncan  
said. ``Another horse had broken open his stall door and I had gone 
over to instruct the gate crew member on him I wanted him to handle 
the horse. Basically, I lost track of the outside horse (Worthy 
Crane).''

<P>
	NYRA president and chief operating officer Terry Meyocks said,  
``We would like to apologize to the owner, trainer and connections 
of Worthy Crane as well as to the fans here and nationally who

<HEADLINE> Japanese Launch High-Tech Biz in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six years ago Hideaki Morishita turned his  
back on a secure but frustrating job with Japanese 
telecommunications giant NTT Corp. and struck out for America with 
a dream of launching an Internet business. 
</P>
<P>
	Morishita's experiment in personal initiative is paying off. His  
M.M. Systems, based in suburban Torrance, builds Web sites for a 
growing clientele of companies doing business in Japan or among 
Japanese expatriates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan it's, 'You have to do this, you have to do that,' ''  
Morishita said. ``I can do what I want to here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What was a bold and radical step when Morishita made his move in  
1993 is becoming more common as Japan struggles with recession and 
record-high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	No agency keeps statistics, but observers say an increasing  
number of young entrepreneurs frustrated by Japan's slow-moving 
business culture are forsaking their homeland to seek their 
fortunes in America's high-tech marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	A more fundamental shift is taking place as well. Japanese  
corporations are studying the business model that emerged from 
Silicon Valley during the late 1980s in which small, flexible 
companies often rise quickly based on the ability to rapidly 
develop and market new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend marks a sharp change from the 1980s, when U.S.  
businesses scrambled to emulate their Japanese counterparts. 
Momentum shifted eastward across the Pacific during the 1990s as 
U.S. companies took the lead in quickly developing new computer 
software and Internet technologies while Japan's economy began to 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '80s, studying Japanese management was very popular for  
Americans. It's totally different now. It's more Japanese 
professors and scholars coming to the U.S. to study the Silicon 
Valley entrepreneurial spirit,'' said Junko Matsubara, a manager of 
business development for Mitsubishi International, an arm of the 
Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Indications of change are evident on both sides of the ocean.  
</P>
<P>
	At a recent conference in Los Angeles, the Japan External Trade  
Organization brought dozens of U.S. and Japanese companies together 
to strike deals and cross-pollinate with new ideas. In Northern 
California, Stanford University's US-Japan Technology Management 
Center and the International Business Incubator in San Jose perform 
similar functions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan some 40 corporations, including NTT, the Japan  
Development Bank and Toshiba Corp., are members of Smart Valley 
Japan, a 400-member group created to foster the entrepreneurial 
spirit. The group is patterned after Smart Valley Inc., a Silicon 
Valley booster group formed during the recession of the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely a trend toward more entrepreneurship, more  
startups in Japan,'' said Richard Dasher, director of the US-Japan 
Technology Management Center. ``There's a great deal of interest in 
the model. Many people are coming here to find out how the model 
works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge is to apply it in a way that fits Japanese culture  
and sensibilities. Some of the very elements that have made the 
high-tech U.S. entrepreneurship successful -- fast-forming alliances 
and quick movement to markets -- clash with the Japanese business 
tradition of careful, deliberate planning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, young entrepreneurs such as Morishita are  
seeking their fortunes in the United States. In Japan, 
incorporating a new business costs $80,000 or more, and companies 
are slow to do business with newcomers. The requirement was 
intended to prevent fly-by-night companies that prey on consumers. 
But the law also has become a barrier to the creation of small 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Morishita was able to incorporate M.M. Systems  
for $4,300, including fees and attorney costs. Businesses seeking 
bilingual Web sites came to him looking for help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the Internet is far more accessible in the United  
States.	   A basic connection that costs $20 per month in the United States 
runs $100 or more monthly, plus per-minute connection charges, in 
Japan. Businesses and consumers alike have been slow to embrace the 
new medium, said Akira Tsuruname, who left his Japanese employer 
more than two decades ago to start his own business consulting 
service, California Coordinator. Now he helps Japanese business 
owners get started in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the real capitalist country,'' he said. ``Japan is a  
capitalist country, but it is a little more socialized. Also, now 
we are going to an information society. All the structure for the 
information society is here in the USA, and its open.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies Hope Opener Heats Up Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- To a man, the Colorado Rockies were hoping that  
Coors Field will prove to be a cure for their quiet bats. 
</P>
<P>
	After experiencing a little bit of everything in the first week  
of the season -- all on the road -- the Rockies (2-4) were scheduled 
to play their home opener on Monday against San Diego, starting a 
nine-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been swinging the bats well,'' manager Jim Leyland  
said Sunday after the Rockies' game at Los Angeles was postponed by 
a steady rain. ``We need our offense to come alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through six games, the Rockies are hitting .275 and have scored  
just 22 runs. On Saturday, they managed only three hits in a 2-0 
loss to Kevin Brown. They have hit only two homers, although both -- 
by Dante Bichette and Todd Helton -- have contributed to their two 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	A particular weakness has been the No. 3 spot in the batting  
order, vacated by the injured Larry Walker. Fill-ins Lenny Harris, 
Angel Echevarria and Pat Watkins have, as starters in that slot, 
hit just .087 (2-for-23) and are hitless in the last 15 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a key player out of the lineup, but so do a lot of  
other teams,'' Leyland said. ``I'm not going to panic after six 
ballgames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, sidelined by a strained muscle in his rib cage, isn't  
eligible to come off the disabled list until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's pitching has been unexpectedly solid. The staff's  
ERA, which generally hovers around 5.00, is 3.60. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five of our six starts have been good ones,'' Leyland said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies clearly were eager to get home. After a final  
exhibition game in Arizona on April 1, they played an exhibition at 
Coors Field on April 3, then traveled to Monterrey, Mexico, for the 
season opener against San Diego on April 4. Two days later, they 
resumed the series with the Padres in San Diego. Then came three 
games against the Dodgers in unusually cold, blustery conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been traveling a lot in the last week or so,'' Leyland  
said. ``We're ready to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty-thousand every night -- it's a great place to play,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Castilla said Colorado fans ``are hungry for baseball.  
We're excited about going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Astacio (0-1), scheduled to pitch for Colorado on Sunday,  
will take the mound on Monday instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't bother me waiting a day,'' he said. ``I never had to  
warm up today, so it won't have any effect on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woody Williams (0-0) is scheduled to oppose him.  
</P>
<P>
	Leyland remained one win short of the 1,000 mark in his major  
league managing career. Only three active managers -- Tony La Russa, 
Bobby Cox and Joe Torre -- have reached that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think about that, that's not important,'' said  
Leyland, who ranks 45th on baseball's career list. ``I'd have to 
think we're going to win another game somewhere along the line.''

<HEADLINE> Center Studies Ideas on Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Possibly coming soon to a refrigerator  
near you: hot dogs covered with an edible film to prevent 
contamination from potentially deadly bacteria like listeria, 
salmonella and E. coli. 
</P>
<P>
	At least that's where Elliot Ryser, a professor at Michigan  
State University, hopes his research will lead sometime in the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea with the film is to try to make something like a  
Teflon suit ... so if bacteria lands on a hot dog it's 
inactivated,'' Ryser says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryser is one of three dozen scientists affiliated with the  
school's new National Food Safety and Toxicology Center. The 
center, which opened last year, draws researchers from many 
different disciplines to study the safety of the food supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason this center exists is to get a holistic view,''  
says director Robert Hollingworth. ``You've got to have 
microbiologists, process control people who understand the 
processes and behavioral scientists who understand how people 
react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recent listeria outbreak traced back to the Zeeland-based  
Bil Mar Foods plant is only one example of potential food safety 
hazards, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 9,000 Americans die and 33 million become ill from  
foodborne illness every year, according to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. It's difficult to find more exact 
numbers because food poisoning cases are not always diagnosed or 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, the figures are estimated to be many times that,  
especially in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it's food, everyone's at risk, especially infants,  
children and the elderly,'' Hollingworth says. 
</P>
<P>
	No official cause of the Zeeland outbreak has been determined,  
although there's speculation it may be related to air conditioning 
units in the plant. The outbreak has been linked to 15 adult deaths 
and six miscarriages or stillbirths in 22 states, according to the 
CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of food safety is nothing new. What is unique about  
Michigan State's approach is the way it brings together academics 
of different stripes under one roof, according to Dane Bernard of 
the National Food Processors Association, an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things can happen around the water cooler that you don't have  
an opportunity for if you are not working together,'' he says. ``An 
example would be DNA technology which has been important in 
medicine but is really now just making itself known in the field of 
microbiology,'' the study of microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
	There are only a handful of similar centers around the country,  
most less than a decade old. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is also getting into the act. Last year,  
it announced plans for the Joint Institute on Food Safety Research, 
which is designed to get the most out of research dollars by 
encouraging cooperation between the government, schools and 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find that there's a lot of enthusiasm at the federal level  
for having collaborative researh projects going on across the 
country,'' says David Edmark, a spokesman for the Food Safety 
Consortium, which coordinates food safety research among the 
University of Arkansas, Kansas State and Iowa State. ``Anything 
that can give you more efficient use of your dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry already spends hundreds of millions of dollars on  
research into food safety, including projects at universities, 
according to Bernard. At Michigan State alone, it accounts for at 
least a quarter of a million dollars in research funding. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to researchers like Ryser who work on understanding  
bacterial behavior and preventing food contamination, the Michigan 
State center also examines several other areas of food safety, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Toxicology. How pesticides and other pollutants affect food  
and the human body. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Social dimensions of food safety. How public perception, the  
media and policy affect food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Genetic engineering. Ways of creating grains and other crops  
that are resistant to disease and, in some cases, herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Natural product chemistry. How some foods or spices may  
contain natural disease-fighting substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until recently, the primary focus in food safety was on  
sanitation -- keeping work and packaging areas clean.

<P>
	But in the last few years, the federal government and industry  
have turned to scientific testing to monitor levels of microbial 
organisms, like listeria and E. coli, that authorities now know can 
cause food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend toward importing food from countries with different

fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry and meat products, according to 
Les Bourquin, a Michigan State professor affiliated with the

<P>
	But for now, Hollingworth says, there's still a lot of basic  
research to be done into how microorganisms, or as he calls them 
``bugs,'' contaminate food. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand where the hazards are,'' Hollingworth  
says. ``We don't even understand how these bugs move around in the 
environment.''

<HEADLINE> Some Work Deaths Preventable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- An estimated 1.1 million work-related deaths occur  
each year, many of which could be prevented by better safety 
measures, the International Labor Organization said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300,000 of these deaths are due to exposure to hazardous  
substances which led to cancer, heart and respiratory disease, the 
U.N. labor organization said -- with asbestos alone causing 100,000 
deaths annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The ILO said workers suffer an estimated 250 million accidents  
each year. Working children are caught in 12 million occupational 
accidents, of which 12,000 are fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the accidents occur in developing countries which  
haven't adopted necessary safety measures. For instance, 
construction sites in developing countries are 10 times more 
dangerous than in industrialized countries, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ILO said an estimated 600,000 lives each year could be saved  
if safety and information practices were improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The data was released by Jukka Takala, chief of the ILO's health  
and safety program, at the start of a conference on occupational 
health in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Princeton Researches Fusion Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAINSBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Scientists using the country's newest  
experimental nuclear reactor believe they're gaining ground in 
their efforts to develop a safe and inexhaustible power source for 
the next century -- fusion energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Spherical Torus eXperiment, or NSTX, at the  
Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory in this central New 
Jersey suburb already is impressing both officials supporting 
fusion research funding and the physicists and engineers working on 
the nationwide collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NSTX is an enormous example of the potential'' of the  
technology, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said recently. ``It 
brings us closer to the reality of fusion energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fusion, the process that powers the sun, involves slamming  
special forms of tiny hydrogen atoms together at very high 
temperature and pressure in a plasma, a hot mass of electrically 
charged gas similar to the substance inside a fluorescent light 
bulb. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say harnessing the power released when the atoms fuse  
will one day provide a clean energy source far safer than today's 
commercial nuclear fission reactors, which split apart large, 
radioactive atoms. The fuel, hydrogen atoms removed from water, is 
plentiful. In addition, the fusion process can't cause a 
``meltdown'' reaction and doesn't contribute to air pollution, acid 
rain or the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory director Robert J. Goldston said the radioactivity  
produced by a fusion reactor is 100,000 times less than in an 
equivalent fission reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossil fuel supplies are expected to run low in 50 years, and  
many scientists hope fusion will be a major energy source before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the year 2100, either we're going to be real toasty and  
under water (from flooding induced by global warming), or we're 
going to have a completely different energy system,'' Goldston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But perfecting the technology to control a self-sustaining  
``burn'' of nuclear fuel will take decades and cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Meanwhile, physicists across the country say 
progress has been slowed in recent years by the federal 
government's inadequate financial commitment: just $27 million 
annually for the NSTX project and $227 million a year for the 
country's entire fusion research program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Magnetic fusion research is eminently worthwhile because it  
solves an energy problem,'' yet it's not a high priority for the 
government, said Patrick Diamond, a University of California-San 
Diego physics professor whose research focuses on turbulence in 
reactor plasmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Limiting that turbulence, which quickly cools down the  
multimillion-degree plasma and stops the fusion process, is one of 
the biggest challenges to physicists and a major focus of the NSTX 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond and his Princeton colleagues are particularly worried  
that, under pressure from Congress, the administration has reduced 
participation in a planned international collaboration on the next 
generation of reactor to basically consulting with scientists in 
Russia, Japan and a European consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	The only U.S. facility for the project was shut last year and  
there is no funding for the collaboration in the proposed budget 
for fiscal year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The physicists worry this country could end up paying for rights  
to use the technology, rather than being able to sell it to 
less-developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Washington's push for smaller, cheaper reactors, the  
compact NSTX is particularly attractive, compared to the 
gymnasium-sized fusion reactor it replaced here, Goldston said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor was shut down two years ago  
after 15 years of breakthrough experiments that included producing 
a record-setting 10.7 million watts of power, about 100 million 
times the level reactors were able to generate in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tokamak reactor would cost nearly 15 times as much to  
build today as the $24 million NSTX, which uses much of the same 
peripheral equipment that was part of Tokamak. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of NSTX was completed on budget and months ahead of  
schedule, Richardson noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet, in two days of preliminary experiments in February,  
the machine produced nearly six times the current targeted for 
those first runs. That proved the reactor could create a plasma 
with its giant magnets and just one of its heating systems, which 
uses an electrical current, like a toaster or space heater. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians now are installing the second, a radio frequency  
heating system that works like microwaves, and will begin 
experiments in earnest in July, said Masa Ono, the project 
director. Come January, experiments will halt while workers connect 
neutral beam injectors, which shoot super-heated particles into the 
plasma. 
</P>
<P>
	Experiments then will run for several years, after which the  
project team of scientists from the lab and 13 other U.S. research 
facilities will use what they have learned to adjust the machine 
for optimal performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being more economical to build than its predecessor,  
NSTX has a removable central core containing some of its most 
complex equipment, so repairs or upgrades to the reactor can be 
done in days instead of months, limiting downtime, according to Al 
Vonhalle, the project's head of technical operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another advantage is its slightly different shape. The Tokamak  
reactor also was a torus, or doughnut shape, while this ``spherical 
torus'' is shaped like a ball, with a very narrow central core. 
Researchers believe that configuration will allow for higher 
pressures in the plasma, something needed to keep fusion reactions 
going much longer than the several-second pulses achieved so far. 
</P>
<P>
	NSTX is one of a handful of this type of reactor with different  
design variations recently built or under construction in the 
United States, England, Russia and Japan. The Princeton scientists 
believe their machine has some significant advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ours will be the most powerful in the world,'' Goldston said.  
``We'll have the most heating and the longest pulse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond believes, however, that a reactor in San Diego and one  
under construction at University of California-Los Angeles are ``at 
least as promising'' as NSTX. Comparing findings from the different 
reactors should allow for more advances in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not fusion reactors can compete with other energy  
sources in a few decades, Goldston notes the research generates 
valuable spinoffs. That includes using plasmas to make better 
computer chips, sterilize medical equipment, make luminous display 
panels more efficient and provide a lightweight fuel for rocket 
thrusters in space ships and on satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	An explanation of fusion and how fusion reactors work:  
</P>
<P>
	WHAT IT IS -- Fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars,  
occurs when very light, superheated hydrogen atoms, in gas form, 
collide at high speed and fuse. The reaction yields slightly larger 
atoms and atomic particles called neutrons that carry away heat 
energy released in the process so energy that can be used to make 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, today's nuclear plants are powered by fission, in  
which very heavy radioactive atoms are split apart, releasing 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	RESEARCH GOAL -- Researchers must harness more energy from a  
fusion reactor than the power needed to run it. The reactor must be 
fairly economical to build and operate, so it can compete with 
other energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
	TIMETABLE -- The United States began its fusion research program  
in 1951 and had aimed to have commercial reactors operating soon 
after 2030. But federal funding cuts have slowed progress, 
jeopardizing that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW REACTORS WORK -- Using powerful magnetic forces and a  
combination of high-tech heating methods, magnetic fusion reactors 
make the nuclei of special forms, or isotopes, of hydrogen fuse 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	A thimbleful of hydrogen gas is injected into the reactor  
chamber and heated to hundreds of millions of degrees -- many times 
hotter than the sun's core -- by electrical current, microwaves and 
neutral particle beam injectors to create a hot, electrically 
charged gas mass called a plasma, similar to the substance inside a 
fluorescent light bulb. Giant magnets then create a magnetic field 
confining that plasma as if in an invisible container. The charged 
molecular particles collide at high speeds and many fuse, releasing 
heat energy. That energy is carried across the magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
	In a future commercial fusion reactor, the energy would be drawn  
off using a heat exchanger to make electricity.

<HEADLINE> Gore Seeks To Soften VIP Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore got a bit of a  
surprise when he plunged into a crowd and paused to admire Sherri 
Leach's dog, Poopsie. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got some puppies, do you want one?'' Leach asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two dogs now,'' Gore said as he retreated down the  
line of people waiting to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, Gore was facing some tough questions from  
8-year-old Jake Powers, who demanded to know how teachers can 
survive when ``they only get paid $3 a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those were typical scenes for Gore and his wife, Tipper, during  
the vice president's latest campaign trip through Iowa. Gore has 
vowed to break through the trappings of his office and connect with 
voters on a grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
	His aides liken it to a national campaign for sheriff.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to spend an enormous amount of time here in Iowa,  
going from town to town and talking with people one at a time and 
one family at a time and in small groups and in living rooms,'' 
Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa and other small states that open the political season  
traditionally demand that candidates campaign up close and 
personal, with activists expecting to meet contenders and quiz them 
on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Showing up in living rooms in Iowa is no different than  
running 1,000 points of television in California,'' said veteran 
Democratic strategist Phil Roeder. ``It's what people expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That can be a problem for candidates like Gore, who travels with  
a huge, traffic-snarling vice presidential entourage of security, 
staff and reporters. Unlike his rivals, it's not easy for Gore to 
drop into a coffee shop for a quiet chat. 
</P>
<P>
	``You walk into a cafe unannounced and you talk with everybody  
there, for as long as they want to talk,'' said former Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate Don Avenson. ``That's what people expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked safely inside ``the bubble,'' a euphemism for the phalanx  
of Secret Service agents, that isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who talk into their sleeves are intimidating,'' Avenson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to show he can overcome that, Gore scheduled a series  
of ``house parties'' in Iowa and mingled with Democratic activists. 
He even spent a night at a farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties jam 40 to 60 carefully selected backers into an  
average-size house. Moving into one party, Gore shed his coat and 
worked his way patiently through the rooms, backslapping and 
schmoozing, posing for photo after photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to counter his reputation for stiffness, Gore often mugs  
and jokes with activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a great sense of humor,'' said Miriam Tyson of  
Waterloo. ``He loosens up and is able to joke about himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After working his way around the room for 20 minutes or so, Gore  
stakes out a corner where he delivers an abbreviated stump speech, 
focusing on schools and those left behind during the current 
economic boon. 
</P>
<P>
	The diner version is similar. Gore moves through the crowd  
shaking hands and slapping backs, all the while soliciting advice 
on what to eat. In Waterloo, it was tenderloin with pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Lavenz beamed after getting a picture of his family giving  
Gore a big hug. ``This is what he needs to do,'' Lavenz said. ``If 
he spends the next 19 months doing this, he won't need all that 
money for television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, then-Vice President George Bush faced some of the same  
problems as Gore. Rivals spent more time on retail politics, and 
Bush finished third in Iowa's caucuses. Gore's only announced rival 
for the Democratic nomination is former New Jersey Sen. Bill 
Bradley, who has considerably more freedom to meet and greet 
Iowans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have looked very closely at what Bush did in 1987 and  
1988,'' said one Gore aide who requested anonymity. ``We will be 
doing the stuff you do if you are running for sheriff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore appears determined to overcome the logistical difficulties.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just requires a little foresight, that's all,'' he said.  
``If you put in the time to plan it out, you can do just about 
anything you want, to go into a crowded living room, spend a night 
at a farm, go to a diner and sit up at the counter where people are 
having lunch. You just need to plan it out well.''

	NATO Scatters Bombs Over Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Orthodox Easter in Yugoslavia began  
earlier today with a series of NATO air strikes. Despite bad 
weather hampering what allies could do, bombs still rained down on 
Kosovo on the day Serbians celebrate Easter, according to local 
reports. Meanwhile, the number of refugees fleeing or driven out of 
Kosovo during the crisis has topped 500,000, a scale of human 
displacement not seen in Europe since World War II. The latest 
figures compiled by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
estimate the exodus at 521,000 people, the vast majority of them 
ethnic Albanians.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has passed a  
live test of its new fixes to correct the year 2000 computer bug. 
The test involved the forwarding of computer clocks at Denver 
International Airport to the hour of midnight Dec. 31, 1999. An air 
traffic controller and the pilot of an approaching FAA plane then 
held a conversation that safely bridged the gap of the new century. 
Officials say the computers were able to read the new year 
successfully. The year 2000 glitch stems from computers not being 
able to read the date properly, a problem some officials believe 
could disrupt air traffic.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Defying appeals from the United States  
to put its nuclear program on hold, India has tested an upgraded 
version of its intermediate-range missile. Information Minister 
Pramod Mahajan told a hastily summoned news conference that the 
Agni II ballistic missile was successfully launched at 10 a.m. 
local time (12:30 a.m. EDT). Indian news agencies quoted government 
officials as saying Pakistan was given advanced warning. The test 
comes after India conducted a series of underground nuclear 
explosions last year that prompted Pakistan to respond with tests 
of its own, raising international fears of a nuclear arms race 
between the two belligerent nations.

	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told a Boy Scout  
yesterday there were no plans to reinstate the draft, despite the 
NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. The draft question by 
14-year-old Joe Wiesneski, was the most pointed about the conflict 
in Kosovo posed to Gore at a campaign fund-raiser. ``There is very 
little support for moving away from the volunteer Army,'' Gore 
said. President Clinton has repeatedly said he had no plan to send 
ground troops to fight in Kosovo.

	Welfare Rolls Fall Again

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton yesterday used the latest  
report of shrinking welfare rolls -- cut nearly in half since 1993 -- 
to prod Congress for child care, housing and transportation 
programs that he said will move even more welfare recipients into 
jobs. He also announced final regulations that give states greater 
leeway in using federal welfare grants to set up such programs 
themselves. Nationally, just over 7.6 million Americans were 
receiving public assistance at the end of December, down from 
almost 8 million at the end of September and 14.3 million in 1994.

a judge to decide how much the nation's third-largest poultry 
company must pay to Dennis P. Hook in punitive damages. The jury 
awarded the compensatory damages on Friday. Judge Robert H. Bonanno

quoted Maurizi, 36, as saying the sexual relationship began in 1981 
after Callaghan moved to Philadelphia to coach and Maurizi, then a 
student, followed. Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to an

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-time Olympian Worku Bikila of Ethiopia  
endured a steady downpour today to win the 10-mile Cherry Blossom 
Run in 46 minutes, 59 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bikila withstood a late charge from Kenyans Lazarus Nyakeraka  
and James Kariuki. Nyakeraka finished two seconds behind the 
winner, with Nariuki another two seconds back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all about who could last the longest,'' Bikila said.  
``The conditons made it very tough to stay ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rain and chilly temperatures were so uncomfortable for the  
runners that a postrace awards ceremony was canceled for fear of 
hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyans dominated the men's competition, placing 12 among the  
top 14 finishers. Eric Morrison of Lakewood, Colo., was the top 
American, finishing 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Omoro won the women's race at 53:37, one second ahead of  
Kenyan countrywoman Jane Ngotho. Six of the top 10 women's 
finishers were from Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Nnenna Lynch of Concord, Mass., led the American women,  
finishing ninth at 55:39. 
</P>
<P>
	Bikila and Omoro each won $5,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Rodgers, bidding for a world record for runners over the  
age of 50, fell 1:11 short of the current mark of 52:53. Rodgers,

<HEADLINE> Two Shootings at Student Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A year after a police shootout marred  
Black College Reunion, two shootings and a stabbing left three 
people in the hospital Sunday, two in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have that many people in such a condensed area,  
sometimes these things happen,'' said Officer Sherri Davis, a 
spokeswoman for Daytona Beach Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Black College Reunion started in 1984 as a small gathering of  
students from historically black Florida A&AMP;M University in 
Tallahassee and nearby Bethune-Cookman College. It now competes 
with Atlanta's Freaknik as the place to go for a ``black spring 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruising, partying and ogling members of the opposite sex are  
the primary activities of the event, which drew an estimated 
100,000 celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating whether the two shootings were  
connected because both were reported at about 4 a.m. on the same 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men, shot in the head, was listed in critical  
condition at Hallifax Medical Center. The other man, shot in the 
abdomen, was listed in stable condition at the hospital. Police 
would not release their names. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim was found at the Sea Dip Motel, the other down the  
street at the Copa Cabana Hotel minutes later. Police questioned 
three men in connection with the shootings, but no immediate 
arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, a Daytona Beach woman was stabbed in the  
neck following an argument at the Desert Inn. The victim, 
identified as Shaneta Leshawn Jones, 20, was listed in critical 
condition at Hallifax. No arrests were made, although Davis said a 
suspect was identified. 
</P>
<P>
	A stabbing Saturday in Ormand Beach, about 5 miles northwest of  
Daytona Beach, resulted in the arrest of an Orlando woman, who was 
charged with aggravated assault for allegedly wounding a man from 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	As of early Sunday, police had made more than 300 arrests, 12  
for firearms possession and related charges. They wrote about 2,400 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 329 arrests were made and 926 citations were written  
over the three-day event. A man was killed and four police officers 
were wounded in a shootout that year.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Several Russian insurance companies have hiked  
their rates for airlines because of potential problems caused by 
the year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies are concerned that Russia's airlines --  
many of which are broke and have poor safety records -- haven't 
prepared their computers, Viktor Gorlov, deputy director of the 
Russian Federal Aviation Service, told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Millennium Bug'' may wreak havoc if computers  
that only use two figures to designate a year misread the year 2000 
for 1900, and produce erroneous information. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's government and businesses have been slow to tackle the  
problem because of more pressing issues -- including a severe cash 
shortage -- over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gorlov said the insurance companies' fears were unfounded  
because the aviation service is ``doing everything possible'' to 
make sure the computer bug doesn't strike Russia's airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorlov admitted, however, that the Federal Aviation Service  
won't be able to enforce testing of all the airlines' computer 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget does not allocate any resources for this,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Milosevic Could Lose Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has  
backed himself into a corner where loss of power and trial as a war 
criminal may be inevitable, Clinton administration and military 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	That grim depiction of Milosevic's future came as an  
increasingly assertive Congress returns from two weeks off to 
debate whether to sanction the use of ground troops to drive 
Serbian forces out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and his aides have emphasized they will not  
negotiate with Milosevic, and the only way he can stop the NATO air 
strikes is to remove his troops from Kosovo, allow the refugees to 
return, give Kosovo autonomy and let in NATO peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, administration officials toughened that stance. White  
House chief of staff John Podesta said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' 
that Milosevic had started four wars in 10 years -- in Slovenia, 
Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo -- and that Yugoslavia could not become a 
real member of the European community with him in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, ``for them to create a stable situation, it looks to  
me like they are going to need a new leader,'' Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Brussels for NATO  
talks, said that with Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo, many elements of the peace settlement that the Kosovars 
accepted but Milosevic rejected last month ``have been overtaken by 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, on CBS' ``Face the  
Nation,'' said Milosevic would eventually be held responsible for 
his attacks on ethnic minorities. ``That means the International 
War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the United States could negotiate with someone it  
considers a war criminal, Talbott replied: ``We're not negotiating 
with Milosevic, we're bombing him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said  
that while he couldn't confirm reports of a mass grave in Kosovo, 
``I suspect ... that we are going to find more and more evidence of 
mass graves, mass executions, some pretty horrific stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials said the bombing was beginning to take a  
serious toll on the troops that have persecuted Albanian Kosovars 
and keep Milosevic in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to attack, degrade, disrupt and ultimately, if he  
doesn't comply to the demands of the international community, he is 
going to lose those forces.'' NATO's military commander, Army Gen. 
Wesley Clark, said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told  
ABC that the airstrikes had already begun to drive apart elements 
of Yugoslavia's 3rd Army, which is leading the attacks in Kosovo. 
He said the military and police were being hurt ``by the lack of 
fuel, the lack of ammunition, the lower morale as a result of now 
starting to be pounded by NATO air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be enough for many members of Congress. Sens.  
Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John McCain, R-Ariz., agreed on NBC that 
Milosevic was a war criminal and that it was a mistake for the 
administration to state from the beginning that the use of ground 
troops in Kosovo was not an option. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who recently returned from a trip to the Balkans with  
Cohen, said he would seek a resolution giving the president the 
authority to use all means necessary, including ground troops, to 
achieve the stated goals in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not achieving our objectives; (Milosevic is) achieving  
his,'' said McCain, a Republican presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is to meet with congressional leaders tonight to discuss  
Kosovo, and hold a more extended meeting with members of Congress 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen stressed that Clark and other NATO officials had not  
requested ground troops, but if that request came, plans could be 
drawn up fairly quickly. NATO last fall estimated that it could 
take up to several hundred thousand troops to overcome hostile 
Yugoslav troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said the air campaign was working but ``has a long way to  
go.'' He noted that Yugoslav troops are ``battle-hardened'' and 
that Milosevic has committed only one-third of his military 
capability to the Kosovo operation.

<HEADLINE> Torre, Yanks Get World Title Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Torre took a couple of steps, jogged a few  
more and then broke into a full trot. 
</P>
<P>
	His World Series ring -- the one bearing the words ``Best Ever''  
and ``Tradition'' -- was waiting near the mound, and he was in a 
hurry to put it on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipated walking out there, but the crowd started me  
running,'' the New York Yankees manager said Sunday. ``Building up 
to it was pretty emotional when you realize what it represents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was the last of the Yankees to receive his ring in  
ceremonies before an 11-2 romp over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the ballpark in uniform for the first time since surgery  
for prostate cancer in mid-March, Torre received a standing ovation 
from a crowd held down to 32, 398 by a gametime temperature of 44 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, he already had the new jewelry on the ring  
finger of his right hand, the place that used to occupy his 1996 
World Series prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-carat gold ring features the interlocking ``NY'' set with  
24 diamonds, one for each of the Yankees' record championships. It 
was Torre's wish that it said ``Best Ever'' after a record 125 wins 
that included a Series sweep of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shuts out '98,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Steinbrenner added his opinion, too -- he wanted an  
oval shape rather an square design, similar to the style Joe 
DiMaggio won and wore in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot is made about the money players make,'' Torre  
said, showing off his shiny hardware, ``but it's the ring that 
really drives you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig presented the rings from a table set up  
between the mound and plate. Most players ran out to receive them 
and walked back to the dugout admiring them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wonderful to get a ring. That's what everyone wants,''  
catcher Jorge Posada said. ``It doesn't happen to too many people 
that they get two rings in three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Yankees who did not take part was Roger Clemens,  
acquired in a February trade with Toronto. The Rocket, who has 
never won a Series title, made sure he saw what all the fuss was 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came off the field, he was looking at the ring,'' Torre  
said. ``The look in his eyes wasn't envy, it was hunger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Strawberry, rehabilitating at extend spring training, and  
Andy Pettitte, currently on the disabled list, came in person to 
collect their rings. General manager Brian Cashman, Don Zimmer and 
the coaching staff, the medical staff and clubhouse personnel were 
among those also taking part. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what the team's all about,'' Torre said. ``We earned  
this ring. It was a team effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Wells, Graeme Lloyd, Tim Raines and Homer Bush, part of  
the '98 club but now playing elsewhere, probably will get the rings 
when their teams visit Yankee Stadium later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, meanwhile, plans to wear his '98 ring all the time,  
though he'll also find plenty of time to sport his '96 version. 
</P>
<P>
	And if all goes well, Torre hopes to return to the Yankees as  
their full-time manager in 3-4 weeks. He's started to work out and 
says he feels fine, yet does not want to rush his health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first of next month is a pretty good barometer,'' Torre  
said. ``My wife can sense that I need to get to the ballpark.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Accepts Vietnam Rememberance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Former President Gerald Ford recalls  
April 1975 as the toughest month in his presidency, but is 
gratefully accepting a symbol of those days for his namesake 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The staircase from the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam that was climbed  
by hundreds of evacuees fleeing the war-torn nation in 1975 now 
stands as a permanent exhibit at the lobby of the Ford Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's a monument of hope and not despair for it  
symbolizes man's undying desire to be free,'' Ford said at 
Saturday's opening of ``The American Century'' exhibit at the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy in what is now Ho Chi Minh City has been razed. The  
United States intends to build a new consular office in its place. 
Only the 18 metal steps from the sixth-floor staircase remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides American personnel and military, more than 6,000  
refugees were airlifted from the rooftops of the embassy compound 
in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit includes Charles Lindbergh's flight suit, FDR's  
wheelchair, Truman's briefcase, the Wright brothers' stopwatch, a 
Ku Klux Klan robe and the safety plug from the atomic bomb that 
leveled Nagasaki.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Bank Called Insolvent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese financial regulators decided to place a  
debt-ridden regional bank under government control Sunday after 
declaring the institution insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Reconstruction Commission moved to take over  
Tokyo-based Kokumin Bank after the bank conceded it could not 
restructure on its own, commission chief Hakuo Yanagisawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency, another bank regulator, found  
last week that Kokumin had amassed a huge capital deficit, and 
warned it would be dissolved unless it came up with fresh funds 
from affiliated firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a law enacted last year to shore up Japan's tottering  
financial system, the government will protect all Kokumin deposits 
and the bank will continue operations under the management of three 
government-appointed administrators. Meanwhile, the FRC will look 
for a private financial institution to take over Kokumin. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokumin's bad loans will be absorbed by the state-run Resolution  
and Collection Corp., Japan's version of the U.S. Resolution Trust 
Corp., which cleaned up the savings and loan fiasco of the 1980s. 
The Bank of Japan will also provide special loans to guarantee 
Kokumin's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank examiners have discovered that Kokumin, with 40 domestic  
branch offices, had amassed a capital deficit of $413 million by 
September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokumin Bank ran into financial trouble through massive soured  
real estate loans it made during the Japan's speculative ``bubble'' 
economy of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the FSA shifted the focus of its investigations  
from major banks. It has been inspecting the books of Japan's 64 
regional banks and 60 second-tier regional banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government took over the operations of major lender  
Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. in December.

<HEADLINE> FAA Tests Computers for Y2K Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- As Convair Three-Niner approaches the runway at  
Denver International Airport, the airplane also is nearing an 
imaginary boundary: the dreaded Year 2000 witching hour. 
</P>
<P>
	It is moments before midnight, in a crucial test of the Federal  
Aviation Administration's computer system. The clocks in the 
airport control center are about to turn from Dec. 31, 1999, to 
Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The controller calls out, ``Time is one minute prior to entering  
the new millennium in our test systems. How do you read this 
transmission?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the Convair replies: ``Loud and clear, and if we  
disappear off the screen, it means we went into the next 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A minute later, after the clocks hit Jan. 1, 2000, and the plane  
remains a radar blip on approach to Runway 16, the controller calls 
back, ``You are now flying in the Year 2000 in our test system. How 
do you read this transmission?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reply: ``It's loud and clear. It went right through the  
sound barrier very nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it went late Saturday and early Sunday, as the FAA tested its  
Y2K computer fixes. Checked were systems that control radar screens 
and radio transmissions, ground traffic, airport weather reports 
and the status of landing lights and remote radio beacons. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines also was on hand, testing its own Y2K fixes. The  
carrier, the nation's largest, beamed imaginary Year 2000 flight 
plans from its headquarters in Chicago to Gate B-41 at Denver 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials held a dress rehearsal March 27 and conducted  
lesser drills on three other occasions. But the weekend test was 
the first open to reporters. It was intended to bolster public 
confidence in the nation's aviation system as the century crossover 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who stayed up well past 2 a.m.  
MDT (4 a.m. EDT) to watch the four-hour test, was pleased with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, you had to watch the clock to be aware it was  
changing,'' Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Long, head of the FAA's Y2K program, told agency workers  
before the test: ``Our success will be gauged by the fact that 
nothing will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way many older computers are programmed, some  
software interprets years in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 
1999. The concern is that unless software is modified, computers in 
various industries will malfunction when the calendar changes from 
``99'' to ``00,'' which may be interpreted as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a special concern in aviation, where computers track  
airplanes from takeoff to landing. Some travelers have sworn off 
flying as Dec. 31, 1999, turns to Jan. 1, 2000, fearing planes may 
collide or fall out of the sky because of computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the head of Australia's Qantas Airlines said he and  
his top executives would not fly on New Year's Eve because of the 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those on hand for this weekend's test was Kenneth Mead,  
inspector general of the Transportation Department. In the past, he 
has been critical about the FAA's preparation for the Year 2000 
changeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to a year ago, I have a much higher confidence  
level,'' Mead said after the test. ``My guess is that a lot of 
attention will shift to airport readiness, international readiness, 
to smaller entities in the air carrier business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mead said he is concerned that parts of Eastern Europe, Africa  
and Asia are not adequately preparing their computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably fly on January 1 in U.S. airspace,'' Mead said,  
``but I'm not going to fly in foreign airspace where there are 
these unknowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, the State Department is expected to release a list of  
countries it suggests avoiding around New Year's because of air 
control computer questions.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Accused of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to  
an Olympic gold medal, has been accused by one of his former figure 
skaters of sexual misconduct, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Maurizi, who skated for Callaghan and later became a  
colleague, told the newspaper they began having sex in 1981 and he 
now thinks he was exploited by one of the sport's premier coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan denied having a sexual relationship with Maurizi, the  
Times said. Callaghan contends the accusations are a ploy to rob 
him of his skaters at the Detroit Skating Club, where he had been 
director of competitive skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Disbrow, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association,  
said Maurizi informed him last month of the accusations. Disbrow 
said his organization cannot act until it receives a formal 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi planned to submit the complaint in a few weeks, the  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disbrow was in Sweden for a weekend competition and attempts to  
reach him there were unsuccessful. Messages were left at his home 
and office outside Minneapolis, and another call to figure 
skating's headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo., was not 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi, now 36, said the relationship started after Callaghan  
moved to Philadelphia to coach. Maurizi, who began working with him 
when he was 13, finished fifth nationally in pairs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, I thought the sex was consensual,'' Maurizi told  
the Times. ``Now when I look back, I don't think it was consensual. 
I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a boy or a girl, a 
coach should never have sex with a student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi never reported any misconduct by Callaghan before. He  
told the newspaper he is able to discuss the matter now because of 
the support of his wife and therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said it spoke with Callaghan for four hours at his  
office in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and interviewed four dozen 
skaters, coaches, officials, agents and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this,'' Callaghan said. ``The allegations  
are awful. I can't believe I worked my butt off for kids to be 
successful in skating to be better people and this stuff happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, with Maurizi assisting, coached Lipinski to a 1998  
Olympic gold medal. He also coached Todd Eldredge to five national 
titles and a world championship. He and Maurizi split as coaching 
colleagues last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, there have been only four years in which Callaghan  
didn't have one of the top three skaters in either the men's or 
women's singles in the U.S. national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nicole Bobek and Eldredge won national titles in 1995, he  
became the first coach in 45 years to train the men's and ladies' 
champions in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, 53, is married with a grown daughter. He resigned as  
director at the Detroit Skating Club in March, telling the Times he 
was tired of the travel and coaching grind. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Johns, chief executive of the skating club, did not  
immediately return a call.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Launch High-Tech Biz in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six years ago Hideaki Morishita turned his  
back on a secure but frustrating job with Japanese 
telecommunications giant NTT Corp. and struck out for America with 
a dream of launching an Internet business. 
</P>
<P>
	Morishita's experiment in personal initiative is paying off. His  
M.M. Systems, based in suburban Torrance, builds Web sites for a 
growing clientele of companies doing business in Japan or among 
Japanese expatriates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan it's, 'You have to do this, you have to do that,' ''  
Morishita said. ``I can do what I want to here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What was a bold and radical step when Morishita made his move in  
1993 is becoming more common as Japan struggles with recession and 
record-high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	No agency keeps statistics, but observers say an increasing  
number of young entrepreneurs frustrated by Japan's slow-moving 
business culture are forsaking their homeland to seek their 
fortunes in America's high-tech marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	A more fundamental shift is taking place as well. Japanese  
corporations are studying the business model that emerged from 
Silicon Valley during the late 1980s in which small, flexible 
companies often rise quickly based on the ability to rapidly 
develop and market new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend marks a sharp change from the 1980s, when U.S.  
businesses scrambled to emulate their Japanese counterparts. 
Momentum shifted eastward across the Pacific during the 1990s as 
U.S. companies took the lead in quickly developing new computer 
software and Internet technologies while Japan's economy began to 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '80s, studying Japanese management was very popular for  
Americans. It's totally different now. It's more Japanese 
professors and scholars coming to the U.S. to study the Silicon 
Valley entrepreneurial spirit,'' said Junko Matsubara, a manager of 
business development for Mitsubishi International, an arm of the 
Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Indications of change are evident on both sides of the ocean.  
</P>
<P>
	At a recent conference in Los Angeles, the Japan External Trade  
Organization brought dozens of U.S. and Japanese companies together 
to strike deals and cross-pollinate with new ideas. In Northern 
California, Stanford University's US-Japan Technology Management 
Center and the International Business Incubator in San Jose perform 
similar functions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan some 40 corporations, including NTT, the Japan  
Development Bank and Toshiba Corp., are members of Smart Valley 
Japan, a 400-member group created to foster the entrepreneurial 
spirit. The group is patterned after Smart Valley Inc., a Silicon 
Valley booster group formed during the recession of the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely a trend toward more entrepreneurship, more  
startups in Japan,'' said Richard Dasher, director of the US-Japan 
Technology Management Center. ``There's a great deal of interest in 
the model. Many people are coming here to find out how the model 
works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge is to apply it in a way that fits Japanese culture  
and sensibilities. Some of the very elements that have made the 
high-tech U.S. entrepreneurship successful -- fast-forming alliances 
and quick movement to markets -- clash with the Japanese business 
tradition of careful, deliberate planning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, young entrepreneurs such as Morishita are  
seeking their fortunes in the United States. In Japan, 
incorporating a new business costs $80,000 or more, and companies 
are slow to do business with newcomers. The requirement was 
intended to prevent fly-by-night companies that prey on consumers. 
But the law also has become a barrier to the creation of small 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Morishita was able to incorporate M.M. Systems  
for $4,300, including fees and attorney costs. Businesses seeking 
bilingual Web sites came to him looking for help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the Internet is far more accessible in the United  
States.	   A basic connection that costs $20 per month in the United States 
runs $100 or more monthly, plus per-minute connection charges, in 
Japan. Businesses and consumers alike have been slow to embrace the 
new medium, said Akira Tsuruname, who left his Japanese employer 
more than two decades ago to start his own business consulting 
service, California Coordinator. Now he helps Japanese business 
owners get started in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the real capitalist country,'' he said. ``Japan is a  
capitalist country, but it is a little more socialized. Also, now 
we are going to an information society. All the structure for the 
information society is here in the USA, and its open.''

<HEADLINE> Panel: IOC Doing OK on Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Members of an ethics panel that blistered the  
IOC last month for the Salt Lake bribery scandal gave a qualified 
endorsement today to the committee's efforts at reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and members of his  
commission said the International Olympic Committee appeared to be 
on the right track but more time was needed to see if meaningful 
changes would be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed to shifts in the selection of Olympic host cities,  
establishment of two panels to rebuild the IOC and oversee the 
behavior of its members, and the expulsion of six delegates as 
signs that the committee seemed committed to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected that reform would occur immediately with the  
totality we suggested it would occur,'' Mitchell said. ``But we 
hope and expect it will be meaningful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell and members of his panel will testify Wednesday at  
Senate Commerce Committee hearings on the Olympic scandal. Mitchell 
refused to say what he would tell the committee, although he said 
the federal law that governs Olympic sports in the United States 
``make congressional review of the Olympic matters proper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his March 1 report, Mitchell said the IOC had fostered ``a  
culture of improper gift-giving'' that led to the Salt Lake 
vote-buying scheme. The ethics panel said drastic change was 
needed, including accountability for IOC members and a public look 
at the committee's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	After commending the U.S. Olympic Committee for acting  
``promptly and decisively'' in adopting a smaller list of 
recommended changes and ``accepting its share of responsibility'' 
for the scandal, Mitchell said the IOC actions were at an ``interim 
stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the international committee -- with some 100 members  
representing different cultures from around the globe -- should not 
be held to the same timetable for quick action. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to give people time to do things,'' the Maine  
Democrat said. ``While we commend the USOC for moving rapidly, we 
have to accept the fact that others move at a different pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More would be known, he said, after an IOC session in June hears  
from a reform commission including Henry Kissinger, Peter Ueberroth 
and USOC president Bill Hybl. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of Mitchell's panel, baseball union chief Donald Fehr,  
said it would be ``many months'' before the IOC's future was clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Fehr and two other ethics members, Roberta Cooper Ramo and Jeff  
Benz, said they, too, liked the IOC's initial reaction to the 
scandal and their panel's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Benz, a former figure skater who serves on the USOC's  
athletes advisory council, was dismayed that only six of the 24 
sets on the IOC 2000 reform panel had been filled, and that no 
athletes had been picked so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Fehr said he was disappointed that IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch had declined an invitation to testify before the Senate 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramo, an Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer, said she was hopeful that  
Samaranch would take this opportunity to ``change the IOC in a 
powerful, positive way'' and adopt a ``true legacy of reform that 
the whole world would applaud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few domestic recommendations of Mitchell's panel  
still in limbo is a request that the IOC be declared a public 
international organization, making bribery of its members subject 
to the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. Mitchell said he had been in 
contact with the White House about the request and that a meeting 
would be scheduled for further discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, whose independent inquiry was appointed by the USOC,  
addressed the committee's board of directors on the findings. As he 
and other commission members left the podium to a standing ovation, 
Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, took 
the floor to issue a ``formal public apology to this group on 
behalf of Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of a few people caused the grief here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As it wrapped up two days of meetings dominated by the Salt Lake  
scandal, the USOC also: 
</P>
<P>
	-- adopted minor changes to drug rules that permit random tests  
of Olympic and Pan American team members up to 120 days before 
competition, a 30-day extension. Task force head Baaron Pittenger 
said the added time would make it easier to catch cheating during 
training, since users of performance enhancers often start to taper 
drug use 90 days before a meet. 
</P>
<P>
	-- heard a status report on the committee's $26 million program  
to produce more U.S. medals at the Olympics. The first year of the 
plan for winter sports, dubbed Podium, produced 17 medals and a 
record 55 top-10 finishes at world championships, according to Norm 
Bellingham, its director. The program's goal is 26 medals at the 
2002 Winter Games, double the record-tying 13 from last year's 
Nagano Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> QB Couch Works Out for Browns Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- With Cleveland Browns coach Chris Palmer  
supervising a 115-pass workout, Tim Couch made his final bid Sunday 
to be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Palmer pronounced himself satisfied with Couch's  
performance, but declined to say whether the Kentucky quarterback 
or Oregon quarterback Akili Smith had the edge with six days left 
before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say they're neck and neck coming down the stretch,''  
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland also is considering selecting Texas running back Ricky  
Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, or trading the top pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's 90-minute morning workout was held at a field house  
adjacent to Kentucky's Commonwealth Stadium. In attendance were 
Cleveland owner Al Lerner, football operations director Dwight 
Clark, president Carmen Policy and about eight other members of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The workout was Couch's second for the Browns. On March 11, in a  
workout run by Couch and his agent, Tom Condon, he threw about 45 
passes for officials from Cleveland and several other NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, with Palmer running the show, Couch threw in all  
directions and at all distances, from a straight drop and while 
rolling out. He also stopped a third of the way through to run a 
pair of 40-yard dashes. The quarterback said he was timed in 4.8 
seconds and 4.9 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch rarely was asked to throw the ball deep downfield in  
Kentucky's offense, which emphasized short passes and screens, and 
his arm strength has been questioned by some pro scouts. The 
quarterback said he threw about 15 deep balls for the Browns on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer had said before the session that he wanted to see how  
Couch performed when he was tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did get winded,'' Couch said, showing off his sweat-soaked  
T-shirt. ``But I think my arm stayed in pretty good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condon said he thought he might have a sense of what the Browns  
will do with the top pick by early in the week, but Policy said the 
team probably will not make a final decision until hours before the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans Saints want to discuss a trade with the Browns  
that would bring them the No. 1 pick. Saints coach Mike Ditka 
recently said he was willing to trade all his 1999 draft picks to 
Cleveland for a chance at selecting Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said the offer is intriguing.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you can get that blockbuster trade that gives you a  
combination of picks, presently and in the future, that can really 
set you up for the next 12 years, I think that we'd be very, very 
foolish not to give serious consideration to that alternative,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Duval Doesn't Continue Winning Roll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- No need to measure David Duval for a green  
jacket just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's top-ranked player came to the Masters on a major  
roll, having already won four tournaments and more than $2.5 
million this year. But his first major title is still an 
unfulfilled goal, scuttled at Augusta National by an erratic wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had the best round of anyone Sunday, a 2-under-par 70 in  
ruthless conditions, but it was only good enough to tie for sixth. 
The 3-under 285 left him five shots behind winner Jose Maria 
Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in playing well. I came in thinking well,'' said Duval,  
one of only seven players to break par amid the swirling winds and 
slick greens. ``But I failed to quite put it all together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's scorecard looked more like a Christmas tree, filled with  
the red and green numbers that Augusta uses to note the non-par 
scores. The man who prides himself on calm, consistent excellence 
endured a roller-coaster of a round that included an eagle, six 
birdies, six pars, four bogeys and a double-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly not expect to do that normally,'' he said  
with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who began the day six shots back at 1-under, moved onto  
the leaderboard with an eagle at No. 2 and birdies at 7 and 8. The 
gallery began to swell when he rolled in a 12-foot birdie putt at 
10 to move 5-under -- only two shots off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I was in very good position heading into the back  
nine,'' Duval said. ``But some poor shots and some untimely 
mistakes really hurt me in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's first miscue came at 11, the lead hole in Amen Corner.  
</P>
<P>
	He cut his tee shot off the tee and landed wide of the fairway  
on the right, 200 yards away. The flag was placed in a perilous 
position -- the back, left corner of the green, just a short roll 
from the pond -- so he pulled out of a 4-iron and tried to play the 
safe shot to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the ball sailed left, bouncing a couple of times before  
it rolled off in the water. Duval took a penalty, followed with a 
poor chip past the hole and two-putted for a double-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just failed to pull off the shot I was trying to hit,'' he  
said. ``Then, with the wind coming from the right, there was only 
one place the ball was going to go, and that was the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval redeemed himself with a brilliant 3-iron at the par-5 13th  
after his tee shot sailed into the tree, lodging against a pine 
cone. From that awkward position, he knocked his second shot on the 
green and two-putted for birdie, pulling back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, his wedge let him down, contributing to bogeys on three of  
the next four holes. His second shot at 14 sailed to the far 
reaches of the green, leading to a three-putt from 50 feet. At 17, 
he plopped down short of the green, was forced to chip on and 
two-putted for another bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pride myself on being a good wedge player,'' he said. ``But  
I failed to perform with those in a big way this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval managed only one par on the back nine, his erratic card  
looking like it belonged to someone like John Daly: birdie, 
double-bogey, par, birdie, bogey, birdie, bogey, bogey, birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval had played the two previous weekends prior to Augusta,  
winning both The Players Championship and the BellSouth Classic. As 
it turned out, that may have zapped his strength at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to think you're going to win that much,'' he said.  
``As we all know, winning takes more out of you than finishing 25th 
or 30th. But I felt my preparation was what it needed to be. I came 
in here obviously playing well. It just didn't quite happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing tied for second at the 1998 Masters, Duval was  
the clear favorite to win this time. It was a role he knew was 
deserved but accepted with trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sometimes unfair to say one player should win an event,''  
Duval told a reporter. ``You can pick whoever you want every week, 
and I'd take the field and bet you everything you want every week. 
Odds are, you're going to lose.''

<HEADLINE> Cards Honor Hall of Fame Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- There's more company for the once-solitary Stan  
Musial statue outside Busch Stadium, now that the St. Louis 
Cardinals have unveiled a likeness of Hall of Famer Red 
Schoendienst. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoendienst, 76, was honored today prior to the Cardinals-Reds  
game. He's been with the team for 51 years -- 15 as a player, 12 as 
manager, 20 as coach and the last four as special assistant to 
general manager Walt Jocketty. 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze statue catches Schoendienst in mid-air at second  
base, kicking up dust as he makes the pivot on a double play. He 
said the only thing lacking from the statue, which is taken from a 
1946 World Series photograph, is the body of Johnny Pesky sliding 
beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made me better looking,'' said Schoendienst, who also  
threw out the first pitch Sunday, with Musial on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fellow Cardinals Hall of Famers attended the ceremony  
along with about two thousand fans. Among the baseball dignitaries 
were Musial, Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Whitey Herzog, Enos Slaughter, 
Marty Marion, Bob Forsch and Danny Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the statue, I like it a lot,'' said Cox, a pitcher for  
the Cardinals in the 1980s. ``It shows some ingenuity, some 
thought. Not just some guy standing with a bat in his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Schoendienst statue follows the unveiling of a Gibson statue  
and a bust of broadcaster Jack Buck outside the stadium last year. 
Later this summer, the Cardinals plan to honor Brock and Slaughter 
in similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Schoendienst paid tribute to new Cardinals ownership  
that has not forgotten the team's past. Since the new group bought 
the team from Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. in 1996, the uniform numbers 
of Schoendienst (3), Smith (1), Slaughter (9) have been retired and 
Busch Stadium has been modernized. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're fixing up the ballpark and keeping this game going in  
St. Louis,'' Schoendienst said. ``It is outstanding, for them to do 
what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Schoendienst has been a fungo machine for the  
Cardinals. He's backed off some lately, although he keeps as active 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to hit them for hours,'' he said. ``Not anymore. Buddy  
Bates, our clubhouse guy, said he was going to get me two fungo 
bats. He said you lean on one now and now you'll be leaning on two, 
as old as you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schoendienst had a .289 career average with 2,449 hits, played  
in 10 All-Star games and tied or led the league in fielding seven 
times. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989.

 *Brother John Sellers    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brother John Sellers, a blues and gospel singer  
who started his climb to fame at age 5, died March 27. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers performed regularly in the early 1960s at Folk City, a  
Greenwich Village nightclub where musicians including Bob Dylan, 
Paul Simon and Joan Baez sang early in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born in Clarksville, Miss., where he was inspired by  
street performers like Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson. By 
age five, he had begun singing, dancing and playing the tambourine 
in church-organized tent shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later gospel singer Mahalia Jackson saw Sellers  
perform, and brought the boy, whose parents had abandoned him, to 
Chicago with her. As Jackson's fame grew, they sometimes sang 
together, and Sellers occasionally filled in for her at concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers made two recordings for Vanguard Records' new jazz line  
in the mid-1950s, teaming up with musicians like Sonny Terry, 
Johnny Johns and Jo Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during a Folk City performance in 1961 that choreographer  
Alvin Ailey noticed him. The two later collaborated on Ailey's 
``Blues Suite'' and ``Revelations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers' final performance with the well-known Ailey company was  
in 1997. At his death, he was involved in litigation with the 
troupe over royalties and the copyright to ``Revelations,'' one of 
Ailey's most famous compositions.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Robert Widman, a retired reporter with The  
Plain Dealer, died Friday of cancer. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Widman worked at The Plain Dealer from 1967 to 1987. His work  
included a series of stories on the abusive treatment of prison 
inmates and coverage of a 1970 state loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked at The (Elyria) Chronicle-Telegram and The (Upper  
Sandusky) Daily Chief-Union before joining The Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	He became an antiques dealer when he retired.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Lazio in Giuliani's Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- In the race for the U.S. Senate seat  
being vacated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Rep. Rick Lazio 
is best known as ``the other Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main Republican is, of course, New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani, who is considering a race that could pit him next year 
against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other Democrat,'' U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey, has said she would  
not run if Mrs. Clinton does. Neither Giuliani nor Mrs. Clinton 
have said yet whether they will run. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio, however, has made no such pledge not to take on Giuliani  
in a GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-term congressman from Long Island concedes he won't run  
if the state's top Republican, Gov. George Pataki, asks him not to, 
but he said both the governor and former GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato 
``have been very generous with their advice.'' The governor's 
advice, he said, has been ``helpful and constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with relations between Pataki and Giuliani still chilly --  
the mayor crossed party lines in 1994 to back then-Gov. Mario Cuomo 
over Pataki -- a number of other Republicans think Pataki may put 
his muscle as well as his advice behind Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key factor is that conservatives tend to control  
Republican primaries, even in New York, said Jay Severin, a veteran 
GOP political operative. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Giuliani supports homosexual rights and was against  
President Clinton's impeachment -- Lazio voted for impeachment -- 
Severin said GOP primary voters ``are not for the new brand of Rudy 
Republicanism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, the Republicans have an elephant as a mascot. One of the  
elephant's characteristics is a long memory and a bad temper,'' 
Severin added. ``Rudy opposed Pataki and endorsed Cuomo ... (and) 
the people who remember that, who don't forget it and don't forgive 
it, are all the people who vote in a Republican primary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani also is suffering fallout from the fatal shooting by  
New York City police of an unarmed African immigrant. A Quinnipiac 
College poll out last week found the mayor's job approval rating 
among city voters at the lowest level of his six-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio has been crisscrossing traditionally Republican upstate  
New York for several months, meeting with local party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represents a fresh, young leadership perspective for the  
Republican Party,'' Erie County GOP Chairman Robert Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really a bright light,'' Joseph Laughney, Broome County's  
GOP chairman, said after meeting Lazio for the first time Thursday 
over lunch. ``He's got a certain freshness about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio fits the state Republican GOP's preferred profile for  
statewide candidates almost to a T. He's Roman Catholic, from the 
politically crucial suburbs surrounding New York City, supports 
abortion rights and favors the death penalty. He is Italian on his 
father's side and Danish on his mother's. He looks younger than his 
41 years and already has more than $2 million in his campaign bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is a matter of recognition.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask somebody in Los Angeles who the mayor of New York  
City is, there's a 50 percent chance they'd know,'' Laughney said. 
``If I went up and down the street and said, `Congressman Lazio,' 
no one would know him, even in Binghamton.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Workers Union Promotes Boycott / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Raised in the potato and strawberry fields  
of northwestern Ohio, Baldemar Velasquez has been fighting for the 
rights of migrant workers for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He led a seven-year boycott of Campbell Soup Co. that  
transformed workers from sharecroppers to employees, giving them 
unemployment benefits, workers' compensation and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Velasquez fears that not only his union but the whole fruit  
and vegetable industry in Ohio and Michigan are threatened because 
food producers can find less costly non-union labor in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll abandon this area,'' he said. ``It's about the  
survival of the industry and the growers here. We'd like to retain 
the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Velasquez and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee he leads have  
enlisted labor unions, churches and minority organizations in a 
boycott of the Mount Olive Pickle Co. -- the South's largest pickle 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it's an unfair tactic because farmers are the  
ones hiring the farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm workers union wants Mount Olive to sign contracts with  
its cucumber pickers, most of whom are temporary workers from 
Mexico and Central America. The union says the workers are forced 
to live in unsafe homes, exposed to dangerous pesticides and get 
cheated on pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	If the boycott isn't successful, the union believes that  
companies such as Campbell, Heinz and Vlasic also will look to the 
South, which is considered non-union territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Each spring, hundreds of migrant workers come to the cucumber  
patches that are mixed in with the rows of corn and soybeans in 
northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two states are among the top five in cucumber production.  
Ohio's crop brings in $12.2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has contracts with 50 growers in Ohio and 11 in  
southeastern Michigan. It's not affiliated with the better-known 
United Farm Workers, but the two unions have a history of working 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Success came slow for the union in its early years. During the  
boycott against Campbell Soup in the 1980s, it took years before a 
church or labor group would pledge support. 
</P>
<P>
	Now as the boycott against Mount Olive begins, the union is  
counting on its old allies for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not starting from scratch. We know a whole lot more  
about running a boycott and putting pressure on our allies,'' said 
union spokesman Mike Ferner. 
</P>
<P>
	Velasquez and his supporters are visiting with church groups,  
student organizations and minority groups in the South -- attempting 
to draw a parallel between the struggles of the field workers and 
those of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Olive president Bill Bryan is speaking to those same  
organizations, taking time out to personally answer questions from 
consumers. ``We think we've been wrongly targeted, because we have 
a well-known brand name and a good product,'' Bryan said from 
company headquarters in Mount Olive, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Olive sells an estimated 80 million jars of pickles a  
year, primarily in the South and Mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it has been a struggle for the union to organize workers  
in North Carolina where they are paid by how much they pick. Most 
earn an average of $3.90 an hour, according to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are reluctant to allow union representatives onto their  
land to hand out pamphlets and make their pitch. They fear higher 
wages will put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we're taking very good care of our workers,'' said  
Stan Eury, executive director of the North Carolina Growers 
Association. ``We're very concerned about (the union's) willingness 
to tell misinformation about their cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Velasquez won't guess how long he expects the boycott to last.  
But he does offer this: 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll always have more time than the company has money.''

	Photos Show Possible Mass Grave  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Western officials today expressed  
alarm over reports of atrocities in Kosovo, saying a possible mass 
grave site had been spotted. In Belgium, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea 
showed aerial photographs of the site in Pusto Selo, southwest of 
the Kosovo capital, Pristina. British officials also said about 
100,000 ethnic Albanian men are apparently missing. Meanwhile, NATO 
continued to hammer Serb targets. Belgrade itself was unscathed in 
overnight air attacks, but attacks in and around Pristina were 
heavy.

	US Officials Take Aim at Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several U.S. officials said today that  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should be tried for war 
crimes. ``I think he is a war criminal,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, 
D-Del., told NBC. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, on CBS, 
said Milosevic would be held responsible for his acts by the 
International War Crimes Tribunal. Meanwhile, some lawmakers want 
the Clinton administration to consider ground troops in the 
campaign against Milosevic. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urged a 
resolution that expresses support for all military options, 
including ground troops. It's ``foolishness to say that you are not 
allowed to exercise any option or at least threaten,'' he said.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force scrambled today to

stranded in a useless orbit. The Defense Support Program satellite 
was launched Friday aboard an Air Force Titan rocket. Air Force 
officials said the Boeing-built motor separated as planned from the

nine others, the Iraqi military reported. The U.S. Central Command 
confirmed that American planes had attacked Iraqi missile batteries 
100 miles south of Baghdad, but gave no word of casualties. The 
attacks were in retaliation for anti-aircraft fire and a 
surface-to-air missile attack on ``coalition aircraft,'' the

<HEADLINE> Nets Retire Williams' No. 52 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Buck Williams, a blue-collar power  
forward who set 10 team records in eight seasons in New Jersey, had 
his No. 52 retired by the Nets today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special honor,'' Williams said before his number was  
raised to the rafters at the Continental Airlines Arena. ``I think 
every athlete thinks in terms of having their number retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony took place at halftime of the Nets' game against  
the New York Knicks. A first-round draft choice of the Nets in 
1981, Williams started his career in New Jersey and ended it this 
year after two seasons with New York. In between were seven seasons 
with the Portland Trail Blazers, with whom he twice went to the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	While Williams had fond memories of his time in New Jersey, many  
of his thoughts Sunday focused on the Knicks' struggles and the 
plight of coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose job reportedly is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is a phenomenal coach,'' Williams said. ``The Knicks  
would be doing themselves an injustice to fire coach Van Gundy. I 
think he has worked harder than a lot of the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few people outworked Williams during his 17-year NBA career. He  
is the Nets' all-time leader in scoring (10,440), rebounds (7,576), 
games (635), minutes (23,100), field goals made (3,981), field 
goals attempted (7,234), free throws made (2,476), free throws 
attempted (3,818), offensive rebounds (2,588) and defensive 
rebounds (4,988). 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he got the most out of his talent and that's what you  
want to be able to say to every athlete,'' said Hall of Famer 
Willis Reed, a Nets senior vice president who coached Williams in 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' fondest memory with the Nets came in the spring of  
1984 when New Jersey eliminated defending champion Philadelphia in 
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Nets center Mike Gminski said no one story or event can  
sum up Williams' career. He was just a player who showed up every 
night and gave everything he had. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amazing thing, and most people don't realize this, is that  
he was a power forward and he never weighed more than 225 pounds,'' 
Gminski said. ``He was so strong inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five other Nets players have had their numbers retired -- Drazen  
Petrovic (3), Wendell Ladner (4), John Williamson (23), Bill 
Melchionni (25) and Julius Erving (32).

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Seeks Jury's Mercy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A serial killer who managed to delay  
his conviction in 11 murders for 14 years now seeks to convince a 
jury that he should spend the rest of his life in prison rather 
than be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Charles Ng, a Hong Kong native and veteran of the  
U.S. Marine Corps, will offer mitigating evidence starting Monday 
with testimony from mental health professionals, jailers and family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Public Defender William Kelley will seek to counter the  
heart-wrenching accounts given by victims' families to jurors 
during the penalty phase of the trial, which determines whether Ng 
will receive death by injection or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said he will spend a week calling witnesses and promised  
``a couple of surprises,'' but declined to give details. Members of 
Ng's family are expected to testify for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, 38, was convicted Feb. 24 of killing six men, three women  
and two baby boys in a 1984-85 spree of kidnapping, bondage and 
sadism. The penalty phase began last month and resumes after a 
three-week break. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng and co-conspirator Leonard Lake incriminated themselves with  
videotapes they made while threatening and tormenting women they 
held as sex slaves before their killings in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Kathy Allen, 18, seen in April 1985 wearing  
handcuffs and being threatened on a videotape made by her captors 
at Lake's rural house in Wilseyville, about 150 miles east of San 
Francisco. Another woman, Brenda O'Connor, was seen pleading in 
vain for the lives of her husband and baby as Ng cut off her shirt 
and bra in view of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-woman, three-man Orange County jury saw the scenes  
repeatedly during the guilt portion of the trial, which began Oct. 
26. Dian Allen, younger sister of the slain woman, rushed from the 
courtroom in tears at the sight of her sister being brutalized on 
television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never replace a family member, never,'' Allen said  
later. ``All the things she missed out on in life. It's just not 
fair; and how it destroyed my life, it's just not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lake, a fugitive on a weapons charge, killed himself with a  
cyanide capsule after police arrested him for shoplifting in San 
Francisco in 1985. Police soon turned up evidence that linked him 
to a series of missing-person cases, all suspected homicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake left behind plans to kidnap and force women to play out  
sadistic fantasies. Victims' remains were found buried around his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng fled to Canada, where he fought extradition for six years  
before the Supreme Court of Canada ordered him returned. 
</P>
<P>
	His trial was moved south to Orange County in 1994 because of  
heavy news coverage in Northern California. But it took five more 
years to begin, making it one of the longest criminal cases in 
California history. The mercurial defendant hired and fired 
lawyers, represented himself for a time and found numerous legal 
issues that delayed the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to testify, then changed course at the very end, took  
the stand and denied killing anyone. He insisted he was subservient 
to Lake, helping him bury two bodies, but said he never killed 
anyone himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health professionals are expected to testify this week  
about Ng's psychological state, and state prison officials will 
likely tell of what they describe as good behavior in detention. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Ng's family have not appeared in court. Kelley  
declined to say where the family members reside but he said they 
would be flying to California to assist the defense. He said he was 
unable to predict whether Ng himself would take the stand and plead 
for mercy.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Return to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge will consider the amount of a fine  
tomorrow for American Airlines' pilot union, held in contempt over 
a February sickout that canceled thousands of flights and cost 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered the Allied Pilots  
Association to make a $10 million down payment, about 25 percent of 
the union's worth, toward a fine levied for the three days pilots 
defied his back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute between the union and the air carrier reached a  
fever point over American's decision late last year to buy Reno 
Air. The union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated into 
American from the Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
effected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Their inability to reach an agreement led to a massive sickout  
of about 2,500 pilots over 10 days in February, resulting in the 
cancellation of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,  
estimates the work stoppage cost the company more than $50 million. 
The APA contends that the sickout was within the union's rights, 
saying the company had violated the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	As the union contends with the dispute with its company, as well  
as the contempt fine before the court, APA also is dealing with 
several civil lawsuits. Several passengers have filed lawsuits 
against the union because their flights were disrupted by the 
sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, which have all been moved to federal court in  
Dallas, seek damages of more than $200 million. Attorneys expect 
the complaints will be consolidated into a single class-action 
lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while the pilots brawled with the company over the Reno Air  
purchase, flight attendants were able to reach an agreement with 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Professional Flight Attendants and AMR  
reached a settlement last week on how to absorb the low-cost 
carrier. They did not disclose details.

<HEADLINE> Florida Eases Plastic Surgery Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida's Board of Medicine on  
Sunday eased new policies aimed at safeguarding outpatient cosmetic 
surgery after complaints from plastic surgeons that the rules were 
too strict. 
</P>
<P>
	The state regulatory board relaxed rules approved in January  
that limited the length of office surgery and required medical 
doctors in anesthesiology to be present during operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to micromanage surgeons,'' said Dr. Fuad  
Ashkar, a board member who proposed the compromise. ``However, we 
need to guarantee patient safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the board voted to limit office surgery to four  
hours per operation, heeding experts who believe lengthy, 
multipurpose procedures increases risk. It also approved tougher 
anesthesiology rules; previously, nurses had been allowed to sedate 
patients without a doctor's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations came after reports of 18 deaths in the state  
related to cosmetic surgery from 1997 to March of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The relaxed rules expand the allowed length of procedures to six  
hours and again sanctions nurses to administer anesthesia to 
patients -- this time to patients who sign waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The board left intact regulations abolishing overnight stays at  
doctors' facilities and reducing the amount of fat that can be 
removed from a patient during liposuction. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rulings followed public testimony from surgeons, nurses  
and representatives of statewide medical associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have also adjusted policies governing use of  
sedatives in outpatient surgery after reports of problems. A law 
that goes into effect next January in California requires proof of 
training for dentists using oral sedatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of New Jersey tightened policies governing anesthesia  
use in doctor's offices following the death there of a young child 
who was sedated and left unmonitored.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Pitcher Charged With DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle Mariners pitcher Mac Suzuki was charged  
with driving under the influence and hit-and-run driving following 
an accident near the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki's yellow Humvee was impounded early Friday morning after  
he was stopped by police investigating a report that an unoccupied 
car had been hit shortly after midnight PDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said his blood alcohol level was close to .14  
percent, which would be well over the legal threshold of .08 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old rookie pleaded innocent Saturday in King County  
District Court and was freed on $1,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Jack Magan said he did not know the extent of the  
damage to either vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a typical DUI stop except for that the driver was a  
Mariner,'' Magan said. ``There was no effort to resist arrest. The 
driver cooperated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki, a native of Kobe, Japan, has played seven seasons in the  
minor leagues and also appeared in six Mariners games last year and 
two this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His longest outing was Saturday night, following his release,  
when he gave up one run and two hits in three innings as the 
Mariners lost to Oakland 11-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners pitching coach Stan Williams said he learned of the  
arrest only on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising to me because I didn't even know he imbibed.  
You can't find a finer young man,'' Williams said. ``It shows you 
that ballplayers are human beings.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Up 14 Cents Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices jumped 14 cents per gallon  
nationwide because of seasonal demand, OPEC cuts in crude oil 
production and fires at California refineries, an industry analyst 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pump prices were highest in California, where the average price  
jumped 43.11 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices jumped, leaped, exploded -- your pick,'' said analyst  
Trilby Lundberg, who runs the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas 
stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average price for all grades and services on Friday  
was $1.2281 -- a 14.12 cent hike from the last survey three weeks 
ago. Prices have soared since Feb. 21, when the average gasoline 
price was only 99.8 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``A combination of three main elements caused the price  
turnaround,'' she said. ``First, the California refining problems, 
then higher crude oil prices ... and, as far as gasoline is 
concerned, we're entering a stronger demand period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries cut daily oil output by 2.1 million barrels as part of a 
unified effort with non-OPEC members to strengthen prices for crude 
that had been languishing at a 12-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheapest gas nationwide was in Atlanta, Ga., where  
self-serve regular unleaded was going for 95.30 cents, Ms. Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists were hardest hit in California, where the unweighted  
average price for regular unleaded was $1.6390. Explosions at two 
refineries -- including one at a Tosco Avon refinery Feb. 23 that 
left four workers dead -- have sent prices soaring in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for gasoline has also been increasing as spring kicks  
into gear; people tend to drive less in the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorist Geoff Leonard groused about the price hike while  
filling the tank of his Volvo station wagon at a San Francisco 
Chevron station on Sunday. The price tag: $18.68 for 10 1/2 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' said Leonard, 42, of San Francisco. ``It's the  
largest increase I've seen since the early '80s. It's 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices at the station were $1.77 a gallon for regular unleaded  
and $1.97 a gallon for premium unleaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pay it and you have no choice,'' Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though refinery problems should disappear soon and the supply  
picture is normalizing, Ms. Lundberg saw no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big picture is that even if prices in California and the  
nation should peak soon, we are unlikely to see those ultra-low 
1998 price levels any time soon,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-service prices nationwide were $1.1717 for regular, $1.2733  
for mid-grade and $1.3590 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	At full-serve stations, the prices were $1.5258 cents for  
regular, $1.6140 for mid-grade and $1.6876 for premium.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The special effects-filled adventure ``The  
Matrix'' held its No. 1 spot at the box office, while spring break 
crowds gave Drew Barrymore's back-to-school film ``Never Been 
Kissed'' a strong opening, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix,'' bringing in $22.2 million, stars Keanu Reeves in  
the story of a computer hacker who finds out that reality isn't 
what it seems. The film has emerged as the year's second breakout 
hit, grossing $72.9 million in just two weeks, according to 
estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' was the year's first breakout hit.  
</P>
<P>
	But not even the wizardry of ``The Matrix'' could pull the year  
out of its post-''Titanic'' syndrome. After a momentary upturn when 
``The Matrix'' opened, the overall box office was once again down 
last weekend, this time 4.4 percent, from last year's weekend, when 
``City of Angels,'' ``Lost in Space'' and ``Titanic'' were going 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than half the nation's young people on vacation last  
week, youth-oriented films predictably dominated the top 10 -- with 
a mixed bag of results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never Been Kissed,'' with a strong $11.7 million, led the  
pack. The hip-hop comedy ``Foolish'' opened with $2.26 million in 
10th place for an impressive per-screen average of $7,410 -- even 
though its studio, fearing bad reviews, didn't screen the movie for 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``10 Things I Hate About You,'' the loose adaptation of  
Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' slid 38 percent in its 
second week to finish fourth with $5.2 million. The movie played 
particularly well to vacationing teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
	But another new film, the Sundance Film Festival favorite ``Go''  
opened with a somewhat disappointing $4.7 million for sixth. Sony 
is now counting on strong word of mouth to keep the critically 
praised rave-scene film from plummeting into oblivion when most 
kids go back to school this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $22.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $5.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Analyze This,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Go,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Forces of Nature,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Twin Dragons,'' $2.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Doug's 1st Movie,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Foolish,'' $2.26 million.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Glad To Be at Wrigley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- They've spruced up Wrigley Field, given the  
scoreboard and flagpole a touch of paint, replaced some old seats 
with more comfortable ones and erected a statute outside the old 
ballpark in memory of Harry Caray. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar ivy may still be dead-of-winter brown and the air  
will be plenty chilly when the Chicago Cubs open their home season 
Monday against the Cincinnati Reds, but no one will be happier to 
return to ``The Friendly Confines'' than struggling Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be good not only for me but for everybody,'' Sosa  
said, looking to his first home appearance since winning the 1998 
National League MVP. ``Opening day is always big. It's going to be 
fun to go back there. Even though we've been playing for a week, 
home is home. That's always special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa will sprint from the third-base dugout just before the  
first pitch, head straight to the right-field bleachers and then 
veer off to the left at the last second like a jet. The fans will 
cheer, bow and chant his name, just before he blows his familiar 
kiss and then pitter-patters his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	What the bleacher bums will really be looking for -- besides a  
nine-inning excuse to have fun -- is a Sosa homer. And so far in 
1999, they have not been plentiful, especially after his 
unforgettable 66-homer season a year ago and his 12-homer spring. 
Sosa finally hit his first homer Sunday against the Pirates, but is 
just 2-for-21 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm swinging much better. It's going to come,'' Sosa said as  
the Cubs played in Pittsburgh before heading home. ``I never get 
down on myself. I've been here before. This isn't the first time it 
happened to me. I got 600 at-bats to catch up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April has never been a big month for Sosa. After his homer  
Sunday, he'd hit 29 of his 274 career homers in the season's first 
month. Last year he set a major league record with 20 in June, 
seven more than he had in April and May combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit 35 homers last season at Wrigley and 31 on the road.  
But he actually batted higher (.315 to .300) and had more RBIs 
(81-to-77) away from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he will be the center of attention Monday and that's how  
he likes it.

	Photos Show Possible Mass Grave  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Western officials today expressed  
alarm over reports of atrocities in Kosovo, saying a possible mass 
grave site had been spotted. In Belgium, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea 
showed aerial photographs of the site in Pusto Selo, southwest of 
the Kosovo capital, Pristina. British officials also said about 
100,000 ethnic Albanian men are apparently missing. Meanwhile, NATO 
continued to hammer Serb targets. Belgrade itself was unscathed in 
overnight air attacks, but attacks in and around Pristina were 
heavy.

	US Officials Take Aim at Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several U.S. officials said today that  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should be tried for war 
crimes. ``I think he is a war criminal,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, 
D-Del., told NBC. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, on CBS, 
said Milosevic would be held responsible for his acts by the 
International War Crimes Tribunal. Meanwhile, some lawmakers want 
the Clinton administration to consider ground troops in the 
campaign against Milosevic. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urged a 
resolution that expresses support for all military options, 
including ground troops. It's ``foolishness to say that you are not 
allowed to exercise any option or at least threaten,'' he said.

	Air Force Seeks Rescue Satellite  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force scrambled today to  
rescue a $250 million missile-warning satellite that was left 
stranded in a useless orbit. The Defense Support Program satellite 
was launched Friday aboard an Air Force Titan rocket. Air Force 
officials said the Boeing-built motor separated as planned from the 
satellite seven hours after liftoff. If the satellite cannot be 
salvaged, the failed mission will have cost taxpayers $682 million.

	Iraq: Allies Hit Civilian Targets

<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Allied planes struck civil and military  
targets in southern Iraq today, killing two people and wounding 
nine others, the Iraqi military reported. The U.S. Central Command 
confirmed that American planes had attacked Iraqi missile batteries 
100 miles south of Baghdad, but gave no word of casualties. The 
attacks were in retaliation for anti-aircraft fire and a 
surface-to-air missile attack on ``coalition aircraft,'' the 
Central Command said in a statement from its headquarters in 
Florida.

	Ex-CIA Chief Reportedly Probed

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's former top spy reportedly was the  
target of a Justice Department investigation into whether he 
mishandled sensitive information. CIA technicians found 31 secret 
files in the unsecured personal computer at the home of the former 
Director John Deutch shortly after he left the post, Newsweek 
magazine said today. The Central Intelligence Agency turned the 
case over to the department, which investigated for a year before 
deciding not to file charges, the magazine said. Deutch resigned

	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Two shootings and two stabbings left  
four people in the hospital today during a spring break-style 
gathering known as Black College Reunion. Despite the violence, 
Mayor Bud Asher said the incidents were isolated and called the 
three-day event a success. Police are investigating whether the two

hardest hit in California, where the unweighted average price for 
regular unleaded was $1.6390. The price tag for a motorist to fill

	Olazabal Wins Masters  
</P>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Jose Maria Olazabal, a 33-year-old Spaniard,  
won the Masters for the second time today. Olazabal survived the 
conditions at Augusta National by not making a bogey over the final 
13 holes. He finished his 1-under 71 with a 4-foot par putt. 
Olazabal shot a 280 for the tournament to beat Davis Love III by 
two strokes. It was the highest winning score in the Masters in 10 
years.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Human Skeleton Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bones of a woman found on California's  
Channel Islands may be among the oldest human remains found so far 
in North America, and could support theories that the first 
Americans came by sea rather than over a land bridge, scientists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones of the so-called Arlington Springs woman are probably  
13,000 years old, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. That would 
make her slightly older than the oldest known human skeletons in 
North America, which were found in Montana, Idaho and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bottom line is she may be the earliest inhabitant of North  
America we have discovered. It's a find of national significance,'' 
said John R. Johnson, curator of anthropology at the Santa Barbara 
Museum of Natural History, which is part of a team researching the 
woman's bones. 
</P>
<P>
	However, results of the team's investigation have not yet been  
submitted to peers for critical review and have not been published 
in scientific journals. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was described in a paper presented March 30 at the  
Fifth California Islands Symposium at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional theory has been the first humans in North  
America came from northern Asia during the Ice Age, crossing a 
bridge of exposed land to Alaska and then spreading across country 
between glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
	The location and apparent age of the Channel Islands discovery  
suggests at least some of the first settlers could have come to 
North America by boat and spread along the coast, instead of 
inland, researchers contend. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains -- two thigh bones -- were discovered at Arlington  
Canyon on Santa Rosa Island 40 years ago and kept at the Santa 
Barbara museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, researchers at the museum and Channel Islands National  
Park conducted DNA and radiocarbon tests unavailable when the bones 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were performed by Stafford Research Laboratories in  
Boulder, Colo., one of the nation's pre-eminent carbon-dating labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists performed two sets of tests, one producing an  
estimate the bones are 11,000 years old and a second giving an age 
of about 13,000 years, the Times said.

<HEADLINE> Norman's Song Remains the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Greg Norman said he didn't believe in  
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Over and over, through all four days of the Masters, he kept  
insisting what's done was done. To prove the point, he went out and 
showed he could play Augusta National differently from the way he 
had every time before. This time, he was patient. This time, he was 
prudent. And purposeful, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, the result was the pretty much the same.  
</P>
<P>
	He finished close enough to the man for whom the green jacket  
was destined to know his measurements by heart. On this day, it was 
slipped over the shoulders of Jose Maria Olazabal. Three years ago, 
it was Nick Faldo. Nearly a decade before that, the names were 
Larry Mize and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing that has changed, Norman said one more time  
Sunday, is his perspective on the losses. Shoulder surgery sent him 
to the sideline for nearly a year. He rediscovered his family and 
his motivation, and found the calm that a hectic schedule and the 
pressures of competing had kept hidden all these years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much like I did yesterday and the day before, like  
I did a couple months ago,'' Norman said after a closing round of 
73 left him in third place, two strokes behind Olazabal and one 
back of Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had done this 20 years ago, have this kind of fresher  
approach on life. Because this has been very, very good for me. And 
if it's been good for me,'' he added, ``then it's going to be good 
for me in the game of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
	If Norman arrived at Augusta no longer tortured by his past, he  
has to be leaving it -- brave words aside -- with some lingering 
concerns about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Climbing into contention in his first major back must be  
satisfying to Norman, especially given the long and painful 
rehabilitation. Finding a new way to lose, though, has to be 
gnawing away at the edges of his self-assured new self. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's be clear: Norman didn't collapse. No single flaw in his  
game proved fatal. He didn't fire at sucker pin positions and he 
didn't pull the wrong club from his bag. He didn't put too much 
spin on his approach shots at the wrong holes or make a loose swing 
in a tight situation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was tied for the lead at 7-under when he stepped onto the  
14th tee Sunday and he bogeyed that hole and the next. Even though 
he made eagle at No. 13, a par-5 of 485 yards, by going for the 
green in two, Norman showed enough maturity to play No. 15, a par-5 
of 500 yards, as a three-shot hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy wound up backfiring when he hit his approach shot  
into the right bunker, then exploded to 12 feet and missed the par 
putt when the ball curled on the lip and spun out. And his 
explanation for the wedge shot that found the right greenside 
bunker at No. 15 was the only time all day he sounded like the old 
Norman -- the one who never lacked for an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had mud on the ball, it was 94 yards, and I tried to squeeze  
a sand wedge in there,'' he said. ``The ball seemed to sail a 
little bit right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On some other day, against someone less opportunistic than  
Olazabal, Norman might have gotten away with it. He started the day 
two strokes behind, shot 73 to Olazabal's 71, on a day when only 
seven players in the entire field broke par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he deserves the jacket as much as anybody else,'' the  
Spaniard said afterward. ``When we were in the scoring tent, I 
said, `I really enjoyed your company today. Just keep on trying. 
You have the game and you deserve the jacket. Hopefully, you will 
get it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That same scene, with a different cast of characters, played  
itself out all day long. One after another, Norman's fellow pros 
fell out of contention and came to the interview room after their 
rounds were complete to say he was now the guy they were rooting 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the horrible collapse of 1996, when Norman  
squandered a six-stroke lead to Faldo, but what made even the 
toughest of his competitors reach out to him then is the same bit 
of character that made them do so one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	For lack of another word, call it grace -- a quality that hadn't  
been observed around Norman until that humbling loss three years 
ago. Before that, he made excuses when he lost, he was arrogant and 
not beyond flaunting his wealth. Sometimes, in private, he unfairly 
trashed reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace is a funny thing that way. Lose it once, and usually it's  
gone forever. Now that Norman has it in his grasp, he'd better hold 
on tight. He said after 1996 that he was certain all those freakish 
losses had been a test for something, though he didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspicion is that he was being tested, all right, by losing  
over and over until he got it right. On Sunday, he demonstrated 
that part of the lesson is over. Now we will find out if Norman 
will ever be ready to start winning the big ones. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fires Close South Florida Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A smoldering 600-acre fire flared back into life  
early Sunday, closing part of a rural road for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Highway patrol closed 15 miles of road for about six  
hours Sunday, said Renee Chidnese with the Florida Division of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators do not know what restarted the fire. However, the  
area in a mostly undeveloped area of southern Miami-Dade County is 
thick with maleleuca trees, which ignite easily and produce a lot 
of smoke, Ms. Chidnese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a 450-acre fire in North Carolina that forced  
evacuation of more than 50 homes was declared contained early 
Sunday. No one was injured, no houses were damaged and the evacuees 
were allowed to return home late Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Female Inmates Report Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inmates of state prisons and local jails,  
especially woman, are much more likely than the general population 
to have suffered physical or sexual abuse as children, the Justice 
Department reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports of abuse are overwhelmingly concentrated among  
female inmates, who represent only a little over 7 percent of the 
state prison and jail population. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 36 percent of the female state prison and jail inmates  
surveyed in 1996 and 1997 reported they were abused sexually or 
physically at age 17 or younger, the department's Bureau of Justice 
Statistics said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 16 studies of child abuse in the general  
population found that 12 percent to 17 percent of women were abused 
as children, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among male inmates of state prisons, 14 percent said they  
suffered child abuse, compared with 5 percent to 8 percent of the 
general male population, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the  
Feminist Majority Foundation. ``The women who end up behind bars 
have had a very hard life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Childhood abuse increases the risk that anyone -- female or  
male -- could end up in prison,'' Smeal said. ``Women abused as 
children have their whole self-image changed. They believe they are 
bad. They end up in relationships with men who abuse them and in 
risky situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some end up in drug abuse and are forced into prostitution,''  
she added. ``The police arrest prostitutes, but usually not their 
male clients. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found alcohol and drug abuse was higher among inmates  
who suffered abuse than among those who did not. Among state prison 
inmates, 80 percent of the abused women and 76 percent of the 
abused men had used illegal drugs regularly, compared with 65 
percent of the women and 68 percent of the men who had not been 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting sexual or physical abuse at any age before  
imprisonment, the survey found that nearly half of the women in 
prison or jail or on probation had suffered such attacks, compared 
with only 10 percent of the men in the same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	This five-to-one ratio may simply reflect the established fact  
that more women than men suffer physical or sexual abuse. In 
addition to differences in size and strength, ``men are trained to 
fight back, and women are trained to cry,'' Smeal said. ``So women 
are a much more abused population than men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that one-third of women in state prisons  
and one-quarter of those in local jails had been raped before they 
were incarcerated. Only 3 percent of men reported they had been 
raped before incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	Abused state prisoners were more likely than those not abused to  
have ever served time for a violent crime. Among males, 76 percent 
of abused inmates, compared with 61 percent of those not abused, 
had a current or past sentence for a violent offense. Among women, 
45 percent of the abused, but only 29 percent of those not abused, 
had ever served a sentence for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisoners reported higher levels of abuse if they grew up at  
least partly in foster care rather than with parents, if their 
parents were heavy drug or alcohol users or if a family member had 
been imprisoned. The study noted that many foster children had been 
removed from homes where they were abused by parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found little difference in the percentage of abused  
parents growing up with one parent or those with two parents.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Looking for Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks finally play their home  
opener Monday night, and they hope 10 games at Bank One Ballpark 
will bring a reversal of fortune following a 1-5 start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get back home and try to change things,'' shortstop Tony  
Batista said. ``I don't know if it will be any easier. It's not 
easy anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motivation should be no problem for the Diamondbacks, because  
Los Angeles is expected to send Chan Ho Park to the mound against 
Arizona's Andy Benes in the first game of a four-game series 
between the two NL West rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, the Diamondbacks accused Park of intentionally  
throwing at Matt Williams' head after Williams homered off him. 
</P>
<P>
	The dugouts emptied for some shoving and a lot of name-calling,  
and the umpires warned both teams not to retaliate. Los Angeles won 
the game 3-2 in 10 innings, one of two extra-inning victories in 
the Dodgers' sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Park was not scheduled to pitch in the Diamondbacks series, but  
Los Angeles' game against San Diego Sunday was rained out, the 
first rainout at Dodger Stadium in 11 years. Park's start then was 
moved back a day to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes (0-1, 9.64 ERA) was pounded by the Dodgers in Arizona's  
6-4 loss in his first game last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rainout also washed out Thursday's scheduled rematch between  
Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown. Johnson will go Thursday, but with 
the Dodgers rotation pushed back a day, his opponent likely will be 
Darren Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks were playing down any payback factor in the  
Dodgers' series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to have the home field on our side,'' manager  
Buck Showalter said. ``We played them in LA and didn't have much to 
show for it. It's not revenge we're after. Whether it's LA, the 
Marlins or the Braves, we still have to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks limp home with three extra-inning losses.  
Closer Gregg Olson has blown three save chances, the latest in a 
3-2 loss to Atlanta on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Stottlemyre had gotten Arizona to the ninth inning, but  
Olson gave up two runs and second baseman Jay Bell committed a 
costly error. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks were 1-2 in Atlanta, with the only victory  
coming in Johnson's complete game, 15-strikeout 8-3 performance on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a tough stretch travelwise,'' said Stottlemyre,  
who has yet to get a decision despite two strong performances. ``We 
played LA and then had to come across the country and play Atlanta. 
There's no question about it. It will be good to get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Giants play a three-game series at Bank One  
Ballpark beginning Friday. The homestand concludes next week with 
three against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	While relief pitching has been a major headache for the  
Diamondbacks, there have been some positive aspects. The starting 
rotation has been as strong as advertised, and the Diamondbacks 
have hit 13 home runs in six games against some of the best 
pitching in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona might have Tony Womack, who has been on the disabled  
list with a fractured right wrist. Womack played last week for 
Triple-A Tucson. The NL leader in stolen bases the last two 
seasons, Womack is slated to be Arizona's leadoff batter. 
</P>
<P>
	His return likely will mean Bernard Gilkey will go to the bench,  
even though Gilkey has gotten off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we want to play sound baseball,'' Bell said. ``If  
we do, eventually things will come our way.''

<HEADLINE> Mid-Level Stocks Could Be Bargain / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the midst of the great Wall Street debate  
over the relative merits of big stocks vs. small, some analysts 
think a worthy answer lies in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the so-called mid-capitalization, or mid-cap, stocks  
haven't soared to the sky-high valuations that some blue chips and 
technology giants have reached lately. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, their partisans say mid-cap companies may have  
a better chance of competing successfully in the world economy of 
the early 21st century than smaller companies, many of whose stocks 
have been in a prolonged slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it may be a step down from the blue-chip realm,  
investing in mid-caps isn't exactly slumming. The mid-cap ranks 
include names like Tiffany &AMP; Co., Harley-Davidson, Abercrombie &AMP; 
Fitch and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, while blue chips have soared and small stocks  
have sagged, mid-cap stock performance has generally been, well, 
middling. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the 12 months through March 31, according to preliminary  
numbers from CDA Wiesenberger in Rockville, Md., stock mutual funds 
modeled on the blue-chip Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index posted a 17.92 
percent gain, while small-cap funds tumbled 15.37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The average mid-cap fund approximately split that gaping  
33-point difference, edging up 3.73 percent. Mid-caps showed 
stirrings of life in March, however, climbing more than 5 percent 
to outpace large stocks, small stocks, the S&AMP;P 500 funds and just 
about everybody else in the ranks of diversified domestic stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been singing the praises of the midcap sector of late,  
as we shy away from the relatively high valuations of large-cap 
growth stocks,'' says A. Marshall Acuff, investment strategist at 
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. ``Faster earnings growth is the reason we 
believe that select mid-caps will continue to close the gap with 
large-caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Definitions of what constitutes ``mid-cap'' status can very  
considerably on Wall Street. Acuff sets the boundaries at $1 
billion to $10 billion in market capitalization, or the total value 
of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the potential for greater earnings growth has long  
been a prime reason cited by ``emerging-growth'' advocates for 
investing in small, or even micro-cap, stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche  
Bank Securities Inc., the economic picture ``is not a happy one for 
small companies. They face enormous competition. They don't have as 
much access to global markets as bigger companies. They don't have 
resources to innovate and to leverage innovations in global 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, this is a caricature,'' Yardeni adds. ``There are  
bound to be some gems out there. But they are likely to be 
purchased by Microsoft before they become the next Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Yardeni's eyes, conditions are very bullish for the small  
universe of big-cap market leaders. The problem is that everyone 
knows this and their stock prices are not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	Argues Acuff: ``The global growth that boosted the performance  
of the large multinationals has become an anchor as global turmoil 
continues. While some regions of the world may be starting to 
improve, we believe that large-cap valuations already reflect these 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, as we expect, a rebound in Asia and Latin America takes  
some time to work through, large-cap valuations could suffer in the 
meantime. However, the powerful domestic economy will continue to 
drive demand, in our opinion, and the beneficiaries will be those 
companies with a strong domestic presence, such as the mid-caps.''

<HEADLINE> Medicines May Prevent Colon Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A combination of aspirin and  
cholesterol-lowering drugs, already used by millions of Americans 
to keep their hearts healthy, may also significantly lower their 
risk of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	New research presented Sunday suggests that these two ubiquitous  
medicines appear to offer a potent -- if unintended -- shield against 
a disease that kills about 48,000 a year in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Data from both people and animal studies suggest that together  
they may eliminate cells in the earliest stages of cancer before 
they grow into full-blown malignancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is based on a new analysis of the powerful class of  
cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins. The research, 
conducted by doctors from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in 
New York City, was released at the annual scientific meeting of the 
American Association for Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful example of drugs that are already  
available that may have an entirely different and important use,'' 
said Dr. Frank Rauscher of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Protective effects of aspirin and similar inflammation-fighting  
medicines against colon cancer are already suspected from earlier 
studies. But the possible role of the statin drugs has been much 
less clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors often prescribe aspirin and statins at the same time to  
prevent heart disease. Statins lower high cholesterol levels that 
clog the heart arteries, while aspirin makes the blood less likely 
to form clots that get stuck in tortuously narrowed arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work suggests that the same drugs prevent colon cancer  
by entirely different mechanisms. Although the precise actions are 
still murky, scientists theorize that they stop cells in the 
earliest stages of cancer from dividing and induce them to commit 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	No human studies have been set up specifically to test these  
theories. However, data are available from several large studies on 
heart patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Banke Agarwal and colleagues examined the results of three  
of these studies involving more then 15,000 patients. The studies 
were designed to test how well Mevacor and other statins ward off 
heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Agarwal said the studies suggest that the statins protect  
against colon cancer, but only when combined with aspirin. In one 
of the studies, nearly all of the volunteers took aspirin. Those 
also getting a statin had a 43 percent reduction in colon cancer. 
However, in another of the studies, only 17 percent took aspirin, 
and there was no cancer reduction among patients receiving a statin 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``On their own, statins may not decrease colon cancer. They only  
increase the effect of aspirin against cancer,'' said Agarwal. 
</P>
<P>
	To check this idea, the researchers tested Mevacor and an  
aspirin-like drug called sulindac on rats at risk of developing 
pre-cancerous colon growths. They found that Mevacor reduced these 
growths by 12 percent, while sulindac reduced them by 15 percent. 
But together they reduced the growths by 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Agarwal said that while the results are promising, more research  
is necessary before doctors prescribe these drugs solely to prevent 
colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In another study at the meeting, Dr. Tao Liu presented data  
suggesting that genetic testing may help identify people at high 
risk of rare inherited forms of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	These cancers often occur because of errors in so-called  
mismatch repair genes, which look for copying errors that crop up 
in genes during the production of new cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers tried out an experimental test that looks for  
these bad repair genes. They found 70 percent of people with the 
inherited colon cancer tested positive with this method.

<HEADLINE> Mets Hobble Home for Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza is on the disabled list with a bum  
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Reed is hobbling with a strained Achillies' tendon.  
</P>
<P>
	While the Mets are winning, they head into Monday's home opener  
against Florida a little beat up. 
</P>
<P>
	``A championship team deals with injuries all year, and the fact  
that it's Mike makes it a big injury for us to overcome,'' Orel 
Hershiser said after Sunday's 6-3 win at Montreal. ``It's the first 
hurdle we've got to clear to have a good year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Jones (1-0) pitches against Livan Hernandez (0-1) on what  
figures to be a wet, cold day at Shea Stadium. The Mets had an 
advance sale of about 45,000 coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just feels like the season didn't start yet because we've  
been on the road, so tomorrow I guess the season will start,'' 
closer John Franco said after Sunday's game. ``We'll have our own 
crowd behind us, rather than everyone else's. We've played two home 
openers, Florida and here, and now we'll have our own, and guys can 
get settled in and get apartments and get used to the home 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the Mets' first game at Shea Stadium since their  
season-ending flop last year, when they went 0-5 and scored just 
seven runs, finishing one game behind Chicago and San Francisco in 
the NL wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will be Bobby Bonilla's first game at Shea Stadium in a  
Mets uniform since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some pretty good opening days for New York, so that's  
one positive thing,'' Bonilla said. ``But everybody's really pretty 
fired up. We were able to do a nice job here in Montreal, which was 
very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are 5-2 and have won five of six since losing their  
opener at Miami last Monday. But Piazza's absence will be sorely 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's decision to sign the six-time All-Star to a $91  
million, seven-year contract signaled a renewed commitment by 
ownership to field a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Leiter then decided to stay, too, getting a $32 million,  
four-year contract, and free agent third baseman Robin Ventura 
signed a $32 million, four-year contract. The Mets also acquired 
Bonilla and reliever Armando Benitez in trades, and signed Rickey 
Henderson and Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was placed on the 15-day disabled list Sunday, even  
though he didn't feel the injury was that severe. Without Piazza, 
Todd Pratt becomes the starting catcher for at least 2-3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they'll be disappointed that he's not there because  
he's such a great player,'' said first baseman John Olerud said. 
``He's the guy for us, offensively-speaking, and so it definitely 
hurts having him out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we have a good team. We have a lot of good guys on  
this team, guys that can swing the bat, so hopefully we can pick up 
the slack until he comes back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was due to have an MRI on Monday. He was hurt Sunday trying  
to stretch his game-tying RBI single into a double. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to miss my next start,'' he said. ``I don't think  
I will. It started to stiffen up but after I got some ice I was 
able to walk around.''

<HEADLINE> Israel May Take Control of Nazareth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Nazareth's mayor said Sunday he will reject any  
move by Israel to take control of the locally elected city council, 
paralyzed by simmering Christian-Muslim tensions in the town of 
Jesus' boyhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ramez Jeraisi said he fears Israel might dissolve the body  
and appoint its own representatives to the council, where parties 
elected in November have so far failed to cobble together a 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the principal obstacles to a coalition is a sectarian  
dispute over a plan to build a plaza to accommodate the anticipated 
flood of Christian pilgrims for the millennium. Muslims want the 
site for a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Interior Minister Eli Suissa launched an inquiry Sunday  
into the political impasse. With the year 2000 only eight months 
away, Christian-Muslim tensions are harming Israel's plans to turn 
Nazareth into a showcase now that Bethlehem, Jesus' traditional 
birthplace, is under full Palestinian control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow the city of Nazareth, where millions of  
pilgrims are anticipated in 2000, not to function as it should,'' 
Suissa said in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the half-acre plot next to the Church of the  
Annunciation erupted into violence last week during Easter 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Townspeople, who once prided themselves on their coexistence,  
saw cars overturned, stores firebombed and a dozen people injured 
in stoning attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeraisi, who is a Christian, told The Associated Press that he  
has received several death threats, the most recent a few days ago. 
He said he would resign if Israel makes its own appointments to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will struggle against it, and we will not accept such a  
step,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> How To Decide on Hormone Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Women deciding whether to use hormone  
replacement therapy to ease the transition through menopause may be 
swayed by factors other than the medical risks and benefits, a new 
study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, college graduates were more likely to use hormone  
replacement therapy than women with less education, and women in 
the South and West were more likely to be users than women in the 
Northeast, according to the study in the Annals of Internal 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The influence of factors such as education and region rather  
than clinical considerations such as heart-disease risk show a need 
for greater efforts to define which women are most likely to 
benefit from the therapy, the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an ideal world, we would think it would be a person's risks  
and benefits that would be driving this decision,'' Dr. Nancy L. 
Keating, researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based on a 1995 survey of 495 women aged 50 to 74,  
showed that 38 percent had used hormones after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest factor was a medical consideration: 59 percent of  
the women who had undergone hysterectomies used hormone replacement 
therapy, compared with 20 percent of those who had not. In 1992 
guidelines, the American College of Physicians said postmenopausal 
women who had had hysterectomies were likely to benefit from the 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also were wide variations in hormone replacement  
therapy use that coincided with nonmedical factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said 54 percent of the college graduates surveyed used  
hormone replacement therapy, compared with 37 percent of those with 
high school diplomas and 30 percent of those without diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Geographically, the therapy was used by 45 percent of the women  
in the South, 42 percent in the West, 32 percent in the Midwest and 
22 percent in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating said the results showed a lack of uniformity in weighing  
the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There clearly is a lot of uncertainty about who really is the  
ideal candidate -- who is going to benefit and who is not,'' she 
said. ``Both physicians and their patients are not entirely 
clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the therapy has been shown to decrease symptoms of  
menopause and help women get through their menopausal years, there 
is uncertainty about its long-term use to prevent disease and 
prolong life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to improve  
cholesterol levels and bone density. Some observations, unproven by 
clinical trials, indicate it may lower the risk of heart disease 
and broken bones but may also increase the risk of breast cancer, 
Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	While awaiting further studies, she said, patients and  
physicians ``must try to do what they can with available data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illustrating the uncertainty, Dr. Jennifer Daley of Beth Israel  
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston wrote in an editorial in the 
journal that she was having trouble making up her own mind whether 
to use hormone replacement therapy and that the survey showed more 
study is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Current recommendations suggest committing generations of  
women to decades of a preventive treatment that offers potentially 
dramatic positive effects on their health and longevity, unpleasant 
side effects for some and unclear risks for breast cancer,'' Daley 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we think of another example of a medical intervention,  
requiring millions of patients to take daily medication for many 
years, in which we have an incomplete understanding of the medical 
science and know even less about the motivations, attitudes, 
perceptions and decision-making styles of the women we want to 
help?'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	If the decision is perplexing for Daley, it is all the more  
confusing for others, Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very well-educated physician who understands the  
data,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Mourn Missing Sightseers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- An overflow crowd of more than 1,000  
people attended a memorial service Sunday for Carole Sund and her 
15-year-old daughter Julie, whose deaths on a trip to Yosemite 
National Park remain unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners at Sacred Heart Church remembered the mother and  
daughter in pictures, poems, prayers and songs. 
</P>
<P>
	On the altar, Julie's violin lay propped on her purple and  
silver cheerleading pom-poms. On a table beside it were tulips and 
irises from her mother's garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where we move on,'' Jens Sund, her husband, said  
before the service. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother and daughter and 16-year-old Argentine exchange  
student Silvina Pelosso were last seen alive Feb. 15, starting a 
massive search. Last month, Mrs. Sund's and Silvina's bodies were 
found in the trunk of their burned rental car. Julie's body was 
found a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Thomas Keys urged mourners to remember positive things  
about Julie and Mrs. Sund as they struggled to understand their 
violent deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anger, hate and fear are powerful emotions. But so are hope,  
love and faith,'' Keys said. ``We have to remember that out of 
darkness comes light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, was remembered as a devoted mother, competent  
businesswoman and tireless volunteer for neglected children. Julie 
was remembered as an accomplished musician and a fiercely loyal 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last people to speak was 13-year-old Gina Sund, who  
wrote a poem about her mother and sister and asked people not to 
despair when they see her around town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of my mother laughing in a chair, and her smile and  
happiness,'' she said as the crowd wept.

<HEADLINE> St. John's Artest May Head to Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Artest, a third-team All-America last season  
as a sophomore, has decided to forgo his final two seasons at St. 
John's and make himself eligible for the NBA draft, The Associated 
Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Artest who spoke on condition of anonymity  
said Sunday the 6-foot-6 swingman, who led the Red Storm to the 
NCAA tournament regional final last month, will announce his 
decision Tuesday. It is planned that he will make the announcement 
at a news conference at the community center in his Queensbridge 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest led St. John's (28-9) in scoring last season at 14.5  
points and also grabbed 6.3 rebounds, but had one of his worst 
offensive games of the season in the Red Storm's 77-74 loss to Ohio 
State in the South Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest had nine points and nine rebounds in what turned out to  
be his final college game, but he was 4-for-10 from the field, 
including 1-for-5 from 3-point range. He also had five turnovers in 
the opening 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recruited to St. John's by former coach Fran Fraschilla  
and played for him as a freshman as the Red Storm went 22-10 and 
made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla was fired after the season and replaced by Mike  
Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest would become the first player to leave St. John's early  
for the NBA draft since Walter Berry, who left after being named 
national player of the year as a junior in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Recreates Marlene Dietrich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                  *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marlene Dietrich was an inimitable performer,  
but Sian Phillips comes close to recreating the one-of-a-kind 
actress-singer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marlene,'' in which Phillips as Dietrich emotes in a Paris  
dressing room for most of two acts and then goes on stage to sing 
her signature songs, opened Sunday night at Broadway's Cort 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, by Pam Gems, opened in 1997 in London, where it also  
was directed by Sean Mathias. Phillips also played it in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, when ``Marlene'' is set, Dietrich was 65 and on a world  
concert tour. Phillips is the right age to play that and, 
remarkably, she has the excellent, slim figure, clean jaw line and 
true, throaty voice for it, too. She doesn't quite have Dietrich's 
sexiness in her voice or her hypnotic presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of Marlene Dietrich can be delighted that their idol is  
brought to stage life in such fine fashion but not quite equaled. 
The idea is, after all, that there was only one Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
	With Phillips in the play are Margaret Whitton as a worshipful  
young playwright Dietrich has summoned to be her dresser and Mary 
Diveny as an elderly wardrobe mistress, mute since incarceration in 
a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich is shown first compulsively scrubbing the dressing room  
floor, kneeling on her folded fur coat. Later she is glamorous, 
belting a silk robe tightly around her, and, finally, she appears 
wearing a glittering gown, sewn with bugle beads, tight as a second 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Between musings and tantrums in the dressing room, the star  
sings, often starting a song before piano-violin-bass accompaniment 
begins. There's nothing to hide behind, but Phillips is fearless 
about that, just as one assumes Dietrich would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich had a smutty, funny, direct way of expressing herself  
and that's in the play. A listener often thinks lines would be fun 
to repeat -- but they aren't polite. She speaks frankly and 
offhandedly about sex with men and with women. She doesn't find sex 
consumingly important, she says, but it seems to give the other 
people's spirits quite a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	Her contradictions are amusing. She's easy, she tells her new  
dresser, then proves difficult, demanding a certain length of 
carpet and that ushers carry floral tributes -- which she has bought 
-- down aisles, held high. 
</P>
<P>
	She orchestrates a scene of autograph-seeking at the stage door  
as she leaves the theater and on her arrival at the hotel. Only 
when the hotel room door closes, she declares, does the performance 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	She laughs at herself, saying many think she tours because she  
needs adoration. No, she says, she does it for the money -- AND for 
the adoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Poignantly, she talks about her stage fright and about the  
conflicting things it means to be German. She never had a great 
talent or a great voice, she says. But the movie camera loved her. 
</P>
<P>
	And so did audiences at her later-in-life concerts. Phillips is  
paying real homage, making sure that Dietrich is giving another 
fabulous show.

<HEADLINE> Female Inmates Report Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a third of the women in state  
prisons and jails say they were physically or sexually abused as 
children, roughly twice the rate of child abuse reported by women 
overall, the Justice Department said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for male inmates who suffered child abuse, while far  
smaller, also are about double that of the overall male population, 
according to a study by the department's Bureau of Justice 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 36 percent of female state prison and jail inmates  
surveyed in 1996-7 reported they were abused sexually or physically 
at age 17 or younger, the bureau reported. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 16 studies of child abuse in the general  
population found that 12 percent to 17 percent of women were abused 
as children. 
</P>
<P>
	Among male inmates of state prisons, 14 percent suffered child  
abuse compared with 5 percent to 8 percent of the general male 
population, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the  
Feminist Majority Foundation. ``While the inmate population is 
overwhelmingly male, the women who end up behind bars have had a 
very hard life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Childhood abuse increases the risk that anyone, female or  
male, could end up in prison, because the home influence is so 
pervasive,'' Smeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women abused as children have their whole self-image changed.  
They believe they are bad. They end up in relationships with men 
who abuse them and in risky situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found alcohol and drug abuse was higher among  
inmates who suffered abuse than among those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Among state prison inmates, 80 percent of the abused women and  
76 percent of the abused men regularly had used illegal drugs, 
compared with 65 percent of the women and 68 percent of the men who 
had not been abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting sexual or physical abuse at any age before  
imprisonment, the survey found nearly half of the women in prison, 
jail or on probation had been attacked, compared with 10 percent of 
the men in prison, jail or on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	This ratio of 5-to-1 may reflect simply the established fact  
that more women than men suffer physical or sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that a third of women in state prisons and a  
quarter of those in local jails said they had been raped before 
they were jailed. In state prisons and local jails, 3 percent of 
men reported they had been raped before incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	Abused state prisoners were more likely than those not abused to  
have served time for violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among males, 76 percent of abused inmates, but only 61 percent  
of those not abused, had a current or past sentence for a violent 
offense. Among women, 45 percent of the abused, but only 29 percent 
of those not abused, had served a sentence for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisoners reported higher levels of abuse if they grew up at  
least partly in foster care rather than with parents, if their 
parents were heavy drug or alcohol users or if a family member had 
been imprisoned. The study noted that many foster children had been 
removed from homes where they were abused by parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found little difference in the percentage of abused  
inmates growing up with one parent or those with two parents.

<HEADLINE> British Academy Honors 'Elizabeth' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Elizabethan England ruled the day at the 51st  
British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, with five prizes going to 
``Elizabeth'' and four to last month's leading Oscar-winner, 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Elizabeth Taylor who got the evening's biggest  
applause, as she haltingly stepped to the podium to receive a 
lifetime achievement award from the British Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me want to act again,'' said Taylor, 67, who was born  
in London but has long lived in the United States. ``But nobody 
will have me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional speech, Taylor called the prize ``the most  
incredible award'' because, she added, ``I guess I didn't think of 
myself as an actress and didn't think many of you did -- quite 
rightly, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar-winning Italian actor Roberto Benigni triumphed as well,  
winning another prize for best actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first prize in England,'' said the ever-effusive  
Benigni, who was a memorably manic presence at last month's Oscars. 
``Really, I am full of joy, like a watermelon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' which won seven Academy Awards this  
year including best picture, took the BAFTA prize for best film, as 
well as supporting performance prizes for Judi Dench and Australian 
actor Geoffrey Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Australian performer, Cate Blanchett, was named best  
actress for the title role in ``Elizabeth,'' which won four other 
awards, including outstanding British film of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply shocked to be standing here,'' said Blanchett, who  
makes her British stage debut next week in the David Hare play 
``Plenty.'' ``So this is an enormous honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although shut out at the Oscars, the darkly satiric ``The Truman  
Show'' won three British Academy awards -- best director (Peter 
Weir), best original screenplay (Andrew Niccol) and best production 
design. 
</P>
<P>
	Best foreign film went to another Oscar also-ran: the Brazilian  
film ``Central Station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' one of the  
most popular films of 1998, won two lesser BAFTAs -- for best sound 
and best visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercially disappointing ``Primary Colors'' won the prize  
for best adapted screenplay for writer Elaine May. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience award for the most popular film of 1998, the only  
prize picked by the general public, went to ``Lock, Stock and Two 
Smoking Barrels,'' the cheeky gangster comedy 
</P>
<P>
	Votes were cast before the Oscar ceremony on March 22.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Issues Easter Greeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Sunday sent greetings to  
Orthodox Christians around the world on occasion of the Orthodox 
Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	The text of a statement issued by the White House:  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish to send a warm message of greetings today to the 6  
million Orthodox Christian Americans and the quarter-billion 
Orthodox Christians around the world, as they gather to proclaim 
that `Christ has Risen.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the feeling of joy that comes on Easter Sunday, when we  
celebrate the miracle of Jesus' Resurrection and His gift to us of 
eternal life. Yet I also understand that on this particular Easter 
Sunday, the joy Orthodox Christians feel may be mixed with other 
emotions: with sadness over the tragic events in and around Kosovo; 
and with fear for those whose lives may still be in danger. The 
majority of those forced from Kosovo in the last two weeks are 
Muslim, but among them are Catholics and Orthodox Christians, too. 
Our hearts and prayers must go out to all who have suffered. We 
hope and pray for the restoration of peace and a resolution based 
on democracy and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``On this holiest of days, when Orthodox Christians celebrate  
the triumph of life over death, of hope over despair, let us 
recommit to seeking peace, human rights and an end to suffering for 
people around the world.''

<HEADLINE> Italy Telecom May Sell to Murdoch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Telecom Italia is again considering the sale  
of a stake in its pay TV unit Stream to Rupert Murdoch's News 
Corp., the financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia declined to comment and officials at News Corp.  
couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Il Sole said the deal could involve the communication company  
Cecchi Gori, a new venture that includes first-division soccer 
teams Lazio, Roma, Parma and Cecchi Gori's Fiorentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia signed a preliminary deal late last year to sell  
Stream to Murdoch but it fell apart when Italy limited ownership of 
certain soccer rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Il Sole said News Corp. is one of several potential partners in  
a new deal, along with France's Canal Plus, Microsoft Corp.'s Web 
TV and other U.S. TV companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of Stream and other non-core assets is part of Telecom  
Italia's attempt to fend off a hostile takeover bid from Olivetti.

<HEADLINE> Salon Industry Needs Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For beauty salons across the country, the strong  
economy is both a blessing and a curse. 
</P>
<P>
	Business is brisk. But the low unemployment rate means workers  
are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's at a crisis situation,'' said Henri Blaine, owner of  
beauty schools in Connecticut and Massachusetts that send recent 
graduates to salons. ``Salon owners give me hell. What can I do? 
It's a tight labor market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blaine said about 500 job postings remain unfilled at his six  
Blaine Beauty Career Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellaria Salons, which has 25 locations throughout New England,  
turns away thousands of clients each week because it doesn't have 
enough hairdressers to handle the load, according to Nino Micozzi, 
president and chief executive officer of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	That translates into a loss of more than $80,000 a week, Micozzi  
groused as he punched in the figures on a calculator. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could hire 50 to 75 tomorrow morning and guarantee $25,000  
a year to start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Micozzi's plight highlights the challenge of hair salons that  
are finding themselves without enough stylists to curl, color and 
snip in an industry that touts flexible hours, benefits and decent 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're competing not necessarily against other hair firms but  
other jobs in general,'' said Paul Finkelstein, chief executive 
officer of Regis Corp., the Minneapolis-based giant that owns more 
than 4,000 salons nationwide, including the SuperCuts and Trade 
Secrets chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem, some say, is a lack of prestige accorded to  
the hairdressing industry. Many creative and talented people don't 
think of hairdressing as a viable career, despite the success of 
famed stylists like New York's Frederic Fekkai and Boston's Mario 
Russo, who have parlayed their expertise into haircuts that can 
cost upward of $400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people make millions,'' said Jackie Summers, editorial  
director of Modern Salon Magazine, a Chicago-based trade 
publication. ``A lot of people think of hairdressers as low-wage 
people and it's not really always the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lucrative salon industry, including products and services,  
is a $45 billion market in the United States, according to Modern 
Salon. And it continues to grow as clients clamor for more services 
-- especially coloring, which has grown in popularity in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young people do it for the cosmetic value and older baby  
boomers do it for that and to start covering up the gray,'' Summers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For salons desperate for stylists, some have started offering  
perks like free training and 401K plans. Many businesses also have 
begun targeting students at high schools, hosting job fairs, 
offering tuition grants and advertising on television, Summer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some professionals said the little-known rewards of the  
hairstyling industry include one intangible: helping others. 
</P>
<P>
	At Salon Mario Russo on Newbury Street in Boston, amid the hum  
of blow dryers, Corey Henderson, 30, said stylists benefit from -- 
as well as perform services for -- their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This brings in a sense of creativity and warmth,'' Henderson  
gushed. ``I love my clients and learn something from them.''

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 2, Mutiny 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York-New Jersey goalkeeper Mike Ammann  
stopped three of four shootout shots as the MetroStars beat the 
Tampa Bay Mutiny 2-1 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Chung, Mike Sorber and Roy Myers scored as the MetroStars  
won the shootout 3-1. Jan Eriksson had the lone Mutiny shootout 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My part is to just be aggressive and try and get out as quick  
as I can,'' said Ammann, who is 9-2 all-time in shootouts. ``You 
still have to react and just be lucky at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ammann was spectacular throughout the match, making eight saves.  
He stopped Alejandro Sequiera's point-blank header in the 86th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars are off to their best-ever start at 3-1.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our record is good, but more importantly we have more  
confidence each game,'' MetroStars coach Bora Milutinovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Hurtado put the MetroStars up 1-0 on a penalty kick  
during the 28th minute. It was the forward's third goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since acquiring Hurtado from the Los Angeles Galaxy last season,  
the MetroStars are 15-2 when the forward records a point. 
</P>
<P>
	Musa Shannon tied it at 1 in the 62nd minute. The Tampa Bay  
forward scored for the second consecutive match after entering as a 
second half substitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay fell to 0-3 and has now started the past two seasons  
by dropping its first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos, who continues to experience  
right leg pain, did not make the trip. It is not known when Ramos, 
who missed his third straight game, will return.

<HEADLINE> Final Opening Day for Tiger Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- There once was an old hay market at the corner of  
Michigan and Trumbull. 
</P>
<P>
	That old hay market gave way to Bennett Park, which opened in  
1896. That gave way to Navin Field, which opened in 1912 and later 
became Briggs Stadium and Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Tigers play the Minnesota Twins tomorrow, it will mark  
the last home opener in Tiger Stadium. The team will move a few 
blocks away to Comerica Park to start the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it's going to be awful hard on me, because I've spent  
every year of my adult life ... at Briggs Stadium and Tiger 
Stadium,'' Hall of Famer Al Kaline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Harwell, the beloved announcer who has been broadcasting  
from the corner since 1960, has been in the radio booth for two 
World Series championships at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparky Anderson came along in 1979 and managed the Tigers for  
the next 16 seasons. Under him, the Tigers won two division titles 
and a World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The current manager, Larry Parrish, remembers the night when  
Sparky -- who never once played the outfield -- robbed him of a home 
run. It happened while Parrish, then playing for Texas, was facing 
Jack Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack threw me a fastball away and I hit it pretty good to  
right field,'' Parrish said. ``It went out of the ballpark. I ran 
around the bases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Sparky stepped out of the dugout, arguing the ball went  
foul before leaving the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually got the home plate umpire to overrule the first  
base umpire, and call it a foul ball,'' Parrish said. ``I had to go 
back up there and hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, a fan made his way to the clubhouse and wanted  
Parrish to autograph the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that he'd caught it, and he was sitting two rows  
inside the foul pole, in fair territory,'' Parrish said. ``So, 
Sparky got a home run taken away from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most famous game came in the 1934 World Series, when  
St. Louis outfielder Ducky Medwick had to be pulled by baseball 
commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Fans threw garbage at Medwick 
after he crashed into Detroit third baseman Marv Owen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have played in the World Series nine times, winning  
four. Detroit also has held three All-Star games, including the one 
in 1971 in which Reggie Jackson homered into the light tower on the 
right-field roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much history in that place,'' Anderson said. ``It  
went all the way back to basically when Cobb played ... Gehrig and 
Ruth, all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett Park, the stadium's forerunner, was mainly a covered  
grandstand. Hundreds of fans crammed bleachers erected across the 
street. They were only slightly deterred by cloth drapes blocking 
their sight behind the outfield wall. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1911, team owner Frank Navin razed the old stands and built a  
new facility. Navin Field opened to a 6-5 Detroit victory before a 
crowd of 24,384 on April 20, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	Also opening that day was Fenway Park in Boston, which next year  
will be alone as the oldest stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of Navin Field -- widely regarded as the beginning of  
Tiger Stadium -- should have been a front-page story. But the 
sinking of the Titanic five days earlier was still hot news. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1923, the original stands were double-decked. Walter Briggs  
took over the club after Navin died and added a second level to the 
bleachers and the right-field pavilion in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, Cherry Street, the northern boundary, was closed,  
enabling another expansion that essentially enclosed the park. It 
was renamed Briggs Stadium, held 53,000 and looked pretty much as 
it does today. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'll miss least is the bullpen,'' reliever Todd Jones  
said. ``To me, it's a cross between a submarine and a prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, as a lover of baseball lore, Jones will be as sorry as  
anyone to see the club move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the place,'' he said. ``But more than that, I love how  
much it means to people.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Activate DeShields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles activated second baseman  
Delino DeShields from the disabled list and added pitcher Doug 
Linton to the 25-man roster Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were in the starting lineup against the Toronto  
Blue Jays. DeShields, returning from a broken left thumb, batted 
eighth and Linton made his first appearance in the majors since 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster, the Orioles optioned infielder Jesse  
Garcia and left-handed pitcher Doug Johns to Triple-A Rochester of 
the International League. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields signed a three-year contract as a free agent in  
December but was forced to wait to make his debut with the Orioles 
after fracturing his thumb March 4 in an intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just ready to play ball. That's it,'' DeShields said. ``I  
knew I'd be back. It's just a matter of being patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linton's last previous major league start and appearance came on  
Sept. 11, 1996 with the Kansas City Royals. The right-hander 
underwent surgery on his right elbow in March 1997 and missed the 
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the 1998 season with Triple-A Salt Lake, an affiliate  
of the Minnesota Twins, and signed as a free agent with Baltimore 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Linton, 34, had a 0.90 ERA in seven appearances during spring  
training. 
</P>

	Garcia made two fine plays at second base for the Orioles in  
their 3-2 exhibition win over Cuba on March 28 and got a single in 
his first at-bat in the majors Saturday. He accepted the demotion 
with no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt comfortable. They put me in and I did what they asked  
me to do,'' he said. ``It's been sweet for me. I have nothing to 
complain about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia said he will box the ball representing his first  
major-league hit, a single, and mail it to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He will alternate between shortstop and second base at  
Rochester. Jerry Hairston Jr., another infield prospect at 
Rochester, also plays second and shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to go down there, do the same things I did here  
and get back as soon as I can,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns made two appearances this season with Baltimore, both in  
long relief. He was arrested on Monday, hours after the Orioles 
opened the season with a win over Tampa Bay, and charged with 
drunken driven and possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Ray Miller said the arrest had no bearing on the  
decision to send him to the minor leagues.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Recreates Marlene Dietrich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marlene Dietrich was an inimitable performer,  
but Sian Philips comes close to recreating the one-of-a-kind 
actress-singer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marlene,'' in which Philips as Dietrich emotes in a Paris  
dressing room for most of two acts and then goes on stage to sing 
her signature songs, opened Sunday night at Broadway's Cort 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, by Pam Gems, opened in 1997 in London, where it also  
was directed by Sean Mathias. Philips also played it in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, when ``Marlene'' is set, Dietrich was 65 and on a world  
concert tour. Philips is the right age to play that and, 
remarkably, she has the excellent, slim figure, clean jaw line and 
true, throaty voice for it, too. She doesn't quite have Dietrich's 
sexiness in her voice or her hypnotic presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of Marlene Dietrich can be delighted that their idol is  
brought to stage life in such fine fashion but not quite equaled. 
The idea is, after all, that there was only one Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
	With Philips in the play are Margaret Whitton as a worshipful  
young playwright Dietrich has summoned to be her dresser and Mary 
Diveny as an elderly wardrobe mistress, mute since incarceration in 
a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich is shown first compulsively scrubbing the dressing room  
floor, kneeling on her folded fur coat. Later she is glamorous, 
belting a silk robe tightly around her, and, finally, she appears 
wearing a glittering gown, sewn with bugle beads, tight as a second 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Between musings and tantrums in the dressing room, the star  
sings, often starting a song before piano-violin-bass accompaniment 
begins. There's nothing to hide behind, but Phillips is fearless 
about that, just as one assumes Dietrich would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich had a smutty, funny, direct way of expressing herself  
and that's in the play. A listener often thinks lines would be fun 
to repeat -- but they aren't polite. She speaks frankly and 
offhandedly about sex with men and with women. She doesn't find sex 
consumingly important, she says, but it seems to give the other 
people's spirits quite a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	Her contradictions are amusing. She's easy, she tells her new  
dresser, then proves difficult, demanding a certain length of 
carpet and that ushers carry floral tributes -- which she has bought 
-- down aisles, held high. 
</P>
<P>
	She orchestrates a scene of autograph-seeking at the stage door  
as she leaves the theater and on her arrival at the hotel. Only 
when the hotel room door closes, she declares, does the performance 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	She laughs at herself, saying many think she tours because she  
needs adoration. No, she says, she does it for the money -- AND for 
the adoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Poignantly, she talks about her stage fright and about the  
conflicting things it means to be German. She never had a great 
talent or a great voice, she says. But the movie camera loved her. 
</P>
<P>
	And so did audiences at her later-in-life concerts. Phillips is  
paying real homage, making sure that Dietrich is giving another 
fabulous show.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Human Skeleton Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bones of a woman found on California's  
Channel Islands may be among the oldest human remains found so far 
in North America, and could support theories that the first 
Americans came by sea rather than over a land bridge, scientists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones of the so-called Arlington Springs woman are probably  
13,000 years old, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. That would 
make her slightly older than the oldest known human skeletons in 
North America, which were found in Montana, Idaho and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bottom line is she may be the earliest inhabitant of North  
America we have discovered. It's a find of national significance,'' 
said John R. Johnson, curator of anthropology at the Santa Barbara 
Museum of Natural History, which is part of a team researching the 
woman's bones. 
</P>
<P>
	However, results of the team's investigation have not yet been  
submitted to peers for critical review and have not been published 
in scientific journals. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was described in a paper presented March 30 at the  
Fifth California Islands Symposium at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional theory has been the first humans in North  
America came from northern Asia during the Ice Age, crossing a 
bridge of exposed land to Alaska and then spreading across country 
between glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
	The location and apparent age of the Channel Islands discovery  
suggests at least some of the first settlers could have come to 
North America by boat and spread along the coast, instead of 
inland, researchers contend. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains -- two thigh bones -- were discovered at Arlington  
Canyon on Santa Rosa Island 40 years ago and kept at the Santa 
Barbara museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, researchers at the museum and Channel Islands National  
Park conducted DNA and radiocarbon tests unavailable when the bones 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were performed by Stafford Research Laboratories in  
Boulder, Colo., one of the nation's pre-eminent carbon-dating labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists performed two sets of tests, one producing an  
estimate the bones are 11,000 years old and a second giving an age 
of about 13,000 years, the Times said.

<HEADLINE> Norman's Song Remains the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Greg Norman said he didn't believe in  
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Over and over, through all four days of the Masters, he kept  
insisting what's done was done. To prove the point, he went out and 
showed he could play Augusta National differently from the way he 
had every time before. This time, he was patient. This time, he was 
prudent. And purposeful, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, the result was the pretty much the same.  
</P>
<P>
	He finished close enough to the man for whom the green jacket  
was destined to know his measurements by heart. On this day, it was 
slipped over the shoulders of Jose Maria Olazabal. Three years ago, 
it was Nick Faldo. Nearly a decade before that, the names were 
Larry Mize and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing that has changed, Norman said one more time  
Sunday, is his perspective on the losses. Shoulder surgery sent him 
to the sideline for nearly a year. He rediscovered his family and 
his motivation, and found the calm that a hectic schedule and the 
pressures of competing had kept hidden all these years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very much like I did yesterday and the day before, like  
I did a couple months ago,'' Norman said after a closing round of 
73 left him in third place, two strokes behind Olazabal and one 
back of Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had done this 20 years ago, have this kind of fresher  
approach on life. Because this has been very, very good for me. And 
if it's been good for me,'' he added, ``then it's going to be good 
for me in the game of golf.''
