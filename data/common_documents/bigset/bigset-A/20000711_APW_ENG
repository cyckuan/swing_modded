<HEADLINE> Philippines Garbage Slide Kills 60  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A mountain of garbage loosened by
rain collapsed and burst into flames Monday at Manila's biggest
dump, flattening squatters' shanties and killing 60 people,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 29 other people were injured and at least 68 and maybe
hundreds remained missing late Monday, officials said. The victims
were poor people who earn a living by scavenging garbage in the
Payatas dump. More bodies were recovered overnight and hopes of
finding survivors dimmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost impossible to get anybody alive at this time,
after 24 hours,'' said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also
heads the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers dug through the wall of rotting garbage into Tuesday,
but were hampered by the stench and lack of equipment, including
adequate lighting.
</P>
<P>
   One scavenger, Gloria Alano, sobbed and yelled at rescuers using
a heavy bulldozer on a heap of garbage to search for survivors and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Backhoe, use only backhoes, not bulldozers, I want to get the
bodies of my loved ones,'' she cried. Her husband and three
children were buried under the tons of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   After collapsing onto the shanties, the wall of garbage burst
into flames, engulfing the area. Residents said the debris may have
been ignited by fallen power cables or stoves being used in huts
covered by the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the Payatas dump in Quezon City, the largest in
metropolitan Manila, often smolder from the spontaneous combustion
of rotting garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks could not reach the area because of limited space
and parked on a main road several blocks from the dump. Hoses were
pulled through crowded alleys by firefighters, who extinguished
most of the blaze after several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Castro, whose shanty was perched alongside the mountain
of garbage, said he felt the ground shift in the morning, before it
finally collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I left the house because I needed to sell outside, so I left
my wife and child,'' he said. ''When I came back my house was gone
and my wife and child are buried underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   The wall of garbage buried an area of squatter houses about the
size of four basketball courts. About 100 houses were covered,
Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay said.
</P>
<P>
   About 780 people were taken to an evacuation center at city
hall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one area, rescuers pulled out three bodies, including a man
badly burned but breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross volunteers doused his body with water from a fire hose
but failed to revive him, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   A week of heavy rains followed by a thunderstorm early Monday
apparently caused a crack in the upper portion of the mountain of
garbage, Manila police chief Edgar Aglipay said.
</P>
<P>
   The dumpsite was to be closed permanently last December but the
plan was postponed until later this year after residents at a
garbage landfill in San Mateo in nearby Rizal province refused to
allow waste from metropolitan Manila to be dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have tried in recent years to relocate the
hundreds of scavengers and junk yard workers living around the
Payatas dumpsite, but most have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Ranola, a hospitalized dump resident, said they
declined to be relocated because they could not afford the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump and a former dump in Manila's Tondo slum
district called Smokey Mountain long symbolized the wrenching
poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, ordered
Smokey Mountain leveled in the mid-1990s and built apartment
buildings at the former eyesore.

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged With Smuggling Koreans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Three foreign nationals were charged
Monday in connection with the smuggling of 21 South Koreans into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kun J. Yoo, 35, of South Korea, Jose E. Castellanos-Ortiz, 28,
of Mexico, and 19-year-old Juan Reyes Aviles of Guatemala were
charged with single counts of bringing an illegal alien into the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The three allegedly met the Koreans at Vancouver International
Airport, took them to a safe house, then left them in a field near
the border, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   There, they were to walk into the U.S., where Yoo and the two
men, whom he had hired, were to meet them, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Koreans were stopped shortly before midnight Friday at
the border, about 140 miles northeast of Seattle, their apparent
destination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Ohm said.
</P>
<P>
   And early Saturday, a van carrying Castellino-Ortiz and Aviles
was stopped near the crossing, Ohms said, and Yoo was taken into
custody about an hour later after fleeing in a car.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans, taken to county jail, face Immigration and
Naturalization Service deportation and asylum hearings, said Steven
Garrett of the U.S. Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed in Spokane, Yoo and his alleged accomplices if convicted
face maximum sentences of 10 years and fines of $250,000.

<HEADLINE> Remainder of Diana Ross &AMP; Supremes tour canceled  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Diana Ross won't be keeping many more fans
hanging on - the plug has been pulled on her ersatz Supremes
reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour suffered from bad karma ever since it was revealed that
Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, who performed with Ross in the
Supremes in the 1960s, refused to join because they felt they
weren't being paid enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ross soldiered on with Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne, two
women who had joined the Supremes after she had left in 1969, but
they sang in some arenas to more empty seats than fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people realized it wasn't a true Supremes reunion and
it cast a negative pall on the tour before it even started,'' said
Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar, a concert industry trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices ranging from $42.50 to $250 per seat didn't help,
either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supremes performed in 12 cities before dates were cancelled
without explanation Friday on Long Island and Sunday in Washington.
Ross and the Supremes were to perform in Pittsburgh on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, in a statement, said she was ''severely disappointed''
that concert promoters SFX had decided to cancel the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would sing the same if there were 10 people in the audience
or 10,000,'' Ross said. ''I love the music and the fans, and I will
find a way to reconnect with them as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the biggest business disasters yet for SFX, the
company that dominates the concert industry. Industry insiders
speculated that they paid too much for Ross and overestimated her
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that SFX decided to cut its losses,'' said Bob
Grossweiner, a concert industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Ross' statement, a spokesman for the company would only
confirm that three concert dates had been canceled. He did not
return several phone calls after her statement was released.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, in an interview with The Associated Press last month, said
she had contacted Wilson and Birdsong to see if they would be
interested in performing this summer. When they said they would,
she turned negotiations over to the show's producers
</P>
<P>
   But the women complained publicly that Ross would be getting
much more money than them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think that Mary had the vision at all to
understand that this was not about money,'' Ross said. ''I really
think it's shortsighted, if you know what I mean. Because five
years from now, we wouldn't be able to do this tour.''
</P>
<P>
   On this tour, Ross and her new companions were singing some of
the biggest Supremes hits from the 1960s, including ''Stop! In the
Name of Love,'' ''Baby Love'' and ''You Keep Me Hangin' On.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when they played in Columbus, Ohio on June 20, there were
fewer than 3,000 people in a 22,000-seat arena.

<HEADLINE> Often forgotten President Fillmore remembered by home town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SUMMERHILL, N.Y. (AP) - Few may remember the nation's 13th
president, but his hometown area was giddy this weekend in
celebrating the 200th year of Millard Fillmore's birth and the
150th year since his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Fillmore's delayed birthday celebration - the date is Jan. 7,
1800 - and the commemoration of his inauguration was combined with
the opening of a new town hall and community center.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Gary Finch described Fillmore, president from
1850-53, as often misunderstood. The celebration 5 miles east of
where Fillmore was born in a log cabin in Locke, about 70 miles
southeast of Rochester, tried to change that for some. Finch said
that led to underrating Fillmore's role in history. He said
Fillmore was a great negotiator and statesman whose administration
delayed the Civil War for 10 years while the North was able to
build railroads and strengthen its defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''His life was a tribute to his sterling character,'' the
Republican said, according to The Citizen of Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't be giving a history lesson, but for many reasons I
wish he was president now,'' said Cayuga County Sheriff Peter
Pickney.
</P>
<P>
   Historical presentations were given by Robert Scarry, author and
historian, whose book on the long-lost Fillmore papers will be
available in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments of the former vice president (under Zachary
Taylor, 1849-1850) include the Compromise of 1850, the expansion of
the Erie Canal, and a role in founding the city of Buffalo.
Fillmore also signed the Fugitive Slave Act and helped open trade
with Japan while fighting to close debtors' prisons.

Colombian President Outlaws Genocide
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a hard-fought victory for human rights activists,
President Andres Pastrana on Monday signed a law that officially outlaws
genocide and forced disappearances. The law put the crimes on the books, sets
sentences as high as 45 years and creates a commission to investigate the fate
of an estimated 3,000 missing people. Pastrana said that by signing the law he
had once vetoed, he was paying homage to the ''the spirit of so many who
suffered and the families who have searched desperately for their loved ones.''

Bank Workers Strike in S. Korea
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- After failing to obtain government guarantees for
their job security, tens of thousands of bank workers went on strike Tuesday.
The union is concerned the government's plans to restructure the industry would
spur bank mergers and lead to layoffs. The initial impact appeared limited, as
banks opened using non-union employees or union members who opposed the walkout.
Last-minute efforts to prevent the strike ended after bank union leaders walked
out of talks with government officials which lasted 6&AMP;frac12; hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - No criminal charges will be filed
against a Pennsylvania man whose cabin cruiser collided into a
speedboat near Ocean City, killing four people last month, New
Jersey State Police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The operator of the speedboat, Dominnick Laspata, 26, of
Westville, N.J., and his three passengers were killed when the boat
was struck by a cabin cruiser piloted by John Lego, 52, of
Lansdale, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Lego was issued waterway violations, which are similar to
traffic violations, for running his 30-foot Pro Line cabin cruiser
into the 26-foot Sonic speedboat operated by Laspata.

   Five of the nine people on board Lego's boat suffered minor

<HEADLINE> 31 horses dead in barn fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH SALEM, N.Y. (AP) - Fire raced through a barn at a horse
farm in northern Westchester, killing 31 horses, many of them
mounts for children learning to ride.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze at Breakaway Farms on Route 121 in North Salem broke
out at about 5:15 a.m. Monday, and the wooden structure was
engulfed by the time firefighters arrived, said Chief Neil Caputo,
of the Croton Falls Fire Department. The cause was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The barn was reduced to an ashen outline, the dead horses buried
by barn workers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Laura Schwartz, told News 12 Westchester that she
saw ''a wall of flame'' shooting up from the barn when she awoke.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Grayson, whose daughter had a horse at the barn, said
of the animal, ''He was her life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For her, it's like losing a child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Debbie Kilcullen, said Breakaway Farms was
''kid-oriented,'' with horse shows and a summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a fire at a Brooklyn stable killed 21 horses.

<HEADLINE> Despite higher prices, some happily use full-serve stations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) - There was once a time when it was an
unusual for gas stations to insist you pump your own fuel. These
days, full service is the novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a service people don't get anymore,'' said Lester
Whitesell, who manages the full-service Keystone Super Service near
the Harrisburg suburb of Camp Hill. ''Most are pleasantly surprised
we offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra cost is worth it to a niche market.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of senior citizens and disabled customers from
nearby Messiah Village and Bethany Village,'' Whitesell said. ''We
pump gas, check oil, clean the windshield, fill the tires and do
whatever they ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Dormer of Middletown, a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair and
drives a van, said he considers a full-service gas station a
necessity, not a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lift in my van, but it's a pain to get in my
wheelchair, get out, pump gas and get back in,'' Dormer said. ''So
I just pull up, roll down the window and get the gas pumped. It
costs a little more, $1.60 a gallon, but it's worth it. My (van's)
windows get cleaned and my oil gets checked, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dormer usually gets his tank filled at Elwood's Sunoco Service
in Middletown, which charges only a few cents more per gallon for
full service. But even at stations where the price of full-service
gas has soared above $2 a gallon, there hasn't been a drop in
demand for full service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers today prefer self service because of the convenience
and speed,'' said David Callahan, executive director of the
Associated Petroleum Industries of Pennsylvania. ''But a small
segment of the population needs or wants full-serve stations. So
they will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Only New Jersey and Oregon require all gas stations to offer
full service, Callahan said. The rest of the nation offers both.
The association does not track the number of full- and self-serve
stations, Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the customers who appreciate full-service stations go beyond
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Alfaro, 21, of Harrisburg uses a full-service station
''to get things checked under the hood.'' She smiled as attendant
Rick Wissler pumped gas, checked her car's fluids and added a quart
of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, owner of Miller's Ultra Service Center in
Harrisburg, where Alfaro gets gas, said a quarter of his customers
choose full service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Full-service customers may not like to pump gasoline or have
the smell of it on their hands,'' he said. ''They also want us to
wash their windshield, check their tire pressure and check their
oil, transmission fluid, power-steering fluid and antifreeze
levels. They're happy with our service, but not with gas prices.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true at Miller's gas station even though Miller charges a
premium for full service. Alfaro bypasses Miller's self-service,
where regular unleaded gasoline sells for $1.62 a gallon, to pay
$2.04 a gallon for full service.

<HEADLINE> Hotels briefed on what to expect  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A crummy hotel stay can really sour a
person's impression of a place.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, representatives of the hospitality industry
are fanning out across the region this week to brief hoteliers on
how to make the most of the upcoming Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 managers at the Philadelphia Marriott attended the
first workshop Monday. The Marriott is one of 95 hotels housing the
45,000 delegates, guests and journalists expected to attend the
convention from July 31 to Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are very important to this whole process and how people
feel about their stay in Philadelphia,'' said Karen Buchholz,
executive director of the Philadelphia 2000 host committee. ''This
is our time to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant stay can be dependent on lots of little things. For
example, the delegates have a 10 a.m. session on the first morning
of the convention and must arrive much earlier to clear security.
So it might behoove hotel restaurant managers to serve breakfast a
little earlier than usual, said Philomena Petro, director of
convention services for the Philadelphia Convention and Visitor's
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Marriott, which is connected to the Pennsylvania Convention
Center, has extensive experience hosting large gatherings. In a
sense, Monday's session was a refresher.
</P>
<P>
   The managers got a ''Hospitality Readiness Program'' packet that
contained tips for concierges, an address list for 30 of
Philadelphia's most famous landmarks and a matching game with 10
easy questions about the city. (Example: Find both the Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall. Answer: Between 5th and 6th streets on
Chestnut Street.) Petro suggested the quiz be distributed to all
hotel staffers, with a prize drawing for participants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that all 95 hotels are geared up for this. I don't
think this is really brand new for anyone. It's just larger in
scope,'' Buchholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hines, general manager of the Marriott, said the hotel
will have key managers on duty 24 hours a day during the four-day
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally am very excited for it and that's kind of out of
my nature,'' said Hines, who has been in the hotel business 24
years but never experienced a national political convention.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee has also asked each hotel to set up a welcome

<HEADLINE> New Jersey teen accused of sexually assaulting camper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENFIELD, N.H. (AP) - After an 18-hour manhunt, police Monday
arrested a camp counselor accused of sexually assaulting a
13-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Juan Diaz, 19, of Clifton, N.J., fled into the woods
near Brantwood Camp on Sunday afternoon. He was found late Monday
morning and arrested on charges of felonious sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz was being held at the Valley Street Jail in Manchester on
$100,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Brantwood is an overnight summer camp, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Camp director Amy Willey released a statement early Tuesday
morning saying Diaz was a temporary, first-time counselor who has
been fired. Police are still investigating, but the incident
appeared to be isolated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must emphasize that no child is presently in danger or at
risk at Brantwood, and we will continue with our mission to provide
a quality summer camp experience to young boys and girls,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The camp reported Diaz to police, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Willey would not comment further or say how many children attend
the camp.

<HEADLINE> Book Details JFK Jr.'s Life, Death  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Long before the Piper Saratoga that John F.
Kennedy Jr. was piloting crashed off Martha's Vineyard on the hazy
night of July 16, 1999, Jackie Kennedy Onassis feared her son would
die in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the latter years of her life, Jackie had a recurring
premonition that John would be killed piloting his own plane. She
pleaded with Maurice (Tempelsman, her longtime companion) to do
whatever it took to keep John from becoming a pilot,'' says a new
book, ''The Day John Died,'' which chronicles the fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   Although she encouraged her son to live fully, his mother could
not stand the thought of his piloting a plane, says the book by
Christopher Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   It also says that an American Airlines jet changed course to
avoid colliding with Kennedy's plane that evening, that Kennedy and
wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy had smoothed out their marital
difficulties and were ready to start a family, and that as early as
1997 Kennedy expressed interest in running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not follow through because he feared his wife might
not bear the strain of a heated political campaign, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, whose book is being released Tuesday by publisher
William Morrow, said it is based on interviews with hundreds of
family members, friends, lovers, journalists and others.
</P>
<P>
   It completes Andersen's Camelot trilogy, which also includes
''Jack and Jackie'' (1996) and ''Jackie After Jack'' (1998). It
also follows his 1998 book on Princess Diana, ''The Day Diana
Died.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Kennedy's cousin, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, and to Sen.
Ted Kennedy, a frequent family spokesman, were not immediately
returned. Andersen said John's sister Caroline and his wife's
family declined to be interviewed for the book.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who watched the days of media coverage surrounding
Kennedy's death, most of the book's material is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   There's the flawed weather report Kennedy saw, indicating the
weather was good when it was not. There's the huge shrine of
flowers, cards and other gifts left outside Kennedy's Manhattan
loft.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the book's 60 photographs, many of which are
also etched in the public psyche, including Little John peeping out
from under President Kennedy's Oval Office desk.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a lot of posthumous character assassination,''
Andersen said. ''But I'm a warts-and-all biographer and if John had
any character flaws, I couldn't find them.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Drive for Peace  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton launches a hands-on drive
Tuesday for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and for a
place in history as a peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy task. By his own and other accounts, no
conflict in the world is more intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to push Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into an agreement in a little more
than a week and then go off to Japan for an eight-nation economic
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really, I think, a matter of trying to come to grips
with the issues on the merits,'' Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged Barak not to be distracted by his political woes
at home, and the Israeli leader again signaled his determination to
come to terms with Arafat although he said the outcome could be
''heart-rending'' for Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The core issues Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright are set to mediate at the Camp David, Md., presidential
retreat have defied solution in the seven years since Israel agreed
to begin turning over territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   They range from the hot-button issue of Jerusalem, part of which
the Palestinians seek for a state but which Barak insists will
never be divided, to claims of Arab refugees to homes in Israel
from which they say they were ousted at Israel's founding a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has signaled a willingness to expand considerably the 40
percent of the West Bank that Israel already has agreed to
surrender and to abandon some settlements in the territory. Few
doubt a Palestinian state will emerge in any accord.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat is holding out for virtually all the West Bank and
sovereignty over part of Jerusalem as the capital for a Palestinian
state. He has vowed to declare statehood if Israel does not agree
to a state by mid-September, the deadline the two sides have set
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has signaled through emissaries that he would be willing
to expand Palestinian local control in areas of Jerusalem to
Arab-populated suburbs. In exchange, he is looking to absorb some
close-in Jewish settlements into the Western part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman for the Palestinians, said
Monday: ''We are not interested in the municipal function of
responsibilities; we're interested in issues of Jerusalem as
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi said while Barak may be a flexible leader, ''if the best
is not good enough to achieve a genuine peace, we are not going to
have a flawed peace that will lead to conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak barely survived a no-confidence motion in the 120-member
Israeli parliament Monday. The opposition, anxious about his
projected concessions to Arafat on territory and Jerusalem,
outpolled the government, 54-52, but it could not muster the 61
votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in a statement before his departure for the summit, told
the Israeli people that ''this is the time to take decisions and to
bequest a better future to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Again preparing the people for concessions, he said ''no deal is
perfect'' and ''the reality of life is highly complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the tough issues, Barak is weighted down with
political problems. Three parties have quit his government,
concerned he is positioning himself to give up too much, and
Foreign Minister David Levy has decided to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Singer, a lawyer who helped drafted the Oslo accords of
1993 that started Israel on the course of pulling back on the West
Bank, said Barak ''clearly does not have a majority in the Israeli
Knesset'' and if he had to get approval for the package he is
likely to propose to Arafat ''he would fail.''

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A mountain of garbage loosened by rain collapsed
and burst into flames Monday at Manila's biggest dump, flattening squatters'
shanties and killing 60 people, officials said. Some 29 other people were
injured and at least 68 and maybe hundreds remained missing late Monday,
officials said. The victims were poor people who earn a living by scavenging
garbage in the Payatas dump. More bodies were recovered overnight and hopes of
finding survivors dimmed Tuesday.

Colombian President Outlaws Genocide

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a hard-fought victory for human rights activists,
President Andres Pastrana on Monday signed a law that officially outlaws
genocide and forced disappearances. The law put the crimes on the books, sets
sentences as high as 45 years and creates a commission to investigate the fate
of an estimated 3,000 missing people. Pastrana said that by signing the law he
had once vetoed, he was paying homage to the ''the spirit of so many who
suffered and the families who have searched desperately for their loved ones.''

Bank Workers Strike in S. Korea

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- After failing to obtain government guarantees for
their job security, tens of thousands of bank workers went on strike Tuesday.
The union is concerned the government's plans to restructure the industry would
spur bank mergers and lead to layoffs. The initial impact appeared limited, as
banks opened using non-union employees or union members who opposed the walkout.
Last-minute efforts to prevent the strike ended after bank union leaders walked

<HEADLINE> Bodies Recovered From Mexico Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Authorities recovered the bodies
of 19 victims late Monday from a twin-engine passenger plane that
crashed on a steep mountain peak in the southern Mexico state of
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found in a 150 square-yard area at the site of
Saturday's crash, just below the peak, said Communications and
Transport Secretariat spokesman Lino Palacios. The bodies were
lowered by ropes because the slope was too steep for helicopters to
land.
</P>
<P>
   AeroCaribe Flight 7831, carrying 17 passengers and two crew
members, crashed less than two minutes after pilots reported they
were deviating slightly from their planned route due to bad weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight recorder has been found and was being
analyzed, but the cause of the crash was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no report by the pilot of any mechanical failure,
and the operating conditions (of the plane) were totally normal,''
said Miguel Esquinca, chief of flight inspection at the Tuxtla
Gutierrez airport.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pilot reported bad weather conditions ten minutes
before he lost contact with the control tower.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 19-seat Jetstream-32 turbo prop, was flying from
Chiapas state capital Tuxtla Gutierrez to Villahermosa, capital of
the neighboring Gulf coast state of Tabasco. It crashed about 35
miles south of Villahermosa.
</P>
<P>
   All 19 people on board -- including four children -- were Mexican
citizens. Their bodies were transported to Tuxtla Gutierrez, where
families members waited to claim them.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, made by British Aerospace, is similar to a J-31
commuter plane that crashed in Pennsylvania in May after both
engines failed. Nineteen people were also killed in that crash.
</P>

carriers -- covers routes in southern Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Convicted in Drug Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, Utah (AP) -- A psychiatrist accused of killing five
elderly patients by prescribing fatal doses of morphine was
convicted Monday of manslaughter and negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Weitzel, 44, was found guilty of two counts of
manslaughter and three counts of negligent homicide. Sentencing was
set for Aug. 17, with Weitzel facing two to 45 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel's attorneys argued that the patients were terminally ill
and he was merely trying to ease their pain in their final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Davis County Attorney Mel Wilson told the jury that Weitzel had
a definite ''pattern of euthanasia,'' which is illegal in Utah, in
dealing with five patients who died in a 16-day period beginning in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He said the doctor ''blasted'' four of the five patients with
anti-psychotic drugs until they seemed to be near death, then
administered lethal doses of morphine.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to use your common sense and you have to look at
these patterns of conduct this doctor has engaged in,'' Wilson told
the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception to Weitzel's pattern of euthanasia was Ellen
Anderson, 91, the first to die, whom Weitzel gave morphine as soon
as she was admitted to the Geriatric-Psychiatric Unit at the Davis
Hospital and Medical Center in Layton.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Weitzel caused her death through ''depraved
indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Anderson, Weitzel was accused in the deaths of
Ennis Alldredge, 85; Mary Crane, 72; Judith Larsen, 93; and Lydia
Smith, 90.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Peter Stirba said there was no reason to
believe Weitzel did anything but fulfill his ethical obligation to
his dying patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's reasonable doubt written all over this case,'' Stirba
said. ''It's not about murder, it's not about manslaughter, it's
not about negligent homicide. It's about one thing: End of life
care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said medical records showed Weitzel did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel prescribed morphine only after consulting with the
patients' families, Stirba said, and acted in good faith to relieve
the patients' pain, both of which allow for immunity from criminal
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the families were on board with me -- understanding what
was going on and wanting their loved ones to be comfortable,''
Weitzel testified last week.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel, whose medical license has been suspended, also faces
federal charges in Utah on 22 counts of prescription fraud.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Muslim Sect Rose With Him  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   QARDAHA, Syria (AP) -- The Alawite Muslims of Syria were once
marginalized in religion, economics and politics. Then a young
Alawite named Hafez Assad rose to power, and things changed
dramatically in such places as his hometown of Qardaha.
</P>
<P>
   Since Assad's death on June 10, Alawites who may have feared
backlash from Syria's Sunni Muslim majority are somewhat reassured
to see another of their clan -- his son Bashar -- ascending to power.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, who depended in large part on family and clan links
to maintain his grip on power for 30 years, has given fellow
Alawites schools, hospitals, roads, colleges, sports arenas and
sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Alawites were concentrated in mountainous
northwest Syria. Nationwide, they are about 15 percent of the
overwhelmingly Sunni population in this country of 17 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hafez Assad, the military became a popular career for
young Alawites. Today, key army units, the elite Republican Guards,
security agencies and palace security are led by trusted Alawites
from the Assad family or loyal clans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect more from Bashar Assad, but it's difficult to
imagine someone doing more than what the president had done,'' said
Habib Makhlouf, speaking in his shop on the main commercial street
of Qardaha.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, 34, was completing the last formal step toward
becoming president Monday with a nationwide referendum in which he
was the only candidate. Within days of his father's death, the
former eye doctor was named commander of the military and head of
his father's Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   Alawites form an offshoot of Shiite Islam and are found in
Lebanon and Turkey as well as Syria. They have long suffered from
charges of religious heresy, neglect by governments and the
political and economic dominance of members of the mainstream Sunni
Muslim faith.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive faith -- the name indicates followers of Ali,
son-in-law of Islam's 7th century Prophet Mohammed -- draws on
astrology and Christianity as well as Islam. It is believed to date
to the 9th century.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Hafez Assad's rule, questions were raised about whether
an Alawite could rule a Muslim country. Hafez Assad appealed to an
influential Shiite cleric who ruled that Alawites are part of the
Shiite community.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where security agencies are dreaded and informers
are planted virtually everywhere, ordinary Syrians are reluctant to
discuss Alawites and how they fared under Hafez Assad. Officially,
no group is discriminated against or favored in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Imad Fawzi Shueibi, a political analyst close to the Syrian
government, rejected any notion of ''an Alawite regime.'' Writing
in the London-based Arab newspaper Al Hayat in late June, Shueibi
said Hafez Assad rose above sectarianism to promote the rights of
all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   But Haitham Manaa, a prominent Syrian dissident who lives in
Paris, said in a telephone interview that favoritism shown to
Alawites -- particularly when government and military posts are
being doled out -- has sharpened social divisions in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Assad regime has erased the civil nature of society and
replaced it with principles based on clans and sects,'' he said.
''The army is structured on sectarian basis, which means that
efficient military men are no longer in positions of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad was shrewd enough to build a diverse power base,
courting other minorities like Shiites, Christians and Druze and
never neglecting the Sunni majority, particularly the powerful
Sunni merchant class.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's two long-serving vice presidents, Abdul-Halim Khaddam
and Mohammed Zoheir Musharaqa, are Sunni Muslims. The speaker of
parliament, the prime minister and the foreign minister are Sunnis
and so are ruling Baath party stalwarts Abdullah Al-Ahmar and
Suleiman Qadaha. Another Sunni is powerful Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlas, long close to the elder Assad and now carefully guiding
Bashar Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of change for Alawites and other minorities
preceded Hafez Assad's presidency, dating to the 1963 rise to power
of the Socialist Arab Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the Baath's staunchly anti-sectarian policies and
its resolve to dismantle the old class order, minorities began to
enroll in schools and colleges in increasing numbers and joined the
professional classes. Many took advantage of relaxed entry
requirements and joined the military in a country where the army
has played a traditionally strong political role.
</P>
<P>
   Alawites ''were clever and worked hard,'' wrote Patrick Seale,
Hafez Assad's British biographer and confidant. ''Having fought and
studied their way to the top, they would not easily be dislodged.''
</P>
<P>
   Resentment of the Alawites' improved fortunes is expressed only
privately in Sunni-dominated urban centers like Damascus, Homs and
Aleppo, where Sunnis complain that Alawites are promoted ahead of
them in the civil service or that their migration to the cities to
work has created crowding and inflated housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such resentment -- believed to have been one of the causes of a
rebellion by militant Muslims that was crushed by Hafez Assad in
the 1980s -- is among the challenges the younger Assad will have to
deal with in order to stay in power.

   Most of it will be spent on staff, travel and expenses
associated with the upcoming national party conventions. Bush also
is developing a last-minute TV advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After the conventions, neither Republican Bush nor Democrat Gore
will be permitted to raise or spend private money, except to pay
legal and accounting costs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each will receive $67.6 million in taxpayer funds to
finance their fall campaigns. Because they are accepting the
federal funds, they cannot spend any money raised for the primaries
on the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had $7.1 million on hand as of May 31, and Gore had $9.6
million. Both can continue spending it through the conventions.
Republicans meet July 31-Aug. 3 in Philadelphia, and the Democrats
from Aug. 14-17 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor who smashed all fund-raising records by
collecting more than $90 million from more than 300,000 individuals
in all 50 states, raised another $4.8 million in June.
</P>
<P>
   His tab for July will be far less, however, since the campaign
is winding down its fund-raising operation. Since late June, Bush's
campaign has stopped holding big-ticket fund-raising events and has
relied upon direct mail and e-mail for last-minute contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who declined federal matching funds for the primary
campaign, can spend as much as he can raise through the convention.
He is the first candidate since post-Watergate reforms were enacted
for the 1976 election to win his party's nomination after declining
to limit spending in exchange for federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Scott McClellan said the campaign was considering a
television ad campaign before Bush accepts the Republican
nomination on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our focus is always on maximizing our resources toward voter
contact and spreading Bush's compassionate conservative message,''
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fourth of Bush's record-setting spending total of
$83 million through May 31 has gone for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, accepted federal funds and thus was
limited to spending $40.5 million through the convention, plus
legal and accounting costs. He went through much of his money early
in the campaign in response to an unexpectedly strong challenge
from former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's early spending raised concerns that he
would reach the spending ceiling months before the convention, as
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole did in 1996, and would be
hobbled while Bush continued to raise and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   But after shifting his campaign headquarters from Washington to
Nashville, Tenn.; cutting staff and defeating Bradley, Gore managed
to hold the line on spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore did a very good job of husbanding his money,'' said
Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Southern California. ''There was a good deal of talk
that he would run out, but he's kept his expenditures as low as
possible in order to stay within the limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said the campaign has plenty of
money to finance its operations, plus expenses at the convention,
until the federal funds flow in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on a very sound financial footing to get out our message
and have a good convention,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Protests Reaching Climax  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The hijacked cars are burning,
the shops all closed, the buses and trains canceled, the tourists
long gone, the police earning their overtime in full riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Belfast is in full summer bloom once again. And the most
hard-line Protestants are getting their marching shoes on for their
biggest day out, the Glorious Twelfth, a one-sided holiday that
many Catholics dread.
</P>
<P>
   Halfhearted appeals by the Orange Order brotherhood for
supporters to protest peacefully over restrictions on their July
parades have done little to deter more than a week of riots,
attacks on Catholic properties and tense confrontations with
police.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are hoping the worst will be over once more than
80,000 Orangemen march Wednesday in a dozen mass demonstrations
across Northern Ireland. They're officially commemorating the July
12, 1690, triumph of the Protestant King William of Orange over the
forces of Catholic James II, although many Catholics and moderate
Protestants think the marches are more about asserting control over
a country where the Catholic minority is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, the Eleventh Night, when Protestants gather
round towering bonfires of garbage to talk and drink heavily, is
traditionally when sectarian passions burn most deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ''This disorder can't go on much longer. It never does in
Northern Ireland. Even die-hards get tired out -- but it is a very
dangerous time all the same,'' said Cyril Donnan, the senior
policeman in Portadown, a cauldron of anti-Catholic sentiment
southwest of Belfast and the epicenter for this month's
province-wide turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, several hundred young Protestant men again rallied at
the spot north of Portadown where British army engineers have
erected obstacles blocking the Orangemen's path through the town's
main Catholic district. They threw firecrackers and fired flares at
Donnan's police lines on the far side of the barbed wire as part of
a wider campaign to stretch the security forces to breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   But the predominantly Protestant police, backed by several
thousand British soldiers, has shown no signs of bending, as
happened in 1996, when Catholic protesters on Portadown's Garvaghy
Road were shoved off the pavement to make way for the Orangemen
after four nights of intense Protestant rioting.
</P>
<P>
   This year the police, by taking a less confrontational approach
with most rioters, has helped ensure that the bloodshed so far has
stayed to a minimum, with no deaths. Unlike so many years past,
they have fired virtually no plastic bullets, the high-velocity
cylinders that are designed to knock down -- and often seriously
injure -- rioters.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night in Portadown, police instead dealt with a
stone-throwing mob from Portadown's most extreme Protestant
neighborhoods by hosing them down with high-powered water cannons
borrowed from Belgium. And extra soldiers were helicoptered into
fields near Garvaghy Road to ensure that no wire-cutting
Protestants would be able to outflank their positions. After a few
tense hours, the crowds went home.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Belfast and predominantly Protestant towns,
hooligans were allowed to run riot within their own neighborhoods,
hijacking passing cars whose drivers were daring enough to drive
past. But few were. The streets of Northern Ireland were virtually
empty from 4 p.m. Monday onwards because of the threat of snap
Orange blockades causing traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic violence continued through the night.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours Tuesday, petrol bombs were hurled at police,
troops and fire fighters in the Protestant village of Dromore,
southwest of Belfast. Two people were arrested, but there were no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In southern County Armagh, three people were hospitalized
suffering from smoke inhalation after petrol bombs were thrown at
an Orange hall. In central Belfast, seven shots were fired at a
police vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Portadown's Orange Order spokesman, David Jones, said Orangemen
would continue the campaign of civil disobedience Tuesday with
scattered road blockades and other unspecified protests all day.
</P>
<P>
   Jones insisted all blame for the trouble should lie with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and a government-appointed Parades
Commission, which since 1998 has had the authority to order
restrictions on Orange parades opposed by Catholics. He said
Orangemen would continue protesting until authorities relented and
allowed Portadown Orangemen to parade down Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent statements from the Parades Commission and British
government, that won't happen unless Orange leaders drop their
boycott on direct talks involving the Catholic protesters opposing
them.

<HEADLINE> EPA Regulations on Mercury Backed  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Removing a key obstacle to Environmental
Protection Agency plans to regulate mercury from power plants, a
panel of scientists has concluded that the agency was justified in
setting stringent levels of protection from the toxic substance.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences
is to be released in a report Tuesday. It concludes an 18-month
review of the science used by the EPA in establishing new
guidelines for protecting the public from mercury contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's plans to regulate mercury emissions has been held up
for nearly two years because Congress barred the agency from
proceeding until the study was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member panel in its report concludes that methyl-mercury
''is widespread and persistent in the environment'' and that the
guidelines used by the EPA to establish maximum exposure levels are
''scientifically justifiable ... for the protection of public
health.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the executive summary of the report was obtained by
The Associated Press from sources familiar with its findings.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel concludes that most Americans face a very low
risk, children of women who consume large amounts of fish and
seafood during pregnancy face a much higher risk. It estimates as
many as 60,000 children annually may develop neurological problems,
including learning disabilities, because of low-level mercury
contamination through their mother prior to birth.
</P>
<P>
   While much remains to be learned about low-dose mercury
contamination and human health, the study says there is strong
evidence to link mercury exposure to neurological problems,
including learning disabilities, as well as immune system and
cardiological problems.
</P>
<P>
   The largest sources of mercury, about 40 tons annually, comes
from coal burning electric power plants. The EPA has sought to
develop standards for regulating these emissions, which often find
their way into lakes and streams and onto pastureland, and
eventually into the food chain, especially in fish.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress in late 1998 barred the EPA from spending money on
any further development of the mercury regulations, pending a
review by the National Academy of Sciences of ''gaps in the
scientific data'' used by the EPA in determining mercury's toxicity
and potential risk to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern were conflicting studies relied upon by
the EPA -- one on the health impact of low-level mercury exposure to
children in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, and the
other in the Faroe Islands off Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The Faroe study found adverse developmental effects among
children whose mothers, while pregnant, were exposed to relatively
low levels of mercury in fish. But the Seychelles study found no
discernible link.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Garbage Slide Kills 71  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A mountain of garbage loosened by
rain collapsed and burst into flames Monday at Manila's biggest
dump, flattening squatters' shanties and killing at least 71
people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 31 people were injured, while estimates of those missing
ranged from 72 by the Red Cross to 300 by community leader Emerita
Pecsonat. The victims were poor people who earn a living by
scavenging garbage in the Payatas dump. More bodies were recovered
overnight and hopes of finding survivors dimmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost impossible to get anybody alive at this time,
after 24 hours,'' said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also
heads the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers dug through the wall of rotting garbage into Tuesday,
but were hampered by the stench and lack of equipment, including
adequate lighting.
</P>
<P>
   One scavenger, Gloria Alano, sobbed and yelled at rescuers using
a heavy bulldozer on a heap of garbage to search for survivors and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Backhoe, use only backhoes, not bulldozers, I want to get the
bodies of my loved ones,'' she cried. Her husband and three
children were buried under the tons of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   After collapsing onto the shanties, the wall of garbage burst
into flames, engulfing the area. Residents said the debris may have
been ignited by fallen power cables or stoves being used in huts
covered by the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the Payatas dump in Quezon City, the largest in
metropolitan Manila, often smolder from the spontaneous combustion
of rotting garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks could not reach the area because of limited space
and parked on a main road several blocks from the dump. Hoses were
pulled through crowded alleys by firefighters, who extinguished
most of the blaze after several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Castro, whose shanty was perched alongside the mountain
of garbage, said he felt the ground shift in the morning, before it
finally collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I left the house because I needed to sell outside, so I left
my wife and child,'' he said. ''When I came back my house was gone
and my wife and child are buried underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   The wall of garbage buried an area of squatter houses about the
size of four basketball courts. About 100 houses were covered,
Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay said.
</P>
<P>
   About 780 people were taken to an evacuation center at city
hall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one area, rescuers pulled out three bodies, including a man
badly burned but breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross volunteers doused his body with water from a fire hose
but failed to revive him, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   A week of heavy rains followed by a thunderstorm early Monday
apparently caused a crack in the upper portion of the mountain of
garbage, Manila police chief Edgar Aglipay said.
</P>
<P>
   The dumpsite was to be closed permanently last December but the
plan was postponed until later this year after residents at a
garbage landfill in San Mateo in nearby Rizal province refused to
allow waste from metropolitan Manila to be dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have tried in recent years to relocate the
hundreds of scavengers and junk yard workers living around the
Payatas dumpsite, but most have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Ranola, a hospitalized dump resident, said they
declined to be relocated because they could not afford the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump and a former dump in Manila's Tondo slum
district called Smokey Mountain long symbolized the wrenching
poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, ordered
Smokey Mountain leveled in the mid-1990s and built apartment
buildings at the former eyesore.

<HEADLINE> Nation Faces Blood Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The annual summer drop in blood donations and
high demand have created a severe shortage at blood banks across
the country, the American Red Cross warned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patients who need blood in emergency situations absolutely
depend on a readily available supply,'' said Dr. Bernadine Healy,
the organization's president. ''No patient should ever be left to
wonder if the lifesaving blood they need will be available to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   All blood types are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has reached crisis proportions in the New York
metropolitan region, said Dr. Robert Jones, president and CEO of
the New York Blood Center. He said blood shipments to New York and
New Jersey hospitals have been reduced by as much as 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless there is an immediate and dramatic donation increase,
these reduced blood shipments will continue or grow worse, placing
hospital and trauma patients at severe risk,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials said there are several reasons for the
shortage including the fact that fewer donors are available with
colleges and high schools not in session during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   They said there is an overall increase in collections this year,
but supply has not kept pace with demand, in part because more
advanced medical procedures such as organ transplants and cancer
treatments are being performed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Blood Center, which is the majority supplier for
200 hospitals in New York and New Jersey, currently has
approximately 1,000 pints of O positive blood and 200 pints of O
negative -- a one-day supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''We typically like to have about a five-day supply,'' said
blood center spokeswoman Linda Levi.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and the blood center are urging eligible donors to
give blood. To donate blood one must be healthy, at least 17 years
old and at least 110 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Day 2 of U.S.-N.Korea Missile Talks  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean officials
entered a second day of talks Tuesday on Pyongyang's development
and export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks began Monday on an optimistic note, with the American
negotiator saying the United States was prepared to move toward
fundamentally improved relations with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Einhorn, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
nonproliferation, greeted North Korean delegates with handshakes
and smiles as they arrived early Tuesday at the U.S. Embassy in
Kuala Lumpur, where Washington and Pyongyang have held several
meetings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation was led by Jang Chang Chon, head of
the country's U.S affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants North Korea to halt the development and
export of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang, however, has said it will not negotiate on its
sovereign right to develop defensive missiles. There are hopes it
may be more flexible on its exports, although they are a vital
source of hard currency for the country.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of talks in Kuala Lumpur, due to hold a final
session Wednesday, has so far focused on the export issue, Kim
Myong Gil, a member of the North Korean delegation, told reporters
before entering the talks Tuesday. U.S. officials did not speak to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has in the past reportedly demanded annual
compensation of $1 billion for three years if it curbs missile
exports.
</P>
<P>
   The United States claims North Korea is the world's top exporter
of missile equipment and technology, with countries such as
Pakistan and Iran as customers.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Pyongyang rattled Asia by test firing a missile
over Japan into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, Einhorn said Monday that the latest
talks were being held in a positive atmosphere, largely due to a
June summit meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and
South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
   The two reached an agreement to reunite some of the many
families that were divided by the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended
without a peace treaty and created the world's most heavily armed
border -- one guarded by thousands of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has also recently agreed to a moratorium on tests of
long-range missiles in exchange for an easing of U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened official talks with Japan, moved to establish
diplomatic relations with many countries in Asia and Europe, and
joined a security forum of Southeast Asian nations.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Starr Deputy Strikes Back  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors plan to show former Kenneth Starr
adviser Charles Bakaly misled a judge about his role in a news leak
and later changed his account to acknowledge he may have
''unwittingly'' confirmed information for a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is countering that any problems were the fault of lawyers
who prepared his statement to the court and omitted information.
''Mr. Bakaly is not responsible for and did not cause that
falseness,'' his lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides laid out their strategies in final court filings
Monday before Bakaly begins trial later this week in a case that
stems from the end of President Clinton's impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is charged with criminal contempt of court, accused of
obstructing justice by making false statements to a judge trying to
determine the source of a news story in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bespectacled former spokesman, who in 1998 announced from
the steps of the Capitol that Starr had referred Clinton to
Congress for possible impeachment, is blaming lawyers in Starr's
office for any misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly alleged in his filing Monday that he detailed his role in
a disputed January 1999 news story to Starr's lawyers, but the
lawyers omitted information from his account before filing a
statement with a federal judge on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued he shouldn't be prosecuted because an appeals
court has concluded that none of the information in the news story
was protected by grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is accused of making three false statements in that sworn
declaration and causing the independent counsel office to make a
fourth in its own filing concerning the news leak.
</P>
<P>
   He alleged that in one instance Starr's lawyers declined to
change language in the sworn statement to make it more detailed and
accurate -- as Bakaly requested -- because the lawyers wanted to keep
information from Clinton's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, he said lawyers told him they omitted
details from his sworn statement because they wanted ''to provide
the minimum amount of information while fully complying with what
was required.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered the former Starr spokesman withheld
information from Starr's office and only later ''changed some of
the details of his story'' when interviewed by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result of Bakaly's false and misleading statements and
representations ... proceedings in this court ... were delayed and
unnecessary work and costs were incurred,'' prosecutors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr, had not
seen Bakaly's filing late Monday and declined comment, his office
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would call two former lawyers for Starr's
office and three FBI agents as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it intends to show the former Starr
adviser misled the court when he signed a sworn statement about the
news leak suggesting that he had ''refused to confirm or comment''
on what Starr's office ''was thinking or doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government said, Bakaly later told the FBI he may
have ''unwittingly'' and ''inadvertently'' confirmed information to
the reporter and ''was in fact'' one of the unnamed associates
quoted at times in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bakaly found support Monday from an unlikely source --
the chief Democratic lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee who
had been a harsh critic of Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Epstein said the case against Bakaly was ''a terrible
prosecution'' and a ''semantical game of gotcha'' because courts
have determined the story Bakaly was accused of leaking was not
covered by grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no real underlying offense here,'' Epstein said.
''This again is example of prosecutors and the legal system going
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a Jan. 31, 1999 story published by The New York
Times that reported -- in the midst of Clinton's impeachment trial --
that Starr's office had concluded that a sitting president could be
indicted in criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   The story became the subject of a leaks investigation, and the
chief federal judge in Washington concluded the story divulged
material covered by grand jury secrecy rules. But the judge was
overruled by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bakaly was ordered to stand trial for criminal
contempt. The leaks case was prompted by a complaint from David
Kendall, the president's personal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly acknowledged in the court filing Monday he talked with
the reporter several times before the story, but said he attempted
to ''steer'' the reporter away from writing the story.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly also acknowledged faxing to the reporter portions of an
internal independent counsel office document that laid out
Watergate-era arguments about indicting a president.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton launches a hands-on drive Tuesday for
peace between Israel and the Palestinians and for a place in history as a
peacemaker. It is not an easy task. By his own and other accounts, no conflict

Philippines Garbage Slide Kills 60

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A mountain of garbage loosened by rain collapsed
and burst into flames Monday at Manila's biggest dump, flattening squatters'
shanties and killing 60 people, officials said. Some 29 other people were
injured and at least 68 and maybe hundreds remained missing late Monday,
officials said. The victims were poor people who earn a living by scavenging
garbage in the Payatas dump. More bodies were recovered overnight and hopes of
finding survivors dimmed Tuesday.

Colombian Leader Outlaws Genocide

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a hard-fought victory for human rights activists,
President Andres Pastrana on Monday signed a law that officially outlaws
genocide and forced disappearances. The law put the crimes on the books, sets
sentences as high as 45 years and creates a commission to investigate the fate
of an estimated 3,000 missing people. Pastrana said that by signing the law he
had once vetoed, he was paying homage to the ''the spirit of so many who
suffered and the families who have searched desperately for their loved ones.''

Bank Workers Strike in South Korea
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- After failing to obtain government guarantees for
their job security, tens of thousands of bank workers went on strike Tuesday.
The union is concerned the government's plans to restructure the industry would
spur bank mergers and lead to layoffs. The initial impact appeared limited, as
banks opened using non-union employees or union members who opposed the walkout.
Last-minute efforts to prevent the strike ended after bank union leaders walked
out of talks with government officials which lasted 6&AMP;frac12; hours.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Editor's Arrest Denounced  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A leading Venezuelan press group on
Monday denounced the detention of a newspaper editor charged with
libeling a prominent businessman with ties to President Hugo
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Lopez, editor-in-chief of the Caracas weekly La Razon, was
detained Saturday after skipping repeated court appearances to
answer the charges of libel by the businessman, a top Chavez
campaign contributor.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan Press Association, an organization of newspaper
owners, said Monday that government aggression against the press
was generating a ''perverse motivation, causing state bodies to
support actions contrary to the Constitution and all notions of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of front-page articles last year, La Razon alleged
that an insurance company owned by Tobias Carrero won government
contracts after making hefty contributions to Chavez's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carrero filed a defamation suit in October.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Perez ordered Lopez's house arrest when he failed to
show up to a hearing Thursday. But a judicial inspector suspended
Perez on Monday, saying he had acted with ''obvious partiality'' in
the case by not allowing Lopez's lawyers to stage a proper defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has ignored a ruling to stop publishing stories on Carrero
and his company, Multinacional de Seguros. ''We're going to keep on
writing,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the legislature, Luis Miquilena, rejected
criticisms of the government's treatment of the press, saying La
Razon writers were ''paid off,'' and that they had criticized
Carrero because ''he didn't buy advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan press groups say the case is the latest evidence of
increasing tensions between the media and Chavez, first prompted
when the president attacked media owners as ''manipulators'' and
''liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chavez pushed through a new constitution containing
an ambiguous clause requiring news outlets to publish ''truthful''
information. Critics have called it a recipe for censorship, while
supporters have said it deepens freedom of expression for
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faces Tight Summit Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After more than a half century of conflict and
countless failed negotiations, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have
just eight fateful days -- if that long -- to find a lasting peace.
Some Mideast experts fear that's not enough time.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, President Clinton said there was no timetable
for completing the talks beginning Tuesday at the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. But a de facto deadline
looms July 19 when Clinton is supposed to fly to Japan for the
annual summit of major industrialized nations. White House
officials said he intended to keep that appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everything breaks right -- and that usually doesn't happen --
about the seventh or eighth day, I would guess, you will know
whether you're going to get there or not. But you won't be there,''
said Samuel Lewis, the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1977 to 1985
and a veteran of the Camp David summit 22 years ago that produced
the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton leaves for Japan, the fear is that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
wander from Camp David, visiting Washington, going to New York,
taking stock about how things look back home, leaking details and
making compromise all the more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if they come back after a break, you will have gone
backward at least half the distance if not all the distance and the
positions will have hardened,'' Lewis said. ''So it's really
unfortunate about this timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japan summit isn't the only reason for staring at the clock.
</P>
<P>
   With his government in tatters, Barak may find it impossible to
linger in the United States while right-wing opponents campaign
against him at home.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, too, has cause to be restless. He was reluctant to go to
Camp David in the first place, fearing he would come under pressure
to make unacceptable concessions on Jerusalem and Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   And time is running out for Clinton. He has less than seven
months in office to make his mark in history as a Middle East
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, if this were easy, it would have been done a long time
ago,'' Clinton said. He said the Middle East poses ''perhaps the
most difficult of all the peace problems in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For a president often criticized for ignoring foreign policy,
Clinton is credited nonetheless with investing a lot of time on the
Middle East, visiting the region more than any other U.S.
president. He has spent countless hours in telephone diplomacy, in
one-on-one meetings and in three-way negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
   He coaxed Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin to shake hands at the White
House, sat with Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu at the Wye River
plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore and shuttled to
Sherpherdstown, W.Va., to oversee Israeli-Syrian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David negotiations probably are Clinton's last chance
for a Mideast agreement. The outlook is grim if the talks fail.
Arafat may carry out his threat to declare a Palestinian state,
possibly as early as Sept. 13. Israel could respond by annexing
land containing Jewish settlements in the West Bank. In that
scenario, there is a high risk of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this thing falls apart then there's going to be a lot of
nasty stuff going on in the region,'' said Lewis, the former
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the high stakes, analysts say there is little risk
politically for Clinton. If an agreement is signed, it's a triumph
for Clinton. If the talks fail, the blame is likely to fall on
Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see how we can even talk about risks of an American
president trying against very, very difficult odds to help bring in
a peace in a very troubled and important part of the world,'' said
Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Visits Germany  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Iranian President Mohammed Khatami brings his
message of a ''new beginning'' with the West to German business
leaders Tuesday, while exiled opponents of Iran's clerical rulers
promised another day of street protests.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stressed Germany's interest in
promoting trade in talks Monday. He announced his government would
offer more export credit guarantees for companies trading with Iran
and revive a bilateral panel on economic cooperation dormant since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was to meet with Germany's conservative opposition
leader and the mayor of Berlin Tuesday before addressing a group of
German business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the security worries accompanying the trip, Khatami
is skipping the traditional walk through Berlin's signature
Brandenburg Gate, where thousands of opponents of Iran's Islamic
rulers protested Monday. More demonstrations were set around the
city for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also raised concerns about human rights in Iran during
his meeting with Khatami. German officials said the discussions
included the recent convictions of 10 Iranian Jews as alleged spies
for Israel -- a charge Israel has denied.
</P>
<P>
   German President Johannes Rau met Khatami earlier Monday and
urged Iran to respect minority rights, the president's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a moderate cleric, has pursued a course of cautious
liberalization and opening to the West since his 1997 election --
overtures limited to Europe since the United States largely still
shuns Iran. Khatami visited Italy and France last year.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Schroeder, Khatami said both sides
should focus on their points of agreement and ''attempt to overcome
the differences in a dialogue. We can also work together well on
economic and political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   German leaders say they wanted to give Khatami support against
powerful Islamic hard-liners who oppose reform. Khatami also is
looking for much-needed investment from Germany, one of his
country's biggest trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   His trip to Germany amid tight security was a sign that both
countries want to look ahead after years of strained or frozen
relations over a German businessman's jailing in Tehran and a
German court ruling that in effect branded Iran a terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was traveling mostly by helicopter, even within Berlin,
and German authorities had stopped an unspecified number of
Iranians at border crossings and airports in recent days after
receiving tips that opposition groups might stage violent
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami travels Wednesday to Weimar for events focused on
German-Iranian cultural links before returning to Iran.

<HEADLINE> US Missile Defense Plans Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is doing a second-by-second
analysis of the latest test failure of its proposed national
missile defense system, as it prepares for what has become an even
more critical test as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to press forward,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner,
spokesman for the troubled program. ''This particular malfunction
doesn't do anything to degrade our confidence in the overall
technology that's been developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, traveling to China, said the
second failed test out of three was disappointing but does not mean
the Clinton administration will give up the goal of having the
system ready to defend against incoming missiles by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns, Cohen is to appear before the Senate Armed
Services Committee to defend the program before Congress for the
first time. The committee chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said
Congress would conduct an ''in-depth analysis'' of the latest
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The next test of the system designed to knock incoming missiles
out of the sky with an unarmed ''kill vehicle'' is set for October
or November and will be very similar to the one that had a double
failure Saturday. The interceptor vehicle failed to separate from
its second-stage booster, and a decoy balloon from the incoming
rocket, designed to deceive the interceptor, failed to inflate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been desirable to have two successful
intercepts, but it doesn't mean the technology is not there yet,''
Cohen said en route to Beijing, adding that he remains convinced a
national missile shield is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had not decided whether to recommend that
President Clinton proceed with construction for the system's
ground-based radar in Alaska -- the next step in a plan for 100
missiles to protect against limited nuclear attack from present or
future enemies or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, a House Armed Services subcommittee chairman,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should it slow down where we're going? No. Will it?
Probably,'' said Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of the military research
and development subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon accused Clinton of not really supporting the system and
predicted he'd use the booster failure as an excuse for not going
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Capitol Hill, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, asked the
Pentagon inspector general to investigate the failure of a decoy
balloon in Saturday's test. That would have made the test suspect
even if it had succeeded, Kucinich said. In an interview, he said
the Pentagon knows the system can't tell a decoy from a real
incoming missile.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people deserve an investigation of this matter to
determine whether the performance failure of the balloon decoy was
indeed the result of a technical malfunction,'' Kucinich said in a
letter to the inspector general. He and 50 other House Democrats
earlier asked the FBI to investigate allegations by some scientists
that the tests were rigged.
</P>
<P>
   For proponents, Saturday's missile miss offered stark evidence
of the vulnerability of American cities to long-range missiles that
might be developed by countries like North Korea or Iraq. Had the
missile been armed and aimed at a real target, an American city
could have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   For critics, it underscored the folly of committing $40 billion
or much more to a missile shield that has angered Russia, China and
Europeans and probably wouldn't work anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Top administration officials said after the test failure that
they expect Clinton to make a decision by the end of summer. No
matter what the president decides, his successor is likely to make
the important decisions on future construction and deployment.

<HEADLINE> Man gets life in children's murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A man convicted of the execution-style
murder of two children in their Rochester home was sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County Court Judge William Bristol listened to convicted
murderer Jose Julian Santiago insist at Monday's sentencing that he
is innocent. Then the judge said: ''You deserve to die in prison,''
the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported. ''Have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, 25, could have been sentenced to death by lethal
injection after a jury found him guilty on June 8 of killing a
14-year-old boy and his 2-year-old nephew during a bungled robbery.
Zyrone Scrivens and his toddler nephew, Drequan, died in their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago was found guilty of first and second-degree murder as
well as attempted first-degree murder for wounding, by shooting and
stabbing, Bernetta ''Goldie'' Wims, 37, and her daughters,
Shuntavia Scrivens, 20, and Chaquita ''Nikki'' Wims, 17.
</P>
<P>
   The women said Santiago, an acquaintance who lived a block away,
talked about being depressed and penniless during a visit to their
home the night of March 1, 1999. They said he then grabbed some
jewelry, demanded cash and turned violent when Wims pleaded she had
none.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago tied them up with telephone cord, blindfolded them and
forced them to lie on a bed, then methodically began shooting and
stabbing each one of them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernetta Wims, whose son and grandson were slain in the attack,
wished Santiago a long life behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look at it like this: He's going to suffer more,'' she said.
''Now he has to endure and deal with things that we worry about,
like whether someone is coming up behind us to hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Richard A. Keenan said Santiago deserves to die
behind bars because he took the lives of two children and gave life
sentences of pain and suffering to their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no sentence this court can impose that would truly
give back to the victims and this community what was taken,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago - withdrawn and silent through much of the trial -
lashed out as he stood before Bristol and made his first public
comment about his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have a fair trial,'' he said, claiming the jury
lacked evidence to convict him. ''The trial was messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the court, Monroe County District Attorney Howard R.
Relin said he was disappointed that Santiago showed no remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen a defendant more despicable, without morals,
without a shred of human decency, than Jose Santiago,'' He said.

<HEADLINE> Democracy Barely Holding On  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The map showed a sea of green but the red that
was Cuba stood out -- the lone country in the hemisphere that was
not a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department created the map and liked to use it to
highlight the democratic trend in the hemisphere as well as
communist Cuba's isolation. But it has fallen into disuse lately, a
reflection of the tenuous state of democracy in much of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico bucked the trend with its democratic leap forward a week
ago but in many countries, democracy is barely holding on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Incomplete and inappropriate'' was the way the State
Department described Sunday's parliamentary runoff elections in
Haiti. The principal complaint, shared by the United Nations and
the Organization of American States, was that it failed to include
Senate seats not won in the first round by an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
   Officials still harbor hopes that Haiti will reverse course and
reaffirm its commitment to a democratic outcome. But Haitian
officials have stood by their process in the seven weeks since the
initial round of voting was held.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials consulted Monday with other hemispheric countries
on a response.
</P>
<P>
   There were extensive consultations as well after Peruvian
authorities decided to go ahead with a May 28 presidential runoff
despite concerns about the reliability of new vote-counting
software -- and appeals by international observers that the
balloting be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was eager for vigorous action against
Peru but few hemispheric countries shared that view. In the end, an
OAS delegation that visited Peru settled for a wish list of reforms
it hoped might make the next elections more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Outright military coups are no longer part of the Latin American
reality. Except for Haiti in 1991, there have been no such power
grabs since Argentina in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But there are enough deviations from constitutional norms to
give committed democrats pause. Besides Peru, the countries seen to
be the most vulnerable are Venezuela, Ecuador and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the democratic tide
that began in Latin America two decades ago is being threatened by
persistent poverty and ineffective government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fruits of growth in the last decade have not appeared on
every table within or among countries in our region,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shifter, an associate at the Inter-American Dialogue,
said the hemispheric community has chosen to ignore press
crackdowns and other anti-democratic abuses by Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shifter said this emboldened Fujimori to embrace
quasi-authoritarian policies. A stronger U.S. stand early on could
have made a difference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shifter also said he was discouraged by the trends in Venezuela,
where the perception of corrupt civilian administrations over the
past 40 years has induced many to look to the military for
solutions; both leading candidates in national elections later this
month, including President Hugo Chavez, gained fame by staging a
coup attempt against the elected government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''This model is completely at odds with the way people thought
democracy would develop in Latin America,'' Shifter said.
</P>
<P>
   The military should remain in the barracks and the United
States, working through hemispheric institutions, should be driving
this point home more forcefully than it has, he said.

<HEADLINE> $100 gun buyback program in Brooklyn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police have launched a gun buyback program in
Brooklyn, aiming to take hundreds of weapons off the streets for
the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's program netted 659 weapons in four weeks, police
Commissioner Howard Safir and Brooklyn District Attorney Charles
Hynes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative started at the beginning of the month and
will run until August. So far, 10 guns have been turned in.
</P>
<P>
   Under the buyback program, anyone who turns an operable weapon
in at a police station house receives amnesty and a $100 voucher
redeemable at the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The guns will undergo ballistics tests to determine if they've
been used in city crimes, then they will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The program, to be advertised in posters and pamphlets printed
in Chinese, Creole, English, Polish, Spanish and Russian, is funded
by drug forfeiture money. A buyback program begun in 1992 ended in
1995 when the money ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the program say gun owners use the $100 rewards to
purchase newer and more powerful weapons on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's program was nicknamed ''Turn it in for a Benjamin,''
a reference to Benjamin Franklin, whose face is on the $100 bill.
Police collected an Uzi machine pistol worth $3,000 on the streets,
a three-shot .22-caliber Derringer that could fit in someone's
palm, a 12-gauge shotgun, a sawed-off shotgun and scores of
semiautomatic weapons and revolvers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 126 homicides in Brooklyn this year, down from
145 during the first half of last year.

   Rabuka, who led two coups in 1987 and then ruled as prime
minister for 12 years, is now head of the Great Council of Chiefs,
which has been called upon to put the finishing touches to a
solution to Fiji's 7-week hostage crisis by naming a new president
and government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has said he will release his 27 hostages and turn in his
rebels' arms as the chiefs meet Thursday. He has said he would not
put his name forward for a Cabinet post, but would accept one if it
were offered by the chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has been holding the hostages since storming Parliament
on May 19 saying he wanted to protect the interests of indigenous
Fijians and disenfranchise the ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   He and the military, which seized control of Fiji 10 days after
Speight's coup, signed an agreement Sunday to end the crisis, which
has paralyzed the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes an amnesty for political crimes committed
until Thursday, when military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama
is to step down as head of state, along with the interim government
he installed a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   It also meets Speight's demands for scrapping Fiji's multiracial
constitution and dumping the democratically elected government of
Mahendra Chaudhry, the country's first ethnic Indian prime
minister. Chaudhry and many of his ministers are Speight's
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview with a Sydney, Australia, radio
station, Speight denied orchestrating a wave of civil unrest that
has swept over Fiji in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Speight sympathizers have occupied three police stations, a
military camp, the hydroelectric plant that supplies power to the
main island of Viti Levu, and the tuna plant. They also have
blockaded traffic and shut down a regional airport for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   There were also unconfirmed reports of workers taking over
Telecom Fiji, the state-owned telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   ''What must be understood is that Fiji people are acting of
their own accord,'' Speight told 2UE radio.

<HEADLINE> 10 Said Dead in Indonesia Bus Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A bus plunged into a deep ravine on
Indonesia's main island of Java, killing 10 people and injuring 13
others in a group on its way to a wedding, reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle was overloaded with 39 passengers when its brakes
failed and it skidded off the road and into the valley near
Sarangan village Sunday, the official Antara news agency said.
Sarangan is about 420 miles east of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Most passengers escaped death as the bus got stuck in the
branches of a pine tree instead of crashing to the valley bottom,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indonesian bus companies have tried to maximize profits by
cutting back on maintenance and packing vehicles with passengers.
Indonesia's roads have also deteriorated in recent years. Both
factors have led to a string of deadly accidents in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Big Cat To Cap Inspiring Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A year ago, Andres Galarraga was sitting at home,
watching baseball's All-Star game on TV as chemotherapy drugs
flowed through his body. It could have been one of the lowest
points of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Galarraga. The player nicknamed the Big Cat already
believed he was on his way to a comeback from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was never negative about it,'' he says. ''As soon as the
doctors told me I would get better and better, I started working
hard to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of baseball's most inspiring stories has come full circle,
with the Atlanta Braves' 39-year-old first baseman starting for the
National League in the midsummer classic just 17 months after
doctors discovered a tumor in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight players skipped Tuesday night's All-Star game
because of various ailments, and Galarraga's ordeal makes those
guys with broken fingers and sore knees seem rather wimpy.
Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall, who suffered a grotesque ankle injury
last season, knows his own comeback was overshadowed by
Galarraga's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be,'' says Kendall, the National League's starting
catcher. ''I dislocated my ankle. He was dealing with his life.
There's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Major leaguers Eric Davis, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Lowell
have all beaten cancer in recent years. But Galarraga missed an
entire season at an age when most players contemplate retirement
and the disease attacked a part of the body that is critical to
swinging a bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves weren't exactly confident he would recapture his
swing. They insisted that Wally Joyner be included in a trade with
San Diego, providing insurance at first base. They told Galarraga
to go easy at spring training, figuring he would need a month or
two to build up the strength in his back and regain his timing.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga wouldn't hear of it. By opening day, he looked like
the same hitter who averaged 44 home runs and 137 runs batted in
during the three seasons before cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew he would still be strong,'' says Braves outfielder
Andruw Jones, a fellow All-Star. ''But to see him come in and swing
the bat like he was swinging right away, that was crazy. I was
getting chills.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached the All-Star break hitting .294 with 20 homers and 62
RBIs for the first-place Braves. Galarraga was named to the
starting lineup when Mark McGwire backed out because of an injured
knee.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, who recovered from a bout
with prostate cancer last season, says Galarraga's comeback is one
of the most inspiring stories in sports, matched only by cyclist
Lance Armstrong's recovery from the disease to win the Tour de
France.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question when you hear that 'C' word, the only
thing you associate with it is death,'' Torre says. ''It's not
really that dark hole you initially think. But to have Andres come
back. I mean, I come back and sit on my rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   There were grim moments for Galarraga during his treatment. The
chemo caused nausea and a weight gain of some 40 pounds, making it
difficult for him to even to look at his once-sculpted body in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Galarraga never lost faith. By the
time of last year's All-Star game, the chemo had destroyed 75
percent of the tumor, convincing him that he would beat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga considers himself an inspiration to others dealing
with cancer. As an All-Star before his hometown fans, he didn't
rule out a few tears flowing down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no words to explain,'' Galarraga says, ''how good I
feel.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: White House Targets Moviess  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Federal drug policy-makers who sparked
protests after trying to sprinkle anti-drug messages into the
nation's TV shows plan to expand the campaign to Hollywood, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy, wants to work more closely with major
studios, writers and directors to promote films that communicate an
anti-drug message, the Los Angeles Times said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As powerful as television is, some experts believe that movies
have an even stronger impact on young people,'' according to
McCaffrey's planned statement, a copy of which was obtained by the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal promises to reopen debate about the government's
efforts to get its anti-drug message out to young people. The new
policy was expected to be unveiled during congressional testimony
scheduled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is something that's not positioned as a joint
cooperative effort, it will have a hard time getting any
traction,'' said Andy Zahn, an executive with the DreamWorks
studio.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCaffrey came under criticism when it was disclosed
that his office had been quietly giving major TV networks millions
of dollars worth of financial credits for including anti-drug
messages in popular shows such as ''E.R.,'' ''Beverly Hills,
90210'' and ''Cosby.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Shadow Hours'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may sound difficult, but try imagining a cross between
''Eyes Wide Shut'' and ''Clerks.'' The result is a movie called
''Shadow Hours,'' which has no real point and apparently was made
for pure shock value.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Holloway (Balthazar Getty, who looks eerily like Charlie
Sheen) is a recovering drug addict expecting his first child with
wife Chloe (Rebecca Gayheart), the woman who stuck by him as he got
sober. To make ends meet, he works the graveyard shift at a gas
station in a seedy section of Los Angeles, where sundry freaks
accost him throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   One night, a sleek, well-dressed man (Peter Weller) pulls up in
a Porsche. He says he's a writer named Stuart Chappell, and,
improbably, invites Michael to come along as he does research for a
book on Los Angeles nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   The two men go out over a series of nights, with each
destination getting darker and darker. They begin at strip bars,
then progress to drug dens and S&AMP;M clubs. There's even a warehouse
reminiscent of ''Fight Club,'' where bare-chested men beat each
other bloody while others cheer and place bets.
</P>
<P>
   Each place tempts Michael to return to his addiction and cheat
on his doting wife, and each place is more ridiculous than the
last. It's hard not to laugh at times, such as when the refined
Stuart orders an expensive French wine at a topless bar.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a visit to a warehouse where gun-toting midgets play a
high-stakes game of Russian roulette also is good for a few
unintentional laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a useless subplot about a serial killer (who may or
may not be Stuart) who snaps women's necks, and the bumbling cops
who try to nail him.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the point? Surely it can't be that it's better to
stay home with your wife than go bar hopping with a mysterious
stranger. If that's the only message, then ''Shadow Hours'' was
made just to be shocking.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary on performance art and people who take part in
these fetish clubs would have been more interesting. At least then
we might learn something.
</P>
<P>
   Director Isaac Eaton begins the film as if it were an episode of
''Melrose Place,'' with the obligatory montage of Los Angeles
images -- the Sunset Strip, the busy freeways, the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he relies too heavily on a repetitive gimmick to indicate
the passage of time during Michael's long, monotonous shift. He
shows the digital display on a gas pump ticking off gallons, then
cuts to the clock on the wall, then cuts to the cash register
opening and closing, with techno music thumping in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Once is enough with this trick.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, who wrote and co-produced, does get the details right on
Los Angeles at night. The clubs and the weirdos seem accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Far more fun than the movie itself, though, are the closing
credits. If you can endure the first 95 minutes, it's worth
sticking around a little longer to find out who played ''Second
Transvestite,'' ''Man Licking Toes'' and ''Man with Hooks In
Face.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Shadow Hours,'' a CanWest release, somehow managed to get
shown at this year's Sundance Film Festival. It is rated R for
strong violence, sex, drug use and language.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: Wisdom of Crocodiles  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS GRYGIEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Grlscz is in a rut. He meets girls, dates them and kills
them. Then he meets a nice young woman and falls completely in love
with her, and she with him. Suddenly, he doesn't feel like killing
her, and that's a problem for Steven, because he needs to kill her
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is ''The Wisdom of Crocodiles,'' a
slick-looking Jude Law film that starts with promise but stumbles
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Law plays Steven, a handsome, articulate young medical
researcher who carries some hefty baggage into relationships -- he's
a vampire. Think dressed-to-the-nines urbane London bloodsucker,
not the dark-cape-and-fangs creatures of old.
</P>
<P>
   Law, the mesmerizing co-star of ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
''Gattaca,'' is the main reason to see ''The Wisdom of
Crocodiles.'' His icy cool performance is riveting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crocodiles,'' which was released in Europe in 1998 before Law
had made much of an impact with American audiences, contrasts good
and evil and suggests the two are interconnected. Steven is at
times very good and seems genuinely empathetic to people in the
hospital at which he works.
</P>
<P>
   He's also very bad. At the beginning of the film, he adroitly
seduces a young woman. She goes back to his place, he chomps on her
neck until she's dead and then he dumps her body in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It soon becomes apparent that Steven has done this sort of thing
before. He chronicles his relationships in elaborate diaries. He
gets women to fall for him and then kills them because to live, he
needs the blood of those who love him.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen recover the body of his latest victim at about the
same time he meets Anne Levels (Elina Lowensohn), a stunning
engineer who captures his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Two police detectives suspect Steven of killing his previous
love interest and begin investigating. It is at this point that
''Crocodiles'' starts to fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   This film can't decide what it wants to be -- mystery, fantasy or
a love story with a twist. Director Po-Chih Leong, who has had
success with films in Hong Kong, is no stranger to martial arts
fight scenes. He even has Law beat up a group of London toughs in a
well-choreographed action sequence.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the action gets going, the film downshifts as the
relationship between Steven and Anne grows more intense. All the
tension that should come from the movie's ultimate question -- will
Steven kill Anne? -- is drained by a painfully prolonged ending.
Where there should be dialogue and motion, there are periods of
extended silence while Steven and Ann brood.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final question is answered, the audience has
grown tired of the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Wisdom of Crocodiles'' is a Miramax Films release. It is
rated R for strong violence and gore, language and sexuality.
Running time: 98 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Vermeer Interest Extends to Opera  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Johannes Vermeer's modest output of quiet,
domestic masterpieces has inspired numerous works imagining him and
his world -- most recently a flurry of novels and, now, an opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Writing to Vermeer,'' which has its U.S. premiere Tuesday at
the Lincoln Center Festival, is primarily a study of domestic
harmony. Its libretto was written by filmmaker Peter Greenaway,
better known for provocative, often rough material in movies such
as ''The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' ''Prospero's
Books'' and the recent ''8&AMP;frac12; Women''.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway was trained as a painter and says his interest in the
17th-century Dutch painter is longstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel I'm part of the current wave of Vermeer
enthusiasm,'' Greenaway says. ''My enthusiasm started when I was an
art student.'' He noted that his 1985 film, ''A Zed and Two
Noughts,'' touched on Vermeer ''as a master of light.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Writing to Vermeer'' grew out of a lecture that Greenaway gave
at a showing of Vermeer paintings in the Hague in 1996. The same
exhibition, which showed in Washington, D.C., the year before, also
inspired the authors of four recent novels: Tracy Chevalier, who
wrote ''Girl With a Pearl Earring''; Susan Vreeland, ''Girl in
Hyacinth Blue''; Deborah Moggach, ''Tulip Fever''; and Katherine
Weber, ''The Music Lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Vreeland, whose novel traces the provenance of a painting
through the generations, speculates that Vermeer's appeal lies in
his works' serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to do with our fast-paced lives and the calm and
tranquility of the lives that he is picturing,'' she says. ''He
presents, very often, a woman in a contemplative moment, alone in
her house, with gorgeous, honey-colored light coming in from a
window, bathing her and an object. I think he loved to suggest the
value of things. It's a spare interior but just by that spareness,
we notice a loaf of bread or a pitcher of milk or a woman holding
up a string of pearls.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway's libretto emphasizes similar themes.
</P>
<P>
   For his lecture at the Hague, Greenaway wrote 18 fictional
letters to Vermeer from his wife, mother-in-law and a model while
the painter was away from his home in Delft in 1672. (Vermeer
really did make a rare trip away from home in 1672 to appraise some
paintings at the Hague.)
</P>
<P>
   For the lecture, Greenaway and colleague Saskia Boddeke used
three actresses to portray the women and read the letters. In the
audience was Pierre Audi, head of the Netherlands Opera, who
suggested that Greenaway turn the work into an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway and composer Louis Andriessen had had a success with
their first opera collaboration, ''Rosa,'' at the Netherlands Opera
in 1994. It told the tale of a South American composer of Westerns
who loved his girlfriend and his horse, especially the horse. All
three met gory ends. Nonesuch Records released ''Rosa'' on CD in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway says he and Andriessen saw ''Writing to Vermeer'' as a
gentle answer to ''Rosa.''
</P>
<P>
   '''Rosa' was very violent. Women were depicted in a completely
different way. We wanted this to be about something you could say
was the complete opposite,'' says Greenaway, whose films, too, have
sometimes generated controversy over their treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   Andriessen used about a third of the text from the letters for
his one-hour, 40-minute opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were low-key, about domestic matters, about the
children,'' Greenaway says. ''We think Vermeer was a very domestic
man. He had 11 children. They were about the price of canvas and
where to buy good ultramarine'' for paint. Vermeer himself isn't a
character in the opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our starting point was celebrating the domestic serenity
Vermeer was so successful at capturing,'' Greenaway says. ''His
paintings show women who have their own space and dignity. Our job
was to make a worthwhile work of art about domestic harmony which
had some profundity about it and wasn't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ''But harmony is difficult to show.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Greenaway, Boddeke rightly realized that ''To
understand harmony, you oppose it with its opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Boddeke, who directs the opera, inserted additional scenes
depicting the harshness of the outside world, in contrast to the
Vermeers' family life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opera is about harmony, the warm family life. But the
outside world, through violence, is bringing the harmonious world
out of balance,'' she says. ''We have brief 'inserts' which stop
the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch composer Michel van der Aa wrote electronic music for the
inserts,which depict Holland's economic crisis when tulips became
too expensive; a fatal explosion of stored arms in Delft; street
riots between Catholics and Protestants; a killing by a mob; and
the deliberate flooding of Holland to drive out the invading
French.
</P>
<P>
   Boddeke added two characters -- a milkmaid and a servant. For
her, important aspects of the opera are the strength, independence
and education of the women, and people's need to find balance and
live a good life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Writing to Vermeer'' premiered in Amsterdam last Dec. 1 and
was performed at the Adelaide Festival in Australia in March. Its
Lincoln Center performances will be Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The main singers are Kathryn Harries as the mother-in-law, Susan
Narucki as the wife and Barbara Hannigan as the model.

<HEADLINE> Congo Vaccinations Called a Success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A three-day polio vaccination campaign in Congo
went ahead as planned over the weekend without major interruption
from fighting, the U.N. Children's Fund said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which took place from Friday to Sunday, was the
first of three rounds scheduled this year to vaccinate Congolese
children against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local rebel groups had been brought on board,'' UNICEF
spokeswoman Lynn Geldof said, adding that it covered all regions of
the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
   Some 11 million children under age 5 were targeted in the
campaign, which saw 250,000 people administer the vaccine, Geldof
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initial feedback is very good, indicating that 80 percent
of urban children and 60 percent of rural children have been
covered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the operation was largely uninterrupted by fighting,
''there have been a number of incidents in South Kivu,'' in the
east of the country, in which aid workers' vehicles were targeted,
Geldof said. In one area, the campaign was postponed for two days
because of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based International Medical Corps said it was
suspending its work in Congo after an ambush Sunday near Uvira that
left one health worker dead and two of its members injured.
</P>
<P>
   Congo is a top priority in the fight against polio as it has one
of the highest rates of polio virus transmission. Further
immunization rounds are planned for August and September, with the
total cost this year reaching $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Recent fighting in Congo's two-year-old conflict raised doubts
over the campaign. Teams in eastern Congo had to overcome rumors
that the vaccines had come from Rwanda, which is backing rebels
opposed to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, Geldof said.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF and the World Health Organization have urged 30 African

<HEADLINE> Ibuprofen Said Helpful to Preemies  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ibuprofen works just as well as a drug used to cure a
blood-vessel problem common in premature babies and is less likely
to cause a dangerous side effect, researchers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released by the New England Journal of Medicine
two months before its Sept. 7 publication because of its potential
value for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by doctors at five Belgian intensive care units for
newborns, compared ibuprofen to a drug called indomethacin for
closing the short duct which lets blood bypass the lungs before
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Because fetuses do not breathe, blood does not need to flow
through the artery which pumps blood into the lungs to pick up
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, just outside the heart, it is shunted from that artery
through a very short link to the aorta, the big artery which
carries oxygen-laden blood to the body.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, this closes within a day or two after birth.
</P>
<P>
   However, it often stays open in premature babies. Blood which
should go to the body returns to the underdeveloped lungs, which
can be overloaded along with the heart.
</P>
<P>
   As many as one-third of all premature babies have the problem
and rates are higher among babies weighing two pounds or less, said
Dr. Brian Barkemeyer, head of neonatology at the Louisiana State
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Indomethacin often is used to close the connection. But it can
keep the kidneys from producing enough urine -- a condition called
oliguria -- which disrupts sodium chloride and potassium levels in
the body, Barkemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at five intensive care centers for newborns gave
intravenous ibuprofen to 74 premature babies whose health was
endangered by the heart problem, called patent ductus arteriosus.
They gave intravenous indomethacin to 74 others.
</P>
<P>
   The connection closed in about the same number of babies: 49
given indomethacin, and 52 given ibuprofen, or about 66 percent to
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only five babies treated with ibuprofen had the kidney problem,
compared with 14 treated with indomethacin, wrote the lead author,
Dr. Bart Van Overmeire of University Hospital Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   Other side effects were about the same for both drugs.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Looks to Next Missile Test  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is doing a second-by-second
analysis of the latest test failure of its proposed national
missile defense system, as it prepares for what has become an even
more critical test as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to press forward,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner,
spokesman for the troubled program. ''This particular malfunction
doesn't do anything to degrade our confidence in the overall
technology that's been developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, in Beijing for a meeting with
Chinese defense chief Gen. Chi Haotian on Wednesday, said the
second failed test out of three was disappointing but does not mean
the Clinton administration will give up the goal of having the
system ready to defend against incoming missiles by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he will tell the Chinese, who oppose the U.S. system,
that both a national missile defense and regional missile defenses
are needed to counter a ''proliferation of missile technology.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returns, Cohen is to appear before the Senate Armed
Services Committee to defend the program before Congress for the
first time. The committee chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said
Congress would conduct an ''in-depth analysis'' of the latest
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The next test of the system designed to knock incoming missiles
out of the sky with an unarmed ''kill vehicle'' is set for October
or November and will be very similar to the one that had a double
failure Saturday. The interceptor vehicle failed to separate from
its second-stage booster, and a decoy balloon from the incoming
rocket, designed to deceive the interceptor, failed to inflate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been desirable to have two successful
intercepts, but it doesn't mean the technology is not there yet,''
Cohen said en route to Beijing, adding that he remains convinced a
national missile shield is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had not decided whether to recommend that
President Clinton proceed with construction for the system's
ground-based radar in Alaska -- the next step in a plan for 100
missiles to protect against limited nuclear attack from present or
future enemies or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, a House Armed Services subcommittee chairman,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should it slow down where we're going? No. Will it?
Probably,'' said Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of the military research
and development subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon accused Clinton of not really supporting the system and
predicted he'd use the booster failure as an excuse for not going
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Capitol Hill, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, asked the
Pentagon inspector general to investigate the failure of a decoy
balloon in Saturday's test. That would have made the test suspect
even if it had succeeded, Kucinich said. In an interview, he said
the Pentagon knows the system can't tell a decoy from a real
incoming missile.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people deserve an investigation of this matter to
determine whether the performance failure of the balloon decoy was
indeed the result of a technical malfunction,'' Kucinich said in a
letter to the inspector general. He and 50 other House Democrats
earlier asked the FBI to investigate allegations by some scientists
that the tests were rigged.
</P>
<P>
   John Isaacs, president of the anti-nuclear Council for a Livable
World, said Tuesday that the test failure should ''slow the program
down significantly. ... The bottom line is that the national
missile defense is still not ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   For proponents, Saturday's missile miss offered stark evidence
of the vulnerability of American cities to long-range missiles that
might be developed by countries like North Korea or Iraq. Had the
missile been armed and aimed at a real target, an American city
could have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   For critics, it underscored the folly of committing $40 billion
or much more to a missile shield that has angered Russia, China and
Europeans and probably wouldn't work anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Top administration officials said after the test failure that
they expect Clinton to make a decision by the end of summer. No
matter what the president decides, his successor is likely to make
the important decisions on future construction and deployment.

<HEADLINE> White House Seeks Hollywood's Help  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House drug policy chief plans to
take his message to Hollywood, expanding on a program of working
with the nation's TV shows to dissuade young people from taking
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through continuous dialogue we believe we can raise awareness
about how images of substance abuse in the movies impact audiences,
particularly young audiences,'' Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a
prepared statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As powerful as television is, some experts believe that movies
have an even stronger impact on young people,'' McCaffrey told the
House Government Reform subcommittee on criminal justice, drug
policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office plans to work closely with major studios,
individual writers and directors in order to impact film. This
process has already begun, he said, through workshops, briefings,
roundtables and one-on-one conversations with industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal promises to reopen debate about the government's
efforts to get its anti-drug message out to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is something that's not positioned as a joint
cooperative effort, it will have a hard time getting any
traction,'' Andy Zahn, an executive with the DreamWorks studio,
told the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McCaffrey came under criticism when it was disclosed
that his office had been quietly giving major TV networks millions
of dollars worth of financial credits for including anti-drug
messages in popular shows such as ''E.R.,'' ''Beverly Hills,
90210'' and ''Cosby.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey noted that the creative process in producing a film is
different from that of television, with scripts often years in
development. ''As a result, the campaign takes a long-term view on
working with filmmakers and understands that we may not see
concrete results for several years.''

<HEADLINE> Daley Bids Farewell to Commerce  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''Flowery farewells are not my style,''
Commerce Secretary Bill Daley said Tuesday, taking a break from the
Gore campaign to say goodbye to thousands of department employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did want to get together -- not to say goodbye -- but to say
thank you,'' said Daley, whose last day as the department's chief
is Friday. ''Thanks for all of the help you have given me these
last 3&AMP;frac12; years.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley took over last month as chairman of Vice President Al
Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have loved every minute of this job. I will miss all of
you,'' an emotional Daley told Commerce employees packed into the
department's cavernous lobby. He assumed the helm in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Daley recalled his introduction to department employees as
President Clinton's nominee in December 1996. He hadn't taken time
to eat that day and fainted on the stage as Clinton was speaking.
''People in the front row may want to back up,'' Daley joked.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., an executive with Lockheed
Martin Corp., has been tapped by Clinton to lead the Commerce
Department and become the first Asian-American Cabinet secretary.

<HEADLINE> TV Production Is Back in Baltimore  </HEADLINE>
By BEN NUCKOLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- It's a curious malady, one that doesn't get
much attention, and the concentration of those afflicted is
particularly high around Baltimore. It's called ''Homicide''
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   While the critically acclaimed, Peabody award-winning police
series never gained a large national audience, the devotees in its
city of origin were fanatical. For true fans, withdrawal symptoms
persist, even if time dulls their pain.
</P>
<P>
   A few people who work in the television industry, however, have
found a cure. TV production has returned to Baltimore with ''Young
Americans'' -- premiering at 9 p.m. EDT Wednesday on the WB -- and
the tight-knit crew that made ''Homicide'' possible is back at
work.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between the two series end there. Instead of
tough crime stories, ''Young Americans'' is a prep-school drama in
the tradition of ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ''Dawson's Creek,''
casting young adults as teen-agers and placing them in outrageous
situations.
</P>
<P>
   The crew sees nothing wrong with that. Their workplace moved
from the city's roughest streets to a soundstage in the industrial
Locust Point neighborhood and a handful of idyllic locations
outside the city line. Their goal is to transform Baltimore into
Rawley Academy, a private school in a lakeside New England village.
</P>
<P>
   A mansion north of the city provides the exteriors for the
school, and the lake is nearby Loch Raven Reservoir. Sleepy Havre
de Grace, at the mouth of the Susquehanna River 33 miles northeast
of Baltimore, stands in for the New England town.
</P>
<P>
   From these locations emerges an airbrushed, anonymous Baltimore,
one that can effectively appear to be much further north. Steven
Antin, creator and executive producer of ''Young Americans,'' said
he was amazed at the city's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baltimore is mostly known for 'Homicide,' which had
illustrated the grittiness of it,'' Antin said. ''What we've
discovered is an incredibly beautiful city.''
</P>
<P>
   Production designer Vincent Perenia, who worked on ''Homicide''
for its entire seven-year run and has also worked with
Baltimore-based filmmaker John Waters, says he's enjoyed the
opportunity to create an idealized milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about youth. It's about lushness,'' he said. ''It's
really going to be a gorgeous show.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's beauty extends beyond the locations. Antin has
followed a WB formula by assembling a cast of virtual unknowns who
are just as easy on the eyes. In particular, Kate Bosworth and Ian
Somerhalder are likely to inspire scores of adoring Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Antin, 35, says ''Young Americans'' represents the perfection of
youth. Yet he has filled their lives with the turbulence of
adulthood. Here's a list, by no means complete, of the issues that
pop up in the first episode: class conflict, gender confusion, the
possibility of incest, lying, cheating, abusive parents,
philandering parents, love, lust, disappointment and
self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's chock full of incidents and twists and turns,'' Antin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a female character who disguises herself as a boy
to attend all-boys Rawley Academy. Unlike Teena Brandon, the
subject of last year's emotionally wrenching film ''Boys Don't
Cry,'' Jake Pratt (Katharine Moennig) isn't suffering from a
gender-identity crisis. Her predicament is played for comedy and
sex appeal, as she falls for fellow student Hamilton Fleming
(Somerhalder).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the romance between privileged Rawley student Scout
Calhoun (Mark Famiglietti) and the striking townie Bella Banks
(Bosworth). They fall in love with astonishing quickness, only to
find out they're brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively stable presence at the show's center is Will
Krudski, the point-of-view character, played by Rodney Scott with a
chip too large to fit on Will's 15-year-old shoulders. An otherwise
intelligent working-class kid, Will has cheated on Rawley's
entrance exam to gain admission.
</P>
<P>
   The former ''Homicide'' crew hopes the show will catch on enough
to continue on the WB after the summer. ''We were all sad when
'Homicide' left because we thought it was a quality show,'' Perenia
said. ''And now, this looks like it has a good possibility of being
a hit.''

<HEADLINE> States Face Jail Release Penalties  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States that release murderers, rapists or
child molesters who then commit similar crimes would have their
federal funding cut under a bill approved by the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would transfer $100,000 in federal law enforcement
funds from the state that released the criminal to the state where
he or she committed the new crime. The bill was passed by voice
vote and sent to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the bill, sponsored by Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.,
is to get states to impose sentences of at least life without
parole for murderers, rapists and child molesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victims in these crimes don't get a second chance. Why
should these criminals?'' Salmon asked.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the measure would create a cumbersome bureaucracy
and have little impact on crime. The funding penalty would not
apply to criminals who served more than 85 percent of their
sentences in states with ''truth in sentencing'' laws requiring
criminals to serve most or all of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., said that means the bill would not
apply to criminals released from prisons in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal is laudable, but this stupid, dumb process that this
bill puts in place ... is simple-minded,'' said Rep. Mel Watt,
D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has been dubbed ''Aimee's Law'' after Aimee Willard of
Brookhaven, Pa., a student at George Mason University in Virginia.
She was murdered in suburban Philadelphia in 1996. Arthur Bomar,
who had been released from a Nevada prison after serving 12 years
for another murder, was convicted of killing her and sentenced to
death.

</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine T-38A Talon jet trainer crashed about 9:40 a.m.
while it was approaching a runway, according to a news release from
the base in southern Maryland, southeast of Washington. Base

<HEADLINE> DEA Drug Informant Is Caught Lying  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- In 16 years on the street, working in cities
across the country as an informant for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Andrew Chambers put up some big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Seized: 1.5 tons of cocaine and $6 million in assets. Arrested
and convicted: 445 drug dealers and other criminals. Earned: at
least $2.2 million in rewards and other compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambers' detractors can point to some big numbers of their
own: He has been arrested at least 16 times, and lied over and over
on the witness stand about those arrests -- as well as about his
educational background and whether he had paid taxes on his DEA
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those lies, prosecutors have dropped charges against
15 alleged drug dealers around the country, and at least 12 others
who were convicted in part on Chambers' testimony are demanding
release.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers could grow. The DEA is going through each
transcript of every trial Chambers has ever testified at, looking
for lies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's information that we think we have an ethical
responsibility, if not a legal responsibility, to be able to
provide to prosecutors who still have pending cases,'' said DEA
spokesman Terry Parham. ''This information, on top of that, needs
to be turned over to the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The DEA insists Chambers never lied about the drug deals he
busted up. But Dean Steward, the former federal public defender who
is generally credited with bringing Chambers' lying to light,
questioned that.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you got a guy that would lie about just about everything
else, why do you think he would tell the truth about what led up to
the deal?'' Steward said. ''That's just common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Chambers' lies deprived defense attorneys of
information they were legally entitled to have to try to undermine
his credibility in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA considers Chambers, 43, the most valuable undercover
informant in its history. But he was dropped in February, and his
actions are forcing the agency to take another look at how it uses
informants in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the DEA has determined is that Chambers started lying
in 1985, one year after he began work as an informant. The agency
also determined that DEA agents knew he was lying in 1985 but
continued to use him without telling prosecutors and defense
attorneys about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telephone listing for Chambers in the St. Louis
area. But Chambers appeared recently on ABC's ''20/20'' and took
questions during an online chat after the broadcast. He insisted he
lied only about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was truthful about what happened when the deal was going
on,'' he said. ''I didn't think that what I said about myself was
that important. Everything that happened during the deal was
recorded on video and I was accompanied by federal agents. The guys
were drug dealers. They had prior histories before I even met
them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Parham, Chambers was embarrassed to admit he had
been convicted of soliciting a prostitute, and arrested on
suspicion of assault, forgery, writing bad checks and impersonating
a federal agent.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers had also testified that he had paid his income taxes;
it turns out he didn't pay taxes on $100,000 the DEA had paid him
over six years. He had also testified that he studied criminal
justice at Iowa Western Community College; the school has no record
of his attending.
</P>
<P>
   The high school dropout from suburban St. Louis got his start
with the DEA after a stint in the Marines. He walked in to the St.
Louis field office seeking to join up as an agent. Without a
four-year college degree, Chambers wasn't eligible. But the DEA
signed him up as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers' work took him all over the country conducting
''reverse sting'' operations. He would fly into a city, and using
rolls of cash, brand-name clothing and luxury cars, make contact
with drug dealers and sell them cocaine. The DEA would make the
arrest and pay Chambers for his expenses and his information. His
highest fee: $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''He built his reputation on being good -- based on the results
being achieved in both federal and state courts,'' Parham said.
''The fact is, he had an innate ability to infiltrate some of our
country's most dangerous and violent trafficking organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Steward who first drew attention to Chambers.
Representing a man charged in a murder-for-hire case in Southern
California, Steward filed a Freedom of Information lawsuit and
obtained background on Chambers in 1999. Now Steward is trying to
use Chambers' lies to get the evidence against his client thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no convictions stemming from Chambers' testimony have
been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers is unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how the DEA or the defense lawyers or prosecutors
feel, but I did a good job and maybe now some person's kid won't be
touched by these drug guys,'' he said during the online chat.
</P>
<P>
   Parham, in fact, considers Chambers a hero for his DEA work:
''For what he did for the American public in working for us in the
fight against drug trafficking, he has to be considered as that.
Without a doubt.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS MDs Try Changes With Therapy  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Doctors are cautiously taking
patients off their AIDS drugs for a few weeks at a time to see if
breaks in therapy are safe and perhaps even more effective than
giving the grueling treatment continuously.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, described Tuesday at the 13th International
AIDS Conference, departs from the commonly held dogma that even a
brief interruption in drug treatment will allow the AIDS virus to
come roaring back in a mutant form that is impossible to control.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally interrupted therapy is still considered
experimental. But doctors say it potentially has several important
advantages, including lower cost, fewer side effects and temporary
relief from a demanding pill schedule. Furthermore, it could make
AIDS therapy more practical and affordable in poor parts of the
world, where the sophisticated combinations of medicines are simply
beyond the reach of most people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S. National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described promising but still
early results with the approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patients are absolutely delighted at the prospect of spending
half of their lives off therapy,'' Fauci said of those taking part
in his experiments.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fauci noted at least a dozen teams around the world are
studying the approach -- which he calls structured intermittent
therapy -- and it will be at least a year before doctors know
whether it is safe. Until then, he cautioned against interrupting
treatment outside carefully conducted studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The long-term effect on the emergence of resistance and the
ultimate clinical course of patients remains to be determined,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when combination therapy revolutionized the
treatment of AIDS, some researchers optimistically theorized that
it might be possible to cure AIDS by wiping out the virus. Later,
though, it became clear that the virus continues to reproduce at
extremely low levels and hides in long-living cells of the lymph
tissue, where it is beyond the reach of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't cure HIV with the present drugs,'' said Dr. Mauro
Schechter of the University of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, doctors need new strategies for using the
available medicines to hold HIV in check, and interrupted therapy
''will be a big thing in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors experimenting with the approach monitor patients'
virus levels and put them back on their pills when HIV returns
strongly. However, Fauci's team cycles patients on and off therapy
without regard to virus levels.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, intended to enroll 70 people, patients take
drugs for two months followed by a one-month break. The virus soon
comes back when people stop their drugs, but all measurable levels
disappear when treatment resumes, and no resistant viruses have
been seen so far.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said that after two to three cycles, the virus appears to
come back less strongly in some people, suggesting that the immune
system may gear up to control the virus better when it is exposed
to HIV in brief bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, disease-fighting blood cells called CD8 T-cells might
be stimulated this way to actually control HIV without the need for
further drugs. However, Fauci said this is probably a long shot for
most patients.
</P>
<P>
   In a smaller pilot study, patients are taking their drugs on a
week-on, week-off schedule. In this experiment, the virus never
returns to more than minimal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said abruptly stopping all drugs is key to preventing the
growth of drug-resistant viruses, which often happens when patients
cut back on their drugs but still take them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New
York City said interrupted treatment ''is a worthy area of
pursuit,'' but he said it remains to be seen whether drug-resistant
viruses eventually emerge.
</P>
<P>
   One common problem of AIDS treatment is that patients' viruses
often grow resistant to their drugs, even when they take them on
schedule, and they must switch to new combinations. Dr. Scott
Holmberg of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said Fauci's method may also help lengthen the time people can use
each regimen.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 1,300 patients, he found that on average people
could stay on a regimen about 11 months before it lost its punch.
Their second combination worked for eight months and their third
for six.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Garbage Slide Kills 91  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Backhoes dug through mounds of
blackened, stinking refuse and workers pulled corpse after corpse
from the filth Tuesday, a day after a wall of garbage collapsed in
Manila's main dump, crushing a collection of shacks and killing at
least 91 people.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for survivors continued Tuesday evening, relatives
of the missing sat weeping and waiting for their loved ones' bodies
to emerge from the acres of trash that buried them. Several black
bags with unclaimed bodies lay on an open basketball court.
Estimates of the number of people still missing ranged from 72 to
300.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost hope, but even if they are dead, I still want to
see them,'' said Gemma Espenilla, whose son, mother and grandfather
were buried in the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Wilson Carpio was awaiting word on his wife, two
children and seven nieces and nephews, all feared buried under the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Land of Hell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were poor people who lived in an area called the
Promised Land -- a group of huts and lean-tos near Payatas, a
municipal dump with garbage piled as high as seven stories in some
places. Impoverished squatters, including many children, live in
the area and pick through the dump to collect items they can sell.
</P>
<P>
   A chunk of that mountain of garbage, weakened by a typhoon that
swept through the Philippines last week, thundered down onto the
shacks Monday, then burst into flame. The collapsed debris
apparently ignited from fallen power cables or stoves in the huts.
</P>
<P>
   Through the night and into Tuesday, rescuers dug through the
rotting trash using shovels and two backhoes. But they were
hampered by the stench and a lack of equipment, including reliable
lighting. Plastic and other non-biodegradable refuse also made it
difficult for the hundreds of volunteers and soldiers to dig
through the collapsed section of garbage, which covers an area the
size of four basketball courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost impossible to get anybody alive at this time,
after 24 hours,'' said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also
heads the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six of the 59 people pulled alive from the debris earlier
were taken to hospitals with injuries, and more than 800 people
whose houses and shanties were destroyed or threatened were given
shelter in nearby schools and churches. At one shelter, Clarita
Garduque sat on the floor in shock, unable even to eat after losing
seven of her nine children.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada quickly promised a safer garbage system
for Manila, the Philippines' capital. He promised that bidding
would be held next week for a new city waste management system that
would no longer simply dump unprocessed garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's high time to come up with a national policy on solid
waste management,'' Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow people to live so dangerously under the shadow
of death in this dump site,'' Mercado said. ''We should have
implemented the law much more strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump, along with a former dump in Manila's Tondo
slum district called Smokey Mountain, have long symbolized the
wrenching poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, ordered Smokey Mountain
closed in the mid-1990s and built apartment buildings at the former
eyesore. The Payatas dump site was to be closed permanently last
December, but the plan was postponed until later this year because
residents near a landfill in nearby Rizal province refused to allow
waste from metropolitan Manila to be dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have tried in recent years to relocate the
hundreds of scavengers living around the Payatas site, but most
have refused to move. On Tuesday, officials were considering
demolishing shanties along narrow streets around the dump to make
way for bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   The pope sent a condolence message to the families of the
victims, noting they were ''among the poorest of the world.'' He
expressed hope that the survivors would receive the assistance
''which their human dignity demands.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Upbeat; Stocks Move Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Tuesday following
an upbeat speech on productivity and the New Economy from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 79.55 to 10,726.13 in
early afternoon trading. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also rose,
gaining 1.65 to 1,477.27.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks pulled back from a rally earlier in the day, sending
the Nasdaq composite index down 22.16 to 3,958.13.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Governors' Association, Greenspan
repeated his views that the explosion in use of the computer and
other high-tech devices has boosted America's productivity growth,
the amount of output for each hour of work. Increased productivity
has been a primary contributor to the nation's long economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan didn't give any indication about whether the Fed would
raise interest rates at its August meeting. Investors have been
hoping the the Fed may be finished raising rates for now following
its six increases over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo shares slumped, losing $9.25 to $100.75, although the
Internet bellwether was expected to announce strong earnings later
in the day. Other Internet companies followed Yahoo lower,
including America Online, down $2 at $53.75; and Amazon, down
$2.375 at $32.688.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, trading was quiet as the corporate earnings season got
under way, but so far the announcements have been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum maker Alcoa reported stronger-than-expected earnings
Monday, and International Paper followed suit with its own strong
earnings report Tuesday. Shares of Alcoa were up $2.313 at $32.313,
and IP shares were up $1.944 at $34.188.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson also reports its second-quarter
earnings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues by a margin of 11
to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 663.19
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.00 to 529.83.

<HEADLINE> French Actor Undergoes Bypass  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French movie star Gerard Depardieu underwent
successful coronary bypass surgery and is recovering in a Paris
hospital, his film agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ArtMedia said the 51-year-old actor had surgery Monday at the
Foch hospital in Suresnes, outside Paris. The agency said doctors
decided to perform the operation following tests, but that there
was no emergency. It said Depardieu was expected to recover fully.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Gilles Dreyfus, who conducted the six-hour operation,
said the actor was admitted last week after suffering from chest
pains.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no alternative treatment,'' Dreyfus said, adding
that the patient was doing very well but would have to stay in
hospital another eight or nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Depardieu is France's most prolific actor, with more than 100
movies to his credit, including ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ''The
Return of Martin Guerre'' and the English-language comedy ''Green
Card.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, he attended the Cannes Film Festival in southern France
to promote the lavish period drama ''Vatel'' and was filming a
comedy when he fell ill. He is expected to return to the set soon,
his film agency said.

<HEADLINE> French Journalists Held Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- A French journalist missing in a remote
jungle used a satellite telephone Tuesday to tell Philippine
officials that she and two colleagues have been taken hostage by
Muslim rebels already holding at least 33 other captives, many of
them foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists from the French TV2 agency failed to return
Sunday after traveling to a camp held by the Abu Sayyaf rebels to
interview the hostages, who include 20 tourists snatched from a
nearby Malaysian diving resort on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said Maryse Burgot
called his aide and said they were being held by the Abu Sayyaf,
but the journalist did not disclose other details.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said Burgot pleaded in a shaking voice to talk with
Philippine President Joseph Estrada. Burgot did not say if the
rebels were demanding a ransom for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The French journalists -- Burgot, Jean-Jacques Legarrec and
Roland Madura -- were among the few foreign reporters still covering
the hostage crisis on southern Jolo island. Most others left after
a German reporter for Der Speigel magazine, Andreas Lorenz, was
abducted by armed men on July 2. He is also believed to held at an
Abu Sayyaf camp.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said he also was able to talk with an Abu Sayyaf
commander, Ghalib Andang, using the French journalists' satellite
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Andang, who also uses the name Commander Robot, offered to
release the hostages in exchange for a ransom of about $1 million
each, Aventajado's aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's talk. We have already 36 hostages, there are too many
hostages here already,'' Andang said, according to Aventajado.
Andang apparently did not include Lorenz in his count. His group is
also believed to be holding three Filipinos kidnapped recently on
nearby Basilan island.
</P>
<P>
   Andang did confirm that the rebels are also holding 13 Christian
evangelists who traveled to the Abu Sayyaf camp on July 1 to pray
for the 20 original captives, Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim rebels have accused the Christians, who belong to a
group called the Jesus Miracle Crusade, of bringing along police
spies disguised as evangelists and of showing disrespect to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   For the preachers' freedom, the guerrillas are demanding that
government troops abandon camps they have seized from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, a separate group of Muslim rebels who are
also fighting for a separate Islamic state in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the evangelists further complicates government
efforts to free the original 20 hostages, some of whom have become
ill from their long jungle captivity. A 21st hostage, a Malaysian
kidnapped with them, was freed last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, German hostage Werner Wallert wrote to Estrada,
asking him to allow the payment of about $1 million in ransom for
the release of his wife, Renate, the most ill of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they would abide by the government's no-ransom
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada called the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas ''crazy and very
callous'' but said his administration's primary concern remains
''the safety of the hostages,'' suggesting he was not entertaining
a military solution.

<HEADLINE> Pregnancy AIDS Treatment Helps  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Treating HIV-infected mothers during
pregnancy reduces the number of babies who get AIDS, even if the
women risk passing on the virus later through breast-feeding,
researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have shown that giving AIDS drugs such as AZT
during pregnancy can substantially reduce the risk of passing on
HIV at birth. However, more than half of all mother-to-child HIV
transmission results from breast-feeding, and some have questioned
whether the early treatment actually matters in the end.
</P>
<P>
   A new analysis, presented Tuesday at the 13th International AIDS
Conference, suggests indeed it does, even though breast- feeding
clearly does wipe out much of the advantage of the treatment during
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stefan Z. Wiktor and colleagues from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention analyzed two studies conducted on
641 births in Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. In both studies, women
were treated with AZT during the last month of their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   At birth, 14 percent of the babies were infected among mothers
getting AZT, compared to 23 percent among those who received dummy
pills. The researchers then followed the babies while most of the
infected mothers breast-fed.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, 22 percent of the babies whose mothers received
AZT were infected, compared with 30 percent of those who got
placeboes.
</P>
<P>
   A similar study, to be presented later this week, analyzed how
many of the babies in both treatment groups had died of all causes
after two years, and not simply how many had AIDS infections. It
found no statistically meaningful difference between the two
treatment groups.
</P>
<P>
   Wiktor said this is because the survival advantage from AZT was
overwhelmed by the large number of deaths from other infant
diseases, such as diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Wiktor said that while passing HIV through breast milk is a
serious dilemma, ''we don't have to solve that problem in order to
start these regimens'' to prevent AIDS transmission at birth.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study, conducted in South Africa, confirms an earlier
landmark report showing that a simple dose of another AIDS drug
called nevirapine is just as effective as more complicated AZT
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, which costs about $4, involves one dose of
nevirapine during labor, one after birth, plus one dose to the
newborn. Dr. Daya Moodley of the University of Natal compared this
with a combination of the drugs AZT and 3TC.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks after birth, the infection rates were virtually
identical -- 14 percent in the nevirapine babies and 13 percent in
the comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message is very simple,'' said Moodley. ''Providing women
with a single dose of nevirapine, you can reduce by at least
one-third the transmission from mother to child.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Boehringer Ingelheim, which makes nevirapine, said it
would offer the drug free to developing countries to help stop
mother-to-child spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3.8 million children have died of AIDS since the
epidemic began.

<HEADLINE> Bashar Assad Wins Syria Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- A month after the death of Hafez Assad,
Bashar Assad on Tuesday completed the smooth ascent to the
presidency that his father had planned, winning 97.29 percent
approval in an election in which he was the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament formally announced that Bashar Assad's swearing-in
ceremony will be on July 17, after which he will embark on a
seven-year term that is full of risks.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which is key to the control of this nation of 17
million people, and the political establishment have rallied around
Bashar Assad. In him they see a chance for a continuation of the
stability enjoyed under the elder Assad for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, a former eye doctor, will have to test his unhoned
skills as a politician against domestic and foreign challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Before his father's death, he had been closely associated with
an anti-corruption campaign that earned him popularity among
ordinary Syrians. But if he continues the purge and at the same
time liberalizes Syria's shackled economy, he risks alienating some
powerful people who have benefited from a corrupt and controlled
market.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, the late president gave Bashar Assad
several tasks -- both at home and in neighboring Lebanon where Syria
is the main power -- to thrust him into public roles and
recognition. But he has also left his son delicate unfinished
business: negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights, captured
by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad pledged he would not accept anything less than the
recovery of all of the Golan, a position his son has adopted but
one that leaves him with little room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the results of Monday's referendum, Interior
Minister Mohammed Harba said Syrians have said '''Yes' to the
constant path ... and a promising future.''
</P>
<P>
   Harba said that of the 9.44 million eligible voters, about 8.93
million cast their ballots, a nearly 94.6 percent turnout.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 8.69 million voters said ''yes,'' 22,439 voters said
''no,'' and 219,000 votes were spoiled, said Harba.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports that some people were coerced into voting,
Harba said: ''The masses that have been crying since President
Hafez Assad's death, have they been forced to shed tears? ... Such
reports do not harm Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the referendum, held exactly one month after
Hafez Assad's death on June 10, was never in doubt. The elder Assad
had ruled Syria with an iron grip and had designated Bashar as his
successor. Hafez Assad received between 99.6 and 99.99 percent of
the vote in his presidential referendums, which, like Monday's,
were orchestrated by the Baath party

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Austin Powers'' star Mike Myers is
countersuing Universal Pictures, claiming that a process server for
the studio chased him ''in a threatening manner down dark, winding

</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Monday, comes after Universal sued Myers on
June 5 for breach of contract because he backed out of a movie
based on the character Dieter, from a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit.
Myers has said he backed out because the script needed work.
</P>
<P>
   In the countersuit, Myers is seeking at least $20 million for
invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.

<HEADLINE> Alzheimer's Vaccine Safe So Far  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary results from the first human study
of a possible Alzheimer's vaccine suggest the experimental compound
is safe, a pharmaceutical company announced Tuesday. Scientists
said it is far too soon to tell if the vaccine will actually do
patients any good.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Pharmaceuticals' experimental vaccine raised tremendous
excitement last year when the company discovered that in mice, the
compound could ward off and even reduce the brain-clogging plaques
that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, mice aren't humans,'' cautioned Dale Schenk, Elan's
lead scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Elan has begun small studies in people to see if the vaccine is
safe. If so, the company hopes to launch larger studies, possibly
by the end of 2001, to test whether the vaccine might slow
progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease -- and maybe
improve symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the first safety results from those Phase 1 trials, none of
the 24 Americans with early Alzheimer's who received a vaccine
injection suffered side effects, Schenk said. ''There's no question
the vaccine was well-tolerated,'' he told an international meeting
of 2,800 Alzheimer's researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes an important second step: Elan is enrolling 80 British
patients with early Alzheimer's into another Phase 1 study and
giving them three shots of the vaccine over several months. Their
immune systems will be checked for early signs that the vaccine is
strong enough to activate immune cells necessary to fight disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all very excited about this but it is very early,'' said
Dr. Ivan Lieberburg, Elan's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows if the vaccine ultimately will help, the
experiments are hopeful because they are grounded in years of basic
research into just what role the brain-clogging deposits, made of a
sticky substance called amyloid, actually play, said Alzheimer's
Association vice president Bill Theis.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease afflicts some 4 million Americans. It starts
with forgetfulness but relentlessly progresses to full dementia
until finally killing its victims. The three available drug
treatments provide only partial relief for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' brains are full of sticky amyloid plaques. It is not
clear if the plaques cause Alzheimer's disease or are a result of
it. Regardless, studies show they lead to death of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The plaques' main ingredient is beta amyloid, a fragment of a
normal body protein that somehow goes awry in Alzheimer's. Some
patients produce too much beta amyloid and others simply do not
clear it out of the brain properly.
</P>
<P>
   Elan theorized that a vaccine made from beta amyloid would
stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack the protein.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, vaccinated mice developed immune system antibodies that
traveled to the brain and ''tagged'' amyloid plaques. That tagging
seems to alert microglial cells, which Lieberburg calls the brain's
''garbage-men,'' to head for the plaques and try to eradicate them.
Upon dissection, the brains of vaccinated mice contained no or very
small plaques while their unvaccinated littermates had extensive
plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Another study unveiled at the Alzheimer's meeting supports
Elan's work. University of Toronto scientists taught mice bred to
develop an Alzheimer's-like disease to swim through a water maze.
Over several months, vaccinated mice remembered how to get through
the maze far better than unvaccinated mice, promising evidence that
the vaccine may affect symptoms, not just plaque.

<HEADLINE> 100 Charred Nigerians Discovered  </HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- More than 100 charred bodies, many of them
children in school uniforms, lay scattered among burned palm and
rubber trees Tuesday after a damaged gasoline pipeline exploded in
southern Nigeria, killing villagers scavenging fuel in buckets and
chamber pots.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was expected to climb. About 100 villagers were
seriously injured; 100 others were reported missing, witnesses and
news reports said. The cause of the explosion was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Some local newspaper reporters who visited the scene estimated
between 150 and 250 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the blast occurred Monday morning when the
punctured 12-inch pipeline caught fire near the villages of Adeje
and Oviri-Court, in the oil-rich Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The fire continued to burn Tuesday and clouds of black smoke
hung over the area. State petroleum company workers and
firefighters were trying to extinguish the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline was carrying gasoline from a refinery in Warri to
northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The accident resembled a similar tragedy in nearby Jesse, where
more than 700 people were killed in October 1998. Since then, the
government has tried to educate villagers about the danger of
''scooping,'' the illegal practice of scavenging fuel from
pipelines. But absolute poverty in the region means many people
remain willing to risk death for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really wasn't a surprise. Our people know the danger of
scooping for petrol. But they have to survive,'' said Austin
Obaseki as he grimly observed the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the injured were taken to a hospital in Warri. But many
others were being treated at home by traditional doctors because
they feared arrest. In the past, the government has prosecuted and
even threatened to shoot pipeline vandals on sight.
</P>
<P>
   The blast destroyed fields and buildings within a one-mile
radius. Burned corpses lay scattered about the area Tuesday -- some
still clutching containers used to collect fuel -- while villagers
began burying other bodies in shallow graves.
</P>
<P>
   Sola Adebayo, a reporter for Lagos' Daily Times newspaper,
counted 100 bodies before giving up. Other reports estimated the
dead at 150 to 250.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Akpele, a farmer living near Oviri-Court, said in a
telephone interview that he heard a loud explosion early Monday and
saw swarms of people running and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Many were unable to outrun the leaping flames, other witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was total confusion. We were all shocked and confused,''
Akpele said. ''I just thank God all 13 of my children are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   What sparked the explosion remained unclear although witnesses
said the pipeline had been punctured by vandals days earlier.
Children and adults flocked to the area from surrounding villages
each day to gather the gasoline in buckets and sell it along
roadsides, the witnesses added.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were not available for comment Tuesday. An
Information Ministry statement issued late Monday said ''several
lives'' were lost and ''a vital petroleum products pipeline''
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government sympathizes with the families of those who lost
their lives in the incident,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases of sabotage are carried out by militant activists
trying to force the government and oil companies to give
compensation to communities for land use and alleged pollution. In
other cases, villagers collect the gushing fuel to make a crude
mixture of oil and gasoline for cheap generators and other motors.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of the oil imported by the United States.
Sales of crude oil account for more than 80 percent of the
government's revenue, and disruptions caused by sabotage are
especially painful at a time when oil prices have skyrocketed from
1998 lows.

<HEADLINE> House Nixes Change to U.N. Holy See  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By a 416-1 vote Tuesday, the House condemned a
campaign led by a Catholic abortion rights group to change the
status of the Holy See at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anything the Holy See deserves a more prominent role in the
United Nations,'' said Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., author of
the nonbinding resolution objecting to the effort to end the
permanent observer status the Holy See has held at the U.N. since
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for a Free Choice has been leading the campaign, named
''See Change,'' demanding a review of the Holy See's status and
urging that it be treated as a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion rights group says the Holy See has misused its
status, which gives it many of the same rights as a full member but
not a vote in the U.N. General Assembly, to push an anti-abortion
agenda. The group says it has more than 400 signatures from
organizations that want to review the Holy See's claim to be a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, one of the House's most outspoken foes of abortion, said
the proposal was ''an ideological power play motivated by
anti-Catholic and pro-abortion sentiments.'' He compared it to past
efforts to expel Israel from the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ''This attack against the Vatican strikes at our bedrock
democratic values that teach us tolerance for legitimate
differences of opinion,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, said in support of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., has sponsored a similar resolution in
the Senate. The one no vote in the House was cast by Rep. Pete
Stark, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy See is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in
Vatican City. It currently has formal diplomatic relations with 169
nations.

<HEADLINE> Gray Wolf Makes Remarkable Recovery  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government proposed Tuesday to reduce
federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had
successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more
could die as a result of the change.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the
wolves -- all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest --
as threatened rather than endangered. That means authorities would
have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into
account concerns from private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced
to parts of New Mexico and Arizona -- only 22 wolves -- would remain
endangered because they continue to be under the threat of
extinction, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf -- also known as the
timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered
species success story.'' But she said the increase in the number of
wolves will allow her agency to ''structure wolf recovery to meet
the needs of the species and those of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection,
the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as
''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand
into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf
experts said. Those include vast areas of the West and even parts
of New England, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the less restrictive designation might convince
landowners in the Northeast -- where currently there are no wolves
known to exist, despite ideal habitat for the animal -- to accept
future wolf recovery plans from Maine to upstate New York,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But as threatened -- a less protective designation under the
federal Endangered Species Act -- some wolves also may be captured
or killed if they threaten livestock or fall under another less
restrictive provision of a formal wolf management plan.
</P>
<P>
   The gray wolf is currently classified as endangered throughout
the country except in Alaska and in Minnesota -- where it has a
''threatened'' classification.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the
northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the
northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in
Yellowstone National Park in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s, today
there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in
Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The reintroduction
of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in
Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made the right choice to ... bring these animals back from
the brink of extinction,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant
reclassification.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups
with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the
lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf's
range.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mixture of good news and bad,'' said Bob Ferris of
Defenders of Wildlife. He said he wasn't opposed to the
reclassification, but was concerned that the government ''is not
considering any further recovery areas'' and that some wolves could
lose federal protection entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal
''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far
short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would
establish four distinct population segments, based on the primary
ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection
in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains but Nasdaq Slips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Tuesday following
an upbeat speech on productivity and the New Economy from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 59.05 to 10,705.63 in
afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 28.72 to 3,951.57 as tech stocks
pulled back from a rally earlier in the day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index edged up 0.17 points to 1,475.79.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Governors' Association, Greenspan
repeated his view that the explosion in the use of computers and
other high-tech devices has boosted America's productivity, the
amount of output for each hour of work. Increased productivity has
been a primary contributor to the nation's long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan didn't give any indication about whether the Fed would
raise interest rates at its August meeting. Investors have been
hoping the the Fed may be finished raising rates for now following
its six increases over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo shares slumped, losing $7.063 to $102.944, although the
Internet bellwether was expected to announce strong earnings later
in the day. Other Internet companies followed Yahoo lower,
including America Online, down $1.875 at $53.875; and Amazon, down
$2.125 at $32.944.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, trading was quiet as the corporate earnings season got
under way, but so far the announcements have been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum maker Alcoa reported stronger-than-expected earnings
Monday, and International Paper followed suit with its own strong
earnings report Tuesday. Shares of Alcoa were up $1.938 at $31.938,
and IP shares were up $2.438 at $34.688.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson also reports its second-quarter
earnings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues edged ahead of declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 785.54 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.30 to 529.53.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Watching Camp David Closely  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- As if the hopes of the Palestinians were not
pressure enough, Yasser Arafat also carried with him to Camp David
on Tuesday the hopes of Arabs from across the region.
</P>
<P>
   They want him to return with at least part of Jerusalem in Arab
hands, and with a solution for the refugees crowded into camps in
Jordan, Lebanon and Syria -- touching on two of the most difficult
issues before Palestinian and Israeli negotiators at the summit
President Clinton opened Tuesday at Camp David, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt on the eve of the summit, President Hosni Mubarak's
chief political aide, Osama el-Baz, told reporters that Arabs
throughout the region, Muslim and Christian, had a stake in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Arafat is not free in dealing with the Jerusalem
issue fully as long as there are other dimensions apart from the
Palestinian dimension,'' el-Baz said, noting there were also
''Jewish rights and dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel insists that the city so holy to Muslims, Jews and
Christians will remain united under its sovereignty. The
Palestinians want east Jerusalem as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
   Camp David is known as the place where treaties are forged. The
mountain retreat is where then-President Jimmy Carter brought the
Israelis and the Egyptians close to their 1979 peace, the first in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But Michel Edde, a former Lebanese Cabinet minister who closely
follows Israeli-Lebanese affairs, expected no Camp David
breakthroughs this time.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, he said, is under great pressure not to compromise, both
from Palestinians and other Arabs. Meanwhile, Barak is weakened by
the collapse of his governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no settlement without east Jerusalem coming into
Arab hands. Not only in Palestine, but in Egypt, in all Arab
countries, in all Islamic countries, it is an absolute
requirement,'' Edde said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his country is the uneasy host of some 350,000
Palestinian refugees, scattered across 13 squalid camps. Lebanon
denies them citizenship rights. Edde said Lebanon, riven by
unemployment and Muslim-Christian tensions, cannot afford to give
them a permanent home should Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
fail to agree that they can return to the homes they lost in the
wars and unrest that followed Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot give Palestinians jobs here when our children do not
have jobs,'' he said. ''It is not a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is similar in Jordan, where an estimated 1.5
million Palestinian refugees form the bulk of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jordan takes a firm stand in refusing to accept a new influx
or to absorb any refugee -- whoever he may be and under any
pretext,'' Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu-Ragheb told his
parliament Sunday. His declaration followed unsubstantiated
newspaper reports of a hidden U.S.-Israeli plan to resettle in
Jordan an estimated 750,000 Palestinian refugees now in Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said there will be no blanket ''right of return'' for
Palestinians displaced in 1948 and 1967 wars.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, where an estimated 350,000 Palestinians have found
refuge, a militant Palestinian leader feared Arafat would not be
able to stand up to pressure applied by Barak and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regretfully, what is happening is very painful and the
Palestinian people and the Arab nation will be the only ones to pay
the price,'' Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Damascus-based Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, said in a
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Khaldoun Abu Ruman, a 77-year-old Palestinian living in Amman,
Jordan's Wehdat Camp, was equally pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis ''are strong and we are weak. Why should a man leave
your house while he is standing there, pointing a gun at you?
Because you ask him gently? No. That will not happen,'' he said
Tuesday. ''I wish to die in my homeland. I wish to see it again, at
least once before I die.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ponders Effective Speech  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A reflective President Clinton says that even
after a lifetime in politics he still cannot predict what things he
says in a speech will have the most impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no formula, a lot of it is just instinct,'' he told
reporters Monday on Air Force One during a flight from State
College, Pa. to Philadelphia. ''You just never know what people
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had addressed the National Governors Association summer
meeting at the university town and stopped en route to his plane to
get a cone of ''Peachy Paterno'' ice cream -- named after Penn State
football coach Joe Paterno -- at the creamery on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   He said figuring out how to communicate ideas effectively is ''a
continuing challenge, almost a riddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that because attention spans vary it is difficult
to gauge how best to persuade people to agree with his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people are more like flowers in the morning. They open up
for a while and they close down for a while because they've got
other things to deal with in their lives and they can't take all
that incoming information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two former speechwriters for presidents of different parties had
a different view. They said they often could guess what resonates
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''You usually do know what will hit,'' said Clark Judge who
wrote for President Reagan during both of his terms. ''One of the
differences is that he (Reagan) had a more focused message that we
were driving. You have to have something to say and people have to
take you seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Sorensen, who wrote for President Kennedy, said they
were able to predict what language would have the desired effect on
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that President Kennedy and I had some sense of the
lines that would inform, as distinct from those that stirred
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen said Clinton is being ''unduly modest'' because the
president is one of the most effective modern political speakers,
especially in small settings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he read several books on personal communications
but they have not given him any great revelations about how to
better hone his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Vice President Al Gore's address to next month's
Democratic Convention would require different skills than a regular
speech and must target three audiences: the crowd in the hall,
television viewers and those who read newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was defensive about his nominating speech at the 1988
Democratic National Convention, often criticized for being too
long. He said he sent three versions of the speech to the campaign
of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis and they chose the longest
one.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Warns Cruise Lines About Fires  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cruise ship companies should drop their
opposition to installing individual smoke detectors in crew and
passenger quarters, federal safety investigators said Tuesday,
warning that smoke from fires onboard endangers thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, reporting on its
investigation of fires aboard five cruise ships over the past four
years, said it could not accept the cruise industry's objections to
the safety devices. The board first urged the installation of local
smoke detectors on cruise ships in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''The No. 1 concern that the safety board has with regard to
cruise ship safety is fire,'' said board chairman Jim Hall. ''They
(cruise ship companies) really have failed to deal in good faith
with the American people on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the International Council of Cruise Lines said
the organization expected to respond quickly to the request.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the safety board noted that 6 million passengers
boarded cruise ships in American ports last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''These passengers are every day placed in danger because the
ships lack an important safety item, a local sounding alarm,'' the
board said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board said that the cruise line industry opposed
recommendations first made by the board in 1997 after its
investigations of fires aboard the Universe Explorer off Alaska and
the Bahamian passenger ship Vista Fjord en route to the Azores.
Five crewmen died of smoke inhalation aboard the Universe Explorer
and 67 crew members and two passengers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The ICCL, the voice of the industry, opposed the proposals
before the International Maritime Organization on grounds that
individual smoke detectors produce numerous false alarms which
could result in mass panic aboard ship
</P>
<P>
   The safety board rejected these arguments and called on the
cruise industry to withdraw its opposition and support a full
discussion on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   It said its original 1997 proposal did not envision the
automatic triggering of a ship-wide automatic alarm based on the
activation of a single local or cabin smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore the local alarm could not be expected to result in a
mass panic situation,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   But it said that since a smoke alarm would result in alerting
the ship's central fire control station, ''the crew could be
immediately informed of the activated alarm and would be able to
launch an appropriate response without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fires aboard the Universe Explorer and the Vista
Fjord, the safety board has investigated three other cruise ship
fires. These nonfatal fires occurred aboard the Ecstasy in 1998,
the Tropicale in 1999 and the Nieuw Amsterdam this year. The safety
board said there were nearly 9,000 people aboard the five ships
when the fires occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board said the additional ship fires underscore the
need for automatic smoke-detector alarms in crew and passenger
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had these ships been equipped with automatic local-sounding
smoke alarms, the injured individuals would have had earlier
warning of smoke, would then have had more time in which to escape,
and probably would not have been trapped or injured,'' the safety
board said.

<HEADLINE> Tips for Elderly Financial Planning  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Here are tips to remember when
selecting
living trusts and other financial planning services.
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Choose your financial planning adviser carefully.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ask for a written list of credentials. Qualified, capable
attorneys, insurance agents and financial planners will provide a
list of states in which they are licensed, along with the name,
address and phone number of their employer. Check licenses with the
state bar association, the state insurance bureau and state
consumer's agency.
</P>
<P>
   3. Call references.
</P>
<P>
   4. Talk to several experienced estate planning attorneys who are
licensed in your state about the anticipated costs of drafting
estate planning documents. Ask how much probate in your state would
cost and how much time it would take.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't do business with someone if their answers to your
inquiries about their credentials make you uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   6. Before creating a living trust, review the amount and type of
your assets and decide how you want your assets distributed.
</P>
<P>
   7. Compare the prices of products of door-to-door sales people
with those of experienced estate planning attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   8. Take your time to decide what are the best financial planning
tools for your circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   9. You must fund a living trust by transferring money or
property to the trust to make the document effective. Be aware of
extra costs you may incur if you need to sell property after you
put it into a revocable trust, for instance, to pay for extended
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
   10. Be aware of the personal liabilities that may be imposed on
the trustee when distributing the trust assets after your death to
creditors and beneficiaries.

<HEADLINE> Living Trust Schemes Target Elderly  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When 84-year-old Walter Kulinski was
approached by salesmen about establishing a living trust, the
Wisconsin man thought he had found people to help him provide for
his heirs after he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now just over two years later, with Kulinski in failing health,
his family says he was sold a poorly written trust and bilked out
of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elderly don't realize that everyone they interact with may
not be legitimate,'' Judy Kulinski, the man's daughter-in-law, told
a Senate hearing Tuesday. ''With the increasing numbers of elderly
adults, we need to find a way to protect them from today's not so
trusting world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say the Kulinskis aren't alone. Each year scores of
seniors are targeted for costly living trusts that are often not
needed; many still have no idea their documents are worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers held Tuesday's hearing to study the issue and weigh
whether action should be taken on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   A recent AARP study found that 18 percent of people over the age
of 50 and with incomes of $25,000 or less had a living trust.
That's a 125 percent growth in the number of people in that
category who had living trusts in 1991, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anecdotal evidence suggests that those with modest means, who
have the least amount to pass on to their heirs, are being sold a
high-priced package through aggressive financial planning
promotions. . .,'' AARP president Tess Canja told the Senate's
Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''Living trusts are being hyped by salespersons -- not lawyers --
who want to sell products,'' Canja said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Canja said, the salespersons' material falsely suggests
that AARP endorses or supports the product even though AARP does
not endorse any company that markets or sells living trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors ''need to be aware that these scams exist,'' said Sen.
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa and the committee's chairman. ''Living
trusts aren't for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A living trust is an increasingly popular estate planning tool
that allows an individual to set up a trust for his or her assets.
The assets must be turned over while the individual is still living
for the trust to go into effect. The trusts are most often used by
those who want to avoid the probate process, which can be
time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Many living trust sales outfits are legitimate and can be useful
for those with complicated estates and distribution needs,
particularly those with estates larger than $675,000 -- the maximum
estate allowed before federal estate taxes kick in.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that companies are targeting seniors of modest
means who don't require complicated legal products.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the concern, officials said, are boilerplate trusts
that don't conform to the various state laws. Many seniors are also
sold other expensive financial products during the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kulinski case, the Pewaukee, Wis., man's trust was drawn
up based on California laws and never filed, the family said.
Adding to the family's woes, Walter Kulinski's IRA was later
transferred to another firm and a 30-year annuity was set up,
liquidating over $280,000 from mutual funds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kulinski's failing memory forced prosecutors to drop the case
and allow restitution. Still, Judy Kulinski estimates her
father-in-law lost over $30,000 from the incident.

<HEADLINE> Russia Braces for Chechen Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Bracing for renewed attacks by Chechen
militants, Russian authorities tightened security Tuesday in Moscow
and elsewhere across Russia, and fearful civilians fled large
Chechen cities in anticipation of new fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been warning that the rebels were planning
terrorist attacks, and amplified the alarm after a series of
bombings last week that killed at least 33 troops and wounded
scores more. Eleven civilians perished in the blasts in four towns,
Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen civilians received rebel warnings to leave the breakaway
region's largest cities including the capital Grozny, the northern
town of Gudermes -- where the pro-Moscow Chechen government has its
headquarters -- and Urus-Martan in the southwest, the independent
NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
   They were leaving these towns in buses, Russian media said.
Meanwhile, a woman was injured in Grozny on Tuesday by a
remote-controlled bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gennady Alyokhin, a military spokesman, confirmed that
Russian forces were bracing for rebel attacks, with Grozny,
Gudermes and Urus-Martan as the ''most likely sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Alyokhin and the Kremlin-installed leader of Chechnya,
Akhmad Kadyrov, however, said the militants were unable to stage
large-scale attacks and were mainly trying to whip up tension.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terrorist acts are possible, but no state can be insured
against them,'' said Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, police and security agents were checking suspicious
trucks and abandoned vehicles, fearing car bombs, according to
spokesmen for city police and the FSB domestic security agency.
Other measures in Moscow and elsewhere included roadblocks and
searches of apartment houses' attics and cellars.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Moscow said they were checking every bomb rumor and
evacuating residents if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The current war in Chechnya began after a series of bloody
apartment house bombings in Moscow and other Russian towns last
year, which the Kremlin blamed on Chechen militants. Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov warned Tuesday the attacks could be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to spread any panic or hysteria, I just ask
everyone to be attentive and cautious, since the situation in the
Caucasus makes this necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Russian forces tightened security on the border
between rebel Chechnya and neighboring region of Ingushetia, which
included more searches and dogs sniffing vehicles for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Border checkpoints also closed earlier than usual despite a
growing number of refugees trying to cross into Ingushetia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Some 450 people entered Chechnya from
Ingushetia over the past 24 hours, it said.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian policeman was wounded Monday evening when the driver
of a car he was trying to search opened fire with a pistol. The
driver was killed but a passenger in the car escaped, Russian
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft flew about 90 combat missions over the past 24
hours, the military said Tuesday. They concentrated their fire on
the southern Vedeno and Argun Gorges, where rebels have taken
refuge.

<HEADLINE> French Clinic Closed Temporarily  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French health authorities shut down a clinic
outside Paris on Tuesday after former employees claimed as many as
40 elderly or seriously ill patients were killed with overdoses of
sedatives.

   A state prosecutor ordered the closure of the La Martiniere
clinic for an inquiry into allegations of homicide, euthanasia and
theft, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said police suspect that between 25 and 40 patients were
killed with a powerful cocktail of sedatives administered by clinic
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the state prosecutor, Laurent Davenas, told France
Inter radio that police seized medical files from the clinic after
receiving what he called ''troubling testimonies'' from employees
and former employees.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, the regional hospital association
announced the closure of the clinic, located in Saclay, south of
Paris and said its 120 patients would be transferred to other
health centers in the area.

<HEADLINE> Offices of Russia Media Co. Raided  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police investigators seized documents Tuesday from
Russia's Media-Most holding company, its flagship television
station and its financial partner, the state gas monopoly, as
officials pursued their case against media tycoon and Kremlin
critic Vladimir Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russian head of the world's second-largest nickel
producer disclosed that a prosecutor has suggested he pay millions
of dollars if he wants to keep his company, which was privatized
three years ago. And the tax police announced they've opened a
criminal case against Russia's largest oil company, Lukoil, for
alleged tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Russia's most visible businesses -- and their owners --
are under growing pressure from the state.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has called for leveling the playing
field for Russian businesses, saying even the country's biggest
enterprises shouldn't get favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But he has said little about the current investigations, and the
prosecutor's office has likewise been evasive -- making it hard to
determine who exactly is behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Chaplygin, an analyst with the Center for Civil Society
Studies, called the recent moves ''an attempt to pack all resources
into one briefcase -- financial resources and ... the mass media.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gusinsky case has taken on particular significance since
media outlets owned by Media-Most have been critical of the
Kremlin. Many perceive the case against Gusinsky as a
Kremlin-ordered attempt to stifle media freedoms in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the documents seized at Media-Most on Tuesday
were part of an investigation into whether Gusinsky defrauded the
government of $10 million in a privatization deal.
</P>
<P>
   They said the search at Gazprom, which owns about 30 percent of
Media-Most's NTV television network and holds 17-20 percent more of
the company's stock as collateral for a bad loan, was part of the
same inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation at Media-Most was the second in three months,
and followed Gusinsky's four-day detention last month when he was
charged over the privatization deal.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said that some media outlets are beholden to their
owners and are weapons in political battles, but he flatly denies
that the investigation is directed at changing Media-Most's
editorial line.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Gusinsky case, coupled with pressure on the
businessman whose company has a controlling stake in Norilsk
Nickel, Vladimir Potanin, could indicate that the government is
moving against some of Russia's so-called oligarchs. They are the
small circle of influential businessmen who gained wealth under
former President Boris Yeltsin and were seen as getting favorable
treatment from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim that an original 38 percent stake in Norilsk
was sold to Potanin at a price $140 million short of its actual
value. The Moscow prosecutor's office filed a lawsuit last month
saying that the company should be returned to the state, but it was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In another dispute between a business giant and the government,
the tax police have opened a criminal case against the leadership
of Russia's largest oil company, Lukoil, for alleged tax evasion,
the tax police said Tuesday. Tax evasion is common in Russia,
robbing the state of needed revenues.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Free Nine Hostages in Fiji  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Indigenous Fijian rebels freed nine of their
27 government captives Wednesday, moving this Pacific island nation
closer to the end of a crisis that began almost two months ago when
the rebels stormed Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The release came hours after rebel supporters seized the posh
beach resort where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed -- the first
attack on a foreign-owned facility during the government crisis on
the Pacific island nation. All the guests -- reportedly including
the American owner -- were said to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   The nine freed hostages were turned over to the Red Cross and
then went to their homes, police and a Red Cross doctor said. They
included all the ethnic Indian parliamentarians except for the
deposed prime minister and his son. The other remaining hostages
are all ethnic Fijian legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagat Ram, the Red Cross doctor who saw the nine freed
hostages, said all of them were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked happy to get out of that (Parliament) complex,''
Ram said. ''They conversed very well and they have gone to their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The release came three days after the rebels, led by former
businessman George Speight, signed an agreement with Fiji's
military government to end the hostage crisis. Under the agreement,
Speight was supposed to release all his hostages Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the early release signified.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's spokesman, Jo Nata, said the hostages were released
because ''we felt -- apart from being a gesture of good will -- it is
a consideration of security. If we released them all at once it
could cause a stampede outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''They also had asked us if and when they were released if we
could do it at night to avoid the humiliation of being liberated in
front of our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aull, the wife of freed Parliamentarian Bill Aull, said his
release was ''unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time,'' she said. ''God was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aull said her husband appeared to be unhurt, but he did not
want to talk about his ordeal. ''We still have hostages inside,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began May 19 when rebels led by Speight stormed
Parliament and took several dozen hostages, including then-Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. The rebels are ethnic Fijians who say
the nation's large ethnic Indian minority has too much power. They
demanded that the country's multiracial constitution be scrapped
and that Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, be
deposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the seizure of the hostages, Speight
supporters looted and burned ethnic Indian homes and businesses,
and many Indians made plans to flee the country. The violence led
Fiji's military to take control and declare martial law.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after weeks of negotiations, military leaders and
Speight reached the deal to free the hostages are supposed to be
freed in exchange for the granting of many of Speight's demands,
including a new government and a new constitution curtailing Indian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Speight may end up with a
Cabinet post, perhaps even the prime minister's job. He told a news
conference that such a move would be a perfect end for the coup.
</P>
<P>
   But unrest has persisted despite the deal. Speight supporters
have engaged in widespread civil disturbances across the nation,
occupying police stations and blockading roads in an apparent
effort to wring more concessions from the military regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, self-proclaimed rebel supporters seized the Turtle
Island resort, the site of the 1949 filming of ''The Blue Lagoon''
and parts of the 1980 Brooke Shields remake.
</P>
<P>
   The resort, owned by American Richard Evanson, boasts
hand-crafted seaside cottages and coral-lined beaches at prices of
up to $1,000 a night. Forty tourists were staying there when the
attackers struck, foreign diplomats said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats and newspaper reports said they included 20
children, 19 Australians and Evanson himself. All the guests were
reported to be safe, and the attackers planned to let them leave
Wednesday morning on a cruise ship anchored offshore, the diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsible for the takeover were believed to be from a
tribe in the Yawawa islets off the northwest coast of Fiji's main
island, Viti Levu. They have been involved for years in a dispute
over who owns Turtle Island.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group told reporters they support Speight. But
they could be claiming rebel affiliation to take advantage of the
amnesty being offered for political crimes related to the hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if these people are in support of us or are
taking advantage of the situation,'' Nata said.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians, whose ancestors were brought to the islands by
English colonialists over a century ago to work in the rich sugar
cane fields, make up 44 percent of the nation's 812,000 people.
Many of the indigenous Fijians who comprise 51 percent of the
population resent their economic clout.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's tourist industry has been devastated by the government
crisis, with some of the hundreds of resort hotels scattered across
dozens of islands reporting occupancy rates as low as 10 percent.
However, around 1,000 Americans a week have been among tourists
still coming into Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known if any of the guests on Turtle Island were
American.

<HEADLINE> CBS Finds Path to Youthful Viewers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of fruitless efforts, CBS has found
its Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ''Survivor'' and the strong debut of ''Big Brother,''
the network was the Nielsens ratings winner among the 18-49 age
demographic last week. It was the first time CBS won in that
category since 1994, excluding weeks when the Olympics were
televised.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has long been penalized by the advertising community, which
pays less for commercials on the network because it perceives the
network's audience as old and set in their ways. Inroads with a
younger demographic could be a financial boon for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is CBS' accomplishment came during the week of
July 4th, traditionally the least-watched television week all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' was the most popular show for the third straight
week, reaching a high-water mark of 24.4 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' other reality show, ''Big Brother,'' had 22.4 million
viewers for its debut last Wednesday. But the audience steadily
eroded, sinking to 6.4 million for Saturday's edition. Initial
reports are that ''Big Brother'' rebounded somewhat Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of reruns, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' had
a strong showing with 21.6 million viewers last Thursday, the night
of its fifth million-dollar winner.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, CBS averaged 9.7 million viewers in prime-time
(6.8 rating, 13 share), according to Nielsen Media Research. ABC
was second with 9.1 million viewers (6.2, 12), NBC had 8.1 million
viewers (5.6, 11) and Fox had 6.2 million (4.2, 8).
</P>
<P>
   UPN had 2.8 million viewers (2.0 rating, 4 share), the WB had
2.4 million viewers (1.7, 3) and Pax TV had 1 million viewers (0.8,
2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
8.8 million viewers (6.6 rating, 15 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 7.9 million viewers (6.0, 14), while the ''CBS
Evening News'' had 7.3 million viewers (5.7, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 15.2; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday), ABC, 14.0; ''Big Brother'' (Wednesday), CBS, 13.9;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 12.7; ''48 Hours''
(Wednesday), CBS, 10.5; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.8; ''20/20
Downtown,'' ABC, 9.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, 8.7; Law and Order,'' NBC, 8.5; ''Touched By an Angel,'' CBS,
8.4.

<HEADLINE> Latest tests all negative for mosquito viruses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The latest tests of Connecticut's
mosquitoes and dead birds showed no trace of the West Nile-like
strain of the encephalitis virus, environmental officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquitoes also tested negative for Eastern Equine
Encephalitis, the Department of Environmental Protection reported.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 11, 7,206 mosquitoes were tested from 46
sites statewide. As of July 10, 92 birds tested negative for the
West Nile-like strain of encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito traps placed by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station in 73 locations will be collected on a 10-day rotation.
Trapping began June 1 and will continue through early fall.
</P>
<P>
   This season several crows in Rockland County, Westchester County
and Long Island, N.Y., tested positive for the West Nile-like
strain. Another crow tested positive for the virus in New Jersey.
The virus is transmitted by bird-biting mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has not caused any human illness in Connecticut, but
last year infected 72 people in New York, killing seven.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapping suspect dies in police custody  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) - A man who police say tried
unsuccessfully to kidnap a woman over an unpaid business debt died
of a heart attack while in police custody, authorities said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County Prosecutor William H. Schmidt said Chong Dae Kim,
45, of Palisades Park died Monday at Holy Name Hospital, where he
was taken after complaining of chest pains at police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested earlier in the day along with two other suspects
in connection with the attempted abduction of a woman as she got
into her car at 1:47 p.m. Police said Kim grabbed the woman and
tried to shove her into his vehicle, but she fought off her
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects then fled but were nabbed by police a few minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said all three suspects were arrested and taken to
police headquarters without incident.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:32 p.m., while at police headquarters, Kim complained of
chest pains, and an ambulance was called. He was taken to the
hospital at 3:08 p.m, where he was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy performed Tuesday by the Bergen County Medical
Examiner's Office determined the cause of death to be a heart
attack from natural causes. Schmidt said Kim had a history of
hypertension and an enlarged heart.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspects were identified as Jong Sung Kim, 40, of
Elmhurst, N.Y., the brother of the dead man, and Chong S. Shin, 25,
of Palisades Park. They are charged with attempted kidnapping,
aggravated assault and criminal restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the victim had borrowed $8,000 from John Sung Kim
in June and was required to pay 10 percent weekly interest, Last
week, the woman was only able to pay back $500 instead of $800. The
prosecutor said the attempted abduction appears to be in
retaliation for the shortfall.

<HEADLINE> House To Consider IRA Changes  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Limits on contributions to individual
retirement accounts and 401(k) plans would be raised and more
businesses encouraged to offer pensions under a bill the House is
expected to consider this month.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Reps. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Ben
Cardin, D-Md., is similar to provisions included in last year's
vetoed $792 billion Republican tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But sponsors -- 90 Democrats and 90 Republicans as of Tuesday --
hope its chances of moving through Congress and getting signed into
law by President Clinton will be improved because it is not
encumbered by other, more controversial items.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing this the right way -- a pension reform bill on its
own,'' Cardin said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, scheduled to be considered Thursday by the House Ways
and Means Committee, could reach the House floor as early as next
week. It is intended to beef up tax-free contributions and
deductions to private retirement plans that have not changed in
some cases for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would:
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually raise the current $2,000 annual contribution limit
for traditional and Roth IRAs to $5,000 in 2003. The limit would
thereafter rise each year based on inflation. A catch-up provision
would allow taxpayers age 50 and up to begin contributing the full
$5,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   --By 2005, increase the limit on salary reduction contributions
to 401(k) plans from $10,500 now to $15,000 and index that amount
for inflation. Limits on employer matches would also be increased.
People age 50 and over would get an extra $5,000 limit, or $20,000
total.
</P>
<P>
   --Create a new 401(k) plan similar to the popular Roth IRA, which
differs from a traditional IRA in that withdrawals, not
contributions, are tax free.
</P>
<P>
   --Shorten employer-offered pension vesting from five years to
three years, increase pension portability from job to job and
simplify rules so that more businesses will offer pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Portman said the measure would help address a national
retirement savings problem in which only about half of all
private-sector workers have a pension -- and only 20 percent of
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It addresses a real and growing concern for millions of
Americans who are trying to figure out how best to save for their
retirement needs,'' Portman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, opposition from Democrats has focused on the
measure's lack of government assistance in helping the poor save
for retirement. House Democrats are split on the bill, and the
White House has reacted coolly to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Cardin said he would favor creation of retirement savings
accounts for lower-income people but both main sponsors insisted
that issue should not delay a bill that would help millions of
middle-class working people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't want to jeopardize this foundation,'' Portman said.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Vigilante Killings Common  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   XALVAQUIEJ, Guatemala (AP) -- The crowd of Indians munched on
potato chips and drank Coke from glass bottles while they waited
for the killing to begin.
</P>
<P>
   They smoked cigarettes and watched dozens of dogs mill about as
a cold dusk fell along the roaring mountain stream.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 villagers had come from their muddy, one-room huts of
stone and logs to exterminate eight men rumored to be behind a
number of local kidnappings and robberies. The villagers had the
main road blocked all day so the eight -- five family members who
ran a private transport service with their pickup trucks, and three
employees -- wouldn't get past them, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   When the four Chevy pickups rounded the bend and started over an
ancient stone bridge shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday, the crowd
sprang into action. They pulled all eight men from the trucks,
doused them with gasoline and burned the men one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante killings in Guatemala are nothing unique: In 1998 such
attacks claimed 50 victims, and last year 41 people were killed.
But this weekend's attack was one of the country's worst.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake, two distinct views emerged.
</P>
<P>
   National authorities explain the attack as the brainchild of a
few locals who used a well-planned scheme and the propensity for
mob rule in Guatemala's mostly Mayan Indian rural areas to rid
themselves of rivals. Investigators from Guatemala City surveyed
the scene outside this riverside village 90 miles northwest of the
capital and determined that residents inexplicably attacked a group
of men with ''absolutely no'' criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   But local authorities here say it was little more than evidence
that the community was tired of waiting for the authorities to
collar a group of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw the names of the men that had been killed, I
recognized them,'' said Manuel Sut, mayor of Chichicastenango, a
nearby tourist stop. ''They were from a family that we had gotten
reports was forming a criminal group. It was something we were
investigating with police locally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sut said his office received reports Saturday morning that a
group of men in Chevy pickups tried to kidnap a group of children
that had been walking along a road near where the vigilante attack
was to occur. The men were also suspected in the kidnapping and
rape of a young girl last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a network of neighbors ready to go,'' he said.
''Information on this attempted kidnapping got out and the group
began forming at the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency of the mob's work was still obvious this week in
the normally tranquil woods here.
</P>
<P>
   Clumps of blackened terrain along a sprawling hillside revealed
where each victim died. Footprints showed a desperate scramble, and
signs of victims' belongings were visible in all directions: a pair
of blackened belt buckles. Bits of the pink-striped shirts commonly
worn by Indian men. A melted tennis shoe. The charred remains of an
Atlanta Braves baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Rene Cifuntes, director of Guatemala's national police,
announced that authorities had secured arrest warrants for three
local men thought to be the ringleaders of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the roughly 40 police officers assigned to Chichicastenango
and the 76 surrounding hamlets which about 2,000 Indians call home
said they aren't on the trail of any suspects. And local
investigators said no local judge had issued any arrest warrants in
connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is very slow here and it can be very frustrating,''
Sut said. ''An attack like this is never justified, but there were
reasons that are being overlooked by those in charge of the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Alfonso Portillo conceded Tuesday that the law can be
slow to prosecute kidnappers, and pledged to propose legislation
this week to ''modify laws that have retarded important
prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would propose more police for rural areas, but
warned: ''No state in the world can avoid crime if its citizens
decide to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saying that Guatemala has the capacity to stop all lynchings
is like saying the United States has the capacity to stop all the
shootings in its schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Portillo also said the government will spend $615 million this
year to improve Guatemala's violent image and make the country an
''obligatory destination'' for international travelers. But
regardless of how the case here pans out, it is clear that
Saturday's violence is another blow to Guatemala's already
beleaguered tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of Guatemala failed the people who were in the attack in
letting something like this happen,'' Sut said. ''As a civilized
country, we all need to do a better job.''

   Of the money, $450,000 will go to a study on shark cartilage at
the Mayo Clinic by the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder will go to the Federal Trade Commission, which
charged the companies made unsubstantiated claims about two
products.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also said the companies ''falsely represented that
clinical studies have shown that BeneFin and SkinAnswer are
effective in preventing, treating, and curing cancer, and falsely
represented that the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the
effectiveness of BeneFin.''
</P>
<P>
   Those products, along with MGN-3, a rice-bran extract, are sold
by Lane Labs-USA, of Allendale, Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA in December sued Lane Labs and its president, Andrew J.
Lane, charging that the company illegally promoted and sold the
three products. The lawsuit, which seeks to bar Lane Labs from
selling the three unapproved drugs, is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said Tuesday he settled with the FTC because the cost of
winning the case would have cost too much money. He said he will
continue to fight the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC deal, filed June 28 in U.S. District Court here, covers
Lane Labs and Lane, as well as a Short Hills company, Cartilage
Consultants Inc., and its president, I. William Lane, father of
Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Lane wrote the 1992 book ''Sharks Don't Get Cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim was questioned in April when researchers described 40
tumors that have been found in sharks and their close cousins, the
skates, rays and chimerids. These creatures contain cartilage but
no bone.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Harshbarger, who heads the federally sponsored Registry
of Tumors in Lower Animals, presented the data at a meeting of the
American Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good science that shows us that sharks can get
cancer,'' biologist John Coffey of Johns Hopkins University said at
the time. ''I don't think there is any benefit to buying shark
cartilage and eating it, any more than I think that eating a rabbit
will make me run faster.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, William Lane said cancer is far less common in
sharks than in other ocean creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger also questioned that, noting that the shark cases
reported so far are anecdotal discoveries, and that no survey has
been made to see if sharks are less prone to cancer than other
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Labs currently sells BeneFin, made from shark cartilage,
for $32.36 for 90 caplets, or $125.96 for 16 ounces of powder. It
offers a half-ounce of SkinAnswer, a ''glycoalkaloid cream'' for
$40.50, and 50 ''Veggie Caps'' of MGN-3 for $53.96.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member FTC voted unanimously to approve the settlement,
but Commissioner Orson Swindle issued a partial dissent, asserting
that Lane Labs is getting an unwarranted benefit from the NCI
study.
</P>
<P>
   ''The provision would effectively allow an advertiser that
abused consumers to use the proceeds of its abuse to pay for a
study that it should have paid for itself,'' Swindle said, noting
that Lane Labs did not conduct clinical tests before claiming that
BeneFin prevented, treated, and cured cancer.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Vaccine Supplier Sought  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Tuesday it is looking for a
second supplier of the anthrax vaccine it still hopes to give its
entire military and civilian force.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling supplies have forced the Defense Department to end
inoculations for all troops except those in South Korea and the
Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we were on safer ground than we turned out to be,''
said Maj. Gen. Randy L. West, senior Pentagon adviser on chemical
and biological protection.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that a second source should have been found when the
ambitious mandatory vaccination campaign began in 1998, West said
the sole contractor for the vaccine, Bioport of Lansing, Mich., has
agreed to cooperate with another manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Bioport has been supplying vaccine from its dwindling stockpile
while having trouble getting Food and Drug Administration approval
for production from a new manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the problems we've had and the lessons we've
learned, we feel its worth the investment to stand up a second
source,'' West said. ''Since 1998, the threat has only increased.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon formally has called for proposals for a second
source in a process that could take years, since it requires FDA
approval for the new manufacturer. Bioport's new vaccine is not
expected to be available before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax vaccines are produced in Britain and Russia, but neither
has FDA approval for U.S. use, and Britain's vaccine also is in
limited supply for its nonmandatory program. The Russians use a
live vaccine which likely would not be considered, West said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the slowdown in vaccinations announced Monday by
Defense Secretary William Cohen, the vaccine supply will run out in
six to 10 months, West said.
</P>
<P>
   About 57,000 troops and other military employees have been fully
immunized, with 1.8 million of the more than 15 million shots
needed to fully immunize everyone now in the U.S. military. Each
employee requires six shots and then annual boosters to remain
fully protected against the deadly virus U.S. officials fear could
be used by enemy forces or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish we were vaccinating the whole force now, but we're
running about a year behind in our planned schedule,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Inoculations will be limited to troops who are to be deployed to
or are already in the Middle East and South Korea, where the
Pentagon feels the threat is most serious. About 37,000 troops are
in Korea and 10,000 in nine other countries where the vaccine will
still be given.
</P>
<P>
   Some military members are refusing to take the vaccine -- 351 at
latest count. They fear potentially damaging side effects, although
the Pentagon insists the vaccine is safe. More than 800 personnel
have complained of bad reactions to the shots. Some members of
Congress have urged Cohen to end the program until a safer vaccine
is found.
</P>
<P>
   West said no additional vaccine from the stockpile is being
tested, because it is being held in reserve in case supplies get
critically low.
</P>
<P>
   The 455,000 soldiers and others who have received at least some
of the shots should be able to pick up the series again when more
vaccine becomes available, said Dr. J. Jarrett Clinton, a Pentagon
assistant on health affairs. They will still have immunity from a
few weeks to several months, depending on how many shots they have
had, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had been giving about 75,000 shots a month.
Limiting the doses to soldiers at the highest risk will reduce that
level to 14,000.

<HEADLINE> Residents, Pinelands Commission at odds over sewer link  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBERTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Fe Wise loves to eat dinner
outside on her deck in the summer. There's just one problem: She
often has to endure the odor of overflowing septic tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Wise and many of her neighbors in the 880-house Presidential
Lakes development have tolerated the sludge and the smell for
years. They are anxious for the township to link them to a public
sewer system, but doing so would conflict with the growth
management plan of the Pinelands Commission, which oversees the
1.1-million acre, environmentally sensitive Pine Barrens.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says a public health hazard must be proved before
a sewer link can be built.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21 years that Wise and her family have lived in their
house, the septic tank has overflowed too many times to count, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's terrible. We can't stand it. It's in your yard, and it
smells,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wise lives in a cluster of homes that have been particularly
hard hit. Her next-door neighbor, Donna Kitson, has had her septic
system back up into her house several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''One time it was above my ankles,'' she said. ''We were redoing
two rooms. We had just put new carpet in and were working on the
walls and woodwork. It was all ruined. We never redid the rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pine Barrens encompass about 22 percent of New Jersey. The
Pinelands Commission has designated some sections as growth areas,
but is charged with limiting development in other regions, like the
forest area that includes Presidential Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission instituted its Comprehensive Management Plan in
1981, about 11 years after Presidential Lakes was built.
</P>
<P>
   ''The division itself, for sure, would not have been approved
now,'' Michael Broek, spokesman for the Pinelands Commission, said
Tuesday. ''You can't cram all these things into a forest area.''
</P>
<P>
   The lots in Presidential Lakes are about 10,000 square feet
each. Under the Pinelands Commission's regulations, houses in
forest areas would need a minimum of 3.5 acres each today, Broek
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons for this is to limit the amount of
nitrogen that is released into the ground. Most of what is
discharged from a septic system is nitrogen. The typical Pinelands
environment is ''nitrogen-poor,'' Broek said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's great for the Pinelands flora and fauna. If you start
to raise the nitrogen levels in the ground water, you start to push
out native species and bring in invasive species,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it were determined that a public health threat exists, sewer
extensions could be put into the affected homes only, Broek said.
</P>
<P>
   The township is sampling wells in the development to gauge
whether nitrates discharged by septic systems have contaminated the
well water.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrates are a byproduct of human waste and of some fertilizers.
When ingested by humans or animals, they are converted into
nitrites and can rob the blood of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent of 385 respondents to a Burlington County
survey said their septic system was malfunctioning. The expected
rate of failure is 5 percent, according to the county.
</P>
<P>
   County health workers also have been visually inspecting
randomly selected septic systems and have found that 5 percent
appear to be malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinelands Commission will determine whether there is a
health hazard based on water tests being conducted by the township
and the county. The commission has not received the county's report
on its resident survey, Broek said.
</P>
<P>
   Township and Burlington County officials did not return several
messages Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broek said rather than linking the homes to a public sewer
system, it would be less expensive and less intrusive on the
environment to put in public water.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the problem is contaminated ground water, it would be much
cheaper - and is within the Comprehensive Management Plan - to
bring in a public water line,'' he said. ''A public sewer line
would be extremely expensive, and they have the problem, where are
they going to take it? It would have to be taken to a treatment
plant and would have to go through miles of virgin forest.''
</P>
<P>
   A public water line also would solve the problem, long
complained about by residents, of brown water high in iron.
Residents say the water smells like rotten eggs, damages their
teeth and stains their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those problems would be solved by public water,'' Broek said.
''That's why the provision is in the plan. If people are stuck and
their water is getting fouled, then we do want to do something
about it.''

	   ARCADE, N.Y.(AP) - Police charged a man with second-degree
attempted murder for allegedly running over his ex-wife and one of
her co-workers.
</P>

   Bouakham Onsa, 37, was in serious condition at Erie County
Medical Center Tuesday. Police said she was in the parking lot on
her way to work at Prestolite on Monday when the automobile attack
occurred.
</P>

   Akkhi Phiansouri, 51, after working his shift at Prestolite, ran
over her once, then backed up and hit her again as she attempted to
enter the building, said Arcade Police Chief John Laird.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Law, a co-worker, ran to warn Onsa the car was returning a
third time when they were both hit. The car was stopped by the
stairs of the building and Phiansouri tried to flee on foot, Laird
said, but other workers caught and held him until police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Law, 46, of Freedom, was treated for facial injuries and
released, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Phiansouri is in Wyoming County Jail. No bail has been set.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: Balkans 'fascinating,' but trip was no vacation  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki's trip to the Balkans and
Germany entailed everything from meetings with opponents of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to a chance encounter with
former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoyed it very much on an intellectual level,'' Pataki told
reporters Tuesday. ''It wasn't a particularly relaxing and
enjoyable journey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki said he was delighted to find during a stop in Berlin
on the way home that former Russian President Gorbachev was staying
in the next room at his hotel. Gorbachev invited Pataki, state
Economic Development chief Charles Gargano and Pataki adviser Zenia
Mucha into his room for a late-night discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent over an hour talking about politics, history, the
future, his view of the Balkans, his view of America, his view of
Russia,'' Pataki said. ''It was absolutely fascinating to have that
chance to talk to one of the figures who, when the 20th century is
looked back on with some distance, will really have played a
historic role.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the discussion with Gorbachev, who presided over the
breakup of the former Soviet Union, was especially meaningful
coming in a city once split by that symbol of communist repression,
the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Language was only a slight barrier. Mucha, a Polish immigrant,
translated Pataki's comments into Ukrainian for Gorbachev.
Gorbachev spoke Russian, which his German translator converted into
English, Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was among about 20 North American and European scholars,
politicians and diplomats who spent four days starting June 25 in
the Balkans on a fact-finding trip arranged by the American
Enterprise Institute's New Atlantic Initiative. It is a group
designed to foster better American-European relations.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the three primary stops of the delegation - Kosovo,
Bosnia and Montenegro - were all troubling in their own way.
</P>
<P>
   He said the depth of ethnic hatred in Kosovo between Serbs and
Kosovars was of a ''magnitude that I've never seen before.'' Troops
must be kept in place to simply prevent one faction from killing
the other, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia remains under the thumb of Milosevic while Montenegro is
''one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen,'' but is
regarded as too dangerous to attract tourists, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group talked to opposition leaders as well as
ruling government officials in each country, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activist Bianca Jagger, ex-wife of Rolling Stone
singer Mick Jagger, was among those on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very serious and she was very hardworking and very
well-prepared,'' Pataki said. ''It was clear that she was serious
about her human rights activities. This isn't just something to
keep one's name in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he gave Texas Gov. George W. Bush some of his
impressions of the trip and expected to provide more details to the
Republican presidential candidate's policy team.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Pataki said he talked up New York business
opportunities before the German Chamber of Commerce. Discussions
are underway to try to lure one German company interested in
opening a North American headquarters to New York, according to the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki refused to identify the company, lest it sour on New York
or the state tip its hand to competitors in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly don't want New Jersey or Pennsylvania to know what
companies are looking to establishing a North American
headquarters,'' Pataki said. ''Let them go to Berlin and find
out.''

<HEADLINE> Police hunt for assailant of men in Brooklyn park  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Police are searching for a man wearing ''ninja''
type clothing who has sneaked up on four men in the past two weeks
in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, slashed three of them and clubbed one
in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks occurred in an area of the park known as the ''Vale
of Cashmere,'' frequented by gay men, which is why the NYPD's Hate
Crime Task Force is leading the investigation, Deputy Inspector
Barbara Sicilia said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is probably the perception of the perpetrator that the
victims are all gay,'' said Sicilia, the task force's commander.
She declined to comment on the victims' sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the victims got a good look at their attacker because he
strikes after midnight and was dressed all in black, and his face
was masked in black, Sicilia said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the people have described it as like a ninja, all in
black, and with a mask,'' she said. ''And he has those kind of
moves - in one case - they see him slashing, with his hands, using
hand motions, as if he were cutting through the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the suspect knows the park well, including the
heavily wooded area where the attacks have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Sicilia added that the suspect is very quiet when he approaches
his victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perp comfortably walks up and you don't know anything is
going to happen and then all of a sudden - boom - you're getting
slashed or you're getting hit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first incident occurred shortly after midnight on June 28th.
A 33-year-old man was approached by a man who said ''I'm going to
kill you.'' The attacker then clubbed the victim in the leg with a
broom handle, Sicilia said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, shortly after 1 a.m., two men were walking together
when a third man approached. The two friends ran but one of them, a
47-year-old, was caught and slashed in the face, wrist, knee, ankle
and back with some type of cutting instrument, Sicilia said.
</P>
<P>
   The last two incidents both occurred on July 7th, within 30
minutes of each other. A 36-year-old man said he was walking on
Flatbush Avenue just outside the park around 2 a.m. when he was
approached and slashed on his face and nose.
</P>
<P>
   That victim called police and the next attack occurred despite a
police helicopter flying overhead, shining a light into the park.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old man reported being slashed in the head, neck,
hands and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (the suspect) has the audacity to attack the second guy''
while the helicopter is overhead, Sicilia said.
</P>
<P>
   Sicilia asked anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at
800-577-TIPS. The city has offered a $10,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy is so dangerous, we want to get him,'' Sicilia said.

<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) - About a dozen people gathered outside a
Wal-Mart store Tuesday to protest the retailer's decision not to
sell the morning-after pill at its pharmacy counters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters from Zero Population Growth and Planned
Parenthood accused Wal-Mart of succumbing to pressure by abortion
foes opposed to the drug which can be used after unprotected sex to
stop a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo-area protest was the eighth in a series of
demonstrations Zero Population Growth has been staging around the
country. Another protest was planned for Wednesday in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think they've made a political decision,'' said ZPG
president Peter Kostmayer said.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said the decision ''has absolutely
nothing to do with morals.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was based on several business factors,'' Jessica Moser said
from the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters, ''one being
customer demand for the product.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already carry a broad assortment of birth control products
and as in any category of products we carry we want to have the
products on the shelf that we're seeing customer demand for,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters carried a sign with the message ''Wal-Mart is rolling
back Buffalo women's rights.''

<HEADLINE> 31 horses dead in barn fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH SALEM, N.Y. (AP) - Fire raced through a barn at a horse
farm in northern Westchester, killing 31 horses, many of them
mounts for children learning to ride.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze at Breakaway Farms on Route 121 in North Salem broke
out at about 5:15 a.m. Monday, and the wooden structure was
engulfed by the time firefighters arrived, said Chief Neil Caputo
of the Croton Falls Fire Department, which serves North Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a horrible thing to see,'' he said Tuesday. ''There was
no way to get the horses out when we got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Westchester County's Fire Control department
had not settled on what caused the fire, but a report was expected
within a couple of days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the horses belonged to Sonia Toker and Martha
Gilchrist, who leased the barn from Oak Brook Farm to run a riding,
boarding and training concern. Fifteen were privately owned and
boarded at Breakaway, many by children learning to ride.
</P>
<P>
   The barn was reduced to an ashen outline and a few blackened
posts. The dead horses were quickly buried by barn workers and
firefighters using the heavy equipment that had been brought in to
extinguish any hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Ward, co-owner of Oak Brook, said she was asleep just
25 yards from the barn, unaware of the fire until her dogs started
barking at arriving fire trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just an incredible tragedy,'' she said. ''There's no
way to make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward is the ex-wife of Barney Ward, a horse trainer who was
sentenced to prison in 1996 after admitting he arranged the deaths
of horses in Illinois for insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Laura Schwartz, said she saw ''a wall of flame''
shooting up from the barn when she awoke.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Grayson, whose daughter had a horse at the barn, said
of the animal, ''He was her life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For her, it's like losing a child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Debbie Kilcullen, said Breakaway Farms was
''kid-oriented,'' with horse shows and a summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a fire at a Brooklyn stable killed 21 horses.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Pressed on what he would tell George W. Bush
if asked to become his vice presidential running mate, New York
Gov. George Pataki continued to duck the question on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love my job, I really do, and there are a lot of good people
out there, a lot of names Governor Bush is looking at who would be
just terrific,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that meant he would decline such an offer from the
Texas governor and presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
Pataki wouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say what I may or may not talk to Governor
Bush about, if I may or may not have discussions with Governor
Bush,'' the New York governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about whether he would accept a cabinet post in a Bush
administration, Pataki repeated his earlier comment. ''I love my
job. I love being governor of New York. It's a great job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the governor's thinking, who spoke only
on condition of anonymity, said later Tuesday that Pataki was not
taking himself out of the running for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term governor of New York, who was a year ahead of Bush
at Yale University in their undergraduate years, has been careful
not to reveal anything about his possible discussions with the Bush
camp over the vice presidency. Pataki has refused to even confirm
that he filled out a vice presidential questionnaire sent out by
Bush's search team.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican officials say Pataki, along with fellow GOP
governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Frank Keating of Oklahoma,
are among those under serious consideration by Bush as possible
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's deliberations, Keating has the advantage of being
anti-abortion and would thus not rile religious right voters as
Pataki and Ridge, both abortion rights supporters, might.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki and Ridge both come from large electoral vote states,
an attraction for any presidential candidate. Ridge is a decorated
Vietnam War veteran and is considered more likely than Pataki to
deliver his state to Bush in November. Pataki has a record as the
nation's top tax-cutting governor, is well-liked by
environmentalists and drove liberal icon Mario Cuomo from the New
York governorship in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Prison guard union members reject contract with state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The union representing more than 24,000
state prison guards Tuesday rejected a proposed four-year contract
with the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police
Benevolent Association (NYSCOPBA) voted down the contract, 10,960
to 9,746. Guards have been working without a contract since April
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In May, union officials and the state had tentatively agreed on
a contract to provide a 3 percent salary increase retroactive to
October 1999, 3 percent increase effective April 2000 and 3.5
percent raises in both April 2001 and April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed,'' said Mary Hines, spokeswoman for
Pataki's Office of Employee Relations. ''We believe that it was a
fair and equitable contract.''
</P>
<P>
   NYSCOPBA officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Contract ratification would have also meant a $500 lump sum
payment for the guards. The downstate salary adjustment would have
gone from $823 to $1,000 in April 2000, $1,100 in April 2001 and
$1,200 in April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the rejected deal was the establishment of a pilot
program encouraging more time on the job. Guards with six or fewer
days of sick leave used during fiscal year 2001-02 and 2002-03
would have been eligible for bonus payments.
</P>
<P>
   Hines said several options are now available, including
returning to negotiations or renewing mediation. It is also
possible that an impasse be declared and both sides move to the
fact-finding process, in which a mediator holds a hearing and then
makes a recommendation for a settlement, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to speak with the union and find out what the issues
are and at that point formulate a strategy,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   The guards' last contract was negotiated by a different union,
Council 82 of AFSCME, which was usurped by NYSCOPBA in 1999 as the
guards' bargaining agent. NYSCOPBA itself now finds itself in a
tussle with a group of insurgents which wants to oust the new
union.
</P>
<P>
   NYSCOPBA is one of the last unions with which the state is still
seeking to reach a new contract.

<HEADLINE> Two Scouts Die in France Bus Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLEANS, France (AP) -- A Belgian bus packed with Boy and Girl
Scouts crashed early Tuesday, killing two children, seriously
injuring five others and leaving another 36 with minor injuries,
French police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus, carrying 64 people including two drivers, overturned
about 7 a.m. on the A71 highway at La Ferte-Saint-Aubin about 100
miles south of Paris, according to highway police. The bus was
heading through the chateau region of central France toward Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The accident involved the bus and two cars, according to highway
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The initial cause of the accident appeared to be the driver, who
allegedly dozed off at the wheel, the highway patrol said. The
driver, who was not injured, is being held for questioning as part
of a police inquiry into the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's RTBF television reported that tests showed no signs of
alcohol in the driver's blood.
</P>
<P>
   The bus belonged to the Leroy-Wavilles company based in
Havinnes, Belgium. Francine Leroy, the president of the company,
told The Associated Press the bus was carrying children who were
returning to Jurbise, Belgium after a stay at a summer camp in
Larrode.
</P>
<P>
   In Jurbise, the town hall was transformed into a crisis center
where tearful parents sought news of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very shocked. This has never happened to us,'' Jean Luc
Lienart, the commercial director of the company, said on Belgium's
RTBF television.
</P>
<P>
   The scouts were members of the Belgian National Federation of
Youth Clubs, French police said. The two children killed were aged
13 and 14. Their parents were being taken to Orleans by Belgian
Foreign Ministry officials.

<HEADLINE> EPA Regulations on Mercury Backed  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel of the National Academy of Sciences on
Tuesday endorsed a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency
to adopt more stringent levels of protection from mercury, saying
the agency had used ''scientifically justifiable'' studies in its
action.
</P>
<P>
   The academy study claims that while most people are not at high
risk of health problems from low-dose mercury exposure, children of
women who consume large amounts of fish and seafood during their
pregnancy may be ''at special risks'' of having neurological
problems, including learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were expected to ease the way for the EPA to
develop new regulations requiring a reduction of mercury emissions
from coal-burning power plants, which spew 40 tons of mercury into
the air annually, much of which ends up in the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's proposed mercury rule has been held up for nearly two
years because Congress barred the agency from proceeding until the
Academy's study was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member panel in its report concludes that methyl-mercury
''is widespread and persistent in the environment'' and that the
guidelines used by the EPA to establish maximum exposure levels are
''scientifically justifiable ... for the protection of public
health.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has asked the utility industry to provide more
information about mercury releases out of power plant smokestacks
and is considering regulations that would require the industry to
curtail such emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy's findings are ''very, very helpful'' in
establishing that the agency's mercury decisions are based on sound
science, said EPA spokesman David Cohen. He said the agency is
required under the Clean Air Act to determine whether new emissions
controls are needed to deal with mercury contamination.
</P>
<P>
   While much remains to be learned about low-dose mercury
contamination and human health, the study says there is strong
evidence to link mercury to neurological, immune system and heart
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''More must be done to gain a better understanding of various
risk factors for the U.S. population'' from mercury exposure, said
Robert A. Goyer, chairman of the 10-member review panel. He said
while the EPA guidelines are ''adequate,'' more needs to be learned
about regional differences, and effects on population groups whose
diets are high in fish and seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to better understand how this chemical affects brain
development in fetuses and children,'' Goyer said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Farm Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $75.3 billion spending
bill for farm programs and food regulation after farm-state
lawmakers defeated attempts Tuesday to end subsidies that benefit
cattle and sheep ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was approved 339-82, faces a veto threat
because of disputes with the Clinton administration over the level
of funding and some food safety and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had requested $76.8 billion in spending for
the Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration for
the 2001 budget, which begins Oct. 1. This year's budget, including
$8.7 billion in farm disaster assistance, was $84.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House funding ''is woefully inadequate'' and ''does not meet
the needs'' of agriculture, said Wisconsin Rep. David Obey, senior
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ''This bill has a
long way to go before it is going to receive a presidential
signature.''
</P>
<P>
   Not included in the House bill was $7.1 billion in special farm
assistance that Congress approved this spring to compensate growers
for depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Before finishing work on the bill, the House defeated an effort
to end federal subsidies for killing coyotes, mountain lions and
other livestock predators and voted to preserve subsidies for wool
and mohair producers that were included in this spring's farm aid.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would bar the FDA from discouraging Americans from
buying prescription drugs in Canada and other foreign countries.
Technically, it's illegal to import prescription drugs that were
originally made in the United States, and the Food and Drug
Administration sometimes sends warning letters to people caught
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers did drop from the bill a provision that would allow
for food and medicine sales to Cuba, but House Republican leaders
have agreed to try to put a more restricted version in the final
version of the legislation later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 228-190 to continue the predator-control
program, despite arguments by critics that it amounts to corporate
welfare for wealthy ranchers in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why send a federal employee to take care of their interests?''
Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., asked in a debate that reflected the
House's urban-rural split.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department spends about $10 million a year
killing about 100,000 animals, mostly costly coyotes, but also
foxes, wolves and mountain lions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe if we released some of these wolves in Portland,
Minneapolis, Boston or New York City we would have a different
attitude by members in this House,'' said Rep. Collin Peterson,
D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bill's provisions that the Clinton administration
doesn't like would weaken egg testing regulations proposed by FDA.
The House left the measure in the bill but egg producers are
negotiating with the agency to alter its proposed testing
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   FDA has proposed to require that producers test for salmonella
enteritidis all around their farm, not just on the hens or eggs,
and to require that all of a farm's eggs be pasteurized or diverted
from market if the bacteria is found.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public would have been put at risk'' by the
industry-sponsored provision in the bill weakening the agency's
proposal, said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The provision is to be stripped from the bill once the industry
and FDA reach a compromise. The compromise would still require the
testing but would not require that eggs be diverted from market
unless bacteria was actually found on one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all working together here to provide a safe,
higher-quality product,'' said Ken Klippen, a spokesman for the
United Egg Producers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan, which also would require a warning
label for egg cartons, is supposed to reduce salmonella cases by
half in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is to take up its version of the appropriations bill
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4461.

<HEADLINE> A defiant Whitman refuses to apologize for frisk photo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - A defiant Gov. Christie Whitman refused
to apologize for searching an unarmed black man and issued a
warning to activists who plan to use a photograph of that pat-down
against her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apologies are too easy,'' Whitman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at Ellis Island, Whitman vowed to stand by her reforms
of the State Police and her efforts to improve Camden, New Jersey's
poorest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not be bullied away from that. I will not be scared
away from that commitment,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also denied charges that state troopers were promised a
bounty of a one week vacation if they snapped a picture of the
governor with a black suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly wasn't knowingly a participant in anything like
that and that certainly is an insult to imply that I was,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman repeatedly told reporters the search and the
four-year-old photograph have nothing to with racial profiling, the
practice where police target suspects based solely on race. Whitman
and her administration have been dogged by accusations that they
were insensitive to accusations by minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''In and of itself, that picture proves nothing,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That picture doesn't say anything about racial profiling,''
she said. ''I saw how you can do good police work and not engage in
racial profiling. They targeted criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Whitman said
she was not sure if there is anything wrong with searching a man
who was never charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said she did not know if she had the legal
authority to search someone. ''It never occurred to me to ask that
question,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has said she did not think twice about searching the man
and was attempting to fully experience police work. At the time the
governor had been accompanying state troopers on night tours of
Camden, just months after the city logged a record number of
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Now Whitman makes only one concession: She would put some
thought into a search of an unarmed, unnamed resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a very legitimate thing to say, 'You should have
thought twice,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph obtained by the AP shows Whitman standing behind a
black man, his arms spread, palms pressed up against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is wearing jeans, a sweatshirt, a baseball cap and
black gloves and appears to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what happened in that moment before'' the
picture was snapped, Whitman said. She said the photograph might
have captured either a smile or a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said those who say the picture proves she encouraged
racial profiling are taking the image out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Now the governor admits the photograph can hurt both her image
and her work to revitalize Camden's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question about it. Damage can be done,'' she said.
''I can't prevent people from taking this picture and inflaming
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose protest over racial profiling shut
down the Atlantic City Expressway last year, said he will meet
Thursday with members of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey
to plan a new round of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, D.C., Sharpton said he plans
a national rally Aug. 26 to protest racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman photograph will be featured at that demonstration
and others, Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the picture of Gov. Whitman will be one we will show
the nation on how insensitive and in many ways how many governors
and other public officials are in denial about how they have not
only condoned, but in fact have tried to cover up the fact that
racial profiling has been a state-sanctioned strategy of law
enforcement,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said the picture could affect the political future of
Whitman, who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential
candidate with George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''A picture's worth a thousand words. It might be worth a vice
presidential nomination,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly Mr. Bush needs to read his own speech yesterday to the
NAACP, and look at this photograph, and then he would have to
decide whether he could sell compassionate conservatism, reaching
out to blacks, and this photograph in the same speech. If he thinks
he can, I have a bridge in Brooklyn that he can sell.''

<HEADLINE> Police arrest man in park robbery spree, but another robbery pattern emerges </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A day after police apprehended a man suspected
of robbing five women at gunpoint in Central Park, they began
investigating another string of robberies there by a group of young
men, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, two people were robbed within five minutes by a
group of four to five men near the park's famous Wollman Rink.
Robberies are up slightly this year in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:50 p.m., a 47-year-old man riding his bicycle southbound
through the park near 63rd Street and Center Drive was knocked to
the ground by the men, police said. The suspects took $86 in cash,
a knife and sunglasses before fleeing. The victim, who suffered
bruises to his left arm, flagged down a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a 30-year-old man told police he was
walking through the park near Wollman Rink when he was approached
by a group of men who knocked him to the ground, then took his
pager and $10.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's robberies occurred a day after police arrested Reinaldo
Joseph, 38, of Brooklyn, for allegedly robbing five women at
gunpoint in the park since April. Police arrested him after a
person playing checkers in the park saw a police sketch of the
robbery suspect and pointed Joseph out to officers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A mounted police officer and a scooter cop grabbed Joseph, who
was carrying a fake gun in his backpack, police said. The
authentic-looking pistol matched the description of the weapon used
in the robberies, said Assistant Chief William Taylor, head of
Manhattan detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five victims have picked Joseph out of a lineup,
Taylor said. The others were tourists who have since returned home.
Three of the attacks occurred on the park's West Drive, between
77th and 81st streets; one occurred near the Sheep Meadow; and one
on the park's East Drive, near 74th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The robberies occurred on April 6, April 28, May 11, June 22 and
July 7. All took place on either a Thursday or a Friday; most
occurred in the late afternoon or evening, but the last one
happened at 10:45 a.m. The victims were between 22 and 25 years old
and were alone.
</P>
<P>
   The latest police statistics show that through Sunday, there
have been 36 robberies in the park this year, compared with 27 the
same period last year.

<HEADLINE> SEC Workers Rally Before Union Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employees sang a labor-organizing song in an
auditorium at the Securities and Exchange Commission two days
before a vote by agency workers on whether to join a union.
</P>
<P>
   The vote scheduled for Thursday has been opposed for months by
SEC officials, who wanted employees at the Washington headquarters
to be represented by a separate bargaining unit from those in the
agency's regional offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute delayed a vote first scheduled for last September by
SEC employees on joining the National Treasury Employees Union,
which represents about 155,000 workers in 26 federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Labor Relations Authority ruled against the SEC in
January. The SEC appealed the ruling; its appeal was rejected this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, after all this talking about it, everyone's going to
get a chance to vote,'' Jeff Friday, national counsel for the NTEU,
told the few hundred employees gathered in the auditorium on their
lunch hour Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Workers listened and applauded as they balanced pizza provided
by the union on paper plates.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they joined in choruses of ''Union Members, Stand
Together,'' a song with new lyrics to the tune of an old-time labor
classic, ''Miner's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gulack and David Frye, who wrote the lyrics, led the
singing and played the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secretaries, paralegals and accountants join our cause! We
will bargain all together, just as we enforce the laws,'' went one
verse.
</P>
<P>
   The union needs to get a simple majority of votes cast to become
the SEC employees' official representative with management. NTEU
officials said they were confident, although there appears to be
far less support for the union among the SEC's 1,200 or so
professional employees, mainly attorneys and accountants, than by
the 650 other employees who are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness of the fight with the SEC was evident as Friday
cited employees' grievances. Chief among them: a series of
''informational meetings'' on the union issue organized by SEC
management for employees.
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials have defended the meetings as being legal and a
useful way to provide information to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think they've been very fruitful,'' SEC spokesman Chris
Ullman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also complained about the SEC using public money
to retain a law firm they said was actively anti-union.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman said the agency ''felt it was in the best interest of
employees to have labor lawyers guiding us through this process,''
since attorneys at the SEC -- which regulates the nation's
securities markets and mutual funds -- don't have expertise in labor
law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every intention of abiding by the results of the
election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees also have complained that they are expected to work
uncompensated extra hours, known as ''donated'' time, and that
bonus money is seldom given to career employees.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks, NTEU President Colleen Kelley said the
election will give SEC employees a chance ''to be part of a driving
force of change.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTEU represents employees at the Internal Revenue Service,
the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Food and Drug Administration, among others.

<HEADLINE> In 'Dancing Demons,' wonderfully scary Mongolian masks make U.S. debut </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Bulging eyeballs and skull tiaras. Wagging red
tongues and big floppy ears. Flashing mirrors and ringing bells.
Faces in lumpy red or greenish gold. Sometimes it takes a little
extra to chase away demons and conjure better luck. And some times
it takes a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional Mongolia, which boasts a no-holds-barred approach
to the matter, the latter seems to be the case. The exhibit
''Dancing Demons: Ceremonial Masks of Mongolia'' displays the
fabulous - and rare - dance masks in all their splendor at the Asia
Society starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buried or hidden in trunks during the decades when they were
banned in a Mongolia under Communist rule, the startling masks and
costumes are finally seeing the light in the nation of nomads and
tundra between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The annual ''Tsam'' dances, in which a series of dancers dressed
as demon deities or in fantastic animal heads to exorcise evil
spirits, were held last year in Mongolia for the first time since
about 1937, said Jan Fontein, curator of the show. Old photographs,
paintings and the fading memories of those who participated decades
ago are helping Mongolians revive the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The masks and other artifacts are being displayed for the first
time in the United States, said Fontein, a noted Asian art scholar
and former director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very wrathful figures, very bloodthirsty,
blood-drinking demons,'' said Fontein, describing the deities which
came to Mongolia with the introduction of Tibetan Buddhism in the
17th century. Buddhism was combined with shamanism, the traditional
belief system of the Mongolian nomads.
</P>
<P>
   The over 60 artifacts, most from the 18th and 19th centuries,
represent about a third of the objects featured in a recent major
exhibit at the Nieuwe Kerk Museum in Amsterdam. They will be on
view at the Park Avenue gallery through Sept. 17, after which they
return to Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the very rare objects featured is perhaps the finest of
only three known Mongolian ancestral figures in existence. The 19th
century figure of a bearded man carved of birchwood with a horse
hair beard was used by Mongolian shamans, or witchdoctors, to ward
away evil. The figure's face is still greasy from years of being
smeared with fat as part of traditional rituals.
</P>
<P>
   There are also drums and costumes used by Mongolian shamans
featuring mirrors, bells, and eagle and owl feathers.
</P>
<P>
   But the most breathtaking pieces are the bright papier-mache
masks, which are displayed in the order in which the figures appear
in the Tsam dances. Most are accompanied by photos from the 1930s
showing them being used in the dances.
</P>
<P>
   Two frightening human skull masks, each with a tiara of five
smaller skulls, dance solemnly to start the massive exorcism
ritual. They are among the very few still in existence, Fontein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, one of the most striking masks appears. With the
cartoonish face of an old Mongolian man, the character known as the
White Old Man has a wrinkled face and a bushy white beard made of
horse hair and cotton. He represents the shamanistic gods of
Mongolia which were absorbed into the Buddhist pantheon. Armed with
a staff featuring a dragon-shaped handle, he performed the role of
the buffoon in the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Later there's a mask with three bulging eyeballs, a lumpy red
face made of coral and a five-skull tiara. Another has the
green-gold face of another horrible deity, also with three big
bulging eyes and a skull-tiara.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a relatively harmless-looking deer mask with a
leopard-spot face and a wagging tongue made of red silk filled with
millet grains. But the deer, known as Shava, is supposed to be one
of the henchmen of Yama, the Supreme Judge of Hell.
</P>
<P>
   Yama finally shows his wonderfully scary face as the dramatic
finale of the Tsam - and of the exhibit. He has an azure bull's
head with blood red lips, bulging eyes and green-blue horns
decorated with swirling gold clouds or dragons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bull is the grand finale, and then the evil is finally
exorcised,'' Fontein said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Old Economy stocks came out on top Tuesday as
two stalwarts of traditional businesses -- paper and aluminum -- led
the market higher, with a little help from an upbeat speech from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Tech stocks continued a
modest decline.
</P>
<P>
   With the second-quarter earnings season just getting under way,
strong showings from International Paper on Tuesday and Alcoa the
day before helped bring old-fashioned brick and mortar companies
back into fashion with investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, of which Alcoa and IP are both
components, rose 80.61 to 10,727.19. Financial, energy and basic
materials shares also rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another day of triumph of the Old Economy over the New
Economy, prompted by International Paper's better-than-expected
earnings announcement,'' said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist
at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 23.87 to 3,956.42 as tech stocks
pulled back from a rally earlier in the day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rose 5.26 to 1,480.88.
</P>
<P>
   The strong earnings reports from IP and Alcoa helped lift other
makers of basic materials, including chemical producer DuPont, up
$2.375 at $47.313; Exxon Mobil, up $2.50 at $80.625; and oil
equipment maker Schlumberger, up $6.078 at $74.953.
</P>
<P>
   IP rose $3.312 to $35.25 after reporting its second-quarter
earnings per share beat analyst estimates by 1 cent. And Alcoa rose
$2.437 to $32.125 after it came out with better-than-expected
earnings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, meanwhile, told the National Governors' Association
that the explosion in the use of computers and other high-tech
devices has boosted America's productivity, the amount of output
for each hour of work. Increased productivity has been a primary
contributor to the nation's long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded well to Greenspan's remarks, taking them as
a hint that the Fed might not raise rates at its next meeting in
August. Analysts have been split over whether the Fed has finished
raising rates for now, following its six increases over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   But with more indications that the economy has been cooling,
investors have been growing more optimistic that the Fed will
determine that rates are currently high enough to contain
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a market conviction that the Fed may be taking its foot
off the brakes,'' said Tom Galvin, chief equity straegist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. ''The lack of any strong
talk out of Greenspan added further conviction that the days of
credit tightening are limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of financial companies, which are among the first to
benefit from steady interest rates, rose following Greenspan's
remarks. Chase Manhattan rose 93.8 cents to $50.688, and home
mortgage reseller Fannie Mae rose $1.313 to $58.688.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech stocks that fell on Monday tried to rally early in
Tuesday's session, but then faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! shares slumped $4.50 to $105.50. The Internet bellwether
released strong earnings after the market closed, beating analyst
expectations by 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies followed Yahoo! lower, including
America Online, down 75 cents at $55, and Amazon.com, down $1.938
at $33.125.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues edged ahead of declining issues by a 5-to-4
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came
to 1.18 billion shares, up slightly from the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.09 to 529.74.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.4 percent.
Germany's DAX index was fell 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.04 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Rally, Protest, Fast  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Just as the Camp David summit got under way
Tuesday, so did the campaign back home for the hearts and minds of
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews, secular Israeli families, West Bank settlers,
Palestinian refugees and army generals were among those attending
rallies, staging hunger strikes or finding other ways to voice
their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak weighed in from afar. Israelis awoke
to a front-page letter from the embattled leader in the top-selling
Yediot Ahronot newspaper, appealing to their imaginations with a
vision of an Israel no longer in conflict with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   After the embarrassing political debacle he suffered just before
his departure, Barak would have been heartened to see the evening
rush-hour in downtown Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was diverted and streets were blocked off near the prime
minister's residence for a festive rally supporting Barak and his
peace initiatives. A crowd of several thousand listened to peace
songs and plastered themselves with stickers saying: ''The Majority
Has Chosen Peace -- Me Too!''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Morin, a 70-year-old retired professor, said the last
time he'd attended a rally was the huge gathering at which the late
Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''But these are special times,'' said Morin, who leaned on a
walking stick and sported a specially made T-shirt that said
''Shalom (Peace) -- Just Do It.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I truly believe that 60 percent of Israelis are for peace at
Camp David. But in the streets, all you hear is the voice of the
right,'' he said, echoing the fears of Barak himself.
</P>
<P>
   David Breski, a 23-year-old student, agreed. ''What you saw in
the government the past two days does not represent what people
think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak left Israel Monday after enduring a humiliating
no-confidence vote in parliament that he barely survived. A day
earlier, he was deserted by three right-wing coalition parties
fearing concessions he'd make to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The right wing also made its voice heard Tuesday. Thousands of
Orthodox Jews gathered at Judaism's holiest site, the Western Wall,
to pray and to hand out leaflets saying: ''Barak is losing the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those bitterly opposing the Camp David summit are settlers
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who fear they'll be forced to
leave their homes in what they regard as the biblical land of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Nurit Ben Porath, from the Kedumim settlement in the central
West Bank, attended the protest with her five small children. ''We
want God to save us from Barak,'' she said. ''He wants to give us
to the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 settlers also gathered at noontime at a park near
Barak's office and began a hunger strike, which they said would
last through the summit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balata refugee camp near Nablus, dozens of Palestinian
youngsters were joined by armed men with masked faces as they
marched on behalf of refugee rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to say to the Palestinian delegation, don't forget the
refugees' rights,'' said Hussam Khader, one of the organizers.
''Anybody who will harm our rights, he deserves a bullet in his
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating in their own way were 28 retired Israeli army
generals, who wrote in a paid advertisement: ''Go in peace, Ehud
Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own letter, Barak envisioned an Israel with no
Palestinian conflict to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be able to focus on the things that are more important
than anything,'' he wrote. ''A better education for our children,
renewed growth in the economy, investment in infrastructure and the
creation of jobs, the allocation of our resources to health,
welfare, the closing of the social gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   As tantalizing as that sounded to many, the irony was surely not
lost. Those are precisely the issues that critics have accused
Barak of neglecting in the year since he took office, all in the
name of pursuing peace.

<HEADLINE> National Guard Copter Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- An Army National Guard helicopter crashed near
Gila Bend, killing both soldiers aboard, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The AH-64 Apache helicopter crashed on the Barry M. Goldwater
Range about 8 p.m. Monday during night exercises, said Capt. Eileen
Bienz of the Arizona Army National Guard,
</P>
<P>
   First Lt. Steven J. Jordon, 35, of Phoenix and Chief Warrant
Officer Gregory Clevenger, 45, of Tucson, both died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A qualified board of officers from Fort Rucker, Ala., a major
Army helicopter training base, has been appointed to investigate
the cause of the crash, Bienz said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter had been based out of the Army National Guard
facility in Marana.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 50 other severe crashes of Apaches
since the helicopter was delivered to the Army in 1985, and 14
fatalities, including two deaths in Albania during a NATO training
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The $14.5 million Apache was designed and built by McDonnell
Douglas at its plant in Mesa. It carries a mix of three weapons
systems: aerial rockets, a cannon that fires high-explosive
ammunition, and Hellfire missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt-nosed, flat-bellied Apache AH-64A is the Army's
primary attack helicopter. It is equipped with night sights and
other sensors that permit its two-person crew to navigate and
attack in darkness and in poor weather.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs 1st Robot for Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robots in the operating room are not
science-fiction anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Tuesday approved the nation's first robotic
surgical device, one intended to help doctors better perform
minimally invasive surgery by moving its three arms.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, given the name ''Da Vinci'' in a historical bow, is
the first of its kind to enter U.S. hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the Da Vinci Surgical
System to help doctors perform surgery more easily through tiny
cuts in the abdomen -- known as ''laparoscopic'' surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a first-generation use. The robot already is being
tested on trickier surgeries, including heart bypasses and heart
valve replacements performed through three incisions each about the
diameter of a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   FDA experts say the robot's ability to perform precise movements
in tiny spaces -- without trembling like a tired surgeon might --
could one day allow better microsurgery, such as for nerve-related
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This system is the first step in the development of new
robotic technology that eventually could change the practice of
surgery,'' FDA Commissioner Jane Henney said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of future uses, the Da Vinci robot is a ''powerful''
tool because it can give surgeons more control during today's
minimally invasive operations, said Dr. Barry Gardiner of the San
Ramon, Calif., Regional Medical Center, who led clinical trials of
the robot.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you sit down and operate with this system, it almost
feels like you've climbed inside the space you're operating in,''
Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Da Vinci, a $1 million device manufactured by Intuitive Surgical
Inc., was tested on laparoscopic gallbladder removals and
heartburn-relief operations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, surgeons do those procedures minimally invasively by
sliding a tiny video camera inside the patient's body and operating
with foot-long scalpels and other instruments stuck into two small
incisions. It looks like they are handling long, steel chopsticks
while looking up at a fuzzy videoscreen instead of down at the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopic surgery is immensely popular and surgeons can do it
well. But they complain the instruments are clumsy at best and
prevent fine stitches and other micro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Da Vinci's camera uses multiple lenses to provide a
three-dimensional image from inside the patient's body.
</P>
<P>
   The robotic arms replace those foot-long scalpels, and have a
''wrist'' built in for more humanlike flexibility. The arms hold
specially designed surgical instruments that mimic movement of the
surgeon's hands as he or she operates the robot's joysticks from a
computer next to the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   ''The computer controls the instruments as if your fingers are
grasping the very tip,'' a sensation doctors usually get only in
open surgery, Gardiner explained. ''It's a very powerful
sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 113 patients who underwent robotic gallbladder or
heartburn surgery, they did just as well as 132 patients who got
standard laparoscopic surgery, said Neil Ogden, the FDA engineer
who oversaw Da Vinci's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the robotic operations took up to 50 minutes longer, in part
because surgeons were not accustomed to the new technology, said
Ogden, who warned that the doctors had a learning curve spotted
over their first 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Already doctors are hunting new uses for Da Vinci. A colleague
at Gardiner's hospital is considering fertility surgery that now
cannot be done minimally invasively. Colon and prostate surgeries
that now require fine suturing might become less invasive, too, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors must be specially trained by the Mountain View, Calif.,
manufacturer to use the robot, the FDA stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Five hospitals are trained to use the Da Vinci now: Henrico
Doctors Hospital in Richmond, Va., Baylor Medical Center in
Houston; Ohio State University in Columbus; East Carolina
University in Greenville, N.C.; and Gardiner's San Ramon Medical
Center. A few other hospitals are conducting clinical trials with
the robot on heart patients.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Immediate 911 Calls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators, probing a natural gas
explosion that killed four people in St. Cloud, Minn., two years
ago, said lives could have been saved had workers who severed the
line been under orders to call 911 immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board urged a national,
industrywide effort to ensure that excavators immediately call 911
or other local emergency response numbers if they know an
underground gas line has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, the safety board chairman, said the threat of gas
explosions is growing in virtually every community in the nation as
crews dig alongside gas pipes for a wide variety of reasons,
including the installation of fiber optic cable used in high-tech
communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This goes on every day; it is a constant challenge that we
have; it can be a real danger and a threat,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Cloud explosion on Dec. 11, 1998 killed four people,
injured 11 and destroyed six buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred about 40 minutes after a construction crew,
attempting to install a support for a utility pole, ruptured an
underground, one-inch plastic gas service pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The board ruled that the probable cause of the accident was the
lack of proper procedures by Cable Constructors Inc. to prevent
damage to nearby gas lines after it encountered unusual conditions
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board investigators said that although the gas line had
been properly located and marked, the accident occurred when the
work crew hit an underground granite slab, bending their drilling
equipment and severing the line.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that the explosion might have been prevented and
lives might have been saved had the foreman of the work crew been
under orders to immediately call 911 or other emergency numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, there was a half-hour delay in notifying the
local gas company and local fire and police agencies.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- You first! No, you! No, I insist -- you!
</P>
<P>
   Opening the Middle East summit on a jocular note, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat staged a
mock wrestling match as they tried to usher each other into their
first joint meeting with President Clinton at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders grinned broadly and the ends of Arafat's checkered
keffiyeh headdress flew as the two playfully muscled one another
toward the door after Clinton had entered. In the end, Arafat went
first.
</P>
<P>
   The clowning stands in sharp contrast to what are expected to be
some tense moments behind closed doors during the summit. Both
sides have said any compromises would be difficult and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   If they get a craving for a midnight snack, Arafat and Barak
won't run into each another in the kitchen. The two leaders are
staying in separate cabins at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there won't be opportunities for informal
encounters. The rustic presidential retreat has plenty of wooded
walking trails, a putting green and even a bowling alley. And the
White House hasn't ruled out a sightseeing trip to break summit
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Buddy is acquiring some serious diplomatic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton brought his dog with him to Camp David for the
summit opening. Buddy, a chocolate Labrador, looked eager to
travel; he bounded across the White House lawn and up the chopper
steps ahead of his master.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy also accompanied Clinton to the Israeli-Palestinian summit
at Wye River two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call it quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmont, Md., the nearest community to Camp David, may have
plenty of small-town trappings: fireflies, cornfields, people
whiling away hot summer evenings on their porch swings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't make too much of that bucolic atmosphere, admonished
the daily newspaper serving the town. The Frederick Post, out of
nearby Frederick, Md., observed acerbically in an editorial that
summit visitors were probably working overtime to ''find variations
of 'quaint''' to describe Thurmont.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, though, that locals weren't eager to offer
the participants their good wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome, Bill, Ehud and Yasser,'' said a sign in the window of
Holly's Country Florist on Main Street. ''Think peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Middle East leaders? Presidents? Historic peace talks? Margaret
Krone has seen it all before.
</P>
<P>
   Now 85 and retired, she was Thurmont's town librarian during the
Camp David summit of 1978, when then-President Jimmy Carter held
landmark talks with Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem
Begin.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, who is working this week as a volunteer in the summit
media center, recalled that when Carter took his guests to see the
nearby battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa., journalists flocked to her
library to bone up on Civil War history.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time around, I expect they'd just get on the Internet,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing Israelis and Palestinians have in common,
it's their love of talking nonstop on their cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   But as at past peace summits, delegation sources on both sides
said the Americans had asked them not to use their mobile phones at
Camp David. The idea is that solitude and privacy might help
produce a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart deflected a question about
the ban, saying he wasn't aware of it. But he said the point was
moot because of cell phone service problems in the rugged Catoctin
Mountains, where Camp David is located.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   With much of their school commandeered as a center for the
international press corps covering the summit, kids attending the
summer session at Thurmont Elementary got a few impromptu lessons
in diplomacy and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And gave a few as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're here to talk about peace and fix their problems so
they don't have to keep having wars,'' explained 9-year-old Chris
Schildt, bouncing a basketball. ''Do you want to know anything
else?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 reporters covering the summit worked in makeshift
pressrooms surrounded by chalkboards, kids' crayon drawings and
alphabet charts. The tables and chairs were adult-sized, though.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Figuring it was the closest they'd get to the leaders conferring
at Camp David, a few dozen demonstrators gathered outside the media
center as the summit was beginning, singing songs and waving
banners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get out and show my support for what Mr. Barak is
trying to do,'' said 75-year-old Sam Green of Washington D.C., who
wore a bumper sticker reading ''Peace Now'' plastered across his
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Later, protesters opposing concessions to the Palestinians also
turned out, chanting ''Jerusalem is Jewish'' and displaying signs
saying ''Barak is a traitor.'' A few got in shouting matches with
demonstrators from the peace camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't abide this so-called peace process,'' said Levi
Huebner of New York, who holds Israeli citizenship. ''We can't
stand by and watch him (Barak) endanger our brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators needed a little help puzzling out their own
Hebrew-language signs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, yeah,'' said Suzanne Davidson of Washington. ''It says,
'Israel wants peace.'''

<HEADLINE> Push To Find Disease Genes Begins  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that the human genome is almost completely
mapped, research organizations are starting a major push to find
the genes that cause human disease.
</P>
<P>
   The National Human Genome Research Institute announced Tuesday
that three academic centers will start work to find segments in the
human gene structure that vary from person to person, a major step
toward finding genes that cause heart disease, diabetes and other
common diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating in the effort are the Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass.; Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis, and the Sanger Centre in Hinxton,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will find the variable sequences by searching the
3.1 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA. These
variable sequences are called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or
SNPs. Some of the variations in the SNPs may amount to only a
single chemical base pair difference in the DNA sequence of one
person compared to another.
</P>
<P>
   The SNPs will be located, or mapped, on the genome. This map
then can be used to locate gene variations that cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration is being funded by the National Human Genome
Research Institute, or NHGRI, and the SNP Consortium, a nonprofit
organization that includes the Wellcome Trust and 13 pharmaceutical
and technical companies. The NHGRI is the lead agency in the
international Human Genome Project, a publicly funded consortium
that is mapping and sequencing the entire genome.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the new search for genetic variations is expected
to identify and map up to 750,000 SNPs, but only a fraction of
these are expected to be medically significant.
</P>
<P>
   To find the SNPs, researchers will cut the DNA into about two
million fragments, each with about 6,000 chemical base pairs of
DNA. The DNA to be used will come from 24 anonymous donors who come
from diverse geographic regions.
</P>
<P>
   The base pair sequences in the fragments will then be compared
to sequences already mapped. This will identify the variations. The
SNPs that are found will then be deposited in a computer data base
that researchers can download for laboratory studies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers can use the map of SNPs to identify the genetic
differences that cause some people, but not others, to be
predisposed toward disease.
</P>
<P>
   The analyzed sequences also may help close some of the few
remaining gaps in the working draft of the human genome, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This collaboration will yield a bumper crop of genetic
variations,'' Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NHGRI, said in a
statement. ''As a bonus, it will also improve the assembly of the
human genome sequence so that it is closer to the highly polished
finished form that is our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project, which includes scientists at 16
institutions in the U.S., Great Britain, Japan, Germany, China and
France, is expected to complete the highly accurate, finished
version of the human genome in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint announcement with Celera Genomics on June 26, the HGP
consortium announced that it had completed a ''working draft'' of
the genome that still contained gaps and segments that needed to be
rechecked for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   During the joint announcement, Celera, a private Rockville, Md.
firm, said that it had completed a first assembly of the entire
genome using a different method.

<HEADLINE> Ads May Fuel Public Education Fight  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Wall Street investor is spending about $20
million of his own money on election-season TV ads to tell parents
''America's government-run public school monopoly is failing our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Forstmann, known for giving away millions in private school
scholarships himself, insisted Tuesday that he's not asking parents
to pressure lawmakers to spend public money on tuition vouchers --
or to push them over charter schools or any other alternative to
traditional public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not what we're talking about at all,'' said Forstmann,
who showed two 15-second spot television commercials in a news
conference. ''What I want is for parents to be aware of the facts
and the possibilities and say yes, 'we want to be in charge.' . . .
And we'll figure out what to do from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, publicly funded certificates that parents and children
can use at a private or parochial school, have gained ground as
communities grow frustrated with low test scores and student
performance. But vouchers also have fueled the election-year debate
over the track record of public education.
</P>
<P>
   Public education supporters were especially critical of the ad
campaign, whose backers include former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young,
a Democrat; Martin Luther King III; and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Forstmann and others refuse to use the word 'vouchers' but
it's clearly what they are suggesting,'' said Kathleen Lyons,
spokeswoman for the National Education Association, the larger
teachers' union, with 2&AMP;frac12; million members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's positive to systematically downgrade and
demonize public schools; a person who has a public voice ought to
be using that voice to improve public education,'' Education
Secretary Richard Riley said when asked about the ads after
addressing a group of private educators here.
</P>
<P>
   One of the spots, which will run nationally on cable and network
television from next week until the end of the year, features a
schoolroom with kids throwing paper airplanes and horsing around as
a teacher tries to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   The voiceover begins by saying schools are failing students.
''One in three kids will not graduate with their classmates. And
parents feel powerless,'' it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are shown the address of the group's Web site, which
will gauge, not dictate, parents' interests and concerns, said Dan
Schnur, executive director of Forstmann's Campaign for America's
Children.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, along with Wal-Mart fortune heir John Walton, last
year gave 40,000 children nationwide $1,300 partial private-school
scholarships. Forstmann said the response to the scholarship
lottery -- some 1.2 million families -- prompted the current
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is nonpartisan and not endorsing candidates, he
said. Vice President Al Gore and his presidential rival, Texas Gov.
George Bush, have yet to accept an invitation from the group to a
debate solely on education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican, has proposed using public funds to help
poor children in failing schools attend better public or private
campuses. Democrat Gore is against public funding of private
schools. He's won endorsement from the two major teachers' unions

<HEADLINE> Anti-toll group pushes lawmakers to get rid of Parkway toll booths  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An anti-toll group is pursuing what has long
been a fantasy for many New Jersey motorists: eliminating toll
booths on the Garden State Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   But the group's solution for the lost revenue such a move would
entail might not go over so well with the motoring public at a time
when unleaded regular gasoline costs nearly $1.60 a gallon:
increasing the state's gasoline tax by 3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Citizens Against Tolls says it has gotten thousands
of signatures on petitions it plans to present to Gov. Christie
Whitman. On Tuesday, they enlisted the support of Jersey City Mayor
Bret Schundler, who was to appear with them at an evening rally in
Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned that we have this organization of hundreds of
people just to collect tolls, with 93 buildings, people to care for
those buildings, and managers making over $100,000 a year,'' said
Ray Neveil, a retired phone company manager from Brielle who
founded the group last fall. ''They're a needless, make-work
operation. These tolls cause traffic jams, air pollution, wasted
fuel, and economic loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Neveil says it's a lot less onerous to increase the gasoline tax
and have unimpeded traffic flow on one of the state's most heavily
traveled roads. He calculates that a 3-cent increase would offset
the cost of having the state Department of Transportation maintain
the Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an interesting idea, but a very complicated one, and
would require an act of the legislature,'' said Laura Otterbourg, a
spokeswoman for Whitman. ''The governor would consider it if the
legislature were to put forth a proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ingoglia, a spokesman for the New Jersey Highway
Authority, which operates the 173-mile toll road, said the Parkway
still has to be funded, regardless of where the money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ''The removal of tolls is a legitimate public question, and the
discussion deserves all the facts,'' he said. ''You can eliminate
tolls, but you cannot eliminate the things tolls pay for: snow
removal, State Police patrols, roadway maintenance. All those
things still have to be paid for. Do you want to do it by charging
the people who use the roadway, or through taxes from people
whether they use it or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Ingoglia noted that 1 in 5 vehicles that uses the Parkway is
from out of state, a figure that increases to 1 in 4 during the
summer. He also disputed figures presented by Citizens Against
Tolls claiming that it costs 13 cents of every 35-cent toll just to
pay for collection. The real figure is 7 cents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schundler, who has his own grass-roots anti-tax group, Empower
The People, said he supports the goal of removing the toll plazas,
but not hiking the gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there's a strong consensus to remove the tolls,'' he
said. ''As far as how to fund roadways, that's a discussion we can
have another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Schundler called Parkway tolls a hidden tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only is it a financial tax, it's a tax on people's
lives,'' he said. ''It wastes work time and family time and causes
enormous mental aggravation.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled an incident when he was in college where he was
sitting in a long line of cars approaching Parkway toll booths, and
someone tried to cut in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those situations where because you've been there
so long you just don't want to let anyone get in front of you,'' he
said. ''We ended up in a situation where our front bumpers were in
contact, but neither of us was going even a tenth of a mile an
hour, so there was no damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy had a nice car, and I had an old beat-up type of car
you'd expect a college student to have, and suddenly the other guy
started opening his door and pounding my passenger door,''
Schundler said. ''So I rolled down my window and yelled, 'Do it
some more!' The point is the whole thing should never have happened
if we didn't have tolls.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for a toll-free Parkway by the citizens group is not
the first. Last summer, two Morris County legislators, state Sen.
Robert Martin and Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Alex
DeCroce, floated a proposal to eliminate eight of the highway's 11
toll plazas while increasing the remaining tolls to $1. But they
later backed off that proposal, saying the Parkway should upgrade
E-ZPass to enable cars to go through faster than the 5 mph now
required. Such technology is still considered to be years away.

<HEADLINE> Supremes' Tour Future Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- So who exactly is going to sing ''Baby Love''
and ''Where Did Our Love Go'' for the rest of this summer, if
anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Confusion swirled around the ill-fated Diana Ross &AMP; The Supremes
reunion tour on Tuesday, a day after Ross said her promoter had
canceled the tour. The promoter, SFX, announced that a concert set
for Wednesday in Hartford, Conn., had been called off but insisted
it had not pulled the plug on the rest of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1,400 of some 10,000 available tickets had been sold
for the Hartford show, said Joe Flanagan, marketing director for
the Hartford Civic Center. Prices had ranged up to $250.
</P>
<P>
   A Ross spokesman, Paul Bloch, said Tuesday that Ross stands by
her statement that the tour has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there's still a chance that Ross will sing on any of
the upcoming dates, Bloch said ''I've been given no indication that
there's a possibility of that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, local representatives said they expected Thursday's
show to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't received definitive word from the promoter yet as
far as any cancellation,'' Jim Delaney, a spokesman for the
FleetCenter in Boston, said. ''As of right now we have to go on the
assumption that the show is still happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders suggested the confusion may be a prelude to
legal maneuvering over how much money SFX is required to pay Ross,
if any, for the canceled dates of the tour.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Tourists, Hostages Released  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Indigenous Fijian rebels freed nine of their
27 government captives Wednesday, moving this Pacific island nation
closer to the end of a crisis. Other rebels seized a beach resort
where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed, later releasing its 40
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the government captives came hours after an
unrelated rebel group seized a posh resort on Turtle Island over
what they said was a land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw a crisis in Fiji and we're thinking this is a good
time,'' rebel Mavi Ratulevu said.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 guests, including 15 Americans, were released from the
resort and placed on a cruise ship to Fiji's main island, Viti
Levu. The resort's owner, American Richard Evanson, was being held
in a hotel room with two of the people who occupied the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to keep an eye on him for a while,'' Ratulevu
said. He added the group might be occupying the island for a week,
unless a satisfactory resolution could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The taking of the resort was the first attack on a foreign-owned
facility during the government crisis on the Pacific island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began May 19 when rebels stormed Parliament and took
several dozen hostages, including then-Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   The nine government hostages were turned over to the Red Cross
and then went to their homes, police and a Red Cross doctor said.
They included all the ethnic Indian parliamentarians except for the
deposed prime minister and his son. The other remaining hostages
are all ethnic Fijian legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagat Ram, the Red Cross doctor who saw the nine freed
hostages, said all of them were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked happy to get out of that (Parliament) complex,''
Ram said. ''They conversed very well and they have gone to their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The release came three days after the rebels, led by former
businessman George Speight, signed an agreement with Fiji's
military government to end the hostage crisis. Under the agreement,
Speight was supposed to release all his hostages Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the early release signified.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's spokesman, Jo Nata, said the hostages were released
because ''we felt -- apart from being a gesture of good will -- it is
a consideration of security. If we released them all at once it
could cause a stampede outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''They also had asked us if and when they were released if we
could do it at night to avoid the humiliation of being liberated in
front of our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aull, the wife of freed Parliamentarian Bill Aull, said his
release was ''unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time,'' she said. ''God was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aull said her husband appeared to be unhurt, but he did not
want to talk about his ordeal. ''We still have hostages inside,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the nation's large ethnic
Indian minority has too much power. They demanded that the
country's multiracial constitution be scrapped and that Chaudhry,
Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, be deposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the seizure of the hostages, Speight
supporters looted and burned ethnic Indian homes and businesses,
and many Indians made plans to flee the country. The violence led
Fiji's military to take control and declare martial law.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after weeks of negotiations, military leaders and
Speight reached the deal to free the hostages are supposed to be
freed in exchange for the granting of many of Speight's demands,
including a new government and a new constitution curtailing Indian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Speight may end up with a
Cabinet post, perhaps even the prime minister's job. He told a news
conference that such a move would be a perfect end for the coup.
</P>
<P>
   But unrest has persisted despite the deal. Speight supporters
have engaged in widespread civil disturbances across the nation,
occupying police stations and blockading roads in an apparent
effort to wring more concessions from the military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group told reporters they support Speight. But
they could be claiming rebel affiliation to take advantage of the
amnesty being offered for political crimes related to the hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if these people are in support of us or are
taking advantage of the situation,'' Nata said.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians, whose ancestors were brought to the islands by
English colonialists over a century ago to work in the rich sugar
cane fields, make up 44 percent of the nation's 812,000 people.
Many of the indigenous Fijians who comprise 51 percent of the
population resent their economic clout.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's tourist industry has been devastated by the government
crisis, with some of the hundreds of resort hotels scattered across
dozens of islands reporting occupancy rates as low as 10 percent.
However, around 1,000 Americans a week have been among tourists
still coming into Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known if any of the guests on Turtle Island were
American.

<HEADLINE> INS Mulls Iranian Dissident's Fate  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Iranian dissident spared deportation to her
homeland by a U.S. immigration court still could be ordered to a
third country, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mahnaz Samadi, 35, had been in INS custody for three months
after she was found to have been a member of a group designated by
the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   At a deportation Monday hearing in Arlington, Va., the court
ruled out sending her back to Iran because she could face
persecution there, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Samadi had engaged in fraud when, applying
for political asylum in 1995, she told immigration authorities that
she was not a member of the National Liberation Army, the military
wing of the Iranian resistance, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said that no order for deportation
to a third country had been handed down and that the question of
deportation to a country other than her homeland rests with the
immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in time, there are no specific plans to do so,''
Cardona said, adding that Samadi has been ordered released from her
detention. The court ruled that that Samadi is free to seek
employment and faces no restrictions on freedom of expression.
Also, terrorism-related charges against her have been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But, Cardona added, ''The INS does have the authority to remove
her to a third country.''
</P>
<P>
   A jubilant Samadi appeared at a Capitol Hill news conference on
Tuesday and thanked the many members of Congress and other
Americans who rallied to her support.
</P>
<P>
   Of her 98 days in confinement in Alabama, she said in halting
English, ''I have gone through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Michael Maggio, said her legs and arms had been
shackled during her confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona said Samadi was detained at a facility administered by a
company hired by the INS. She said procedures at the facility are
set up by the contractor and not the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi said she and two brothers engaged in dissident activities
not long after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. She was
arrested, she said, after the execution of her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was tortured during her time in an Iranian prison,
from 1982 to 1986. She made her way to Iraq in the early 1990s and
spent several months working with NLA rebels active in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived in the United States in 1994 and was granted
political asylum in 1995. As part of a settlement reached with the
immigration court on Monday, she voluntarily relinquished her
political asylum status.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities arrested her earlier this year on grounds
that her past associations made her a danger to the community.
Canada then deported her to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Group Offers New Gun Control Effort  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Cabinet members lent support Tuesday to a
private effort intended to recruit college students for a
gun-control campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still one of the most violent nations in the world,''
Attorney General Janet Reno told Tuesday's audience of about 400,
most of them students interning for the summer at Washington's many
advocacy groups, law firms, and government offices. ''But that does
not have to be. ... We can do something about it, but we have got
to wake up America.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno called gun violence an epidemic, saying that 29,829 people
died from gun-related injuries in 1998 -- or 82 deaths a day --
despite dramatic reductions in violent crime in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The ''First Monday 2000'' campaign hopes to build on enthusiasm
created by the Million Mom March in May and inspire students from
law, nursing, social work and medical schools to organize events
for Oct. 2, the day the Supreme Court begins its next term. The
Alliance for Justice, which is organizing the effort, envisions
hundreds of simultaneous rallies, town hall meetings and
door-to-door campaigns across the country that day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to launch a mobilization so massive that politicians
cannot ignore us,'' said Alliance President Nan Aron.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of advocacy groups perhaps best known for monitoring
federal judicial nominations, the alliance has held ''First
Monday'' events since 1994, focusing on a different social justice
issue each year. They are joined this year by Physicians for Social
Responsibility, the National Education Association, Handgun
Control, the American Bar Association and the American Academy of
Pediatrics, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo urged the students to counter the
strength of anti-gun control forces with their own political
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to get beat because they were better at
getting their voices heard,'' Cuomo said. ''It's up to you. Make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also addressing the crowd were several of Congress' leading
gun-control advocates, including Democratic Reps. Bobby Rush of
Illinois and Carolyn McCarthy of New York, who both have lost
family members to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court's
dismissal of an attempt by the National Rifle Association to force
Attorney General Janet Reno to immediately destroy personal
information relating to legal firearm transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA argued that the Brady Act requires the immediate
elimination of the data, though the court agreed with Reno that
nothing in the act bars the Department of Justice from holding the
information for up to six months for background check system
audits.

<HEADLINE> George Karl Frustrated With Bucks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- George Karl expressed frustration
Tuesday that the Milwaukee Bucks didn't give him a chance to pursue
the coaching vacancy at North Carolina, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who called the position his ''dream job,'' said he
withdrew his name from consideration at UNC when the Bucks denied
him permission to talk to the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina hired Matt Doherty as coach Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't deny that my heart is very much in Carolina,''
Milwaukee's coach said Tuesday at the Bucks' suburban practice
center. ''It was a weekend of a lot of feelings and a lot of
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Karl wore a North Carolina cap as he played golf
at a charity event for the Greater Milwaukee Open.
</P>
<P>
   Karl spent a weekend trying to convince the Bucks' owner, Sen.
Herb Kohl, D-Wis., to let him have more serious talks than an
informal chat with former coach Dean Smith, Karl's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who signed Karl to a four-year, $20 million deal in 1998,
turned Karl down, the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to sit here and deny that I wish I had more
freedom,'' Karl said. ''Analyzing it, I probably would have done
the same thing the senator did, but that doesn't mean I'm happy
with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first sign of conflict between Karl and Kohl, who have
had a harmonious relationship in their two years together. Karl's
contract has no buyout clause, meaning he needed permission to
speak to another organization about a job.
</P>
<P>
   A message The Associated Press left Tuesday at Kohl's Washington
office was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he's not totally happy with me,'' Karl said. ''I'm
not sure he understands the lure that place has for (alumni).''
</P>
<P>
   Bucks general manager Ernie Grunfeld mediated the discussions
between Karl and Kohl. Grunfeld characterized the decision as
''mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the nature of the business,'' Grunfeld said. ''We're
happy we have a coach that's so well-regarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl, a 1973 graduate of North Carolina, has 13 years of NBA
coaching experience. He has never held a college coaching job.

<HEADLINE> Twenty-year police veteran gets six months in rape of 16-year-old  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENSSELAER, N.Y. (AP) - A former Rensselaer police officer was
sentenced to six months in jail for raping and sodomizing a
16-year-old girl last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's sentencing with the victim in the courtroom is part of
a plea agreement Edward Farrell, 40, made in April. The crime
happened in January 1999 in Farrell's home.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell also faces five years probation and will have to
register with the state as a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, now 17 years old, made a powerful statement at the
sentencing. She said her life was torn apart when her school
friends learned of the crime. She also warned Farell to never go
near her or her family.
</P>
<P>
   Farell, who claimed he had consensual sex with the girl, will
still get his police pension.

<HEADLINE> Mother complains about kids on Senate mail list  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Bay Shore mother is complaining that her
children received Senate fund-raising letters after she provided
their names and addresses for a security check prior to meeting
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Savino had been invited to a reception with Clinton at Bay
Shore High School Sept. 8 and was allowed to bring her three young
children. She provided their names and Social Security numbers for
security purposes for ''a first lady visiting our school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, she and the children received
individual White House Christmas cards, followed by fund-raising
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to be used. I don't like to be duped,'' Savino
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said Tuesday that the
meeting was a campaign event and that the participants' names were
collected by the campaign, for use by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Savino said she was under the impression that Clinton had been
visiting as a first lady. But Clinton's Senate campaign staff
accompanied her to the high school and drove a van carrying
reporters from Manhattan. Clinton also held a news conference that
day about Senate issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Gross, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who formerly worked
for the Federal Elections Commission, said that if costs associated
with the event were paid for by the Clinton campaign rather than
the federal government, ''then names accumulated are fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Secret Service, Jim Mackin, said: ''On
occasion we do name checks for certain events. When we do that, we
share that information with no one.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly minority leader, John Faso, agreed with
Savino.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is inappropriate,'' said Faso, a supporter of Clinton's
GOP Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''One wonders how many other times have they done this,'' Faso
said Tuesday on WROW-AM radio in Albany. ''Here's this first lady
out there saying how she wants to protect everyone's privacy. The
first thing they do is they trample on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton herself has been an advocate for greater privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe you should give up your privacy when you visit
your doctor, take a trip to the video store or buy a book on the
Internet,'' she said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kelly, head of the Bay Shore Board of Education, did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officer Expects Lower Costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The 2002 Winter Games won't be as
expensive as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after stepping down as president of the Utah
senate to monitor Olympic finances, State Olympic officer Lane
Beattie said Monday that state agencies won't need nearly as much
money as originally estimated to cover expenses for the games in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much less is still being calculated, the Deseret News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said the figures would be released in about two weeks,
in his inaugural report on the financial impact the Olympics will
have on Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie was appointed State Olympic officer in June by Gov. Mike
Leavitt. Months earlier, Beattie announced he would not run for
re-election in the Senate, where he has served since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are costing SLOC nearly $1.32 billion, not
including government costs for public safety and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's report from former Olympic officer John Fowler
estimated the Legislature would need to find $31 million for
everything from paying police overtime to building new roads.
</P>
<P>
   The SLOC devised a plan to raise $15 million toward the cost of
providing protection to the public during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers came up with $2 million and lawmakers agreed not to
tax Olympic tickets, freeing another $13 million. Other savings are
possible as state agencies review expected expenses through the
games and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie worries about public safety and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are two issues that could destroy the success of an
Olympics very quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with state agencies to take a look at ''everything
from life to death, meaning emergency preparedness ... down to
Olympic pins'' will likely be held in the next two to three weeks,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Jet manufacturer joining 'time-share' boom  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. (AP) - Cessna Aircraft Co., the well-known
builder of small airplanes, expanded Tuesday into the ''fractional
ownership'' market, a kind of time-share business for corporate
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest sign of a trend that has resulted in
record sales of business jets and has allowed about 1,500 companies
to claim part-ownership of a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Cessna, part of the Textron conglomerate, announced it is buying
50 percent of TAG StarShares Holding, a subsidiary of TAG Aviation
USA Inc. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   StarShares is being renamed CitationShares Holding. It will be
headed by Steve O'Neill, StarShares' chief executive officer. Neil
Armstrong, the first man on the moon, is one of seven board
members.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, based at Westchester County Airport in Harrison
and concentrating on the eastern United States, will operate a
small fleet of Cessna's Citation jet aircraft for the fractional
market, in which businesses save money buy purchasing access to a
jet rather than paying full price for one.
</P>
<P>
   Cessna spokeswoman Tish Cohlmia said a business that buys a
share would call when it needs a plane and would be able to fly
within eight hours. The larger the share, the more hours of flying
time available.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth of a share in one of Cessna's six-seat Citation
Bravos, for example, would cost about $700,000 and guarantee 100
hours of flight time a year on any plane in the fleet. The base
price of a Bravo is $5.15 million.
</P>
<P>
   CitationShares would provide the plane, the pilot and aircraft
maintenance. It would feature Citation's new CJ1 and Bravo models,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McMullin, TAG's chief executive officer, said
CitationShares would combine Cessna's product line and marketing
with TAG's experience in aircraft operations. Gary Hay, Cessna's
CEO, said the new company would have ''the lowest entry price for
new jet aircraft in the fractional ownership market.''
</P>
<P>
   Cessna already sells planes to other firms that market
time-shared jets, including industry leader Executive Jet Inc.,
which says it has bought 45 percent of all the business jets
ordered in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Cohlmia said the new company would not be in direct competition
with Executive Jet because that company specializes in larger
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers, including Raytheon Aircraft Co. and
Bombardier Aerospace, already operate fractional jet programs.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Atlantic City councilwoman gives up on challenge  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - The former president of the City
Council said Tuesday she would withdraw a civil suit challenging
the results of the election that ousted her from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Norrell-Nance, 50, said she could not afford to pursue
the challenge any longer. But she called on the county prosecutor
to investigate allegations that her opponent's supporters cast
ballots on behalf of absentee voters in the June 13 run-off
election for her Second Ward seat.
</P>
<P>
   She said her complaints were not sour grapes over her loss to
political newcomer Robert L. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something has to be done about this,'' she said. ''If not,
we're going to find every election a total mess, with people using
these kinds of procedures to undercut the voters' choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 43, defeated the two-term incumbent 574-515.
Norrell-Nance won at the polls but lost after Johnson supporter
David Callaway, acting as a messenger, hand-delivered 115 absentee
ballots to the Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among those ballots, 112 voted for Johnson and three for
Norrell-Nance.
</P>
<P>
   Norrell-Nance said an investigator working for her had
identified 91 instances of election fraud, several involving
Callaway and his brother, Craig Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   The two told voters there was an easier way to vote than going
to the polls, and asked voters to sign a document, Norrell-Nance
said. The voters told the investigator later that they never marked
the yellow absentee ballots used in the election, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator also found that residents of Pleasantville,
Mays Landing and other Atlantic City wards voted in the election,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Michael Winkelstein rejected
Norrell-Nance's request for an investigation by the Board of
Elections on June 29, saying the burden of proof was
Norrell-Nance's.
</P>
<P>
   But it would cost between $60,000 and $110,000 in attorney's
fees to take depositions, issue subpoenas and continue
investigating each vote. She wouldn't say how much she had spent to
date on the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''She lost, we won. She got beat,'' said Daniel Perskie,
Johnson's lawyer. ''Her concessions don't sound like concessions,
but the bottom line is she's withdrawing her complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Callaways could be reached for comment. Craig
Callaway's home telephone rang unanswered Tuesday afternoon; there
was no listing for David Callaway's telephone, and Perskie said he
knew of no way to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his supporters did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Mrs. Nance's constitutional right to pursue any type of
matter she sees fit. Everything was fair and square,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz said he would review
Norrell-Nance's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will review whatever information and data is submitted,
then make a decision regarding investigation,'' Blitz said.

<HEADLINE> GAO Account Fuels Nuke Secret Fury  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 12 years, Energy Department procedures
have not required classified documents to be signed in and out by
users, a congressional investigator told lawmakers Tuesday. The
finding adds to their fury over how two computer drives containing
nuclear secrets went missing from the Los Alamos weapons lab last
month.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator for the General Accounting office told the House
Commerce Committee that the since 1988, and likely even before
that, the Energy Department ''has not and does not require a
sign-out sheet'' for secret or even top secret material.
</P>
<P>
   Other requirements for protecting and controlling secrets have
been discontinued, said Jim Wells, the GAO investigator. For
example, the lab no longer requires frequent inventories or unique
identification numbers for classified material, which makes it
easier to track.
</P>
<P>
   Since the discovery that the two disk drives had vanished from a
top-security vault for about two months at the Los Alamos lab in
New Mexico, some members of Congress have been dumbfounded to learn
that those using the drives weren't required to sign them out.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing last month, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., wondered why
his hometown library has sign-out requirements for books, but the
weapons lab doesn't have any for nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said the General Accounting Office reviewed changes that
have been made since 1988 for the control of classified material,
including secret and top secret nuclear weapons material.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 ''complete accountability was required,'' said Wells,
but even then there was no sign-out or sign-in requirement for
secrets kept in areas where access was highly controlled such as
Los Alamos' ''X Division'' complex where nuclear weapons designers
worked.
</P>
<P>
   The two hard drives were last seen in the vault within the ''X
Division'' sometime in late March and discovered missing in early
May, but their disappearance was not reported for another three
weeks. They were found June 16 behind a copying machine not far
from the vault. The incident remains under FBI criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that many requirements for protecting and
controlling secret and top secret material were discontinued during
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The policy revisions in 1992 and 1993 left ''a security system
that has deep flaws,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the Commerce
Committee chairman. He added that the lack of such records
apparently has never been a violation of Energy Department security
rules.

<HEADLINE> HUD HQ Named for Black Cabinet Head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The headquarters of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development was named on Tuesday after Robert C. Weaver,
who became the nation's first black cabinet head when he was named
HUD secretary in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Robert Weaver was a pioneer who broke through bariers of
racism again and again to build a life of extraordinary achievement
and public service,'' HUD's current secretary Andrew Cuomo said
Tuesday. Cuomo was joined by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Rep.
Charles Rangel, both New York Democrats, in naming the towering HUD
building in downtown Washington after Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington D.C. and a graduate of Harvard University,
Weaver played an active role in the civil rights movement. He also
served for a time in the administration of President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt working in the Department of Interior.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Weaver became deputy New York state rent commissioner,
later becoming the first black in the state's cabinet when he was
named commissioner. In 1959, he became vice-chairman of the New
York City Housing and Development Board. Soon after President John
F. Kennedy named him director of the federal Housing and Home
Finance Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy tried to have the agency raised to a cabinet rank but
Congress balked, led by southerners opposed to the appointment of a
black as a cabinet head.
</P>
<P>
   When President Lyndon Johnson succeeded in creating the
Department of Housing and Urban Development he appointed Weaver
secretary in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver moved back to New York City after his four-year term at
HUD, serving as president of Baruch College and professor of urban
affairs at Hunter College. He died in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Former bank employee sentenced to two weeks in prison  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former Bank of New York employee was sentenced
Tuesday to two weeks in prison and five and a half months home
confinement for her role in a $7 billion Russian money laundering
scam.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff sentenced Svetlana
Kudryavtsev, 50, to prison even though prosecutors and a defense
lawyer conceded they mistakenly believed she had pleaded guilty to
a charge that did not carry a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said the prison term, however brief, was necessary to
''send a message that if you commit a crime of this sort, you will
go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal sentencing guidelines called for the Brooklyn woman to
receive at least a month in prison, but Rakoff said the facts of
the case were unusual enough to spare her a more serious sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev had pleaded guilty to accepting illegal payments as
a bank employee and lying to investigators after accepting $500 a
month from Lucy Edwards and her husband to monitor bank accounts
which were being used to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern
European Division, has pleaded guilty to federal charges along with
her husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I swear I didn't know Lucy was doing anything improper while
she was working at the bank,'' Kudryavtsev said through an
interpreter just before she was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really very, very sorry,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Charles D. Adler, said his client had become close
friends of Edwards when they lived in Leningrad together during 25
years under a repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   He said she lied to FBI agents when they interviewed her last

the former Soviet Union to be guarded about anything she said.

<P>
   ''In that culture, you don't admit anything,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed Kudryavtsev deserved a break.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sentence is sadder than many because I really don't have
any doubt that the defendant was manipulated and used and, if you
will, betrayed into the crimes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman announces $1 million grant to restore Ellis Island buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. - Gov. Christie Whitman presented the National
Park Service with a ceremonial check Tuesday to mark a $1 million
donation from the state to restore buildings on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   The state grant will be matched by federal funds, Whitman said
at a ceremony outside the island's immigration museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''This important reference point needs to be preserved so that
future generations can come, look and learn,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many of the buildings that once housed hospitals
were deteriorated, Whitman said. Now state money has gone to
stabilize those structures so preservationist can begin work, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time to redouble our efforts to save this historic
monument,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The state also allocated $2.3 million last year for preservation
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''A million here, a million there, after a while you get real
money,'' joked Department of Environmental Commission Commissioner
Bob Shinn.
</P>
<P>
   A private group, Save Ellis Island!, hopes to preserve 30
buildings on the island's south side. The estimated cost is $6.6
million to begin preservation work.
</P>
<P>
   The group expects to get more matching funds from private
sources to aid the effort, said chairman Finn M.W. Caspersen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now all we need to do is raise between $200 and $300 million
to save the island,'' Caspersen said.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Church Arson Cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Indiana man, who called himself a
missionary of Lucifer, pleaded guilty to setting 26 churches on
fire over a five-year period that ended in 1999, the Justice
Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Scott Ballinger entered his plea in federal court in
Indianapolis, the department said in a release. It recommended that
the 38-year-old Yorktown man be sentenced to more than 42 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The plea follows a nationwide investigation conducted by the
FBI, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the Indiana State Fire Marshal's Office, state and local
fire investigators around the country and the National Church Arson
Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger ''frequently expressed his hostility toward organized
Christianity, signed individuals he met to contracts with the devil
and termed himself a missionary of Lucifer,'' according to the
Justice Department's release, which cited information contained in
the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger pleaded guilty to setting fires at churches in
Alabama, California, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, South
Carolina and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fires were started late at night or early in the
morning at isolated rural churches, the Justice Department said. On
most occasions, Ballinger broke a window at the side or back of the
church, poured gasoline into the church and set it on fire with a
lighter, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger's plea ''represents the largest number of fires
charged to any single defendant'' since President Clinton formed
the National Church Arson Task Force in June 1996, said James
Johnson, Treasury's under secretary for enforcement and co-chair of
the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger's plea involved fires at:
</P>
<P>
   Concord Church of Christ, Lebanon, Ind.; Liberty Baptist Church,
Kempton, Ind.; Church of God at Angola, Ind.; Maranatha Baptist
Church, Versailles, Ohio; First Eminence Baptist Church, Eminence,
Ind.; South Shore American Baptist Church, Dana Point, Calif.;
Sunlight Baptist Church, Eastaboga, Ala.; Arm Oak Baptist Church,
Hardeeville, S.C.; Sumach United Methodist Church, Wardell, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Milledgeville United Methodist Church, Milledgeville,
Ind.; Hawcreek Missionary Baptist Church, Hope, Ind.; Grace Baptist
Church, Coatesville, Ind.; New Liberty Congregational Christian
Church, Lynn, Ind.; Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Lewisville, Ind.;
Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, Filmore, Ind.; Christian Liberty
Church, Sheridan, Ind.; Mt. Eden Christian Church, Little York,
Ind.; Bolton Schoolhouse Missionary Baptist Church, Bonnieville,
Ky.; Little Hurricane Primitive Baptist Church, Manchester, Tenn.;
Cedar Grove Baptist Church, Franklin, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Pleasant Hill Methodist Church, Elkton, Ky.; New Harmony
Baptist Church, Morgantown, Ky.; Otterbein United Brethren Church,
Rockford, Ohio; Stidham United Methodist Church, Lafayette, Ind.;
Wabash Primitive Baptist Church, Huntington, Ind. and Community
United Methodist Church, Brookville, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Metal from unknown source damages car in Rotterdam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROTTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) - Federal Aviation Administration officials
now says hunks of metal that were thought to have fallen from an
airplane onto a car and a neighborhood is from no airplane they
know of.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Smith Jr.'s Hyundai was empty and no one was hurt Monday
morning at about 10:40 a.m. when the 4-inch-by-4-inch metal piece
apparently slammed into the car parked at Carman Body Works. Later
in the day after news reports were aired, neighbors found other
small pieces in the area.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials on Tuesday, however, said that preliminary tests
show the metal isn't from an airplane and more tests at a special
laboratory could be scheduled, WRGB-TV reported.
</P>
<P>
   Garage owner Bob Valachovic saw the car and first assumed the
damage had been done by teen-age vandals. But then he saw a piece
of metal behind the car that looked like a part from an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I picked it up, and it was kind of hot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valachovic called police immediately because he thought there
might be a damaged or disabled plane in the area. Rotterdam police
reached the same conclusion, and they contacted the FAA in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly looks like it came from an aircraft. However,
they haven't been able to identify the aircraft yet,'' FAA
spokeswoman Arlene Salac Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The piece shattered the rear window, bent the window frame, and
dented the vehicle's trunk.

<HEADLINE> Woman arrested in Ocean County stabbing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - A Lakewood woman was charged with
manslaughter in the stabbing death of her sister's boyfriend, Ocean
County prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Tresa Pearson, 25, was arrested Tuesday afternoon. The stabbing
occurred shortly before 5:30 a.m., police said. Bail was set at
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the stabbing took place after Alvin Nicholson, 30,
of Howell, and his girlfriend, Tonya Pearson, got into a heated
verbal and physical argument in the foyer of a Lakewood apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police didn't give Tonya Pearson's age or her hometown. It also
wasn't immediately clear who was living at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   After the altercation, the sisters entered the apartment and
Nicholson tried to follow them, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tresa Pearson then got a kitchen knife and used it to stab
Nicholson in the chest, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examiner pronounced Nicholson dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was scheduled Tuesday evening to determine the cause
of death and the number of wounds.

<HEADLINE> Clemson Track Coach Agrees To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Clemson women's track coach Ralph White,
who was hired, unhired and hired again last year after a school
committee complained the job search was not extensive enough, has
agreed to leave the program after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won the battle but lost the war,'' White said Tuesday. The
school's announcement called the move a mutual separation.
</P>
<P>
   White was hired twice within five weeks last summer. After his
first hiring June 18, the Status of Women commission wrote to
then-president Constantine ''Deno'' Curris complaining that no
women or minorities were considered.
</P>
<P>
   A search committee headed by associate athletic director Linda
White (no relation to Ralph) looked at about 50 applicants and
interviewed four candidates before Ralph White -- an assistant coach
for Clemson's men's team from 1997-99 -- was rehired.
</P>
<P>
   He had coached track and field at Allegheny (Pa.) College,
Southern Methodist, George Mason and Penn State before coming to
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   White will be paid $46,344.82, what he was due for the final
year of his two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Distance runner Erika van Reenen said the coach was widely liked
by the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of a crazy situation,'' said van Reenen, who did not
want to discuss the circumstances of White's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Linda White again will head a search committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Mexico signed an
agreement Tuesday that would enable the two countries to cooperate
in antitrust enforcement, the Justice Department announced.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the agreement was ''an
important tool'' for consumer protection in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Key provisions would encourage enforcement actions by each
nation at the other's request, and maintain confidentiality of
sensitive information provided by the other country.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides ''a sound basis for enhanced cooperation,
while minimizing possible conflicts between the two nations'
antitrust enforcement activities,'' said Joel I. Klein, assistant
attorney general in charge of antitrust.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has similar agreements with Brazil, Canada,
the European Union, Israel and Japan.

<HEADLINE> FBI e-mail Snooping Device Attacked  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Civil liberties and privacy groups railed
Tuesday against a new system designed to allow law enforcement
agents to intercept and analyze huge amounts of e-mail in
connection with an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The system, called ''Carnivore,'' was first hinted at on April 6
in testimony to a House subcommittee. Now the FBI has it in use.
</P>
<P>
   When Carnivore is placed at an Internet Service Provider, it
scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails for messages associated
with the target of a criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to two members of the House subcommittee
that deals with Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure issues, the
American Civil Liberties Union argued that the system breaches the
Internet provider's rights and the rights of all its customers by
reading both sender and recipient addresses, as well as subject
lines of e-mails, to decide whether to make a copy of the entire
message.
</P>
<P>
   Further, while the system is plugged into the Internet
provider's systems, it is controlled solely by the law enforcement
agency. In a traditional wiretap, the tap is physically placed and
maintained by the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnivore is roughly equivalent to a wiretap capable of
accessing the contents of the conversations of all of the phone
company's customers, with the 'assurance' that the FBI will record
only conversations of the specified target,'' read the letter.
''This 'trust us, we are the government' approach is the antithesis
of the procedures required under our wiretapping laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU, said citizens
shouldn't trust that such a sweeping data-tap will only be used
against criminal suspects. And even then, he said, the data mined
by Carnivore, particularly subject lines, is already intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Law enforcement should be prohibited from installing any
device that allows them to intercept communications from persons
other than the target,'' Steinhardt said in an interview. ''When
conducting these kinds of investigations, the information should be
restricted to only addressing information.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who heads the
Constitution subcommittee, said that the congressman had no
immediate comment on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to Canady's subcommittee, Robert Corn-Revere, a
lawyer at the Hogan &AMP; Hartson law firm in Washington, said that he
represented an Internet provider that refused to install the
Carnivore system. The provider was placed in an ''awkward
position,'' Corn-Revere said, because the company feared suits from
customers unhappy with the government looking in to all the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was acknowledged (by the government) that Carnivore would
enable remote access to the ISP's network and would be under the
exclusive control of government agents,'' Corn-Revere said.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere told the committee that current law is insufficient
to deal with Carnivore's potential and that the Internet provider
lost their court battle in part because of the Internet's
connection to telephone lines, and that the law was stretched to
cover the Internet as well.
</P>
<P>
   Corn-Revere would not reveal the name of his client, and the
client lost the case. He said that the FBI has been using Carnivore
since early this year.
</P>
<P>
   James X. Dempsey, senior staff counsel at the Center for
Democracy and Technology, said that the main problem with Carnivore
is it's mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI is placing a black box inside the computer network of
an ISP,'' Dempsey said. ''Not even the ISP knows exactly what that
gizmo is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dempsey said that Internet providers contributed to the
problem, by saying that current technology does not allow the
Internet provider to sort out exactly what the government is
entitled to get under a search warrant. The carriers complained
that they had to give everything to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The service providers said they didn't know how to comply with
court orders,'' Dempsey said. ''By taking that position, they have
hurt themselves, putting themselves into a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Thomas, who heads the FBI's Cyber Technology Section,
told the Wall Street Journal that the bureau has about 20 Carnivore
systems, which are PCs with proprietary software. He said Carnivore
meets current wiretapping laws, but is designed to keep up with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a specialized sniffer,'' Thomas told the Journal,
which first reported details about Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   Encrypted e-mail, done with an e-mail encoding program like PGP,
still stays in code on Carnivore, and it's up to agents to decode
it.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey has a possible solution to the problem, though one
that's probably unlikely -- show everyone what it does and how it
does it, allowing Internet providers to install the software
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI should make this gizmo an open-source product,'' he
said. ''Then the secret is gone.''

<HEADLINE> Hanged Teen's Kin, Reno To Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mother and brother of a black Mississippi
teen-ager found hanged will meet with lawmakers and Attorney
General Janet Reno on Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Raynard Johnson, 17, was found hanging from a pecan tree a few
yards from the front door of his rural home June 16. Officials said
autopsy findings were consistent with suicide, but Johnson's family
questioned the ruling and called on the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
others to demand a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Maria, and brother, Roger, will meet with Reno after
a news conference at the Capitol with Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich,
said Keenan Keller, Democratic counsel for the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers is the ranking Democrat on that committee.
</P>
<P>
   Keller also said it is possible the Johnsons might be invited
back to speak to the House Judiciary Committee at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary probe into Johnson's death,
and state authorities say their investigations continue to be a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who spoke at the teen's funeral, also is expected to
escort the family to Washington. Jackson has been trying to focus
national attention on the death.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said he believes there are suspects in the case,
although officials have refused to confirm or deny that. He said
many things point to a racially motivated killing, including the
fact that Johnson and his brother had been friends with two
17-year-old white girls.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has set up a $10,000 reward and toll-free tip line to
encourage more leads in the case.

<HEADLINE> Packers Acquire FB Powell  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers acquired fullback
Marvin Powell from the New Orleans Saints on Tuesday in exchange
for tight end Lawrence Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who played at Southern California, appeared in nine
games for New Orleans last season, making two tackles on special
teams and rushing once.
</P>
<P>
   He is the son of 11-year NFL veteran Marvin Powell, the fourth
selection in the 1977 draft and an All-Pro offensive tackle who
played for the New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, a 1998 graduate of Southern, spent much of last season on
the Packers' practice squad and all of 1998 on the Jets' practice
squad. He recently played for the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, where
he started nine games and caught 18 passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, who need to replace former starter Mark Chmura,
already have rookie Bubba Franks, Tyrone Davis and Kaseem Sinceno
vying for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was released after he was charged with enticing and
sexually assaulting a 17-year-old baby sitter at a post-prom party.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Pennsylvania man was charged on Tuesday
with sending a threatening e-mail to a radio station about
Philadelphia 76ers star Allen Iverson and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Jay W. Charles, of Leola, Pa., was charged with one count of
transmitting interstate threatening communications.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, 54, sent an e-mail to WIP, a Philadelphia radio

</P>
<P>
   He sent the e-mail May 16 to WIP's Rhea Hughes. The message was
routed through a server in Atlanta and traced to Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Computer transmission connections often go through other
states, and in fact, Mr. Charles' name was on the e-mail he sent.
It was not sent anonymously,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Stiles,
who refused to disclose the specific contents of the message.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Charles could be sentenced to 5 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Charles did not return a message left at his home Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> House OK's 'Rosie the Riveter' Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''Rosie the Riveter,'' the famous figure in a
poster whose flexed muscle embodied the fighting spirit of millions
of America's working women during World War II, is a step closer to
having a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that would establish the Rosie the Riveter/World War II
Home Front National Historic Park in Richmond, Calif., cleared the
House on a voice vote Tuesday. A Senate hearing on a similar
measure is scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'Rosie the Riveter' national park would salute the role of
the home front during World War II, particularly recognizing the
significant changes in the lives of women and minorities that
occurred during that era,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who
sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We honor all of those who served in the war in uniform and in
coveralls, wearing helmets and bandannas, hoisting a machine gun or
a welder's torch.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond was chosen for the park because it played a key role in
the domestic war effort. Its four shipyards employed 90,000 people
and produced 747 ships. Another 55 war-related industries in the
city employed 10,000, providing everything from uniforms to
vegetable oil. Women held one in four jobs in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   A descendant of a real-life ''Rosie the Riveter'' welcomed the
recognition but said her mother's commitment during the war was not
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of that generation, most of the people didn't feel like they
did any more than they should have done. It sounds kind of corny,
but she did her part,'' said Vickie Jarvis of Clarksville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   While the character on the poster was symbolic of all the women
in war work, Jarvis' late mother, Rose Will Monroe, was chosen to
portray ''Rosie'' in two movie clips used to sell war bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, a riveter at a Michigan bomber plant, fit the image of
the widely distributed poster, which featured a woman in bandanna
and overalls beneath the slogan, ''We can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   ''She just happened to be in the right place at the right
time,'' said Jarvis, who is assisting former Sen. Bob Dole's effort
to build a World War II memorial on the National Mall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4063.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Broils Southeast Europe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Scorching heat claimed more lives,
rekindled fires and closed sweltering offices across southeast
Europe Tuesday, and forecasters said the heat wave will continue to
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, an unusual cold snap brought snow to Alpine
passes, forcing at least one to close to allow snowplows to clear
12 miles of road.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a different weather story in Greece, where
firefighters managed to extinguish more than 150 wildfires, but
were still battling to put out a blaze on the resort island of
Samos.
</P>
<P>
   A weeklong heat wave in the region was expected to peak
Wednesday with temperatures forecast to reach a high of 109. The
mercury was expected to drop into the high 70s or 80s by Friday,
the national weather service said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, the heat wave is blamed
for the death of Greek-American Louise-Marie Roussou, 62, who
suffered a heart attack. That brought to five the number of
heat-related deaths since the weekend, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's temperatures reached 106 in the shade in Nicosia.
There are fears a prolonged heat wave could trigger the same deadly
effects as August 1998 when a record hot spell claimed some 60
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, the government ordered state offices shut down for
two days this week after meteorologists predicted more intense heat
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the heat wave have surpassed 104 across much of
Turkey -- well above seasonal averages. At least 12 people have
died, including two on Tuesday, in heat-related incidents.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court rules that lower court judge can preside over case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals court has ruled that a dispute
between the states of Connecticut and New York over whether non-New
York lobstermen can harvest New York water around Fishers Island
does not have to be decided by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-to-1 decision
returned the dispute to U.S. District Judge Frederick J. Scullin
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had dismissed the case brought by Connecticut, saying
it had to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court, which is supposed
to resolve controversies between two or more states.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court in a Friday ruling decided that the
Connecticut lawsuit could be decided at a lower court level in part
because New York state was not directly sued, only officials
including its commissioner of environmental conservation and the
Fishers Island Lobstermen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''This suit does not implicate a core aspect of New York's
sovereignty and seeks no relief that would require the state of New
York to disburse funds from its treasury to the state of
Connecticut,'' the appeals court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Judge Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the case ''boils
down to one issue: whether Connecticut's suit is, in fact, a
controversy with New York. If so, it is subject to the Supreme
Court's exclusive jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal had originally
filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Albany, challenging a
New York law which prohibits non-New York lobstermen from
harvesting in New York waters around Fishers Island, off the
eastern tip of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was trying to keep the area rich with lobsters open
for Connecticut's $30 million lobstering.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut fishermen take nearly 2.9 million pounds of lobster
each year, much of it from the Fisher's Island area. While the
island is on the New York side of the states' boundary, it lies
closer to Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Survivors Mark Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- For five years, Kada
Hodzic has been recalling the moment when Serb soldiers snatched
her 18-year-old son from a crowd of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   She watched him walk away, called out to him, and finally,
quietly, wished him luck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can still feel him,'' Hodzic said. ''I still believe he will
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodzic, 42, and hundreds of other Muslim women who survived
Srebrenica chose to open old wounds Tuesday, traveling home with
2,000 other female survivors of the bloodiest massacre in Europe
since World War II. It is the first time Muslims could travel en
masse to Srebrenica, a region controlled by Bosnia's hard-line
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 8,000 Muslim men were believed killed when Serbs overran
the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, just before the end of the
Bosnian war in 1995. Some 4,000 bodies have been recovered from
mass graves, and thousands are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre is regarded as the turning point of the Bosnian war
-- which led to Western military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Even for this mission to pray in an enclave once designated a
U.N. safe area, Serb leaders insisted that the number of women be
kept low in exchange for guarantees of no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tell us we cannot live together again,'' Hodzic said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs from Srebrenica deny anything unusual happened there,
and regarded Tuesday's ceremony as a provocation. They had declined
to guarantee the security of a convoy with 5,000 women traveling to
the site, but agreed after negotiations with U.N. officials that
2,000 could come.
</P>
<P>
   While the convoy passed through Bratunac, a town near
Srebrenica, several hundred Serbs raised three fingers -- a Serb
victory sign -- screamed insults and yelled, ''Get out of here!''
NATO-led peacekeepers and local police along the road prevented
serious attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim survivors like Munira Subasic were angry at the
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to go there, especially if we meet the people
who expelled us and who took our children away,'' Subasic said.
''They still walk around freely. Whenever we visit the town, we see
those faces again.''
</P>
<P>
   The women decided to go anyway, submitting to searches before
boarding 46 buses to cross into the Serb-held part of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton peace accords that ended the
Bosnian war, applauded all those who traveled to Srebrenica for the
commemoration in the face of ''outrageous threats'' by Serbs as
well as the few ''brave'' Muslim families who have resettled in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Serbs who are there must make room for them,'' Holbrooke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke called for the ''butchers of Srebrenica'' to be
brought to justice, but also for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, his Bosnian
Croat colleague, Ante Jelavic and the U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia,
Thomas Miller, attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Islamic Community in Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric, led
the prayers and declared that Bosnia's Muslims would keep searching
for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a reminder,'' he said, ''that Srebrenica should never
be repeated again.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO helicopters and the U.S. Army patrolled near the boundary
line to help the women reach Potocari, a village near Srebrenica
where refugees sought shelter with Dutch U.N. troops after Serb
forces overran the city on July 11, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch could only watch, however, when soldiers loyal to
Bosnian Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic separated men from women and
children. The men were never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan acknowledged that the United
Nations' failure to help save thousands of Bosnian Muslims from a
Serb mass murder will forever haunt the world body.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said: ''We cannot undo this tragedy, but it is vitally
important that the right lessons be learned and applied in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic have been
charged with war crimes in connection with the Srebrenica deaths.
They are still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Hodzic belongs to a group trying to win approval from
international officials to build a monument in Potocari. The Serbs
object to the location.
</P>
<P>
   Her group is angry that the international community did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask myself: 'Couldn't this world do anything to prevent it?'
'' she said. ''Day and night -- especially at night.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: Pataki team took bribes, but governor didn't know  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Republican fund-raiser teamed with a top
campaign aide to Gov. George Pataki to solicit bribes from parents
of violent felons on the promise their children would win parole,
prosecutors charged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, New Jersey businessman Yung Soo Yoo, ''decided
to put up for sale your state criminal justice system,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Margaret Giordano said during opening statements at
Yoo's campaign corruption trial in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Yoo - once valued by the likes of former U.S.
Sens. Alfonse D'Amato and Bob Dole as a deft fund-raiser in the
Korean-American community - stems from an ongoing federal
investigation into allegations of influence peddling by Pataki
aides. Yoo has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   No one close to Pataki has been charged. But three parole
officials have been charged or convicted of lying to investigators,
and some of the governor's top aides have been called to testify
before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said in his opening statement that there is no evidence
the governor knew about the alleged scheme involving $36,000 in
contributions to ''Friends of Pataki'' in the mid-1990s. The
campaign aide linked to Yoo - Patrick Donahue - has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors allege Yoo and Donahue cut deals with three sets
of parents for Donahue to push for the release of their children
through a political ''pipeline'' connecting the governor's office
to the parole board. During one clandestine meeting, Donahue
promised an anxious mother, ''Give me three more months and I'll
make good,'' Giordano said.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano told the jury that a former parole official would
testify that two board members voted to release an armed robber and
gang member, John Kim, in 1996 after the official secretly informed
them: ''The governor's office wants this kid released.'' Records
show Kim's parents, who live in Queens, arranged for $7,000 in
contributions to the Pataki campaign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Nicholas DeFeis labeled the obstruction of
justice and political corruption charges against Yoo, 63, of Glen
Ridge, N.J., ''a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one promised anyone their kids would get out of jail in
exchange for contributions,'' he said. ''That did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Yoo faces up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Albany on Tuesday, Gov. Pataki was asked
about the claims that Donahue might somehow be involved with Yoo's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to say, other than anybody's entitled to
bring up anything. That's the nature of our process,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue's attorney did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The parole investigation began after a man went to police in
1997 complaining that Yoo and Donahue failed to deliver on their
guarantee to free his son for $20,000 in donations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, another parent, Incha Chung, testified Yoo assured
her a $10,000 contribution would buy freedom for her son once
Pataki was elected. She said the defendant was known as ''President
Yoo'' in Korean-American circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know something like that is possible in Korea,'' Chung
recalled saying to Yoo about the bribe. ''Is that do-able here?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it is possible in America by the governor's authority,''
she said Yoo replied.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's son is still serving time for attempted murder.

<HEADLINE> Man arrested seven times on drunk driving charges arrested again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARWICK, N.Y. (AP) - A 34-year-old man was charged July 4 with
driving while intoxicated, his eighth drunk driving arrest in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on July 4, Warwick police had taken MacLeay's keys away
from him. Still, police accuse him of getting behind the wheel of a
car drunk.
</P>
<P>
   That arrest came a week after he pleaded guilty in Broome County
Court to charges stemming from a 1999 drunken driving arrest. He
was released on his own recognizance pending an August sentencing
date; he faces one to three years in prison, Broome County
Assistant District Attorney Rita Basile said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does he have to kill someone before he gets it?'' asked Pat
Bodnar of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. ''I cannot believe this
person is still out there,'' she told the Middletown Times
Herald-Record.
</P>
<P>
   His criminal record includes two arrests 19 days apart in 1994
that led to a prison sentence of one to four years, according to
records. In all, he has done more than three years in state prison
and county jail, according to police and court records.
</P>
<P>
   ''You throw up your hands in frustration. State prison hasn't
done anything to help,'' Orange County District Attorney Frank
Phillips said. ''Most DWI offenders don't repeat. What allows the
system to work is the general obedience of the public to the
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   At his 1994 sentencing in Orange County Court, MacLeay said he
had sought treatment twice that year for alcoholism. He said he
suffered from cirrhosis of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am an alcoholic,'' he said. ''I'm trying, you know.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Navy Ships Vulnerable  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Navy ships do not have adequate
protection against deadly cruise missiles, the General Accounting
Office warns in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several ship classes, like frigates and fast combat support
ships, which distribute supplies, are still not well-protected,
according to a GAO assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited inadequate funding and maintenance. It
said the SLQ-32 electronic self-defense system, for example, is 30
years old and the Navy expects to have versions of it on its ships
for another 10-20 years. While some newer systems exist, the Navy
lacks the funds to replace the older units.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO used Navy estimates in its report, but auditors say that
even those estimates are optimistic and assume perfect weather, a
swift flow of supplies and top crew and equipment performance.
</P>
<P>
   The report also warned that many new cruise missile types will
reach operational status earlier than expected. Federal auditors
listed eight new missile classes made by foreign powers that will
become available by 2005, and two more coming after that. The
Russian Yakhont missile, for example, will have a range of
approximately 185 miles and travel at supersonic speeds.
</P>
<P>
   These new missiles are faster, stealthier, and can fly at lower
altitudes than the type that hit the Perry-class frigate USS Stark
in 1987, killing 37 sailors. That Iranian-fired missile was an
Exocet, made by France, which is expected to release a new version
of that has an increased range of 45 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Even the centerpiece of the Navy, the Nimitz-class nuclear
aircraft carriers, which carry over 5,000 sailors and aviators,
were given a ''low'' self-defense capability rating by the GAO. As
of late 1999, the carriers were far behind missile defense upgrade
schedules stated by the Navy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report decried a lack of comprehensive strategy for
dealing with cruise missile defense. Plans had been made to protect
a particular ship class, but there has been no baseline requirement
for defense across the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to the GAO report, the Department of Defense
agreed with the recommendation that a broad upgrade plan is needed,
and will instruct the Navy within 30 days to begin developing the
plan.

<HEADLINE> Daughter helps rescue Mom when kayaks overturn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFORT, N.Y. (AP) - The morning after running the
15-kilometer Utica Boilermaker Road Race, Elizabeth Daly may have
run the race of her mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Without shoes, Daly, 25, ran to the top of a steep bank on the
Mohawk River to signal for help. Her mother, Mary Ellen Daly, 55,
sat stranded and injured on a log in the rushing waters below after
both womens kayaks overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapids were very strong at that point. We both flipped
over, and my leg was squished between the kayak and a log,'' Mary
Ellen Daly told the Utica Observer-Dispatch after Monday's
accident.
</P>
<P>
   After freeing herself, Mary Ellen Daly waited on a log in the
river, because she felt it was too dangerous to cross the rivers
strong current with her injured leg.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had a hard time finding her because of the high bank
and thick brush. In a small boat, two village of Frankfort firemen
found Mary Ellen Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we saw her, she was sitting, clinging to an unstable log
in the rapids,'' said Philip Spaman, who said Daly was about 15
feet from the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Five police and fire departments from Herkimer County cut brush
with a small saw and axes and hoisted Mary Ellen Daly up the
20-foot bank in a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Her leg was treated for bruises.
</P>
<P>
   State spokesman Allen James said boaters should be aware that
waterways they have traveled before can change from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a different year with the rain weve had. The rapids we
have usually in May We may now have them,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Daly said she learned a lesson from the mishap: never
go alone and make sure you have your life preserver on.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Seeks Drug Benefit Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an attempt to reach compromise on a
politically charged issue, the chairman of a key Senate panel is
drafting a Medicare prescription drug plan that would share costs
between the government and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., planned
to circulate the proposal Wednesday in hopes of reaching a middle
ground between President Clinton's large new government entitlement
plan and the House GOP's bill based on subsidized private
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican sources, speaking Tuesday night on
condition of anonymity, said that under Roth's emerging plan the
government would share prescription drug expenses with Medicare
recipients above a certain deductible amount. One deductible amount
being discussed was $500, but that was subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   Above the deductible, the sources said, the government would pay
half of all drug costs up to another level -- one preliminary figure
was $3,500 -- and as much as 80 percent the costs above that.
</P>
<P>
   This would appeal to GOP conservatives who want a co-payment in
order to hold down the program's size and cost.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would use benefit managers, much like health insurers
do, to buy drugs and design services at lowest possible cost. It
would also provide subsidies for low-income people to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Roth envisions changes to the current Medicare Part
A and Part B programs as they affect hospitalization. Under current
law, Medicare recipients must pay a $776 deductible per
hospitalization and a $100 deductible for services under Part B.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth proposal would combine both deductibles into one -- the
amount hasn't yet been decided -- and people on Medicare would get a
full 365 days of hospitalization with no other co-payment.
Currently, there is a tiered system of co-payments for
hospitalization and no coverage after 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   There are a myriad of other details to be ironed out, including
the proposal's cost. The GOP budget resolution calls for a
prescription drug benefit costing $40 billion over five years if
Medicare is also reformed, but Roth's plan could cost much more,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the measure represents a glimmer of hope that compromise
could be reached despite the drug issue's potency as a campaign
issue. Clinton is adamantly against the House-passed private
insurance plan, and Republicans in Congress won't pass the
president's government-run plan costing $250 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it comes out of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan
fashion, it enhances the chances of something happening instead of
just statements by political parties,'' said Sen. John Breaux,
D-La.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Displays Players' Pride  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The All-Stars got to show a little fatherly pride
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   During the pregame ceremony, the players' sons and daughters
also were introduced to the sellout crowd at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was a first for baseball, and a big hit with the players, who
walked onto the field from center field and stood around the
diamond with their children to share the ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, who is back with the Braves after missing last
year while recuperating from cancer treatment, got a big cheer as
he carried his 2-year-old daughter, Andrianna, onto the field and
tipped his cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great,'' said Atlanta's Greg Maddux, who walked out with
his 3-year-old son, Chase, and 6-year-old daughter, Amanda.
</P>
<P>
   At Fenway Park last year, baseball honored the living members of
the sport's top 100 Players of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now Major League Baseball is looking to the future -- to the
new generation,'' said spokeswoman Katy Feeney, ''and the players
are carrying it out with their children.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COSTLY REPLACEMENTS: Replacing those injured players at
Tuesday's All-Star game cost owners an extra $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's because six of the seven players chosen as replacements
received bonus money for selection to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Jeffrey Hammonds gets $75,000; Arizona's Steve Finley
and the Chicago Cubs' Joe Girardi get $50,000 each; and Toronto's
Tony Batista, Baltimore's Mike Bordick and St. Louis' Edgar
Renteria get $25,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SMOLTZ ON AIR: John Smoltz, Atlanta's four-time All-Star who's
been sidelined for the season after elbow surgery in the spring,
was on the job doing pregame color for a local television station.
Smoltz also is appearing on ESPN's ''Baseball Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Smoltz visited the AL clubhouse to greet former
teammates Fred McGriff and Jermaine Dye. McGriff, Tampa Bay's only
representative, asked Smoltz how he was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can pitch right now,'' Smoltz said with a wry grin. The only
pitching Smoltz will be doing this season, however, is on the golf
course with a wedge. He's a 4-handicap and played last weekend in a
celebrity tournament at Lake Tahoe, Nev., finishing 6-over par for
the 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   JONES HOMECOMING: There's another Jones in the All-Star game,
and he's from Georgia, too.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Atlanta has heard of the two representing the
Braves, Chipper and Andruw. This one, Todd Jones, is on the AL team
and is the Detroit Tigers' only player on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who grew up in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta and went to
Osborne High School there, is making his first appearance in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great. I have a chance to rub elbows with the greatest
ball players of my era. I'm just in awe,'' said the right-hander,
who leads the AL in saves with 24 in 25 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not bad. I'm doing a lot better than last year,'' said Jones,
who converted 20 of his last 22 save chances a year ago and ended
with 30 saves. Dating back to 1997, Jones has converted 105 of his
last 116 save opportunities and has 113 career saves.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have about 45 friends and relatives in the stands,
including his mother, Lise, who works at the state Capitol, just
down the street from Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TIGER McGRIFF: Tampa Bay's lone representative, Fred McGriff,
the former Atlanta Brave, was asked if he could chose one person to
be other than himself, who would that be.
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, McGriff replied, with a wide smile and
tongue in cheek: ''Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Woods?
</P>
<P>
   ''Because he's able to crush the ball 300 yards down the middle
every time,'' said McGriff, who only took up the game while he was
with Atlanta in the mid 1990s, and considers himself ''a hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NO D-H, P-H: Seattle's Edgar Martinez is having such an
extraordinary season with the bat that AL manager Joe Torre
couldn't avoid picking the Mariners' designated hitter in a game
played in an NL park, which doesn't use the DH.
</P>
<P>
   Does Martinez, who has made one appearance in the field this
season -- at first base -- expect to play?
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I think I'll just pinch hit. I've been a DH the last five
years. I rarely see any action in the field anymore,'' said
Martinez, who came up to the majors as a third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, hitting .354 with 23 home runs and a league-high 87
RBIs, wasn't sure Torre would pick him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was hoping he'd pick me, but I know he had a very tough
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gutches, Burton To Wrestle for Spot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Les Gutches, a 1996 Olympian, will wrestle
Charles Burton in a best-of-three series July 27 in Fargo, N.D.,
for a spot on the U.S. team at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gutches, the national freestyle champion at 187.25 pounds,
missed the Olympic trials last month because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gutches' back problems date to 1996, when he had surgery on a
ruptured disc. The injury didn't stop him from winning the world
championship in 1997, and five straight national titles. He said
the layoff should help him this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, the longer it got delayed, the better,'' Gutches
said from Corvallis, Ore., where he was a standout at Oregon State.
''Having a month was great because I wanted the time to have
confidence in my health and training. Mentally, it's enough time to
get focused and ready for the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutches' last match was April 22, when he beat Burton at the
U.S. championships. He has defeated Burton the last four times they
have wrestled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think either of us will surprise the other,'' Gutches
said. ''But even though there's not going to be any surprises, he's
still got good techniques. He still has enough ability that he
doesn't necessarily need to surprise anyone.''

<HEADLINE> State gaming regulators voice concerns about sale of casino stakes  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) - State gaming regulators Tuesday put off deciding
a plan for two couples to sell their 40 percent Greektown Casino
stake, troubled by a provision that could let the founding
investors buy back their shares in the virtually finished gambling
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gatzaros, Dimitrios Papas and their wives are divesting
their interests in what would become Detroit's third temporary
casino, given a state-mandated investigation that uncovered
problems in their backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal argued Tuesday before the Michigan Gaming
Control Board, the couples would sell their 40 percent in effect to
the Upper Peninsula's Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians
for more than $200 million over 10 years. The 28,000-member tribe's
stake already is 50 percent. Local investors own the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: the proposed deal would leave the door open for the
couple to perhaps reinvest in the casino, something the regulatory
gaming board made clear it doesn't view favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am suspicious (about that provision), and I am concerned,''
Thomas Denomme, the board's chairman, told Thomas Kienbaum, an
attorney for the couples. ''My advice is you take it out and make
it a clean sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as it's in there, we're going to have a hard time''
signing off on the transfer, Denomme said.
</P>
<P>
   When Kienbaum countered that he found any suspicion unjustified,
Denomme said ''you could relieve any suspicion by removing some of
this language.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want a smooth-sailing transaction here, take it out,''
he said. ''Today's our day to tell you how we feel in plain
English, and that's how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Paula Blanchard called prospects that the
Gatzaroses and Papases reinvest in the casino ''a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The board recessed the matter until Aug. 7, largely to allow its
staff and financial advisers to scrutinize the proposal spanning
hundreds of pages submitted late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Neiswonger, a spokesman for the couples, said the
Gatzaroses and Papases agreed to sell their stakes to hasten the
casino's opening, believing they have a legal right to reinvest
later.
</P>
<P>
   ''They believed they'd eventually be granted a license,'' but
saw the licensing process plod along, Neiswonger said. ''They
believe what they propose would lead to the quickest opening of the
casino.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiswonger said the casino could open this fall ''if all went
smoothly'' with licensing, though Denomme said ''we should not be
held hostage'' by the clock or calendar.
</P>
<P>
   If the Papases and Gatzaroses don't sell their shares, they
could be found unsuitable by the gaming board and allowed to recoup
only what they originally invested. By selling now, they could get
as much as $228 million for the 40 percent stake, not including
interest.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's four-hour hearing, Denomme said the board has
let investors in casinos elsewhere in Michigan buy back their
stakes on rare occasions, typically amounting to 1 percent. With
the Greektown case, he said, ''our concern is it's a huge chunk of
ownership'' that could be repurchased by the divesting couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they persist in having that as part of the transfer
agreement, it's going to be very hard for me to approve that
proposal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Denomme said it was possible the Gatzaroses and Papases could
sue over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, Greektown's $150 million casino falls
farther behind its competitors, giving the local MotorCity and MGM
Grand gambling halls that opened last year more time to build
customer loyalty and costing city coffers additional tax revenue.

<HEADLINE> Dayne: Booster Same With Everyone  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne didn't
think twice when a school booster offered him huge discounts at his
shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody he knew got the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you went to the store and you were nobody, he gave you a
discount,'' Dayne, now a member of the New York Giants, said
Tuesday. ''If you weren't even a football player, period, he gave
you a discount. That's just the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne is one of 22 Wisconsin football and men's basketball
players identified in a report in the Wisconsin State Journal that
found they received discounts of 25 to 40 percent on purchases at
The Shoe Box and interest-free credit -- both possible NCAA rules
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The school also is probing allegations that some may have
exchanged university-issued shoes for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Association athletic director Vince Sweeney said players have
begun scheduling interviews with the school's compliance officer to
discuss their relationships with school booster Steve Schmitt, who
owns the store in Black Earth, about 20 miles west of Madison.
</P>
<P>
   He said the school hopes to make a report to the NCAA in several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among players listed in the report were Dayne, starting
quarterback Brooks Bollinger, and all five starters from the
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach several players Tuesday
were unsuccessful, and school spokesman Steve Malchow said most
involved wanted to talk to investigators before addressing the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt denied he gave players any special treatment, a claim
Dayne backed up.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne said he never ran up a line of credit at the store or
received any special treatment. He said he paid off his bills after
each visit or his uncle Rob Reid did it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you'd go back to the store, you'd pay it whenever you had
the money,'' Dayne said. ''Usually, he'd give you a little time
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Football coach Barry Alvarez, speaking Tuesday before a charity
golf event at the Greater Milwaukee Open, reiterated the
university's position that his players had no idea they were
receiving any discounts not available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really confident that my players didn't intentionally
break any rules,'' Alvarez said. ''I think they honestly felt they
were getting the same price anyone would.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said he hasn't been to The Shoe Box for at least six
years, but he was aware of the store's reputation for discounts. He
said his players are educated on possible NCAA violations, and any
rumors of abuses would have been investigated.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Mideast Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- In the same rustic setting where Israel
forged its first peace treaty with an Arab enemy, President Clinton
brought together Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in a renewed quest Tuesday for a lasting Mideast
peace. ''There is no guarantee of success, but not to try is to
guarantee failure,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting on compromise, Clinton said peace was a ''two-way
street'' and that ''both sides must find a way to resolve competing
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened the summit at the Camp David presidential
retreat, where in 1978 Israel and Egypt struck a peace deal, by
meeting separately with each leader. Arafat first, then Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the three leaders walked side-by-side down a winding
asphalt path to Laurel Cabin to begin the first three-way meeting
of the summit. Clinton put one arm around Barak, the other around
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a long table, they conversed for a half-hour, but not
alone. Clinton had eight assistants with him, Barak and Arafat,
five each.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good atmosphere; the discussion was serious,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   However, he declined to say whether either of the two leaders
acknowledged Clinton's spirited appeal for them to compromise on
core issues. Nor did Lockhart venture any assessment of whether
Clinton had made progress.
</P>
<P>
   There were two bilateral sessions Tuesday evening, the last one
between Clinton and Arafat ending shortly after 8 p.m., Lockhart
said. All three delegations, about 40 people, dined together at
round tables inside Laurel cabin, he said. Lockhart said he would
not release details about any after-dinner meetings until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pledged to each other we would answer no questions and
offer no comments, so I have to set a good example,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that were the only agreement reached so far, Clinton
said: ''That would be answering a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood appeared jovial as Arafat and Barak playfully sought to
give way to the other when entering the cabin. But the scene belied
the sharp differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat are far apart on all key issues that must be
settled to attain a comprehensive accord. Strenuous efforts and
dogged shuttling by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Dennis
B. Ross and other U.S. mediators have failed to make a serious
dent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two leaders have profound and wrenching questions, and
there can be no success without principled compromise,'' Clinton
said at the White House before boarding a helicopter to fly to Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the two sides to agreement will not be easy. The
central issues have defied solution in the seven years since Israel
agreed to begin turning over territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   They range from Jerusalem, part of which the Palestinians seek
but which Barak insists will never be divided, to claims of Arab
refugees to homes in Israel from which they say they were ousted at
Israel's founding a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said both Barak and Arafat have demonstrated they are
committed to reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both leaders feel the weight of history but both, I believe,
recognize this is a moment in history which they can seize,''
Clinton said. ''We have an opportunity to bring about a just and
enduring end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That is the key
to lasting peace in the entire Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that ''it will take patience, creativity
and courage'' to resolve the differences, but he said both Arafat
and Barak have those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do everything I can over the coming days to see that this
moment of promise is fulfilled,'' Clinton said. While no deadline
has been set, Clinton is scheduled to go to Japan on July 19 for an
eight-nation economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   There, an Israeli diplomat said, Clinton intends to appeal for
financial help to assist Palestinian refugees and to implement any
agreement he might strike with Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians' designated spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi,
continued to fire off strong criticism of Barak despite his offers
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel should not come to the negotiations with extremist
positions such as not returning to the 1967 boundaries or
maintaining sovereignty over Jerusalem or rejecting the return of
refugees,'' Ashrawi said at the National Press Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being extremely realistic, I don't expect to see a miraculous,
substantive breakthrough because the issues are complex. I have
read the Israel proposals and the gap is extremely wide. It will
take a great deal of effort to find areas of consensus, even
convergence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Israel and the United States appeared to be
making headway in a dispute over projected Israeli radar sales to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in contact, and I believe we are getting closer to a
solution of the problem,'' said Gadi Baltinasky, an Israeli
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, there were reports that Israel would propose selling
the advanced airborne warning system to China through a third
country in hopes of reducing U.S. pressure to drop the sale.

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Hilton sold to Los Angeles developer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Park Place Entertainment will sell the Las
Vegas Hilton hotel-casino to Los Angeles developer Ed Roski Jr.,
for $365 million, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This acquisition moves our company into the midlevel gaming
and hospitality arena,'' said Roski, co-owner of the Los Angeles
Lakers basketball team and the Los Angeles Kings hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   Roski's plans call for an increase in the Hilton's restaurants
and entertainment and retail offerings. Though he said it was too
early to discuss specifics, Roski said he will consider using the
property's 30-acre undeveloped site to add as many as 1,500 hotel
rooms and a timeshare development.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to add slot machines and remodel the casino and
hotel rooms and suites.
</P>
<P>
   The once-glamorous high-roller casino has struggled for several
years because, many believe, of its off-Strip location next to the
Convention Center and it competition from new resorts that cater to
high-end gamblers such as MGM Grand, Bellagio and the Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   The property is to remain open and employees can expect to keep
their positions, officials said. The sale also is not expected to
affect plans to extend the Bally's-MGM Grand monorail to the Las
Vegas Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place officials said the sale will allow the company to
consolidate its high-end gaming operations at Caesars Palace
hotel-casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan to use the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt and
repurchase the company's common stock,'' said Arthur Goldberg,
president and chief executive officer of Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can now focus 100 percent of our efforts in Las Vegas on
our four properties at the center of the Las Vegas Strip,'' he said
about Caesars, Paris, Bally's and the Flamingo Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Roski built the Silverton hotel-casino, then called
Boomtown, which he has operated since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Roski also developed the STAPLES Center in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the year. It
is subject to regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> White: Coach Search Began Last Week  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame began looking for a new
basketball coach before Matt Doherty even went to North Carolina to
interview for the job there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started about a week ago taking a good hard look at the
national marketplace, so to speak, to try to see who makes sense,''
Irish athletic director Kevin White said Tuesday. ''We've done an
awful lot of work to this point anticipating we might be in this
position.''
</P>
<P>
   White declined to name any prospective candidates, saying it
would ''marginalize the pool.'' But he said the coach would have to
be a good fit with the team and the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for somebody that's had great programatic
success at the highest level, preferably somebody that's been in a
high-profile situation, a high-end conference or a major situation.
And somebody that will represent the values and characteristics of
the University of Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish players said they were disappointed, but understood.
</P>
<P>
   ''People close to coach Doherty understand what went on with the
decision and the things that pulled him to North Carolina. We
understand why he made the decision,'' forward Troy Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, a first-team All-American and Big East player of the
year as a sophomore last season, decided in the spring to skip the
NBA draft in part because of Doherty, who led the Irish to a 22-15
record and a second-place finish in the NIT in his first season.
But Murphy said he doesn't regret his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I think I have a lot of things I can get better
on,'' he said. ''There are a lot of what ifs in everything. It's a
decision I made and a decision I have to live with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other players said they also understood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was his dream to go coach at his alma mater. You've got to
follow your dreams, try to achieve them. He got his chance to go do
that,'' forward Harold Swanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   White plans to start interviewing prospects in the next three to
five days, saying it was crucial to get someone in quickly because
of recruiting and for the sake of the players.
</P>
<P>
   White learned of Doherty's decision at 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday, and
Doherty and White met with the players in a dorm room an hour
later. Players said Doherty cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach was very emotional. We just kind of took it all in and
really didn't have any comments,'' guard Matt Carroll said. ''He
just told us it was such a hard decision to make. He said it was
just an opportunity he just couldn't pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   White said the Notre Dame job also will be a tough one to pass
up, comparing the job to coaching at places such as Duke and
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our commitment hasn't changed. Our commitment is to have a top
five program, and I believe we can have that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty was a Kansas assistant when he signed a five-year deal
with Notre Dame in March 1999. But he had a clause in his contract
regarding North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect that when Matt came to Notre Dame he hoped that at
some point he'd have an opportunity to have a conversation with
North Carolina, maybe five or eight or 10 years down the road. I
don't think he ever expected it would occur after year one.''

<HEADLINE> Eric Swann Released by Cardinals  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Eric Swann, a defensive tackle who once
complained that the Arizona Cardinals got a Rolls Royce for the
price of a Cadillac, was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Swann requested the release months ago, and the Cardinals hired
his replacement on June 9. But they avoided cutting loose their
6-foot-5, 315-pound defensive star until a week before training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The move freed up $3.5 million that general manager Bob Ferguson
will use to try to sign first-round draft pick Thomas Jones before
camp begins July 21. Jones, a running back from Virginia, is the
last unsigned player of the eight the Cardinals drafted in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now was the proper time to make this decision in the best
interest of both parties,'' Ferguson said. ''From Eric's
standpoint, he had requested his release. From the team's
standpoint, it was inevitable his status would become a salary-cap
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann was jubilant about the news, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better late than never,'' agent Steve Zucker said. ''We
would have liked it a month ago, but it's fine that it happened
now. At least the camps haven't opened yet. He knew he was going to
be released, but until it happened there was a lot of frustration.
Now he can get on with his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teams began calling soon after the announcement, and Swann
compiled a short list of preferred franchises. His initial plan was
to visit the Chicago Bears and Carolina Panthers, Zucker said.
Other teams that have shown interest in the two-time Pro Bowl pick
are Baltimore, Denver and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, 29, played his first nine seasons with the Cardinals, who
drafted him No. 6 in 1991 off a minor league team. He was the first
first-round pick without college experience since the Los Angeles
Rams chose Emil Sitko in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a gamble worth taking because of Swann's size and
speed, but nobody foresaw the arthritic knees that gradually eroded
his value to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The first injury occurred at Swann's first minicamp. It was a
minor arthroscopic procedure on his left knee, but before the 1991
training camp ended he had fluid drained once and had another
arthroscopic surgery to clean up debris.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his inexperience, Swann was never bashful about
assessing his talent. He made the car comparison in 1992, saying he
was underpaid with a $4 million, five-year contract, and in 1998 he
was given a $25 million, four-year deal which would have required
the Cardinals to pay him $5 million this season and again in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   He also had the last two of his seven knee surgeries in October
and December 1998, and has not started a game since Oct. 4, 1998.
Swann was sidelined for 18 of 34 games the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals prepared for his departure by bringing in Tony
McCoy, a free agent from Indianapolis, to play Swann's right tackle
spot at $1 million a season for two years.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Tourists, Gov't Hostages Freed  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Indigenous Fijian rebels freed nine of their
27 government captives Wednesday, moving Fiji closer to the end of
a near two-month crisis. Other insurgents seized a beach resort
where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed, later releasing its 40
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The nine government hostages were turned over to the Red Cross
as rebels appeared trying to ease a crisis that began May 19 when
they stormed Parliament and took several dozen hostages, including
then-Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross doctor Bhagat Ram said the nine freed hostages were
unharmed. They included all the ethnic Indian parliamentarians
except for the deposed prime minister and his son. The other
remaining hostages are all ethnic Fijian legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked happy to get out of that (Parliament) complex,''
Ram said. ''They conversed very well and they have gone to their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the government captives came hours after an
unrelated rebel group seized a posh resort on Turtle Island over
what they said was a land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw a crisis in Fiji and we're thinking this is a good
time,'' rebel Mavi Ratulevu said.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 guests, including 15 Americans, were later placed on a
cruise ship heading to Fiji's main island, Viti Levu. The resort's
owner, American Richard Evanson, was still being held.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to keep an eye on him for a while,'' Ratulevu
said. He added the group might be occupying the island for a week,
unless a satisfactory resolution could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists included 19 Australians, four New Zealanders and
two Britons. There was a total of 11 children among them.
</P>
<P>
   The Turtle Island resort, where some cottages rent for $1,000 a
night, was the site of the 1949 filming of ''The Blue Lagoon'' and
parts of the 1980 Brooke Shields remake.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsible for the takeover were believed to be from a
tribe in the Yawawa islets off the northwest coast of Viti Levu.
They have been involved for years in a dispute over who owns Turtle
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's developments came three days after the rebels, led
by former businessman George Speight, signed an agreement with
Fiji's military government to end the hostage crisis. Under the
agreement, Speight was supposed to release all his hostages
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what the early release signified.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's spokesman, Jo Nata, said the hostages were released
because ''we felt -- apart from being a gesture of good will -- it is
a consideration of security. If we released them all at once it
could cause a stampede outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''They also had asked us if and when they were released if we
could do it at night to avoid the humiliation of being liberated in
front of our supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aull, the wife of freed Parliamentarian Bill Aull, said his
release was ''unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time,'' she said. ''God was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aull said her husband appeared to be unhurt, but he did not
want to talk about his ordeal. ''We still have hostages inside,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the nation's large ethnic
Indian minority has too much power. They demanded that the
country's multiracial constitution be scrapped and that Chaudhry,
Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, be deposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the seizure of the hostages, Speight
supporters looted and burned ethnic Indian homes and businesses,
and many Indians made plans to flee the country. The violence led
Fiji's military to take control and declare martial law.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after weeks of negotiations, military leaders and
Speight reached the deal to free the hostages in exchange for the
granting of many of Speight's demands, including a new government
and a new constitution curtailing Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Speight may end up with a
Cabinet post, perhaps even the prime minister's job. He told a news
conference that such a move would be a perfect end for the coup.
</P>
<P>
   But unrest has persisted despite the deal. Speight supporters
have engaged in widespread civil disturbances across the nation,
occupying police stations and blockading roads in an apparent
effort to wring more concessions from the military regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest unrest, Speight supporters occupied the police
station at Lambasa, on the island of Vanua Levu. Shots were fired
during the raid and at least two people received minor injuries, a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A large crowd of Speight supporters on Wednesday was also
gathering near Suva's airport, currently the only regular method of
transit into and out of the city since rebel supporters set up
makeshift checkpoints on major roads last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Turtle Island, members of the rebel group said they support
Speight. But they could be claiming rebel affiliation to take
advantage of the amnesty being offered for political crimes related
to the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The resort's manager, Robert Betsford, told the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. by telephone that the rebels had demand to speak
to Evanson about ownership of the island and the future of the
resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to show their support for George Speight's
movement and they did that by making their presence felt here,''
Betsford said. ''They then wanted to sit down and talk to Richard
about the island's ownership. Richard has been here for 28 years
and has never had someone make such a claim before.''
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians, whose ancestors were brought to the islands by
English colonialists over a century ago to work in the rich sugar
cane fields, make up 44 percent of the nation's 812,000 people.
Many of the indigenous Fijians who comprise 51 percent of the
population resent their economic clout.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's tourist industry has been devastated by the government
crisis, with some of the hundreds of resort hotels scattered across
dozens of islands reporting occupancy rates as low as 10 percent.
However, around 1,000 Americans a week have been among tourists
still coming into Fiji.

<HEADLINE> Jury seated in trial over Disney sports complex  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - A jury was seated Tuesday in a civil case
pitting the Walt Disney Co. against a New York businessman who is
accusing the company of stealing his idea for the Wide World of
Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of three men and three women were seated for the trial,
which is expected to last four weeks. Opening arguments were
scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the witness list were several top Disney
executives, including chairman and CEO Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   However, Disney attorneys and the plaintiffs' lawyers, including
Johnnie Cochran Jr., were holding mediation talks late Tuesday that
could put off a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs Nicholas Stracick, of Buffalo, N.Y., and Edward
Russell, of Fonthill, Ontario, claim Disney used their ''trade
secrets'' to develop the sports complex after they invested more
than $100,000 and three years designing the project.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks more than $1 billion in damages,
accuses Disney of theft, breach of contract, misappropriation of
trade secrets and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ideas he had were taken and appropriated by this giant,''
Cochran said. ''It's substantial ... They're making lot of money
off this idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney says the plaintiffs' idea was not unique and that it had
been planning a sports complex years before Stracick pitched his
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is full of Mr. Stracick's idea,'' Disney attorney
David Evans said. ''He doesn't own the idea. The notion of putting
together sports facilities with athletic events has been around
since the days of the ancient Greeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stracick, a former professional baseball umpire, teamed with
Russell in the late 1980s to form a Tampa-based company called All
Pro Sports Camps Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The two men presented their idea to Disney officials in
September 1986, submitting a written proposal for a multi-sport
theme park based at Walt Disney World, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Disney officials expressed interest in the concept and
even talked about forming a joint venture with All Pro, according
to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   During the next three years, the two sides met 50 times and
exchanged more than 500 phone calls, said Willie Gary, co-counsel
for the plaintiffs. All Pro invested more than $100,000 in a scale
model of the sports complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney opened its Wide World of Sports complex in 1997, the same
year the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Disney had plans to develop similar sporting
facilities dating back to the 1960s. Disney used its own architects
and sports experts to design and develop the complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The complex hosts a variety of professional and amateur sporting
events, including spring training for the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ''They stole the concept of the all pro sports complex,'' said
Stracick, 65. ''We're finally getting our day in court.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - A woman was found dead in her home
after an early morning fire Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police released few details, but said the fire and death
appeared suspicious, according to the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
An autopsy is planned for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Patzelt, 46, of the town of Plattsburgh was found dead
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Capt. Peter Person said Patzelts husband, Robert
Patzelt, reported that he awoke about 2 a.m. and found a fire
burning inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   He told police he tried to get his wife out of the home, but
could not, Person said. Patzelt then ran across the street to
another home to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Person said that evidence inside the home where the body was
found raised some questions, but he would not elaborate on the
evidence or whether they have any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton County Coroner David Donah said the body was burned, but
there did not appear to be any other noticeable injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Patzelt, 51, was treated for minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> 24-Year-Old Wins 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A 24-year-old graduate of the University of
Michigan became the sixth -- and youngest -- million-dollar winner on
ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   David Goodman, who lives in Olney, Md. and works for a Virginia
consulting firm, accepted the check from Regis Philbin after
successfully identifying Peru as the country where the children's
book character Paddington Bear is from.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman raced through 14 questions without using any of his
three lifelines -- then used them all on the last query.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately eliminated two wrong answers, and was left with
the choice of Peru and Iceland. Goodman polled the audience, and
more than half guessed Peru. That was his hunch, but he confirmed
it by phoning a former Michigan classmate for help.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman was confident he could succeed on the show, saying he
had done very well in recent months playing the ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' computer game at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prepared for this show by basically reading everything I
could get my hands on since I was three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second million-dollar winner in a week on the ABC
show. The British show upon which ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
is based has never had a big winner in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman rejected a suggestion that ABC was subtly encouraging
winners to draw more attention to its show, overshadowed somewhat
lately by CBS' hit reality series, ''Survivor.'' Goodman said the
questions he received happened to coincide with subject matters
where he had an interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they were necessarily any easier,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Shot Doctor Stabbed in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A doctor who was once shot by
a suspected anti-abortion activist was wounded in his office
Tuesday by a knife-wielding attacker, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A hooded assailant stabbed abortion provider Garson Romalis once
in his lower back, but the wound was not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant escaped and no suspects had been arrested as of
late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they didn't know of a motive for the attack but
indicated it might have been linked to Romalis's practice, warning
other doctors who perform abortions in the Vancouver area to be
careful.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear that this doctor was targeted,'' said
Vancouver police Constable Anne Drennan. ''We ask that all other
abortion services providers go on high alert.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the doctor first believed he had been punched. He began
to follow the attacker before realizing he was bleeding and sought
help.
</P>
<P>
   She described the suspect a man about 20 years old with a dark
complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to identify Romalis as the victim, but office
workers in the building confirmed his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart goes out to Mr. Romalis's family,'' said Attorney
General Andrew Petter.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis, who was shot in the leg at his home in 1994, was the
first of five doctors in Canada and the northeastern United States
to be hit by sniper's bullets over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett Slepian of Amherst, N.Y., was the only fatality. He was
killed in 1998 by a bullet fired through his kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   The other three were shot in Buffalo, N.Y., Winnipeg, Manitoba,
and Ancaster, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   James Kopp, an American anti-abortion activist, was charged in
the Slepian killing but remains at large. The FBI has said there is
little doubt the same man pulled the trigger in each attack.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the abortion debate reacted to Tuesday's stabbing
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we have an abortion doctor being targeted in the most
vile, violent way by a fanatic and it's extremely upsetting,'' said
Joyce Arthur, a spokeswoman for the Pro-Choice Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who does this is not part of the pro-life movement,''
said Monica Roddis, executive director of Pro-Life Society of
British Columbia. We absolutely disassociate ourselves entirely
from anyone who does this kind of thing.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators Re-Enact Erving Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- Divers trying to re-enact the death of Cory
Erving submerged his car Tuesday in the retention pond where his
body was found in the vehicle last week.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find out how the son of Julius Erving died,
divers went down with the black Volkswagen Passat in the pond near
their exclusive neighborhood, Orlando television station WKMG
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office confirmed
that divers submerged the car, but wouldn't comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crime scene investigators and a representative of the
(Florida) Highway Patrol are continuing the investigation,'' said
Sheriff's Lt. Ed Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Final preparations were made for Wednesday's memorial service,
expected to be attended by Bill Cosby, singer Patti LaBelle and
Larry Bird -- friends of Julius Erving, a member of the basketball
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Eulogies were expected from the family's three remaining
children, three of Cory's friends and from Stedman Graham, a close
friend of the Ervings and Oprah Winfrey's longtime boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Cory, 19, was found dead in his car last Thursday, more than a
month after a search was launched to find him. He was last seen
alive on May 28 at a bakery where was buying bread for the family's
Memorial Day cookout.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Don Eslinger said the teen-ager's death was likely
accidental, although investigators haven't ruled anything out.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Clinton Disbarment  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An appointed judge with barely a
month's experience decided Tuesday to preside over a lawsuit that
could cost President Clinton his Arkansas law license.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski County Circuit Judge Leon Johnson was the fifth judge to
whom the case fell after four others stepped aside, citing the
appearance of conflicts of interest because of ties to Clinton, a
former Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see anything hindering me from taking this case,''
Johnson told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he wouldn't talk about the details of the case
and had not decided on a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, appointed last month to fill a court vacancy through
the end of the year, was assigned the case July 5 and had been
considering whether to keep it. The judge called the clerk's office
Tuesday morning and said he would accept the case, said Sherry
Bruno, a supervisor in the office.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct is
suing to disbar Clinton because of his misleading testimony in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment case about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is based on complaints filed by U.S. District Judge
Susan Webber Wright, who cited Clinton for contempt in the Jones
case, and by the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the Arkansas committee is acting too harshly
and that his lawyers will fight -- although he will not get involved
personally in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lawyer David Kendall was in China on Tuesday and
unavailable for comment, a secretary said. A legal associate did
not immediately return a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based foundation seeking to disbar Clinton praised
Johnson's decision to accept the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a sense that he wouldn't have taken the case if it
didn't feel it could be concluded by the end of the year, which is
the end of his term,'' said foundation president Matthew Glavin.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Johnson likely will be appealed to the Arkansas
Supreme Court, meaning a final decision may not come until after
Clinton and the judge have left office.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's case continues into 2001, it would be transferred
to Johnson's elected successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although appointed June 2 by Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee,
Johnson voted just 10 days earlier in the Democratic primary
election, according to state voting records. He also voted in the
1998 Democratic primary runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's decision to hear the case clears the last procedural
hurdle for the legal process to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The president has 30 days from the time he was served with the
lawsuit to file a response, which could come by the end of the
month. Either side could then follow with more filings.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's Committee on Professional Conduct sued to
disbar Clinton on June 30.

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Indicted on Tax Evasion  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE KARNOWSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- NBA referee Ken Mauer was indicted Tuesday on
federal tax evasion charges, becoming the latest league official
charged in an airline ticket scam.
</P>
<P>
   Mauer, 45, was charged with four counts of tax evasion and one
of obstructing and impeding the administration of federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges Mauer received ''substantial taxable
income'' from 1989 through 1994 but failed to declare it. The
indictment did not specify how much income he failed to report or
how much he might owe in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen other referees have faced similar charges. Like
them, Mauer was allegedly reimbursed for first-class airline
tickets, but purchased less-expensive tickets and pocketed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Under their union contract, referees were allowed to downgrade
their first-class tickets to coach and keep the difference as a way
of supplementing their incomes. But the Internal Revenue Service
required them to report the excess reimbursements as income on
their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Mauer did not immediately return a message left on his answering
machine. Dianna Case, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office,
said she didn't know the name of his lawyer and that the Justice
Department attorneys handling the case left for Washington shortly
after the indictment was handed up Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 other NBA officials pleaded guilty earlier. Most
were fined a few thousand dollars, put on probation, and ordered to
pay their back taxes. Some also had to serve short periods of home
detention. The NBA reinstated several of them.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges Mauer filed false income tax returns for
1989 through 1994 that either underreported his income or
overstated his business expenses. It said he also obtained receipts
for flights he did not take, or that showed costs more than he
incurred.
</P>
<P>
   It also said Mauer submitted false airline ticket receipts to
the NBA, causing the league to file W-2 forms that understated his
income, and gave false information to his tax preparer.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges Mauer made false statements to an
IRA agent in 1994, during an audit of his 1991 and 1992 tax
returns, to conceal his true income.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Stabbed in Canada Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A doctor who was once shot by
a suspected anti-abortion activist was wounded in his office
Tuesday by a knife-wielding attacker, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A hooded assailant stabbed abortion provider Garson Romalis once
in his lower back, but the wound was not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant escaped and no suspects had been arrested as of
late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they didn't know of a motive for the attack but
indicated it might have been linked to Romalis's practice, warning
other doctors who perform abortions in the Vancouver area to be
careful.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear that this doctor was targeted,'' said
Vancouver police Constable Anne Drennan. ''We ask that all other
abortion services providers go on high alert.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the doctor first believed he had been punched. He began
to follow the attacker before realizing he was bleeding and sought
help.
</P>
<P>
   She described the suspect a man about 20 years old with a dark
complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to identify Romalis as the victim, but office
workers in the building confirmed his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart goes out to Mr. Romalis's family,'' said Attorney
General Andrew Petter.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis, who was shot in the leg at his home in 1994, was the
first of five doctors in Canada and the northeastern United States
to be hit by sniper's bullets over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett Slepian of Amherst, N.Y., was the only fatality. He was
killed in 1998 by a bullet fired through his kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   The other three were shot in Buffalo, N.Y., Winnipeg, Manitoba,
and Ancaster, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   James Kopp, an American anti-abortion activist, was charged in
the Slepian killing but remains at large. The FBI has said there is
little doubt the same man pulled the trigger in each attack.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the abortion debate reacted to Tuesday's stabbing
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we have an abortion doctor being targeted in the most
vile, violent way by a fanatic and it's extremely upsetting,'' said
Joyce Arthur, a spokeswoman for the Pro-Choice Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who does this is not part of the pro-life movement,''
said Monica Roddis, executive director of Pro-Life Society of
British Columbia. We absolutely disassociate ourselves entirely
from anyone who does this kind of thing.''

<HEADLINE> All-Star Game Tied After 3 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones became only the third player in 31
years to homer during in an All-Star game in his home ballpark,
leaving the National and American leagues tied 1-1 after three
innings Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Kevin Brown put the NL ahead with a bases-loaded walk to
Carl Everett in the top of the third, Jones connected for an
opposite-field homer to left-center in the bottom half, earning a
huge ovation from the Atlanta Braves' fans at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron, the former Brave who threw out the first pitch
Tuesday night, homered in 1972 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium,
which stood adjacent to Turner Field and is now a parking lot.
Sandy Alomar Jr. homered for Cleveland three years ago at Jacobs
Field. In all, Jones became the 10th player to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two innings, pitching dominated, with David Wells
holding the NL to two hits, while Randy Johnson and Danny Graves
allowed one hit each to the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who walked just 27 in 125 innings during the first half
of the season, walked three in his inning, throwing 33 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar walked with one out and Derek Jeter singled.
Yankees teammate Bernie Williams hit a fielder's choice-grounder to
third and Oakland's Jason Giambi walked, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Brown then fell behind Everett 3-0 in the count and threw a pair
of pitches that Everett missed. After a foul, Everett took a high
pitch for ball four.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez then flied out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' homer, which came on a 2-0 pitch, was his first in
All-Star play.
</P>
<P>
   Missing seven of the 16 starters elected by fans last week, the
All-Star game began on a muggy night with less anticipation that
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Mike Piazza and Barry Bonds were
missing from the National League lineup, while Cal Ripken, Alex
Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez were injured in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro Martinez, who struck out five batters in the first two
innings of last year's game at Fenway Park, also was out.
</P>
<P>
   With a temperature of 86 degrees and humidity at 72 percent when
the first pitch was thrown at 8:45 p.m., a sellout crowd at Turner
Field got to see a new twist: the All-Stars taking their children
on the field with them during pregame introductions. Some of the
kids hit the field when four F-14 fighter jets roared over the
ballpark following the national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga got the biggest cheer, a
30-second standing ovation. After missing all of 1999 while
battling cancer, Galarraga returned this season and hit .294 in the
first half with 20 homers and 62 RBIs, earning an All-Star berth.
</P>
<P>
   Among those watching from the commissioner's box next to the NL
dugout was former President Jimmy Carter; Time Warner vice chairman
Ted Turner; Frank Torre, brother of AL manager Joe Torre; and
former commissioner Fay Vincent, who was ousted by owners in 1992.

Clinton Urges Mideast Compromise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton brought together Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a renewed quest today for a
lasting Mideast peace. Insisting on compromise, Clinton said peace was a
''two-way street'' and that ''both sides must find a way to resolve competing
claims.'' Clinton opened the summit at the Camp David presidential retreat,
where in 1978 Israel and Egypt struck a peace deal, by meeting separately with
each leader. Arafat first, then Barak.

Police Brace for Belfast March
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- Thousands of hard-line Protestants lit towering
bonfires at midnight Wednesday to celebrate a victory from centuries past, but
many worried whether they would win this month's battle to keep marching past
Catholic areas. Rowdy fife and drum bands entertained heavily drinking crowds
before Wednesday's mass Orange Order parades across Northern Ireland. Police
said they hoped the turmoil would subside once the Orangemen march through
Belfast and more than a dozen other towns Wednesday for the Twelfth, a
profoundly divisive holiday that commemorates the 1690 victory of Protestant
William of Orange over his Catholic foe, James II.

<HEADLINE> Negotiator Implicated in Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Bosnia's U.N. ambassador implicated top
international negotiator Carl Bildt on Tuesday in the failure to
defend the U.N. ''safe haven'' of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt countered that Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey's recollection
of their meeting on July 11, 1995, as Srebrenica was falling was
wrong. And he reiterated that the U.N. Security Council was
primarily to blame for not providing enough troops to defend the
enclave in eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on that fateful July 11, just a few months before the
end of the 3 &AMP;frac12;-year Bosnian war, Bosnian Serb forces overran
Srebrenica, which was designated a U.N.-protected zone. When the
slaughter was finished, as many as 8,000 men and boys older than 14
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   At a symposium Tuesday to mark the anniversary and discuss
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's 155-page report on the massacre
issued in November, Sacirbey for the first time described what he
called ''a reprehensible meeting'' with Bildt as the Bosnian Serbs
were overrunning Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey, who at the time was Bosnia's foreign minister,
recalled that Bildt told him on July 11 there were no plans to
defend or liberate Srebrenica or defend Zepa. The smaller,
less-protected U.N. ''safe haven'' fell to the Serbs days later.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, who wrote about a meeting with Sacirbey in his book about
Bosnia, said in a telephone interview from Sweden that Sacirbey's
''rather sensational information'' is ''somewhat strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And I can say it's wrong because I was there ... If any of
this were remotely true, it would have been well-known and
documented by now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey told the symposium that a few days before the Bosnian
Serbs attacked Srebrenica, Bildt met Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and Bosnian Serb military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic in
Belgrade. At the time, Bildt was representing the ''Contact Group''
that oversees the Balkans: the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what happened at that meeting,'' Sacirbey said,
but he speculated that the prospect of imminent attacks on
Srebrenica and Zepa were mentioned and Bildt didn't object, which
was viewed as a green light.''
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, who is now Annan's Balkans envoy, said his meeting in
Belgrade dealt almost entirely with a possible cease-fire.
Srebrenica was mentioned only in a discussion about trying to get
supplies to the beleaguered enclaves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key problem with Srebrenica was that the members of the
Security Council never gave enough troops to even have the
possibility of defending Srebrenica,'' he said. ''If the U.N. had
been given an army on the ground by its member states, everything
would have been different. But the U.N. was given words, and they
didn't count for much in the brutality of the Bosnian war.''
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica's inhabitants believed that the presence of 150 Dutch
U.N. peacekeepers and the might of NATO airpower would ensure their
safety. But NATO never responded to repeated Dutch requests for
airstrikes, and the peacekeepers failed to prevent the Serb
massacres.

<HEADLINE> Congress May Receive Pay Raise  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no discussion, a House subcommittee
opened the door late Tuesday to giving members of Congress their
latest cost-of-living pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers' current $141,300 salaries would be raised by 2.7
percent, or $3,800, and take effect next January, officials said.
It would be their third increase in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward approving the increase came as a
subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee approved a $29.1
billion measure financing the Treasury Department and other
agencies for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains no language addressing the pay raise. But
under a 1989 law, lawmakers get an automatic annual increase unless
they decide to block it, and the Treasury bill is the traditional
vehicle for such language.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is based on a formula designed to hold the boost
below the inflation rate and any increase civil servants will
receive. The bill would also allow federal workers to receive the
3.7 percent pay raise next year that President Clinton has
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents expect to force election-year votes challenging the
raise for lawmakers. But the proposal has a good chance to survive
because of the strong economy, healthy budget surpluses and last
month's agreement between both parties' leaders not to attack each
others' incumbents for supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bible says the worker is worthy of his hire,'' House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters earlier in the
day. ''These members of Congress on both sides of the aisle work
very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., said he supports the increase and expects the Senate to
approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The same spending bill would also require Hillary Rodham Clinton
to submit monthly reports to the House Appropriations Committee
detailing the travel expenses of her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For months, some Republicans have been accusing her of
insufficiently reimbursing the Treasury for her flights to and from
New York, which she takes on military aircraft on the Secret
Service's advice.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1999 through last May, it has cost an estimated
$698,000 for her flights, of which she has paid the government
$112,200, according to figures released by Appropriations Committee
Republicans. The numbers were based on White House data.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said that as with all recent
White House occupants, Clinton's reimbursements have been for the
political portion of her travels and are based on the price of
first-class passenger tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also impose stricter reporting requirements
for all House and Senate candidates using federal aircraft,
beginning in the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would:
</P>
<P>
   --Roll back a 0.5 percent increase in federal workers'
contributions to their retirements enacted in 1997, at a cost of
$460 million. That provision, proposed by Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,
was approved 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   --Block U.S. sales of diamonds used to finance Sierra Leone
rebels, who have killed and terrorized thousands of civilians. The
language by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., was approved by voice vote.

<HEADLINE> Troop Increase for S. Leone Opposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States said Tuesday it opposed
a quick strengthening of the beleaguered U.N. peacekeeping force in
Sierra Leone, an indication that negotiations on a proposed
increase in the force could drag on for some time, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recommended increasing the
13,000-strong U.N. mission by another 3,500 troops to help the
Sierra Leone government regain authority over territory under
control of the rebel Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500 U.N. peacekeepers, many of them poorly trained
and under-equipped, were taken hostage by the Revolutionary United
Front in May. The United Nations since then has been working to
bolster troop strength and improve the force's ability to deter
rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In consultations Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said
Washington couldn't sign off on another costly increase in the
force size without more details from the U.N. peacekeeping
department on what a strengthened U.N. force would be asked to do.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiations on the force's mandate continue, the United
States is moving ahead with another initiative to create an
internationally sanctioned tribunal to prosecute rebel leader Foday
Sankoh and his troops.

   SEVERNA PARK, Md. (AP) -- An explosion caused by a leaking
propane tank leveled a house Tuesday night, killing one woman and
severely burning her husband and son.
</P>
<P>
   ''The house is flattened, it's gone, there's nothing left,''
said neighbor Mike Oler, who lives four houses down from the home.

<HEADLINE> Prisoners Rebell in Southern Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The 800 inmates of a southern
Brazil prison rebelled against severe overcrowding Tuesday, taking
17 hostages and demanding the transfer of out-of-state inmates,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners using wooden sticks overpowered guards from the roof
at the Ahu Provisional Prison in Curitiba, 420 miles southwest of
Rio, and set fire to the prison's main building, Parana state
police Maj. Nemesio Xavier Franca said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the inmates released seven hostages -- three
professors, two pastors, a dentist and a security guard. Ten guards
remained hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations will resume Wednesday, Franca said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison overcrowding is a common motive for rebellions in Brazil.
The Ahu prison is designed to hold 300 inmates.

Clinton Urges Compromise in Mideast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton brought together Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a renewed quest today for a
lasting Mideast peace. Insisting on compromise, Clinton said peace was a
''two-way street'' and that ''both sides must find a way to resolve competing
claims.'' Clinton opened the summit at the Camp David presidential retreat,
where in 1978 Israel and Egypt struck a peace deal, by meeting separately with
each leader. Arafat first, then Barak.

Congress May Receive Pay Raise

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no discussion, a House subcommittee opened the door
late Tuesday to giving members of Congress their latest cost-of-living pay
raise. Lawmakers' current $141,300 salaries would be raised by 2.7 percent, or
$3,800, and take effect next January, officials said. It would be their third
increase in four years. The first step toward approving the increase came as a
subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee approved a $29.1 billion
measure financing the Treasury Department and other agencies for the coming
fiscal year.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Bosnia's U.N. ambassador implicated top international

Srebrenica. Bildt countered that Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey's recollection of
their meeting on July 11, 1995, as Srebrenica was falling was wrong. And he
reiterated that the U.N. Security Council was primarily to blame for not
providing enough troops to defend the enclave in eastern Bosnia. Starting on
that fateful July 11 Bosnian Serb forces overran Srebrenica, which was
designated a U.N.-protected zone.

Police Brace for Belfast March

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- Thousands of hard-line Protestants lit towering
bonfires at midnight Wednesday to celebrate a victory from centuries past, but
many worried whether they would win this month's battle to keep marching past
Catholic areas. Rowdy fife and drum bands entertained heavily drinking crowds
before Wednesday's mass Orange Order parades across Northern Ireland. Police
said they hoped the turmoil would subside once the Orangemen march through
Belfast and more than a dozen other towns Wednesday for the Twelfth, a
profoundly divisive holiday that commemorates the 1690 victory of Protestant
William of Orange over his Catholic foe, James II.

700,000 sick Florida smokers. ''That's a request for a death warrant for each of

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Thousands of hard-line
Protestants lit towering bonfires at midnight Wednesday to
celebrate a victory from centuries past, but many worried whether
they would win this month's battle to keep marching past Catholic
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rowdy fife and drum bands entertained heavily drinking crowds at
scores of bonfires -- stacks of wood planks, discarded furniture and
tires, some 100 feet high -- before Wednesday's mass Orange Order
parades across Northern Ireland. Adding to the air of menace,
masked gunmen fired volleys of shots beside at least two bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a man was shot and killed Wednesday and his body was
found near a bonfire in Larne, County Antrim, about 20 miles north
of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate details of the shooting but crowds at
the bonfire briefly confronted police when they arrived to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week of rioting has caused widespread intimidation,
forcing businesses to close early and motorists off the roads, but
done little to sway authorities' determination to prevent Orangemen
from going near several hostile Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Police commanders said they hoped the turmoil would subside once
the Orangemen march through Belfast and more than a dozen other
towns Wednesday for the Twelfth, a profoundly divisive holiday that
commemorates the 1690 victory of Protestant William of Orange over
his Catholic foe, James II.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking nothing for granted, but the protests must run
out of steam sometime,'' said Chief Superintendent Brian McCargo of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's mostly Protestant
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 146 suspected rioters had been arrested, nearly
1,000 gasoline bombs seized, 88 vehicles hijacked and burned, and
57 officers and five British soldiers wounded since trouble first
flared July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Orange leaders urged their supporters Tuesday to behave ''in a
totally peaceful manner'' and ''to be constant in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But menacing groups of Protestants blocked more than a dozen
major roads in Belfast as darkness fell, a scene repeated in at
least 10 other predominantly Protestant towns.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, some of the worst trouble was brewing in Portadown,
a stronghold of Orange loyalties, where more than 2,000 soldiers
and police have spent the week barring Protestants from the town's
surrounded Catholic neighborhood, Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Police used attack dogs, clubs and shields to force a 100-strong
crowd away from one heavily defended entrance to Garvaghy Road.
After dark, a mob of drunken youths left a bonfire to barrage
police and soldiers with bottles and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The intimidation wasn't all one way. Anti-Protestant arsonists
struck a rural Orange hall with gasoline bombs while a meeting was
going on inside. All six Protestants inside were hospitalized for
smoke inhalation. And British army bomb-disposal experts examined a
series of suspicious packages at other Orange lodges that turned
out to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Twelfth has always served to deepen intercommunal tensions
between British Protestants and Irish Catholics, who generally
loathe the marches, which they see as provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, founded in 1795 near Portadown during another
period of tense rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, was
crucial to Northern Ireland's foundation as a Protestant-majority
state in the 1920s, when the predominantly Catholic rest of Ireland
broke free of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, its marches stirred much loathing but little
violence, largely because Orangemen paraded the same routes year
after year without challenge. But ever since 1995, when militant
Catholic groups began blocking a few key parades that pass near or
through Catholic areas, July has become a sectarian battleground.
</P>
<P>
   To Orange fury, British authorities gradually have opted to
block the most controversial processions in Belfast and Portadown
rather than provoke Catholic riots.
</P>
<P>
   A government-appointed Parades Commission has ordered Orangemen
to steer clear of several predominantly Catholic villages
Wednesday, as well as Lower Ormeau, a Catholic enclave beside a
major south Belfast road. In response, Belfast Orangemen plan to
divert their entire city parade to a park across the Lagan River
from Lower Ormeau.

<HEADLINE> Former Doctor Charged With Murder  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- A former doctor suspected of poisoning
patients from Ohio to Zimbabwe was charged Tuesday with the 1993
murder of three patients at a veterans hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors announced the new charges against Michael
Swango, 45, just days before he was to be released from a Colorado
prison, where he is serving a 42-month sentence for lying on an
application for a residency at Stony Brook University Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Swango failed to disclose that he had spent 30 months in jail
and lost his medical license in 1985 for poisoning six co-workers
in Quincy, Ill. Prosecutors had brought charges against him in part
to buy them time to build the murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors suspect that soon after graduating from Southern
Illinois University Medical School in 1983, Swango poisoned
patients and co-workers in the United States and abroad for more
than a decade. None of the people died.
</P>
<P>
   But after Swango was hired by Stony Brook, three patients died
in his care at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Garden City,
Long Island, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Swango is suspected of killing all three patients by injecting
them with toxins. In two of the cases, he is accused of falsely
telling associates that the patients' families had issued ''do not
resuscitate'' orders.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also believe a fourth patient was poisoned, but
there wasn't enough evidence to prove the injection led to death.
Swango is charged with assault in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's court-appointed lawyer, Randi Chavis, did not
immediately return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   When Swango left Stony Brook, he headed for Zimbabwe, where he
was hired by the Zimbabwe Association of Church Hospitals in 1994,
according to Tuesday's 17-page indictment. About a year later,
patients at hospitals there began showing signs of poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was suspended from practice at the Mnene Mission Hospital
in Zimbabwe in July 1995. Prosecutors there are still investigating
and cooperated with U.S. prosecutors in preparing Tuesday's
indictment, Lynch said.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Expected To Name President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers are expected to
hire a former toy company and video game executive as their
president and CEO on Wednesday, The Santa Rosa Press Democrat
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Harris, 56, will have full day-to-day control of the
NFL franchise with an emphasis on the business end, the newspaper
said. One of his primary tasks will be reviving the stalled
stadium-shopping mall project at Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   The team scheduled a 1 p.m. EDT news conference to make the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has a reputation for turning around troubled companies,
including FAO Schwarz. The toy company hired him as CEO in 1985 and
he quadrupled profits within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Harris worked for Accolade, a San Jose video game
producer. He is now head of The Picture People, a family studio
portrait chain with 183 outlets in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have not had a permanent president since Carmen Policy
left for the Cleveland Browns in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Actor Liam Neeson injured in motorcyle-deer accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITHGOW, N.Y. (AP) - Actor Liam Neeson suffered a broken pelvis
Tuesday when his motorcycle collided with a deer near his home,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, 48, was riding his 1989 Harley Davidson motorcycle
around noon when a deer jumped out into the road, according to the
Dutchess County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, who wore his helmet, was thrown from the motorcycle and
landed on an earth embankment just before the motorcycle ran into a
tree in the town of Washington, about 70 miles north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated Irish actor suffered a fractured right
pelvis, a chipped left pelvis, and multiple abrasions to his leg,
according to the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Staats of Hyde Park was driving his truck in the area
when he spotted Neeson lying on the roadside and alerted emergency
response crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''The embankment is about 100 feet from the road and 30 feet
deep,'' Staats told the Poughkeepsie Journal. ''He managed to crawl
his way up back to the road. He wanted me to drive him back to his
house right up the road, but I could tell his hips were bothering
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson was taken to a Connecticut hospital where a nursing
supervisor confirmed the actor was admitted into the emergency
room, but she refused to release any information on his condition
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told that he's in good condition and that he's resting
comfortably,'' said Alan Nierob, Neeson's publicist. ''We're
expecting a quick recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Oskar
Schindler in the 1993 epic ''Schindler's List.'' More recently,
Neeson starred in ''Stars Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace,''
''The Haunting,'' ''Excalibur'' and ''Rob Roy.'' Sheriff's deputies
said the deer initially ran off, but died nearby a short time after
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson married actress Natasha Richardson in 1994 at their Town
of Washington home.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elliott Likely To Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) -- San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott
said Tuesday he is leaning toward returning for at least one more
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to go out losing,'' Elliott said in the San
Antonio Express-News for Wednesday's editions. ''That has really
bothered me. Watching someone else win the championship after you
did is not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said Tim Duncan's decision to re-sign with the Spurs,
announced Tuesday, increased the likelihood he would return. He
also said he would prefer not to end his career after losing in the
first round of the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the opportunity to show what we really have as a
team,'' he said. ''Right now, with Tim coming back, I'm probably
leaning pretty hard toward coming back also.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 32, was the first professional athlete to come back
from transplant surgery. Last year, he received a kidney from his
brother Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the season, I was 99.9 percent sure I would
retire,'' Elliott said. ''But that's changed. That's changed a lot.
I still have a lot to talk about and think about, but right now I
really feel like coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott averaged six points and 2.5 rebounds in 19 games with
the Spurs after returning from the operation March 14.

<HEADLINE> US, N.Korea Missile Talks Nears End  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Amid new hopes of progress, U.S.
and North Korean negotiators went into their final meeting
Wednesday in three days of talks on Pyongyang's development and
export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations follow new willingness by long-reclusive North
Korea to discuss defense issues and the latest failed test for a
U.S. missile defense system aimed at stopping strikes from North
Korea and other so-called countries of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Myong Gil, a North Korean negotiator, told reporters after
Tuesday's talks that ''the atmosphere was very sincere'' and the
chief topics were missile exports and compensation to North Korea.
An agreement was ''under negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants North Korea to halt the development and
export of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang has said it will not negotiate on its sovereign right
to develop defensive missiles. There are hopes it may be more
flexible on its exports, though they are a vital source of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has in the past reportedly demanded annual
compensation of $1 billion for three years if it curbs missile
exports.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, chief U.S. negotiator, Robert Einhorn, had greeted
North Korean delegates with handshakes and smiles after saying the
United States was prepared to move toward fundamentally improved
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States claims North Korea is the world's top exporter
of missile equipment and technology, selling to such countries as
Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Pyongyang rattled Asia by test-firing a missile
over Japan into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, Einhorn said Monday that the talks
were being held in a positive atmosphere, largely due to a June
summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean
President Kim Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also recently agreed to a moratorium on tests of
long-range missiles in exchange for an easing of U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened official talks with Japan, moved to establish
diplomatic relations with many countries in Asia and Europe, and
joined a security forum of Southeast Asian nations.

<HEADLINE> Director of rehab center quits in dispute over alcohol treatment  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The director of the Smithers clinic, the
celebrity rehab center that treated Truman Capote and Joan Kennedy,
has quit in a dispute over his decision to adopt a program that
allows patients to drink in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Dr. Alex DeLuca from the Smithers Addiction
Treatment and Research Center comes amid a renewed debate over
whether problem drinkers should be allowed to drink in controlled
fashion or should abstain altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Audrey Kishline, the founder of Moderation
Management, a national organization that promotes moderate drinking
for problem drinkers, pleaded guilty to causing a deadly
drunken-driving accident in Washington state. She has renounced the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca's decision to include Moderation Management as a
treatment option at Smithers was first reported in last week's New
York magazine. He told the magazine: ''I humbly submit that this is
the way alcoholics should be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca resigned Monday under pressure from St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center, which runs the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital said in a statement that the Smithers center ''has
a long and proud tradition of treating alcoholism by advocating
total abstinence. While we recognize there may be other
alternatives in the treatment of this difficult disease, no change
in our own program policy was ever approved.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Since Dr. Alex DeLuca does not support the program philosophy,
we have accepted his resignation as director of Smithers,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A call to the
only Alex DeLuca listed in New York state was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Tuesday's New York Times, DeLuca said he was
not advocating that the Smithers center drop abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was only suggesting that you could engage people in a
kinder, gentler manner rather than telling them that they had to
sign up for a goal of achieving abstinence from the beginning,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithers center, whose patients over the years have included
writer John Cheever and baseball star Darryl Strawberry, was
founded 30 years ago with a $10 million donation from
philanthropist Robert Brinkley Smithers, who also started the
Christopher D. Smithers Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The two organizations are no longer linked, and the dispute over
controlled drinking has deepened a rift between the clinic and the
foundation, which advocates total abstinence for alcoholics and
drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation took out a full-page ad in The New York Times on
Sunday noting that it is not associated with the clinic and that it
believes ''alcoholism is a disease that requires abstinence-based
treatment, and that controlled drinking, under any name, whether it
be 'modern management' or 'harm reduction,' is not possible where
the disease of alcoholism exists.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Kishline, 43, pleaded guilty in the March
25 deaths of a man and his 12-year-old daughter. Kishline was
driving the wrong way down Interstate 90, and her blood-alchohol
level was more that three times the legal limit. She faces a
possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline started Moderation Management in 1993, calling it an
alternative to abstinence-based Alcoholics Anonymous. The
moderation program says it is not for alcoholics, just problem
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, Kishline has quit the movement. Her lawyer
has said that Kishline realized that Moderation Management ''is
nothing but alcoholics covering up their problem.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Truck Crash a Murder-Suicide  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA FARGEN

   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- In a neatly written note to her
husband, a woman gave the only hint as to why she killed their
three sons and herself by driving the family's pickup truck into
the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Duncan told Chris Duncan that she was distraught over
problems in their marriage of nearly 10 years, then ended the note
with a chilling declaration:
</P>
<P>
   ''Your children will be in God's hands now.''
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators said Tuesday the note offered no other
indication of what the woman had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly her intent was she was going to commit suicide and
take the children with her,'' Sgt. Ray Mabbitt said. ''It was not
an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not make the entire note public. Mabbitt said
only that it contained ''her observations on their marriage'' and
that she had been distraught.
</P>
<P>
   The note was found in a car parked at the family's Council
Bluffs house Monday night at the same time rescue workers
frantically searched for the woman and her children.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the note was found, the bodies of 33-year-old Karen
Duncan, her 4-year-old twins, Derek and Dylan, and 8-year-old son,
Zachary, were pulled from the river along with the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Duncan, 35, was at home when he learned of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to talk right now,'' he said over the telephone.
''Obviously, I can't think straight.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the family Tuesday night said Karen
Duncan was struggling with depression and the family had sought
professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sincerely hope and pray that other families who may be
experiencing this situation, will seek out and receive the help
they need,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Duncan's grandmother, Sally Negrete of Council Bluffs,
said the suicide came as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Karen was a nice person,'' Negrete said. ''I would have never
expected her to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Court records offered no indications of legal problems or
disputes between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Duncan drove the truck into the river about 5
p.m. Monday at Narrows County Park, just north of Council Bluffs
directly across the river from Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said it appeared Duncan made no effort to stop the
black Chevy pickup, which sped off of an access road about 100 feet
from the river. They told of hearing the children screaming as the
car raced over a 25-foot bank.
