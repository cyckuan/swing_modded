observe anniversary of Diana's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Only 6 percent of Britons are planning to observe
Monday's anniversary of Princess Diana's death, according to a new
opinion poll published Friday.
	   The findings appear to confirm suggestions that many people are
suffering from ``Diana fatigue,'' according to the Daily Telegraph,
which commissioned the poll.
	   In the telephone poll of 1,009 people, conducted by the Gallup
research group between Aug. 19 and Aug. 25, 93 percent of
respondents said they were planning to do nothing to commemorate
the event and more than two-thirds said they believe that marking
the Aug. 31 anniversary of Diana's death should be an individual
choice, not a national occasion.
	   But a year after the princess died in a Paris car crash, 92
percent of them can still remember where they were when they heard
she had died.
	   In a separate analysis of the poll results, the Telegraph
declared that the findings suggest the intense period of national
mourning is now over and that the grief has become quiet
reflection.
	   The Telegraph quoted an unnamed Buckingham Palace spokesman as
saying the royal family hoped the anniversary would be a
``low-key'' affair and that it was understandable if the public
shared this view.
	   ``I don't know about calling it 'fatigue,' but having marked the
princess's death in a very significant way, people may now want to
mark it in a very personal way,'' the newspaper quoted the
spokesman as saying.
	   The poll showed strong support for a national memorial to the
princess, with 92 per cent in favor of a children's hospital and 75
percent in favor of a new nursing program named after her.
Sixty-four percent said they backed the controversial proposal of a
memorial garden outside her former home of Kensington Palace.
	   There was marked opposition to naming the public holiday that
occurs during the last weekend in August as ``Diana Day,'' with 72
percent of respondents opposed to that idea.
	   Fewer than half of respondents, 41 percent, regard Diana as a
true ``People's Princess,'' while 44 percent believe she was ``a
woman with her merits but also her faults.'' Thirteen percent said
they consider she was a ``privileged woman with an exaggerated
public image.''
	   The poll also showed that a majority of people _ 58 per cent _
believe the royal family is more in tune with the national mood
since Diana's death. Buckingham Palace officials acknowledged
Thursday that Diana's death had accelerated efforts to make Queen
Elizabeth II more informal and accessible to her people.
	   Diana's teenage sons, William and Harry, will remember their
mother in private prayer on the first anniversary of her death.
They will have their father and other senior members of the royal
family for support when they attend church on the queen's Scottish
estate at Balmoral on Monday.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie will join the
royals at Balmoral in their tribute to Diana.
	   In Paris, a candlelit vigil at the scene of the fatal car crash
will commemorate the life of Diana.
	   Meanwhile, at Althorp, the princess's ancestral home 65 miles
(100 kms) northwest of London, the Spencers will hold a family
service overlooking the island where Diana was laid to rest.
	   At Harrods department store in London, Mohamed Al Fayed will
unveil a statue in memory of Diana and his son Dodi, who died with
the princess.
	   Flags, at government buildings and royal residences, including
the Union Jack flag over Buckingham Palace, will fly at half-mast
throughout the day.
	   Only the Royal Standard, which is never flown at half-mast, will
remain at the top of Balmoral's flagpole.

Vietnam releasing 5,219 prisoners as part of amnesty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam said Friday it is releasing 5,219
prisoners as part of a general amnesty, including two men whose
cases were criticized by the European Parliament.
	   An unspecified number of expatriates, including Americans, were
on the list, Nguyen Canh Dinh, chairman of the president's office,
told a news conference.
	   He said the amnesty was effective after it was signed Friday by
President Tran Duc Luong, who is on an official visit to Russia.
	   It was not immediately clear if some prisoners already have been
released, but a spokesman for the Police Ministry Prisons
Management Department said all would freed before National Day,
Sept. 2.
	   With few details, an amnesty for up to 8,000 people had been
announced in advance as part of National Day commemorations. Dinh
said another batch would be considered after the holiday.
	   Dinh reiterated Vietnam's claim that it holds no political or
religious prisoners, only people who have broken the law.
	   International human-rights groups claim a number of people are
in jail for their political or religious beliefs under either the
all-encompassing national security law or strict regulation of
religious activities.
	   In response to a question, he said Doan Viet Hoat and Nguyen Dan
Que were among those being released. Their cases were cited in a
July 16 resolution by the European Parliament _ sharply criticized
at the time by Vietnam _ that called for their convictions to be
quashed immediately.
	   However, a third man specified in the resolution, Thich Khong
Do, was not mentioned by Dinh.
	   Hoat has been serving a 15-year sentence for publishing
pro-democracy newsletters. He was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom
by the World Association of Newspapers earlier this year for his
commitment to a free press.
	   He was first arrested in 1976, when he was a professor of
literature, for calling for greater civil liberties and spent 12
years in detention camps without trial.
	   He was arrested again in 1990 and held for 28 months without
charge, then sentenced to a 20-year term for publishing
``anti-communist'' articles in a small underground magazine. The
sentence later was reduced to 15 years.
	   Que was sentenced in 1991, in what the European Parliament
called ``totally unfair proceedings,'' to 20 years for seeking to
overthrow the government.
	   To qualify for the amnesty, Dinh said inmates must have served
at least a third of their sentences, or 12 years in the case of a
life sentence. He said he did not know the longest period that had
been spent in prison.
	   People sentenced to death were not eligible unless their
sentences already had been commuted to life imprisonment.
	   The group being released includes 5,166 who are being given
complete amnesty and another 53 who effectively are being paroled.
	   Any of them who seeks to immigrate abroad will receive normal
consideration, Dinh said.

India's Interior Minister blasts U.S. for ``double standards'' on
</HEADLINE>
terrorism &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's powerful Interior Minister
accused the United States of adopting what he called double
standards in dealing with terrorism, newspapers reported Friday.
	   For years, India has accused neighboring Pakistan of encouraging
Kashmiri separatists with arms, training and funds. Pakistan says
it only gives them moral support in their battle to win
independence for the Himalayan state.
	   ``How is it that you can do something and we cannot do that? Is
it not double standards?'' said Interior Minister Lal Krishna
Advani, referring to the U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering's comments on the attack on Afghanistan and Sudan in
relation to the bombings of the American embassies.
	   Pickering said in Washington that the United States reserved the
right to attack terrorists in any country. But he warned India
against taking similar action regarding the disputed territory of
Kashmir because it could ``run the risk of setting off a wider
conflict.''
	   ``Let it be clearly understood, however, that we will not rest
until the proxy war launched by Pakistan against India is
decisively defeated,'' Advani said in public meetings in his
constituency in a western state on Thursday.
	   ``The U.S. has chosen to ignore gross acts of terrorism being
aided and abetted from across the Indian border. Our nation is a
victim of terrorist conspiracy,'' the papers quoted Advani as
saying.
	   ``Americans are not expendable. ... But then, are Indians
expendable?'' he asked.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Edits throughout to remove garble &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister struggled to keep
the lid on his country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded the government step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters shortly last
Thursday night.
	   His statement concluded a day of wild rumors and ominous
financial news. The Kremlin kicked into high gear to deny cycle
after cycle of rumors that the crisis had forced President Boris
Yeltsin to resign.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky denounced the murmurings
as ``absolutely groundless idle inventions,'' and the Kremlin press
service issued a special plea after CBS News reported that Yeltsin
had signed a resignation order.
	   ``The press service of the Russian president appeals to CBS and
other foreign media with an urgent request not to spread inaccurate
information,'' the statement said. It said such reports were
interfering with plans for President Bill Clinton's planned visit
next week.
	   Meanwhile, parliament leaders proposed a series of Soviet-style
measures they said would contain Russia's escalating troubles _
currency controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   It was clear that after years and months of insisting that free
market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now willing to at
least consider some retrenchment.
	   Chernomyrdin and other government figures held consultations
with top parliament leaders _ most of them Communists and other
hard-liners _ who presented the draft plan. Provisions include
nationalizing major industries, controlling prices, and fixing
currency exchange rates.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Chernomyrdin also reported on his emergency meeting with
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus on Wednesday,
saying he expressed support for the government's actions and
accepted some blame for the crisis.
	   Meanwhile Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically, demanding that he cede some of his sweeping powers to
the parliament in return for lawmakers' confirmation of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job last March, was brought
back in a surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The Central Bank suspended all currency trades for Friday,
effectively freezing the market through the weekend. The last
transactions on Tuesday left the official exchange rate at 7.86
rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents. The street rate is below 10
rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, in order to ensure
that some 25 million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets. The
new group of five banks will be led by National Reserve Bank, with
Inkombank, Avtobank, Mezhkombank and Alfa Bank also joining.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.
	   ``I wouldn't say there's panic,'' said 35-year-old kiosk owner
Arkady Charyan. ``The only panic is at the foreign exchange
offices, where people have rubles and they're trying to change
them.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A tropical storm blamed for mudslides, flooding and
12 deaths dumped torrential rains on much of Japan Friday and was
headed for Tokyo, weather officials said.
	   Japanese media reported the death toll from the rains rose to 12
Friday, with three missing, as soldiers recovered a body in a
flooded town north of Tokyo.
	   Police refused to immediately confirm that. They have confirmed
11 deaths, with four missing.
	   Officials in Mito, a city about 100 kilometers (63 miles)
northeast of Tokyo, warned 39,400 people to evacuate their homes
because of the rains, which began Wednesday night.
	   Tropical Storm Rex was located 1,100 kilometers (690 miles)
south of Tokyo late Friday morning and moving north, according to
the Meteorological Agency. It said the storm had sustained wind
speeds of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour near its center.
	   The rains have been caused by the storm pushing warm, wet air
from the central Pacific Ocean north.
	   Some 1,000 soldiers searched near the town of Nasu, just north
of Tokyo, for the people still missing after a river burst its
banks Thursday. News reports said they recovered the body of a man,
leaving three people unaccounted for.
	   The torrent also killed a 60-year-old university professor and
destroyed or damaged more than 34 houses in the town, which has
seen a record 839 millimeters (33.6 inches) falling since the rains
began at about midnight Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, officials in Fukushima prefecture, 175 kilometers
(110 miles) north of Tokyo, were investigating why a mudslide
warning never reached an institution for the handicapped.
	   Five patients there were killed when a mudslide slammed into
their building Thursday morning.
	   In the immediate Tokyo area, the effects of the storm were
limited mainly to disruption of transportation.
	   Several highways and train lines were closed in and around
Tokyo. East Japan Railway Co. reduced traffic along the Chuo line
running through central Tokyo by 80 percent.
	   The railway also halted bullet trains between the cities of
Yokohama and Atami, southwest of the capital.

Funds kick-start South Pacific environment project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A program to protect and develop
South Pacific coastal areas and ocean fisheries has been boosted by
a 25.5 million New Zealand dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.3 million) grant
from the Global Environmental Fund, announced Friday.
	   The grant will help fund the South Pacific Regional Environment
Program, a project for Pacific island states and regional
organizations to develop the area's extensive ocean resources
without destroying them, program spokesman Gerald Miles said.
	   The five-year project would be of regional and global benefit,
he said.
	   ``These project activities are designed to prevent existing and
imminent threats to the Pacific's international waters, such as
pollution of ocean and fresh water from poor sewage disposal
systems and disposal of chemicals,'' Miles said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister struggled to keep
the lid on his country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded the government step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters Thursday night.
	   His statement concluded a day of wild rumors and ominous
financial news. The Kremlin kicked into high gear to deny cycle
after cycle of rumors that the crisis had forced President Boris
Yeltsin to resign.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky denounced the murmurings
as ``absolutely groundless idle inventions,'' and the Kremlin press
service issued a special plea after CBS News reported that Yeltsin
had signed a resignation order.
	   ``The press service of the Russian president appeals to CBS and
other foreign media with an urgent request not to spread inaccurate
information,'' the statement said. It said such reports were
interfering with plans for President Bill Clinton's planned visit
next week.
	   Yeltsin headed to the Kremlin on Friday, and was planning to
meet with the visiting president of Bulgaria and possibly
Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

Foreign diplomats flailed for sympathy to Myanmar opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ An official commentary attacked foreign
diplomats Friday for allegedly sympathizing with Myanmar's
pro-democracy movement.
	   ``In any diplomatic relations there exist diplomatic ethics as
prescribed in the Geneva Convention,'' said the state-run
Myanmar-language daily Mirror.
	   ``Supporting and having close contact with the organization
which is opposing the government, aiding and abetting the
dissidents with clandestine correspondence by taking advantage of
the diplomatic immunity, refusing to call the country `Burma' as
`Myanmar' and having a negative outlook towards the host country
are not among the diplomatic ethics,'' it said.
	   The military group which took power in 1988 changed the
country's official name from Burma to Myanmar.
	   The commentary, written under the pseudonym Sithu Nyein Aye,
came one day after the government claimed it wants substantive
talks with the opposition.
	   Despite the rhetoric about dialogue, it continues to attach
conditions that would keep pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
from taking part in any such meetings.
	   The opposition, international human rights groups, the United
States, the European Union and Japan, and some of Myanmar's
regional neighbors have all urged a dialogue to ease political
tensions.
	   But the military regime has failed to move towards
democratization, instead engaging in heavy-handed repression of
dissent.
	   Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, the main
opposition party, have also been putting low-level but concerted
pressure on the government to release political prisoners and
convene the parliament whose members were elected in 1990 but never
seated.
	   The junta has been stressing that the NLD's recently-announced
plan to unilaterally convene a civilian parliament would upset
attempts to hold a dialogue.
	   At the same time, its briefings to foreign diplomats about the
situation have included threats to arrest opposition members and to
declare Suu Kyi's party illegal.
	   One of Suu Kyi's colleagues, meanwhile, reported that her health
has improved after a grueling 13-day sit-in protest she staged in a
van which was blocked from traveling by the authorities.
	   Suu Kyi, another senior party member and two drivers stayed in
the vehicle for 13 days to protest the government's refusal to let
them proceed to the city of Bassein to meet other party members.
	   She returned to Yangon Monday on the advice of her personal
physicians, who had found her health imperiled, and in accordance
with the wishes of her party members, NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo said
Friday.
	   ''Her blood pressure is back to normal and her health has
improved,'' said Tin Oo, contacted by telephone. ``She is still
under medical care and is resting.''
	   Tin Oo also said that more than 200 party members came to see
her at her home in the capital on Thursday.

Indonesian city quiet after mob attacks governor's office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police guarded the governor's office
in a provincial town Friday after protesters hurled rocks at the
building.
	   Violence broke out Thursday during a rally against the local
governor in Mataram, a coastal city on the island of Lombok, a
popular tourist destination.
	   There were no reports of injuries, but windows were broken and a
gate was damaged. Police and military officials eventually
persuaded thousands of demonstrators, some of whom had arrived in
trucks, to leave.
	   Protesters said the new governor, Harun Al Rasyid, did not
reflect their views. A former vice governor of Jakarta, Harun was
elected by the local Parliament.
	   Mataram is 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   There has been scattered unrest in several other areas of
Indonesia this week, some involving looters.
	   Indonesia is enduring the worst economic turmoil in decades and
deadly riots stemming from the hardship helped oust former
President Suharto in May.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is moving Indonesia toward
democracy, freeing some political prisoners and scheduling general
elections next year.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with press service saying Yeltsin
at work, Clinton summit to go ahead as scheduled and parliamentary
leaders meeting, CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister struggled to keep
the lid on his country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded the government step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters Thursday night.
	   Yeltsin was at work in the Kremlin on Friday, his press service
said, and was planning to meet with the visiting president of
Bulgaria and possibly Chernomyrdin and Acting Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov. He had not been seen in public since Tuesday,
adding to the sense of crisis.
	   The Kremlin continued Friday to deny rumors that Yeltsin would
resign. Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky denounced the
murmurings late Thursday as ``absolutely groundless idle
inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service reiterated Friday that the summit with
President Bill Clinton in Moscow next week would go ahead as
scheduled.
	   Parliament leaders began discussing Friday a series of
Soviet-style measures they said would contain Russia's escalating
troubles _ currency controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   They also considered a power-sharing agreement that would give
lawmakers more say over Cabinet appointments and government
policies. It would also offer certain guarantees _ such as immunity
from prosectipn _ if a president steps down. This provision has
fueled media speculation that Yeltsin's resignation was imminent.
	   It was clear that after years and months of insisting that free
market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now willing to at
least consider some retrenchment.
	   Chernomyrdin and other government figures held consultations
with top parliament leaders _ most of them Communists and other
hard-liners _ who presented the draft plan.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Meanwhile Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically, demanding that he cede some of his sweeping powers to
the parliament in return for lawmakers' confirmation of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job last March, was brought
back in a surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The Central Bank suspended all currency trades for Friday,
effectively freezing the market through the weekend. The last
transactions on Tuesday left the official exchange rate at 7.86
rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents. The street rate is below 10
rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, to ensure that 25
million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.
	   ``I wouldn't say there's panic,'' said 35-year-old kiosk owner
Arkady Charyan. ``The only panic is at the foreign exchange
offices, where people have rubles and they're trying to change
them.''

Defense Agency confirms deaths of two Japanese fighter pilots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese Air Self-Defense Force fighter pilots,
missing since their F-1 jets plunged into the Pacific Ocean three
days ago, have been confirmed dead, a Defense Agency spokesman said
Friday.
	   The jets were conducting low-altitude night flying practice at a
point about 120 kilometers (75 miles), southeast of the U.S. Air
Force's Misawa air base, when they disappeared from radar. Misawa
is 560 kilometers (347 miles), northwest of Tokyo.
	   The bodies of 1st Lt. Hirokazu Nagai and 1st Lt. Madoka Nakaya,
the missing pilots, were identified Thursday at a Misawa base
hospital, said Kazuji Tanaka, a Defense Agency spokesman.
	   Rescuers from Japan's coast guard and military had found parts
of their bodies as well as pieces of metal fragments from the jets
since the aircraft went missing Tuesday night.
	   The cause of their crash is still under investigation, Tanaka
said.
	   Initial speculation was that they may have collided in mid-air.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister struggled to keep
the lid on his country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded the government step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters Thursday night.
	   Yeltsin was at work in the Kremlin on Friday, where he met with
visiting President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria, his press service
said. He had not been seen in public since Tuesday, adding to the
sense of crisis.
	   Yeltsin was also expected to meet with Chernomyrdin and Acting
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

Israel lifts closure on Palestinians in Hebron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank, (AP) _ The Israeli army lifted a week-long
closure on some 130,000 Palestinians in the West Bank city of
Hebron Friday after a rabbi was killed there last week, a spokesman
said.
	   In addition, a curfew in the center of the city controlled by
Israel was lifted for three hours to allow the 30,000 Palestinians
living there to buy food and necessities, the spokesman added.
	   The closure and curfew began after a rabbi was killed on Aug. 20
in his home in a Jewish enclave in the center of the city,
allegedly by Palestinians.
	   Skirmishes have broken out over the past week between settlers
and Palestinians when the curfew was lifted periodically but none
were reported early Friday.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in the area Israel controls, which
is located in the heart of the city holy to Jews and Muslims.
	   Although the Palestinians control the other section of Hebron,
the Israeli army can seal the city to prevent Palestinian travel in
and out of the area.

Cambodian opposition leader calls for nationwide protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defying sharp government warnings,
opposition leader Sam Rainsy called Friday for nationwide
demonstrations against alleged election fraud as well as the ouster
of the country's leader, Hun Sen.
	   Speaking to a crowd of about 2,000 supporters on the fifth day
of a sit-in in front of the National Assembly, Sam Rainsy said that
Cambodia was on the brink of a ``revolution.''
	   Cambodians around the country should ``rise up'' against
dictatorship, he said, drawing cheers and applause from the crowd.
	   ``Victory is near,'' he said.
	   His comments come on the heels of a government warning Thursday
that the sit-in is ``illegal'' and that Sam Rainsy is creating
social unrest.
	   Sam Rainsy will have to ``take responsibility in front of the
law for any kind of problems that could result from his
irresponsible and immoral behavior,'' the government said.
	   The statement raised speculation that the government _ which has
so far reluctantly allowed the rallies to go ahead _ may be
preparing to crack down and possibly arrest the opposition leader.
	   Still, thousands turned out in front of the National Assembly
early Friday to hear Sam Rainsy speak.
	   He showed no sign of easing his vitriolic attacks on Hun Sen _
whose ruling party last month ran first in parliamentary elections
_ and continued to call the polls a farce.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority, but
not the two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   The turnouts in front of the National Assembly have gotten
progressively larger since the sit-in began Monday.
	   The park in front of the parliament, dubbed ``Democracy Square''
by the opposition, is dotted with tents and the surrounding roads
are often closed to traffic by crowds.
	   The atmosphere in the tent-city is festive.
	   Dozens of flags from various opposition parties soar above blue
tarpaulin roofs, vendors sell fruit and other snacks, and
demonstrators laugh, cheer and clap as they listen to speeches over
the loudspeakers.
	   Sam Rainsy, who visits the site at least twice a day, is always
given a hero's welcome by enthusiastic supporters.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party together won 58 of the 122 seats in the National Assembly but
have accused Hun Sen of using massive fraud to ensure victory.
	   They have threatened to boycott the assembly to prevent a
government from forming and have spurned Hun Sen's offers to form a
coalition unless their concerns are properly investigated.
	   While Sam Rainsy is seen as a freedom fighter by his followers,
critics consider him a rabble-rouser.
	   ``All compatriots join hands in overthrowing the Yuon puppet's
dictatorial regime,'' Sam Rainsy told Friday's crowd. ``Don't give
in, be strong in your heart. Throughout Cambodia, stand up against
dictatorship.''
	   ``Yuon' is a pejorative term for Vietnamese. Prejudice against
the country's Vietnamese minority is widespread, making it an easy
target for politicians seeking popular approval.
	   Hun Sen's opponents cast him as a Vietnamese puppet because he
was part of a government installed in 1979 by the Vietnamese
invasion which toppled the brutal Communist regime of the Khmer
Rouge.
	   ``Cambodia does not need leaders who incite hatred and
confrontation,'' Raoul Jennar, a Belgian expert on Cambodia whose
remarks were read over a television station associated with Hun
Sen's party. He called Rainsy a ``dangerous and thoughtless
provocateur.''

Talbot expects traditional rivalry to continue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian swimming coach Don Talbot
expects the traditional rivalry involving Australia, England and
Canada to resurface at next month's Commonwealth Games.
	   It was no contest in Victoria, Canada, when Australia won a
record 25 gold, 17 silver and 11 bronze medals to swamp the rest of
the Commonwealth four years ago.
	   England scored just six gold, four silver and eight bronze and
Canada grabbed two gold, eight silver and nine bronze despite the
advantage of a home crowd.
	   In Auckland in 1990, Australia also dominated the medal tally
with 21 gold, 19 silver and 13 bronze.
	   But Talbot predicts a tougher battle at the Kuala Lumpur Games
from Sept. 11-21.
	   ``It'll be very close swimming in KL,'' Talbot said Friday.
	   ``I think it'll be a much more contested Commonwealth Games than
it's been for many years which I'm really happy about. That's good
for the sport and I think it's good for us.
	   ``I don't want us to be winning too easily. Our swimmers get
careless . . . and I don't want them doing that, particularly going
into 2000 for the Olympics.''
	   While the Australian men's team was powerful at the Perth world
championships in January, claiming six golds to equal the United
States, the women's squad has some major holes to plug.
	   Absent will be reigning Commonwealth 200-meter and 400-meter
individual medley champion Elli Overton, who is unavailable, and
retired backstroker Nicole Stevenson and distance swimmer Hayley
Lewis.
	   Talbot is pleased with the return to form of dual Olympic
1,500-meter freestyle gold medalist Kieren Perkins, whose star has
faded from the international spotlight since the Atlanta Olympics
two years ago.
	   Perkins clocked 7 minutes, 42.85 seconds over 800 meters
freestyle in a 25-meter pool recently _ the second-fastest swim of
the year.
	   ``To predict a win for him I think is a little bit unreasonable
but that swim was a pretty good swim and it indicates he's firing
now, whereas for a little while he was in the wilderness,'' Talbot
said. (djp)

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister struggled to keep
the lid on his country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded the government step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters Thursday night.
	   Yeltsin was at work in the Kremlin on Friday, where he met with
visiting President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria, his press service
said. He had not been seen in public since Tuesday, adding to the
sense of crisis.
	   Yeltsin was also expected to meet with Chernomyrdin and Acting
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Kremlin continued Friday to deny rumors that Yeltsin would
resign. Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky denounced the
murmurings late Thursday as ``absolutely groundless idle
inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service reiterated Friday that the summit with
President Bill Clinton in Moscow next week would go ahead as
scheduled.
	   Parliament leaders began discussing Friday a series of
Soviet-style measures they said would contain Russia's escalating
troubles _ currency controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   They also considered a power-sharing agreement that would give
lawmakers more say over Cabinet appointments and government
policies. It would also offer certain guarantees _ such as immunity
from prosecution _ if a president steps down. This provision has
fueled media speculation that Yeltsin's resignation was imminent.
	   It was clear that after years and months of insisting that free
market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now willing to at
least consider some retrenchment.
	   Chernomyrdin and other government figures held consultations
with top parliament leaders _ most of them Communists and other
hard-liners _ who presented the draft plan.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft said. ``The situation demands increasing the role of the
state in regulating the economy.''
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Meanwhile Communist leaders continued to pressure Yeltsin
politically, demanding that he cede some of his sweeping powers to
the parliament in return for lawmakers' confirmation of
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job last March, was brought
back in a surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, to ensure that 25
million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.
	   ``I wouldn't say there's panic,'' said 35-year-old kiosk owner
Arkady Charyan. ``The only panic is at the foreign exchange
offices, where people have rubles and they're trying to change
them.''

Chinese politicians, dissidents attack government over flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With millions left homeless and the Yangtze River
still dangerously swollen, Chinese dissidents and legislators have
attacked misguided government policies for exacerbating China's
worst flood season in decades.
	   The outpouring of criticism shows how the summer-long disaster
has laid bare the environmental cost of rapid economic growth and
touched disparate and often divided groups across the political
spectrum.
	   In the largest petition since the military crushed the Tiananmen
Square democracy movement nine years ago, 309 dissidents urged the
government to abandon environmentally disastrous policies, a human
rights group said Friday.
	   ``For so many years, by blindly following the concept that `man
can conquer nature,' we have built up vast, evil debts to the
Yangtze River,'' said the petition, completed Wednesday and
released by New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   ``We are now swallowing the bitter fruit of nature's revenge and
pay-back,'' said the petition signed by dissidents from 19
provinces and major cities, from scientists to labor rights
campaigners and democratic reformers.
	   The dissidents catalogued a growing number of environmental ills
that the flooding has made so plain even the government has
acknowledged: clear-cutting that has reduced forest cover in the
Yangtze basin by half in four decades, an upsurge in soil erosion
and the resulting silting of channels and raising of river beds.
	   ``Finally the long-term strain has pushed the ailing Mother
River to the breaking point, and it has gone crazy,'' the petition
said.
	   By the government's own count, flooding nationwide has killed
3,004 people, destroyed more than 5 million houses and caused
economic losses of more than 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2
billion). Across the Yangtze and in the northeast, millions of
hectares (tens of millions of acres) of fertile farmland lie under
muddy water.
	   Although the latest surge on the Yangtze _ the summer's seventh
flood crest _ lost some of its punch and flood waters on
long-raging northeastern rivers began receding Friday, the danger
to farms and cities persisted.
	   Heavy rains and winds whipped up waves on swollen Dongting Lake
along the Yangtze, lashing soggy, weakened dikes; in the northeast,
a swollen tributary of the Songhua River sent 200 meters (650 feet)
of dike crumbling outside Jiamusi city, the People's Daily
reported.
	   In two days of appearances before the national legislature this
week, government officials said they were working flat out to
contain the disaster and care for the victims.
	   Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering pledged Thursday that each
refugee would receive half a kilogram (a pound) of grain a day and
all would be given shelter and warm clothing, a particularly urgent
need in the northeast with the first frost two weeks away.
	   Despite the assurances, members of the tightly controlled
legislature vented unusually sharp criticisms, decrying the
environmental ruin, low investment in flood control projects and
the corruption and indifference of some officials, state media
reported.
	   Wang Xuan, a member of the legislature's executive committee,
said some officials who went to inspect the flooding asked to be
housed in air-conditioned rooms and requested such delicacies as
soft-shelled turtles, the China Daily reported.
	   One legislator noted that a belated ban on logging along the
upper Yangtze did not cover the depleted forests of the northeast.
	   The legislators' call for better environmental protection and
wiser spending dovetailed with the suggestions by dissidents, many
of whom have been jailed and harassed for their political acts.
	   The dissidents' appeal was bolder and broader, demanding Chinese
leaders keep development from depleting natural resources, halt
land reclamation projects and draft stringent, scientific rules to
protect the environment and punish transgressors.

Peru's Congress blocks referendum on Fujimori's third election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's Congress on Thursday night blocked an
opposition bid to hold a referendum on whether President Alberto
Fujimori can run for a third consecutive term in office, paving the
way for an election bid in 2000.
	   Minutes before midnight, after a marathon 14-hour debate, the
Fujimori-controlled Congress killed the referendum, with the
opposition falling three votes short of the 48 they needed to
demand a referendum.
	   Opposition legislators had collected 1.4 million signatures of
Peruvians requesting the referendum. Congress recently ruled that
Fujimori can run for a third consecutive term in office in spite of
an apparent constitutional ban.
	   Polls show most Peruvians oppose another Fujimori election bid.
	   Some 1,000 students and union members held a pro-referendum
rally in front of Congress, carrying a large cross with the word
``Referendum'' to symbolize its death at the hand of Congress.
	   Inside Congress, opposition legislators held up signs saying
``No To Fraud'' and charged the government with trampling Peru's
laws to keep Fujimori in power.
	   Fujimori was elected in 1990 as a political outsider and was
re-elected in a landslide in 1995. But his popularity has fallen in
recent years.
	   Fujimori has not said if he plans to run again in 2000, but
Congress has paved the way for another election bid with a
controversial ruling.
	   Peru's 1993 Constitution prohibits a president from running for
three consecutive terms in office. But Congress ruled that since
Fujimori's first election was before 1993 it does not count.
	   If the referendum supporters had won the vote, the National
Elections Board would have had to review the validity of the
signatures. If more than 1.2 million signatures were valid, it
would have been obliged to call a referendum under Peruvian law.

Government's battle with speculators intensifies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government's two-week battle to prop up
stocks came to a showdown on Friday with speculators gaining an
upper hand in early trading and driving the main index lower.
	   Speculators continued to dump a massive number of shares while
the cash-rich government pumped in billions of dollars in an
attempt to push the index higher.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at Vickers Ballas
Holdings Ltd. ``There is a battle going on.''
	   But falls in world bourses from the United States to Japan made
the government's job more difficult. Despite aggressive buying that
pushed trading volume close to its all time high by midday, the
market stayed in negative territory.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 63.14 points to 7,859.83 at
the midday close, after moving in a range of 7,856.60 and 7,880.93.
	   Market volume rose to 40.97 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
5.25 billion), and market players are predicting Friday's volume
will break the all-time high record of 46.02 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.9 billion) on Aug. 29, 1997, when the market
peaked.
	   On Wednesday, the Hang Seng was the only Asian market to close
higher, gaining 1.1 percent at 7,922.97.
	   The government has been buying aggressively to prop up the stock
index to punish speculators short selling stocks and futures.
	   Friday was a crucial day in the battle as August futures
contracts expire. If the market closes higher, those stuck with
short positions on August contracts will pay dearly.
	   Investors who sell the market short borrow shares, sell them
hoping the prices will fall, the then buy them back at the lower
prices, pocketing the difference.
	   ``We are at a crucial juncture,'' said Kent Rossiter, senior
investment adviser at Nikko Securities (HK) Ltd. ``The government
isn't ready to throw in the towel quite yet.''
	   The government's market intervention has sparked a heated debate
in the territory. A poll commissioned by the mass-circulation Apple
Daily said 59.4 percent of respondents supported the government
buying spree, and 23.4 percent were against it.
	   Analysts believe the government might have spent more than U.S.
dlrs 6 billion by Wednesday, a sum it could well afford with its
massive reserves.
	   But they warn this is a war with no end, as the government would
be unable to unload the massive amount of shares it holds without
triggering a market collapse and inviting more speculators to the
market.
	   Critics urge the government to adopt long-term measures to make
it more difficult for speculators to profit from the market by
making the financial system more transparent and tightening
supervision.
	   ``If throwing money in the market is all the government can do,
victory will finally go to the speculators,'' the Hong Kong
Standard editorialized.
	   ``Winning this round may buy only temporary reprieve, and then
there will be a stronger temptation in the future to repeat the
intervention,'' wrote independent legislator Margaret Ng in the
South China Morning Post.
	   ``Money goes fast on a gambling table, and the reserves may run
too low too soon,'' he said.

Moody's downgrades credit rating of another major Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dealing the latest blow to confidence in Japan's
financial system, Moody's Investor Service said Friday that it cut
the long-term credit rating of Fuji Bank Ltd.
	   The U.S.-based debt rating agency lowered its rating of Fuji
Bank's long-term bonds to ``Baa2,'' which is two steps above
speculative, or ``junk,'' grade. The bank's previous rating was a
healthy ``A3.''
	   Moody's left its assessment of the bank's short-term debt
unchanged at ``Prime-2.''
	   The agency in a statement cited Japan's recession and the bank's
exposure to the shaky economies of Southeast Asia.
	   The move comes a day after Moody's cut its assessment of the
creditworthiness of two other Japanese banks, Asahi Bank Ltd. and
Tokai Bank Ltd.
	   Reduced creditworthiness indicates increased risk for investors,
so the downgrade could raise the banks' borrowing costs.
	   Last week, Moody's cut the credit ratings of Toyota Motor Corp.,
Japan's largest automaker, and two of the country's biggest
electronics makers, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.

Israel lifts closure on Palestinians in Hebron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli army lifted a week-long
closure of the West Bank city of Hebron Friday, reopening the area
where about 130,000 Palestinians live, a spokesman said.
	   In addition, a curfew in the center of the city controlled by
Israel was lifted for three hours to allow the 30,000 Palestinians
living there to buy food and necessities, the spokesman added.
	   The closure and curfew began after a rabbi was killed on Aug. 20
in his home in a Jewish enclave in the center of the city,
allegedly by Palestinians.
	   Skirmishes have broken out over the past week between settlers
and Palestinians when the curfew was lifted periodically but none
were reported early Friday.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers live in the area Israel controls, which
is located in the heart of the city holy to Jews and Muslims.
	   Although the Palestinians control the other section of Hebron,
the Israeli army can seal the city to prevent Palestinian travel in
and out of the area.

South Korea records ninth consecutive current account surplus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Decreasing imports helped South Korea
record a current account surplus of dlrs 3.67 billion in July, the
ninth consecutive monthly gain, the Bank of Korea said Friday.
	   The July figure pushed the nation's combined current account
surplus for the first seven months of the year to dlrs 25.47
billion, compared to a deficit of dlrs 11.12 billion during the
same period last year.
	   The July surplus compared to a deficit of dlrs 1.04 billion
during the same month last year, the central bank said in a
preliminary report.
	   The bank attributed the surplus to declining imports of raw
materials and consumer goods, caused by decreasing private spending
and industrial investment, amid the nation's worst financial crisis
in years.
	   July imports decreased by 44.4 percent to dlrs 6.92 billion from
a month ago, the biggest monthly contraction ever.
	   Exports also decreased by 9.6 percent to dlrs 10.87 billion last
month, creating a dlrs 3.95 billion trade surplus in July, the
ninth straight monthly gain.
	   Bank officials attributed the falling exports to a financial
crisis in Asia, a major South Korean market, and the appreciation
of the Korean won, which made Korean goods more expensive in
overseas markets.
	   ``We expect to see more current account surpluses in the coming
months because of falling imports, but the size will shrink as
exports are also falling,'' said Chung Jung-ho, a spokesman for the
bank.
	   The current account measures a nation's trade in goods and
services plus certain other capital flows. It is a key yardstick
for gauging a nation's economic health.

Council moves to suspend sanctions, threaten more on Lockerbie

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Calling on Libya to honor its pledges, the
Security Council has unanimously agreed to suspend sanctions
against Tripoli once it turns over two suspects in the fatal
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
	   The council voted 15-0 Thursday night to approve a resolution
that also threatens additional measures if the suspects fail to
appear for trial before a three-judge panel in the Netherlands.
	   ``This unanimous signal from the Security Council to the
authorities of Libya could not have been stronger,'' said Britain's
deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall. ``This is now the moment of
truth for Libya to come good on the commitments it has made.''
	   The two suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270
people.
	   Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, harshly criticized
the 6-year-old U.N. sanctions and the short amount of time Libya
was given to respond to a U.S.-British proposal for a trial in the
Netherlands.
	   Nevertheless, Libya ``accepts that the two suspects be tried in
a Scottish court in the Netherlands by Scottish judges according to
Scottish law,'' Dorda said. ``We reaffirm this position today.''
	   ``This is a serious position, an irreversible position,'' he
added.
	   Earlier Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in Tripoli
he wouldn't surrender the suspects until he received guarantees
that the United States and Britain wouldn't play ``tricks.''
	   He did not elaborate on what assurances he was seeking, but said
he wanted sanctions lifted immediately after an agreement on the
trial is reached.
	   Before issuing their compromise proposal, the United States and
Britain had insisted the trial be held in either the United States
or Britain. But Libya refused, saying the suspects could never get
a fair trial in either country.
	   There were concerns earlier Thursday that China might abstain
from voting on the resolution because it opposed a provision that
could allow the use of force if Libya failed to comply. But deputy
ambassador Shen Guofang said China voted in favor of the
resolution.
	   ``What we need now from the Libyans is not equivocal or
conditional statements, but simple straightforward acceptance,''
said U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh. ``We expect their deeds
to be the proof of their stated intentions.''
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to surrender
the two suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   Under the proposal, the suspects could not be extradited from
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would serve their sentences
in Britain.
	   The proposal stipulates the ``safe transfer'' of the suspects
from Libya to the Netherlands and says international observers may
attend the trial.
	   The resolution also insists that Libya satisfy a French
investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded
over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.

State Duma to meet Monday to vote on Chernomyrdin's confirmation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The lower house of parliament will meet Monday to
vote whether to confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as Russia's prime
minister, news agencies said Friday.
	   The decision was made by the agenda-setting council of the State
Duma. Chernomyrdin was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to try
to stem the country's mounting political and economic crisis.
	   Communists and their hard-line allies have said they will not
approve Chernomyrdin unless the government accepts a power-sharing
agreement and a package of economic measures that would impose
Soviet-era controls.

Malaysia will downgrade economic estimates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will lower its economic
estimates for 1998 after the once booming economy shrank by 6.8
percent in the second quarter, Malaysia's finance minister said
Friday.
	   ``We have to review the performance for the year,'' said Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who's also deputy prime minister. He added
that the revised numbers, likely to be released with October's
annual budget, would be ``slightly lower.''
	   Currently, the government expects the economy to shrink by up to
2 percent for the year. Most economists, however, believe a 5
percent contraction is more realistic.
	   They note that this estimate also dovetails with the central
bank's grim announcement Tuesday that the country has fallen into
full-blown recession after its second quarter gross domestic
product contracted by 6.8 percent.
	   Central bank officials and the country's top leaders, meanwhile,
have all said the worst is over for the Southeast Asian nation's
faltering economy.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday that the extent of
the country's dramatic economic slide will lessen in the second
half of the year, backing up what his top economics adviser, Daim
Zainuddin, said a day earlier.
	   Mahathir placed much of the blame on external factors,
particularly the recession in Japan, a main importer of Malaysian
products.
	   ``This consequently affected our manufacturing industries,'' the
premier said. The manufacturing sector shrank by 9.2 percent in the
second quarter of 1998, compared to a robust 13.5 percent growth
last year.
	   Central bank officials and Anwar have also chimed their
agreement with Mahathir's prognosis.
	   Anwar added that the government is looking at new steps to shore
up the Malaysian ringgit currency, which has lost around 40 percent
of its value since last July's financial crisis swept across Asia.
	   ``We are considering measures. I think we have to decide on it
soon,'' he said, without elaborating further.

Tokyo stocks close at 12-year low, dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index finished at
its lowest level in a dozen years Friday, undermined by Russia's
deepening political and economic crisis and steep falls overnight
on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed below the 14,000
points, losing 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, to finish the week
at 13,915.63.
	   It was the Nikkei's lowest finish since March 7, 1986, when it
closed at 13,994.63. Friday's fall followed a 452.24-point, or 3.04
percent, drop Thursday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 141.64
yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 2.02 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and below its late New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   The Nikkei index trimmed some of its early losses by midday on
bargain-hunting by institutional investors toward the end of the
morning session, but selling intensified again toward the closing
bell.
	   Japanese share prices plunged almost across the board, as
foreign and domestic institutional investors as well as individual
Japanese investors sold shares.
	   ``After dropping this much, the market should have factored in
all the foreseeable bad news,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager
at Ryoko Securities Co. ``The government must inject public funds
(into the market) before Japanese stocks become non-performing
assets, like real estate,'' Arai added.
	   Global stock markets went into free fall as news reports spread
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin may soon resign because of his
nation's financial crisis. The Kremlin denied the reports.
	   Russia's central bank froze dollar trading for a second day to
preserve its dwindling foreign reserves. The bank also called off
dollar trading for Friday.
	   Uncertainty buffeted other stock markets, with the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York falling 357.36 to 8,165.99, a
roughly 4 percent decline, on Thursday.
	   Another factor weighing on the market was poor earnings
prospects for Japanese companies amid the nation's worst recession
in decades.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and opposition parties remain at
loggerheads over critical bank reform bills promised for early
September.
	   While Obuchi wants to commit public funds to bailing out large
banks such as the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., opposition
lawmakers are demanding more extensive reform.
	   ``There is no more time for debate on bank reform,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, a general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. ``Speed
is of utmost importance.''
	   LTCB, the most actively traded issue, was up 3 yen at 54 yen
with 15.01 million shares changing hands.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 29.98 points, or 2.68 percent, at 1,086.99.
The TOPIX closed down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S.
currency Friday as overseas investors continued to take profits on
the dollar to make up for large losses resulting from investment in
markets in Russia and on Wall Street, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to a historical low of 1.060 percent from Thursday's
finish of 1.115 percent, driving its price up to 112.72 yen from
112.32 yen.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with State Duma to meet Monday to consider
Chernomyrdin's appointment. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's acting prime minister struggled to keep
the lid on his country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded the government step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters Thursday night.
	   President Boris Yeltsin was at work in the Kremlin on Friday,
where he met with visiting President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria,
his press service said. He had not been seen in public since
Tuesday, adding to the sense of crisis.
	   The Kremlin continued Friday to deny rumors that Yeltsin would
resign. Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky denounced the
murmurings late Thursday as ``absolutely groundless idle
inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service reiterated Friday that the summit with
President Bill Clinton in Moscow next week would go ahead as
scheduled.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed to meet Monday to consider the
confirmation of Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was
appointed by Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's
mounting political and financial crisis.
	   The decision was made by the agenda-setting council of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament. Communists and their hard-line
allies who dominate the chamber have said they will not approve
Chernomyrdin unless the government accepts a power-sharing
agreement and Soviet-era economic measures such as currency
controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   The power-sharing agreement would give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies. It would also offer
certain guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a
president steps down. This provision has fueled media speculation
that Yeltsin's resignation was imminent.
	   It was clear that after years and months of insisting that free
market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now willing to at
least consider some retrenchment.
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job last March, was brought
back in a surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, to ensure that 25
million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''
	   Most Russians keep their money at home in dollars, and for them
the crisis will have a minimal impact. Still, the devaluation has
revived memories of the hyperinflation of the early 90s, and those
who do have rubles are eager to exchange them for hard currency.
	   ``I wouldn't say there's panic,'' said 35-year-old kiosk owner
Arkady Charyan. ``The only panic is at the foreign exchange
offices, where people have rubles and they're trying to change
them.''

Global selloff continues in Japan and Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Tokyo stocks closing at their
lowest level since March 1986, Hong Kong stocks falling further and
setting a new trading volume level, Singapore stocks recovering
most of their opening losses. &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday
to urge investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about
Russia's economic chaos and a new six-year low on Japan's benchmark
stock index proved more persuasive.
	   As soon as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged once
again, and by the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest
level in 12 years. Even the dollar _ normally sought as a safety
net in times of crisis _ tumbled against the Japanese currency.
	   The developments in Asia appeared to indicate that the global
free fall that began Thursday was not yet complete. The Dow Jones
industrial average in New York tumbled 357.36 points Thursday as
the deepening crisis in Russia and doubts about Japan's handling of
its recession jolted stock markets around the world.
	   ``The drops are so large, it's not just fundamentals driving
this, people are scared,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly scheduled
news conference Friday to urge investors to remain calm. ``The most
important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped below 14,000 in early
trading and closed at its lowest level since March 1986.
	   At its deepest point, the index was down 591.56 points, or 4.10
percent, to 13,822.23. It recovered somewhat, closing 13,915.63,
down 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday.
	   On Thursday, the Nikkei fell 452.24 points, or 3.04 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar dropped sharply
in early trading, but recovered somewhat by the afternoon, buying
141.64 yen. That was down 2.02 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and
below its late New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   Stock markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also continued their
plunge Friday morning, but Singapore later recovered.
	   After only 15 minutes of heavy trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng
Index was down 48.10 points to 7,874.87. By the time it closed for
lunch, the index had fallen 63.14 points, or 0.89 percent, to
7,845.34. Trading volume reached an all-time high of Hong Kong dlrs
46.1 billion (U.S. dlrs 5.9 billion).
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd. ``There is a battle going on.''
	   For two weeks, the Hong Kong government has been propping up the
local stock and stock futures markets in an effort to punish
speculators. If the government ``wins,'' stocks could move higher
Friday, but with world markets sharply lower, the forces working
against that possibility were intense, analysts said.
	   Across Hong Kong, people watched nervously at computer monitors
flashing the latest market news at banks and Internet providers. On
buses and subways, they read front-page newspaper stories about a
showdown between officials and speculators.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index
quickly crashed through the crucial 900-point level, tumbling 28.17
points, or 3.1 percent, to 882.71. But by late afternoon it had
recovered most of the day's losses.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
``People are watching what is happening everywhere, in Russia, in
Latin America. They are sitting on the sidelines, very nervous.''
	   Much of the nervousness came from fears of another day like
Thursday. The Dow's 4.2 percent drop means the index is now 1,171
points below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   In Russia, stocks plummeted 17 percent after trading was twice
suspended. The ruble continued to slide against the dollar, and the
government suspended dollar sales for the rest of the week.
Pressure also mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign.
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   Japan, the world's second largest economy, has been widely
criticized for not doing enough to revive its economy. Its new
government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo on Friday.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that shows the Nikkei stock
prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   ``I'm afraid this might lead to a big depression,'' said
Takehiko Morooka, 29, another worker. If that happens, he said, he
will blame it on Japan's politicians.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people were told to evacuate
their homes Friday as Tropical Storm Rex _ already blamed for
mudslides, flooding and at least 12 deaths _ dumped torrential
rains across much of Japan.
	   Nearly 40,000 people were told to flee their homes in Mito, a
city about 100 kilometers (63 miles) northeast of Tokyo, because of
possible flooding from the rains, which began Wednesday night.
	   Police confirmed 12 deaths by Friday afternoon, with 4 missing
and 30 injured. Japanese media said at least 13 people had died.
	   Rex was located 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo at
midafternoon Friday and moving north, according to the
Meteorological Agency. It said the storm had sustained wind speeds
of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour near its center.
	   The rains have been caused by the storm pushing warm, wet air
from the central Pacific Ocean north.
	   Some 1,000 soldiers trudged through mud and debris Friday near
the town of Nasu, just north of Tokyo, for the people still missing
after a river burst its banks Thursday. News reports said they
recovered the body of a man, leaving three people unaccounted for.
	   The torrent also killed a 60-year-old university professor and
destroyed or damaged more than 34 houses in the town, which has
seen a record 839 millimeters (33.6 inches) falling since the rains
began at about midnight Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, officials in Fukushima prefecture, 175 kilometers
(110 miles) north of Tokyo, were investigating why a warning never
reached an institution for the handicapped where five people died
when a mudslide slammed into their building Thursday morning.
	   In the immediate Tokyo area, the effects of the storm were
limited mainly to disruption of transportation.
	   Several highways and train lines were closed in and around
Tokyo. East Japan Railway Co. reduced traffic along the Chuo line
running through central Tokyo by 80 percent.
	   The railway also halted bullet trains between the cities of
Yokohama and Atami, southwest of the capital.

Singapore conducts its biggest pornographic video raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Police seized more than 300,000 pornographic
video computer discs and broke up four distribution rings in
Singapore's biggest such raid ever, news media reported Friday.
	   According to The Straits Times newspaper, 42 people were
arrested including the four suspected ringleaders.
	   Because the groups normally cooperate in alerting each other,
160 officers made swoops all at once throughout the island on
Thursday in an operation that took five months of planning, the
paper quoted police as saying.
	   A major target was a two-story house where police found the
three bedrooms had been turned into a virtual pornographic library,
with video CDs arranged by title and language and a movie theater
system for playing the tapes.
	   By Thursday night police officers were still counting video CDs
that they found in almost every nook and cranny, including kitchen
cabinets.
	   The videos were sold from makeshift stalls at bus interchanges,
subway stations and in some shops, the reports said.
	   The maximum punishment for distributing an obscene film or
possessing it for distribution is two years in prison and an 80,000
Singapore dollar (dlrs 45,450) fine.
	   Those possessing pornographic films, but not involved in their
distribution, face one year in jail and a 40,000 dollar (dlrs
22,725) fine.

Malaysia will downgrade economic estimates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day of GDP announcement to Thursday sted Tuesday in
graf 4

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will lower its economic
estimates for 1998 after the once booming economy shrank by 6.8
percent in the second quarter, Malaysia's finance minister said
Friday.
	   ``We have to review the performance for the year,'' said Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who's also deputy prime minister. He added
that the revised numbers, likely to be released with October's
annual budget, would be ``slightly lower.''
	   Currently, the government expects the economy to shrink by up to
2 percent for the year. Most economists, however, believe a 5
percent contraction is more realistic.
	   They note that this estimate also dovetails with the central
bank's grim announcement Thursday that the country has fallen into
full-blown recession after its second quarter gross domestic
product contracted by 6.8 percent.
	   Central bank officials and the country's top leaders, meanwhile,
have all said the worst is over for the Southeast Asian nation's
faltering economy.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday that the extent of
the country's dramatic economic slide will lessen in the second
half of the year, backing up what his top economics adviser, Daim
Zainuddin, said a day earlier.
	   Mahathir placed much of the blame on external factors,
particularly the recession in Japan, a main importer of Malaysian
products.
	   ``This consequently affected our manufacturing industries,'' the
premier said. The manufacturing sector shrank by 9.2 percent in the
second quarter of 1998, compared to a robust 13.5 percent growth
last year.
	   Central bank officials and Anwar have also chimed their
agreement with Mahathir's prognosis.
	   Anwar added that the government is looking at new steps to shore
up the Malaysian ringgit currency, which has lost around 40 percent
of its value since last July's financial crisis swept across Asia.
	   ``We are considering measures. I think we have to decide on it
soon,'' he said, without elaborating further.

U.S. giving another dlrs 185,000 for drought aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The United States is giving Vietnam an
additional dlrs 185,000 to help the country fight an ongoing
drought in the central part of the country, the U.S. Information
Service said Friday.
	   Ambassador Pete Peterson was meeting a Foreign Affairs official
friday to relay details of the assistance, which Vietnam has sought
from foreign governments and international organizations. Earlier
this month, the U.S. Embassy committed dlrs 25,000.
	   ``The people of the United States hope this humanitarian
assistance will help to quickly relieve the suffering of people in
central Vietnam's drought-stricken area,'' Peterson said.
	   The funds will be divided evenly among the three provinces that
have been hit hardest _ Quang Tri, Quang Binh and Ha Tinh _ by the
region's worst drought in 90 years. The area also has been plagued
by outbreaks of dengue fever and malaria.
	   Administered by the U.N. Development Program and the
International Federation of Red Cross, the money will be used to
drill wells, buy and install water pumps, buy portable water
containers and build elevated water storage tanks.
	   The national Agriculture Department estimated two weeks ago that
2.5 million people in 14 provinces were short of water, with
345,000 acres (140,000 hectares) of rice paddies affected.
	   The falling water table has allowed encroachment by ocean
saltwater up to 20 miles (32 kms) inland.
	   A drought earlier in the year caused an estimated dlrs 385
million in damage to crops nationwide.
	   The El Nino weather phenomenon has largely been blamed for both,
although deforestation from slash-and-burn farming has contributed.

Deaths linked to poisoned Cambodian rice wine mounting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The number of deaths blamed on
poisoned rice wine climbed to 28 Friday, according to officials who
reported 12 new deaths overnight.
	   ``We are very much concerned,'' said Kruoch Phan, chief of Phnom
Penh's Dangkao district, where many of the victims lived. ``We have
started confiscating wine from the stocks and closing shops that
sell it.''
	   City officials say that insecticide, often added to rice wine in
Cambodia with the mistaken belief that it increases the wine's
potency, is responsible for the deaths.
	   The first symptoms of poisoning are dizziness and sweating.
	   In 1996, more than 40 people were killed by tainted brew. The
most recent deaths all occurred this week.
	   Residents in several Phnom Penh districts have started shooting
in the air and in fields to evict evil spirits believed to be tied
to the poison-related deaths, Rasmei Kampuchea newspaper reported.
	   Kruoch Phan said that some of the victims were said to drink
more one liter (quart) a day of rice wine.

Protesters from Indonesian province rally for independence

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Chanting and singing, about 150
separatist protesters from the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya
rallied Friday outside the Foreign Ministry.
	   The demonstrators accused the government of human rights abuses
in the remote eastern territory, home to a small band of rebels.
Three people, including a police officer, were killed in
pro-independence rallies in Irian Jaya last month.
	   The protesters wore T-shirts with the image of their separatist
flag, which is white and blue with a red star.
	   Several truckloads of soldiers with rifles pulled up near the
rally site, prompting protesters to shout angrily. ``You are
butchers,'' one woman screamed.
	   Resentment toward the Indonesian military runs deep in several
provinces where soldiers have been accused of atrocities while
fighting separatist movements.
	   Last week, a human rights panel visited mass graves in northern
Aceh province, uncovering dozens of bones of people believed to be
victims of the military.
	   Trying to revamp its image, the military has pulled some troops
out of Aceh and East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   The more conciliatory approach falls in line with democratic
reforms pledged by President B.J. Habibie, who took over from his
autocratic predecessor, Suharto, in May.
	   Irian Jaya, which comprises the western half of New Guinea, is
the easternmost province of Indonesia and was taken over from the
Dutch in 1963.
	   Six years later, people in the territory formally chose
integration with Indonesia through a U.N.-sponsored vote.

Australian dollar plunges to new low amid global market turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS and UPDATES with end-of-day details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar and stocks staged
a mild recovery Friday after turmoil on global markets overnight
sent the currency tumbling to unprecedented lows.
	   The Australian dollar fell to 55.30 U.S. cents,the lowest level
since the currency was floated in 1983, prompting the Reserve Bank
to intervene to prop up the currency, dealers said.
	   The intervention stabilized the currency, but was not enough to
erase negative foreign exchange market sentiment.
	   Just before the end of local trading at 5 p.m. (0700 GMT), the
dollar had recovered to 56.09 U.S. cents.
	   The All Ordinaries Index of shares finished down Friday by 43.7
points, or 1.7 percent, at 2516.9 after plunging to 2461.3 in early
trade after sharp drops on overseas markets overnight Thursday.
	   An escalation of the turmoil in Russian markets reverberated
throughout global markets overnight, with commodity-based economies
like Australia's coming under renewed pressure, dealers said.
	   Russia's problems were accentuated by unconfirmed rumors that
president Boris Yeltsin might resign, they said.
	   The effects were also felt in New Zealand, where the New Zealand
dollar fell below 48 U.S. cents. It recovered slightly Friday and
finished the day at 48.87 U.S. cents.
	   The New Zealand stockmarket dived three percent to its lowest
level since 1993. The NZSE-40 capital index closed at 1847.73, down
63.10 points.
	   Analysts in Australia said the Reserve Bank may lift official
interest rates to support the dollar. Overnight, Canada and Norway
lifted interest rates to try to save their own beleaguered
currencies.
	   With national elections looming, Treasurer Peter Costello and
Prime Minister John Howard both declined to comment on the
currency's plight and the prospects of a rate rise.
	   ``We can't control what happens on international financial
markets, no government can,'' Howard said in a radio interview.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Foreign donors announced grants Friday
to help Bangladesh buy food and medicines to cope with the
century's worst floods that have kept two-thirds of the nation
under water for nearly two months.
	   Bangladesh appealed this week for dlrs 600 million in emergency
foreign aid as the lingering floods washed way thousands of homes,
roads, bridges and flood protection embankments.
	   The deluge has so far claimed nearly 600 lives and displaced
thousands of people. More than 25 million people have been marooned
in the flooded villages and towns.
	   In response to the appeal, the United States has promised to
give 260,000 tons of mostly wheat to feed the flood-hit people, the
American embassy in Dhaka said Friday.
	   The European Commission will give dlrs 500,000 to buy food and
medicines, Michael Drury, head of the EC delegation in Dhaka said
on Friday.
	   Germany has provided medicines and clothes worth dlrs 327,000,
its embassy in Dhaka said.
	   ``The donors are prepared to help Bangladesh overcome the flood
disaster,'' Pierre Landell-Mills, head of the Dhaka office of the
World Bank said.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called off her visit to Durban,
South Africa, for the Non-Aligned Summit to supervise the relief
work, her press secretary Jawadul Karim said.
	   Floods regularly ravage the low-lying delta nation. The latest
floods began six weeks ago.
	   Meanwhile, a depression in the Bay of Bengal whipped up 40 mph
(65 kph) winds that caused high tides and slowed draining of waters
from the plains, the Meteorological Department in Dhaka said.

Plane crash site in Myanmar, not Laos, say officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A missing Myanmar Airways passenger plane
previously reported to have crashed into a mountain in Laos
actually crashed inside Myanmar, government officials said Friday.
	   There were apparently no survivors. Thirty-three people were
believed to have been abroad the Fokker Friendship F-27 aircraft,
although the passenger manifest lists fewer.
	   Contradictory information on the plane' fate had been issued
nearly every day since it went missing Monday on a flight from the
Myanmar capital of Yangon to the northeastern city of Tachilek.
	   On Friday, officials informed the families of some of those
aboard that wreckage from the plane and the remains of some of
those aboard had been found at a place called Manibagi, about 25
kilometers (15 miles) east of Tachilek. The area is close to the
border with Laos.
	   A government spokesman, contacted by The Associated Press, gave
the same information.
	   The spokesman's office on Thursday had issued a statement saying
that ``Government officials from Laos informed the Myanmar
Government that a F-27 aircraft crashed in north of Laos on the
Payakha mountain.''
	   Earlier in the week an airline official had said the passengers
were safe after an emergency landing in Laos.
	   State-run newspapers Friday morning had said that the search for
the plane was continuing on the basis of unconfirmed reports it had
landed.
	   The reports said Deputy Transport Minister Brig.-Gen. Kyaw Myint
and the ruling junta's chairman for Shan State, Maj.-Gen. Thein
Sein, were supervising the aerial and ground search from Tachilek
airport.
	   Some of the victim's families were preparing Friday to travel to
Tachilek. Some had prepared for a funeral at the first news of the
plane's disappearance, but suspended their plans after the more
hopeful reports emerged.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar _ also known as Burma - Thailand and
Laos converge.
	   The area is extremely rugged and isolated and communications are
difficult.
	   Before the plane disappeared, its crew had contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were reportedly infants.
	   On January 27, another F-27 operated by state-owned Myanmar
Airways crashed while trying to take off from the city of Thandwe
on Myanmar's west coast, killing more than a dozen passengers.

Pakistan introduces sweeping new Islamic laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
introduced a constitutional amendment Friday to scrap the country's
legal system and replace it with one based on the Muslim holy book,
the Koran.
	   Sharif's majority government is not expected to have any trouble
acquiring the two-thirds majority required to pass the amendment.
Parliament is expected to debate for several days before taking a
vote.
	   Sharif promised a ``true Islamic welfare state'' that would be
based exclusively on the Koran as well as the Sunnat, the writings
of Islam's prophet Mohammed.
	   ``Simple changes in laws are not enough,'' Sharif told
Parliament in a televised address to the nation. ``I want to
implement complete Islamic laws where the Koran and the Sunnat are
supreme.''
	   Sharif promised that the new laws will protect the rights of
women and minorities in Pakistan, where 95 percent of the country's
140 million people are Muslims.
	   While the current legal system is rooted in British common law,
Pakistan already has taken tentative steps toward Islamic rule.
	   On the books since the late 1970s are laws governing rape, which
requires four male witnesses. The same law also provides the death
penalty by stoning for having sex outside of marriage.
	   In the early 1990s Pakistan passed the Islamic law governing the
death penalty which allows the family members of a victim to decide
whether the murderer can go free or be executed.
	   But Sharif on Friday told the nation that the latest amendment
to the constitution would be sweeping. The new law could possibly
effect most aspects of life in Pakistan.
	   Sharif assured minority religious groups they would be allowed
to practice their religion freely and that women's rights would be
protected. He said that education under Islam is guaranteed for
both men and women.
	   His emphasis on education for women appeared to be an attempt to
make it clear that Pakistan's version of Islamic law is not the
same as neighboring Afghanistan, where the Taliban religious army
has imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law on its people.
	   The Taliban has banned women from school, forced them off the
job, demanded they stay indoors and travel outside only when
accompanied by a close male relative.
	   Sharif, by comparison, said he wanted Pakistan's version of
Islamic rule to be an example of an Islamic welfare state that he
said guaranteed freedoms and would eradicate the corruption and
lawlessness that has become rampant in Pakistan.

British cameraman found dead in hotel room
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ A British television cameraman was
found dead in this rugged frontier city near the border with
neighboring Afghanistan, authorities said Friday.
	   The cameraman, who police identified as Carlos Mavroleon, was
found dead in his hotel room late on Thursday.
	   An autopsy is being conducted, however police say they do not
believe the cameraman was killed.
	   A syringe was found near the body, although it wasn't
immediately known whether any drugs were found in the room.
	   The cameraman had tried to cross the border into Afghanistan
earlier this week, but had been turned back by the authorities,
police said. Police refused to give further details.

Warnings extended; Sydney water contamination worse than thought
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with later test results; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's water contamination crisis
worsened Friday, with authorities extending health warnings and
urging residents to be vigilant about not drinking tap water
without boiling it first.
	   The new warnings came as organizers of the 2000 Olympics said
the contamination scare, the second in Sydney in a month,
threatened to ``dent'' the city's international reputation.
	   Health warnings would remain in place for at least the weekend,
as the results of tests for the dangerous microscopic parasites
cryptosporidium and giardia vary wildly, authorities said.
	   Testing late Thursday found cryptosporidium in Sydney's water at
levels ten times higher than when warnings were first issued, said
Michael Reid, director general of the New South Wales state health
department.
	   The levels of a second parasite, giardia, were also higher than
previously recorded.
	   But testing on Friday showed no signs of cryptosporidium or
giardia.
	   The all-clear would not be given until a series of tests showed
no signs of the parasites, authorities said.
	   Still, no cases of illness have been reported as a result of the
latest outbreak in Sydney or the one that preceded it in late July.
The warning last month lasted a week.
	   Reid said health warnings had been extended to cover areas
previously thought to be safe. Almost all of the city's 3.7 million
residents have been told to boil tap water for at least one minute
or risk illness from the parasites.
	   Only boiled water should be used for drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing foods and making ice, the department said.
Schoolchildren should take bottled water to school.
	   Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy Holloway said the city was
being closely watched overseas, and the problem needed to be fixed
quickly and permanently.
	   ``We are on show,'' Holloway said. ``For it to happen twice
suggests we have a problem that needs rapid resolution. Were this
to happen periodically between now and the Games this would dent
our image.''
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems, including the very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, in 1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000
others were sickened.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Yeltsin meeting
Primakov,

<TEXT>
	   TV pictures, new bond offering, TRIMS pvs.
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government struggled to keep the
lid on the country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded Boris Yeltsin step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told
reporters Thursday night.
	   President Yeltsin was at work in the Kremlin on Friday, after
not being seen in public since Tuesday, adding to the sense of
crisis. He looked relaxed and fit.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of him smiling and talking
energetically with acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he ``would not
even like to reproduce'' Yeltsin's reaction to calls for his
resignation. On Thursday Yastrzhembsky denounced the murmurings
that Yeltsin may resign as ``absolutely groundless idle
inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with President Bill Clinton in Moscow next week would go ahead as
scheduled. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov and was
scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed that lawmakers would meet Monday to
consider the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was appointed by
Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's mounting political
and financial crisis.
	   The decision was made by the agenda-setting council of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament. Communists and their hard-line
allies who dominate the chamber have said they will not approve
Chernomyrdin unless the government accepts a power-sharing
agreement and Soviet-era economic measures such as currency
controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   The power-sharing agreement would give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies. It would also offer
certain guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a
president steps down. This provision has fueled media speculation
that Yeltsin's resignation was imminent.
	   It was clear that after years and months of insisting that free
market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now willing to at
least consider some retrenchment.
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Acting Economics Minister Yakov Urinson, who has held talks with
parliamentary leaders this week, said Friday the proposals would
include printing more money _ another favored Soviet response to
covering budget deficits.
	   He said the government would take steps to prevent this from
fueling inflation _ something many economists say would be
difficult to achieve.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job in March, was brought
back in a surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The government said Friday it would try to sell 1 billion
rubles worth of short-term bonds next week. At the official
exchange rate, that would be dlrs 127 million.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, to ensure that 25
million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession,
with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter, the government announced Friday.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang also said the economy is
expected to shrink by 4 percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99,
compared with a 3.5-percent growth forecast earlier this year.
	   The territory's economy shrank in the first quarter by 2.8
percent.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last
decade and expanded 5.3 percent in 1997, has now fallen into its
worst recession in 13 years.
	   A recession is generally defined as two quarters of shrinking
gross domestic product.
	   Hong Kong now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
including Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia. All of which
have been jolted by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's economic crisis better
than many other economies, the region's ills have slowly spread to
the territory.
	   Contagion from Asia's financial crisis and a slew of domestic
factors forced officials to scrap its target of a 3.5 percent GDP
growth in May.
	   Tsang forecast the economy will shrink by 4 percent, but the
government has no plans tpo cut spending.
	   ``Japan's economic and financial troubles seem to be
intensifying,'' Tsang said. ``This is outside of our control.''
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent, property
values have fallen by up to 40 percent, and interest rates under
Hong Kong's system to protect its currency, the last fully
convertible Asian currency that has not depreciated in the region's
financial crisis.
	   The official announcement of a recession was no big surprise to
many who have watched their businesses slowdown and investments
lose up to half their value over the past year.
	   To fend off speculators threatening to force officials to scrap
the 13-year currency peg with the U.S. dollar, the government
continued Friday to scoop up shares to drive the key stock index
up.

summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton are
expected to make a joint statement on global security during a
Russian-U.S. summit in Moscow next week, the Kremlin said Friday.
	   Yeltsin discussed preparations for the summit on Friday with
acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and was scheduled to meet
later in the day with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott.
	   The presidential press service said that Yeltsin and Clinton
plan to sign a joint statement addressing the challenges to global
security on the eve of next century.
	   It quoted Yeltsin as saying that the statement is extremely
important and has a ``strategic character,'' the Interfax news
agency reported. It gave no other details.
	   Yeltsin and Clinton are expected to discuss arms control,
regional problems and economic cooperation at their two-day summit
beginning Tuesday.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government struggled to keep the
lid on the country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded Boris Yeltsin step down.
	   ``Now I have sorted out the situation in full and can say:
Although it is certainly not simple, it is absolutely
controllable,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told
reporters Thursday night.
	   President Yeltsin was at work in the Kremlin on Friday, after
not being seen in public since Tuesday, adding to the sense of
crisis. He looked relaxed and fit.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of him smiling and talking
energetically with acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he ``would not
even like to reproduce'' Yeltsin's reaction to calls for his
resignation. On Thursday Yastrzhembsky called the murmurings
``absolutely groundless idle inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as scheduled
next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov and was
scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed that lawmakers would meet Monday to
consider the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was appointed by
Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's mounting political
and financial crisis.
	   The decision was made by the agenda-setting council of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament. Communists and their hard-line
allies who dominate the chamber have said they will not approve
Chernomyrdin unless the government accepts a power-sharing
agreement and Soviet-era economic measures such as currency
controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   The power-sharing agreement would give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies. It would also offer
certain guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a
president steps down. This provision has fueled speculation that
Yeltsin's resignation was imminent.
	   The Kremlin on Friday said it disagrees with the parliament's
power-sharing plan and called for additional consultations.
	   It was clear, however, that after years and months of insisting
that free market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin is now
willing to at least consider some retrenchment in the economic
field.
	   Kremlin officials have taken part in the deliberations, but it
was unclear how much support the specific proposals may have from
Yeltsin and his team.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, said
Chernomyrdin agreed with the hard-liners' economic proposals and
would present them to parliament as his own program, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Chernomyrdin's spokesman Konstantin Voitsekhovich refused to
confirm the report. Chernomyrdin was expected to attend final
discussions on the power-sharing agreement and the economic
proposals later on Friday.
	   Acting Economics Minister Yakov Urinson, who has held talks with
parliamentary leaders this week, said Friday the proposals would
include printing more money _ another favored Soviet response to
covering budget deficits.
	   He said the government would take steps to prevent this from
fueling inflation _ something many economists say would be
difficult to achieve.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired from the job in March, was brought
back in a surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more
experienced leader to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The government said Friday it would try to sell 1 billion
rubles worth of short-term bonds next week. At the official
exchange rate, that would be dlrs 127 million.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, to ensure that 25
million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks try to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''

Controversial Mochovce plant goes fully on line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The controversial nuclear power
plant at Mochovce went fully on line Friday, feeding electricity
into Slovakia's national grid, a government official said.
	   The 440-megawatt reactor, which has been criticized as unsafe by
neighboring Austria, was officially connected to the grid in a
``gala ceremony'' in front of the plant, attended by government
officials, including Premier Vladimir Meciar, and international
guests, Eleonora Pernicka of the Slovak Economics Ministry said.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency was
represented by its deputy director Zygmund Domaratzky, who is the
IAEA's director of nuclear safety, and other officials.
	   The second of the Mochovce plant's two generators was already
turned on in early July, feeding 30 megawatts into the Slovakia's
mational grid.
	   The plant is just 120 kilometers (72 miles) east of Austria,
which has campaigned strongly against its activation, arguing that
certain features of the heavy-water pressure reactor make it
unsafe.
	   Mochovce is a Soviet-designed plant subsequently equipped with
Western technology. In May, a team of 22 international experts
inspected the plant and noted safety changes made at the station,
but also complained that the company operating it had failed to
release necessary documents.
	   Austria is the only country in the world to have built a nuclear
power plant, then mothballed it after voting in 1978 by referendum
against putting it on line or having nuclear power.
	   Austria is worried that a Chernobyl-type disaster at Mochovce _
or other nuclear plants in neighboring Slovakia and the Czech
Republic _ would affect hundreds of thousands of its citizens.
	   Austria is particularly worried that the Czech-produced pressure
vessel made of special steel is safe for only the first five years,
and that nuclear reaction will weaken its quality. Slovak officials
have dismissed those concerns as unfounded.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices nosedived to their lowest
levels in a dozen years Friday when fears about global financial
turmoil and the stalled domestic economy prompted a broad sell-off.
	   The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed below the 14,000
points, losing 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, to finish the week
at 13,915.63.
	   It was the Nikkei's lowest finish since March 6, 1986, when it
closed at 13,901.56, and the third consecutive day of falls _
Wednesday's 206.90-point fall and a 452.24-point, or 3.04-percent,
drop Thursday.
	   ``It's difficult to find where the bottom line will be at this
time,'' said Masaru Takagi, an economics professor at Tokyo's Meiji
University.
	   Traders said declines in world financial markets were rattling
each market, with U.S. stock prices being influenced by financial
turmoil in Russia and Asia and Asian stock markets being affected
by movements in the United States and elsewhere.
	   The Nikkei average trimmed some of its early losses by midday on
bargain-hunting by institutional investors, but selling intensified
again toward the closing bell.
	   Japanese share prices plunged almost across the board, as
foreign and domestic institutional investors as well as individual
Japanese investors sold shares.
	   Masaru Arai, general manager at Ryoko Securities Co., said the
Japanese government should inject public funds into the market
before domestic stocks become non-performing assets, like real
estate.
	   World stock markets went into free fall as news reports spread
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin may soon resign because of his
nation's financial crisis. The Kremlin denied the reports.
	   Uncertainty buffeted other stock markets, with the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York shed a roughly 4 percent decline on
Thursday.
	   Another factor weighing on the market was poor earnings
prospects for Japanese companies amid the nation's worst recession
in decades.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, director general of Japan's Economic Planning
Agency told reporters that the nation's economy for April-June and
July-September quarters may show negative growth as the economic
condition remains ``extremely severe.''
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi wants to commit public funds to
bailing out large banks saddled with bad debts, such as the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., but opposition lawmakers are
demanding more extensive reform. Parliament continued debating the
measure.
	   LTCB, the most actively traded issue, was up 3 yen at 54 yen
with 15.01 million shares changing hands on Friday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 29.98 points, or 2.68 percent, at 1,086.99.
The TOPIX closed down 30.24 points, or 2.64 percent, the day
before.
	   Trading remained fairly active, with 565 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Thursday's 505 million shares.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,095 to 133, with 75 issues
unchanged.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 143.32 yen, down 0.34 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
142.18 yen overnight. Trades ranged between 140.20 yen and 144.25
yen in Friday's trading.
	   The dollar, which remained around 141.00 yen for much of
Friday's trading, gained ground after an unfounded rumor late
afternoon that a major Japanese commercial bank was in severe
financial trouble, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.070 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.115 percent, driving its price up to 112.65 yen from 112.32 yen.

	   Israel says no request to arrest father of U.S. murder suspect
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The justice ministry has not received a request
from the United States to arrest the father of an American suspect
in a murder case, who allegedly helped his son flee to Israel, a
spokeswoman said Friday.
	   Sol Sheinbein is staying in Israel with his son, Samuel, who
police say murdered an acquaintance in Maryland and then left the
country to escape charges.
	   Samuel Sheinbein fled two days after the charred and dismembered
body of Alfredo Enrique Tello, Jr. was discovered in a garage near
the Sheinbein home on Sept. 19 last year.
	   He was arrested by Israeli police upon his arrival in the
country and an Israeli district court is slated to rule by Sept. 1
on a request from the United States for his extradition.
	   The father was charged by prosecutors in the case this week with
obstruction of justice for allegedly providing the airplane ticket
and financial support to send his son to Israel.
	   Prosecutors said Thursday that they had contacted the Sheinbein
family lawyers about the arrest warrant of the father for the
misdemeanor charge.
	   But justice ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed said Israel had yet
to receive any formal or informal request from the United States
regarding the father's arrest.
	   The family has insisted that Samuel Sheinbein has Israeli
citizenship through his father and thus cannot be extradited to the
United States under Israeli law.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession,
with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter, the government announced Friday.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang also said the economy is
expected to shrink by 4 percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99,
compared with a 3.5-percent growth forecast earlier this year.
	   The territory's economy shrank in the first quarter by 2.8
percent.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last
decade and expanded 5.3 percent in 1997, has now fallen into its
worst recession in 13 years.
	   A recession is generally defined as two quarters of shrinking
gross domestic product.
	   Hong Kong now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
including Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia. All of which
have been jolted by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered Asia's economic crisis better
than many other economies, the region's ills have slowly spread to
the territory.
	   Contagion from Asia's financial crisis and a slew of domestic
factors forced officials to scrap its target of a 3.5 percent GDP
growth in May.
	   Tsang forecast the economy will shrink by 4 percent, but the
government has no plans to cut spending.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank governor
and his deputy tendered their resignations on Friday, a day after
the government announced the economy had fallen into full-blown
recession.
	   Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don, and deputy governor,
Fong Weng Phak, submitted their resignations to Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   Bank Negara officials could not be reached immediately, but an
announcement was expected later Friday.
	   Market observers have speculated that the resignations may be a
direct result of the sharp contraction in the Malaysian economy,
which Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has blamed repeatedly on the
central bank's tight monetary policy.
	   The central bank announced Thursday that the country's second
quarter gross domestic product shrank by 6.8 percent compared with
the same period last year, pitching the economy into recession for
the first time in 13 years.
	   Mahathir has long blamed high interest rates _ a policy Bank
Negara adopted to stabilize the ringgit and keep a lid on inflation
_ for strangling business activity and curbing economic activity.
	    &UR; ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will lower its economic
estimates for 1998 after the once booming economy shrank by 6.8
percent in the second quarter, Malaysia's finance minister said
Friday.
	   ``We have to review the performance for the year,'' said Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who's also deputy prime minister. He added
that the revised numbers, likely to be released with October's
annual budget, would be ``slightly lower.''
	   Currently, the government expects the economy to shrink by up to
2 percent for the year. Most economists, however, believe a 5
percent contraction is more realistic.
	   They note that this estimate also dovetails with the central
bank's grim announcement Tuesday that the country has fallen into
full-blown recession after its second quarter gross domestic
product contracted by 6.8 percent.
	   Central bank officials and the country's top leaders, meanwhile,
have all said the worst is over for the Southeast Asian nation's
faltering economy.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate improved in July from the
previous month, but joblessness remained at an ``extremely severe''
level, the government announced Friday.
	   Unemployment in July fell from 4.1 percent from the previous
month's record high of 4.3 percent, according to a report issued by
the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency.
	   The report was otherwise gloomy, however.
	   It said the overall number of people employed in Japan declined
from a year ago for the sixth straight month. The number of
employed fell by 720,000 to 65.77 million people during July.	   The number of newly hired also fell, by 550,000 from a year ago,
for its sixth straight month of year-on-year declines.
	   By age group, men between the age of 15 and 24 remained the
hardest hit, with an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent, up 1.6
percentage points.
	   ``The situation remains extremely severe,'' the agency said.
	   In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said Friday the ratio
of job offers to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor,
fell to 0.50 from 0.51 in June, the lowest level since the ministry
began compiling the data in January 1963.
	    &UR; ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Decreasing imports helped South Korea
record a current account surplus of dlrs 3.67 billion in July, the
ninth consecutive monthly gain, the Bank of Korea said Friday.
	   The July figure pushed the nation's combined current account
surplus for the first seven months of the year to dlrs 25.47
billion, compared to a deficit of dlrs 11.12 billion during the
same period last year.
	   The July surplus compared to a deficit of dlrs 1.04 billion
during the same month last year, the central bank said in a
preliminary report.
	   The bank attributed the surplus to declining imports of raw
materials and consumer goods, caused by decreasing private spending
and industrial investment, amid the nation's worst financial crisis
in years.
	   July imports decreased by 44.4 percent to dlrs 6.92 billion from
a month ago, the biggest monthly contraction ever.
	   Exports also decreased by 9.6 percent to dlrs 10.87 billion last
month, creating a dlrs 3.95 billion trade surplus in July, the
ninth straight monthly gain.
	   Bank officials attributed the falling exports to a financial
crisis in Asia, a major South Korean market, and the appreciation
of the Korean won, which made Korean goods more expensive in
overseas markets.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dealing the latest blow to confidence in Japan's
financial system, Moody's Investor Service said Friday that it cut
the long-term credit rating of Fuji Bank Ltd.
	   The U.S.-based debt rating agency lowered its rating of Fuji
Bank's long-term bonds to ``Baa2,'' which is two steps above
speculative, or ``junk,'' grade. The bank's previous rating was a
healthy ``A3.''
	   Moody's left its assessment of the bank's short-term debt
unchanged at ``Prime-2.''
	   The agency in a statement cited Japan's recession and the bank's
exposure to the shaky economies of Southeast Asia.
	   The move comes a day after Moody's cut its assessment of the
creditworthiness of two other Japanese banks, Asahi Bank Ltd. and
Tokai Bank Ltd.
	   Reduced creditworthiness indicates increased risk for investors,
so the downgrade could raise the banks' borrowing costs.
	   Last week, Moody's cut the credit ratings of Toyota Motor Corp.,
Japan's largest automaker, and two of the country's biggest
electronics makers, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan plans to charge overflight fees from foreign
airlines flying through Japanese airspace beginning in January
2000, a Transport Ministry official said Friday.
	   The aim is to bring Japan in line with similar measures taken by
other nations, including European states and Canada, said Toshihiro
Yamakoshi of the ministry's Air Traffic Services System Division.
	   Yamakoshi said the United States introduced a similar fee system
in May of last year, but it has been temporarily suspended pending
an ongoing revision of the way costs are calculated.
	   Yamakoshi said Japan's overflight fee will be charged only for
air traffic control services provided to foreign aircraft that fly
through airspace under its control, but that do not land or take
off here.
	   At present, domestic and foreign carriers pay for air traffic
control services only when their planes land and take off in Japan,
Yamakoshi said.
	   Details of the overflight fees, including what price per plane
should be appropriate, will be calculated later, Yamakoshi said.
	    &UR; ___
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police arrested three directors of
banks whose operations were frozen last week on allegations that
they violated lending limit regulations, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Battling a deep financial crisis, the government is reforming
banks and taking other steps in an attempt to restore confidence in
Indonesia's economy.
	   The daily Bisnis Indonesia said the private bank directors were
arrested Thursday.
	   It also quoted an official at the finance ministry as saying
that since April, the ministry has asked immigration authorities to
impose a travel ban on 13 bankers.
	   The detained bankers were identified as Leonard Tanudjaja of PT
Bank Umum Nasional, Kiki Hamidjaja of PT Bank Modern and Husni Ali
of PT Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia.
	   The government is under international pressure to show it is
serious about cleaning up the banking sector, a major target of
reform under a multibillion-dollar economic rescue package put
together by the International Monetary Fund.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday
to urge investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about
Russia's economic chaos and a new six-year low on Japan's benchmark
stock index proved more persuasive.
	   As soon as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged once
again, and by the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest
level in 12 years. Even the dollar _ normally sought as a safety
net in times of crisis _ tumbled against the Japanese currency.
	   In fact, by the time trading had ended across Asia on Friday and
begun once again in Europe, it was clear that the global free fall
that began Thursday was not yet complete. The Dow Jones industrial
average in New York tumbled 357.36 points Thursday as the deepening
crisis in Russia and doubts about Japan's handling of its recession
jolted stock markets around the world.
	   ``The drops are so large, it's not just fundamentals driving
this, people are scared,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly scheduled
news conference Friday to urge investors to remain calm. ``The most
important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped below 14,000 in early
trading and closed at its lowest level since March 1986.
	   At its deepest point, the index was down 591.56 points, or 4.10
percent, to 13,822.23. It recovered somewhat, closing 13,915.63,
down 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday.
	   On Thursday, the Nikkei fell 452.24 points, or 3.04 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar dropped sharply
in early trading, but recovered somewhat by the afternoon, buying
141.64 yen. That was down 2.02 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and
below its late New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   Stock markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also continued their
plunge Friday, with Singapore breaking through an important barrier
for the first time in more than a decade.
	   In Europe, prices plunged from the outset Friday on the London
Stock Exchange, the continent's biggest market. The Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 44.2 points, about 0.8
percent, at 5,324.3 in the first half hour of trading.
	   In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX index plunged 5.2 percent to
4,754.28 by midmorning. German investors have been concerned that
their banks are overexposed to the economic turmoil in Russia.
	   In Hong Kong, after only 15 minutes of heavy trading, the Hang
Seng Index was down 48.10 points to 7,874.87. It traded in negative
territory throughout the session, and closed 93.23 points, or 1.2
percent, lower at 7,829.74.
	   Trading volume reached an all-time record high of Hong Kong dlrs
79 billion (U.S. dlrs 10.13 billion), and traders estimated that
government buying accounted for more than 80 percent of the trading
volume. Market participants said the government may have used more
than 10 percent of its reserves in its two-week battle against
speculators.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd. ``There is a battle going on.'' For two weeks,
the Hong Kong government has been propping up the local stock and
stock futures markets in an effort to punish speculators.
	   Across Hong Kong, people watched nervously at computer monitors
flashing the latest market news at banks and Internet providers. On
buses and subways, they read front-page newspaper stories about a
showdown between officials and speculators.
	   As if that weren't enough, on Friday afternoon the government
announced that Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession, with
its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter. It also said the economy is expected to shrink by 4
percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index
crashed through the crucial 900-point level, tumbling 25.62 points,
or 2.8 percent, to 885.26. It was the first time in more than 10
years that it has closed below 900.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
``People are watching what is happening everywhere, in Russia, in
Latin America. They are sitting on the sidelines, very nervous.''
	   Much of the nervousness came from fears of another day like
Thursday. The Dow's 4.2 percent drop means the index is now 1,171
points below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   In Russia, stocks plummeted 17 percent Thursday after trading
was twice suspended. The ruble continued to slide against the
dollar, and the government suspended dollar sales for the rest of
the week. Pressure also mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign.
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   Japan, the world's second largest economy, has been widely
criticized for not doing enough to revive its economy. Its new
government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo on Friday.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that shows the Nikkei stock
prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   ``I'm afraid this might lead to a big depression,'' said
Takehiko Morooka, 29, another worker. If that happens, he said, he
will blame it on Japan's politicians.
	   The key stock indexes in other Asian countries also closed lower
Friday: Australia by 1.7 percent, South Korea 1.5 percent, Taiwan
1.3 percent, and the Philippines 1.6 percent.

Thai police on alert against possible attacks on U.S. firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's intelligence agencies have
been put on alert against possible reprisals against American-owned
businesses after last week's U.S. missile attacks, a senior Thai
police officer said Friday.
	   Agents will also be on the lookout for any possible terrorist
activities against embassies and other facilities associated with
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, said Maj. Gen. Sawek
Wattanakit, commander of the second division of the Special Branch
Police Bureau.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has expressed great concern
over possible revenge attacks taking place here, said Sawek, adding
that Thailand has been working closely with foreign governments on
the issue.
	   ``The level of the alert will not be as high as during the Gulf
War but it's better to take preventive measures now,'' said Sawek.
``The threat of possible attacks is very real and we suggest that
those who may targeted take extra precautions as well.''
	   U.S. missiles last week destroyed a pharmaceutical plant in
Sudan and camps in Afghanistan that Washington said were linked to
terrorists. The strikes followed the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa.
	   During the Gulf War, Thai soldiers were called out to guard the
U.S. Embassy and other Western diplomatic facilities.
	   Chuan was quoted in The Nation newspaper as saying the
government will provide budget and equipment to fully support the
task of preventing terrorism.
	   The alert came three days after a pipe bomb exploded in a Planet
Hollywood restaurant, in Cape Town, South Africa, killing one
person and injuring 27 others.
	   The restaurant is South African-owned but part of a well-known
chain founded in the United States. The motive for the attack was
believed to be revenge for the U.S. missile attacks.

Sixth Fleet flagship leaves Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Under tight security measures, the
flagship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet USS La Salle sailed out of
Bulgarian waters Friday after paying a three-day visit to the Black
Sea port of Varna.
	   Security was increased following an alleged bomb threat received
while the ship was at the port.
	   According to local police, a man speaking with an Arabic accent
had called and threatened to blast the ship. There were 650 sailors
aboard at that time, including Sixth Fleet Commander Vice Admiral
Daniel J. Murphy Jr.
	   No explosive device was found, but the port call continued amid
tight security until the flagship left.
	   ``Security has been tightened in all U.S. military bases and
ships in connection with the bomb attacks against the U.S.
embassies'' in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Murphy explained.
	   He didn't comment on the alleged bomb threat against USS La
Salle, but said that ``terrorism is a reality in the contemporary
world and one never knows which the next target is going to be.''
	   Murphy announced that next year Bulgarian naval officers will
take part in a multinational NATO exercise in the Mediterranean.
	   ``This will be one of the major cooperation initiatives of the
Bulgarian naval forces and the U.S. 6th Fleet,'' he said.

Australia looks for clean sweep of series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia goes after its third
consecutive win in the final Bledisloe Cup match against New
Zealand on Saturday, a position they've seldom seen in previous
rugby union series against the mighty All Blacks.
	   A sweep would ensure Australia's season is more than just a mild
success. Coach Rod Macqueen sees the match as a test of character
for the Wallabies following last week's loss to South Africa and
its role in the buildup to next year's World Cup.
	   But the new breed of All Blacks appears to have even more to
play for at Sydney Football Stadium, going into their last match of
the season hurting from four successive losses but buoyed by the
positives from a heart-breaking 24-23 loss to the Springboks two
weeks ago.
	   The odds are in favor of the All Blacks avoiding a whitewash,
with the Wallabies arriving home from Johannesburg late on Tuesday
and still unable to finalize their team until Saturday morning
because of injuries.
	   ``This is a great challenge for us,'' Macqueen said Friday.
``It's a chance to show some character, coming back from a loss and
adversity with injuries and one week to prepare.
	   ``The All Blacks did a good job last year, we certainly want to
do a good job this year.''
	   Australia's injury concerns eased Friday when winger Ben Tune
was passed fit after overcoming chronic knee soreness. But outside
center Daniel Herbert was ruled out and a final decision on prop
Andrew Blades' Achilles injury would be made Saturday.
	   A defeat would be the Wallabies' third loss in their last four
tests, casting some doubt on their progress in a rare Bledisloe
Cup-winning year.
	   ``We've come a long way this year and we don't want to be in the
situation where we play well one week and badly the next and well
the next,'' captain John Eales said.
	   The teams:
	   AUSTRALIA: Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Jason Little, Tim Horan, Joe
Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David Wilson,
Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades/Glenn Panoho, Phil Kearns, Dan Crowley. Reserves: Chris
Whitaker, Damian Smith, Nathan Grey, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen
Finegan, Glenn Panoho/Richard Harry, Jeremy Paul.
	   NEW ZEALAND: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Eroni Clarke, Jonah
Lomu, Mark Mayerhofler, Andrew Mehrtens, Justin Marshall, Xavier
Rush, Josh Kronfeld, Robin Brooke, Royce Willis, Taine Randell
(captain), Kees Meeuws, Anton Oliver, Carl Hoeft. Reserves: Joeli
Vidiri, Caleb Ralph, Carlos Spencer, Mark Robinson, Scott
Robertson, Ian Jones, Craig Dowd, Mark Hammett (one to be omitted).

Police still quizzing one over Planet Hollywood blast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police questioned a man about the
bombing of a Planet Hollywood restaurant but said Friday they had
no evidence so far to link him to the fatal blast.
	   Reacting to an anonymous tip, police arrested the suspect with
two women at Cape Town International Airport as they were about to
board a flight to Egypt with allegedly incorrect travel documents
Thursday night.
	   The three are members of a Muslim vigilante group that targets
drug dealers in the Cape Town slums.
	   The women would be charged with ``passport offenses,'' police
said, declining to say what was wrong with the passports.
	   ``We are still questioning the man about the Planet Hollywood
blast,'' said police spokesman Senior Superintendent John
Sterrenberg ``But at this stage there is no evidence to connect him
to it.''
	   The bombing at the crowded tourist spot Tuesday evening killed a
man and injured 27 people.
	   All three are members of the group People Against Gangsterism
and Drugs, which police suspect of carrying out a wave of bomb
attacks this year on drug dealers in Cape Town's sprawling
townships.
	   The arrests sparked anger among some in the Muslim community
that their religion was being singled out in a rush to judgment.
Most of the country's nearly half-million Muslims live in the Cape
Town area.
	   About 80 PAGAD supporters protested Thursday night outside the
Cape Town home of Justice Minister Dullah Omar. Shouting slogans
accusing the police of carrying out a witch-hunt against Muslims,
the protesters later peacefully dispersed.
	   ``It is unfortunate that the police seem to be just focusing on
Muslims at the moment,'' said PAGAD lawyer Ardiel Theunissen.
	   Originally conceived as an anti-crime group, local newspaper
reports have said PAGAD has adopted an increasingly Islamic and
anti-Western agenda.
	   However, police say they are sensitive to the accusation that
they are only targeting Muslims. ``We are exploring all avenues of
this investigation,'' Sterrenberg said.
	   Local media have rushed to pin the Tuesday night attack on
Muslim groups. One newspaper ran a front page report on Wednesday
describing a ``swarthy man'' who was ``Moroccan-looking'' captured
acting suspiciously on security cameras moments before the blast in
Planet Hollywood. Police on Thursday issued a statement saying the
film was at least a month old.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the bombing has come from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.
	   However, the organization plans a march on Saturday to the U.S.
consulate in Cape Town to protest American cruise missile attacks
on suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   The bomb has shocked a city proud of its image as a safe tourist
destination in a country infamous for its high crime rate.
	   On Friday tourism industry consultant Joseph Aminzadeh said he
thought the number of visitors from the United States would drop by
a third due to the attack. In 1997 143,000 Americans visited South
Africa.

Russian crisis affects other former Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Three burly men in bright sportswear paused
in front of a currency exchange office in central Kiev, stared
glumly at the climbing rate for buying dollars and walked away.
	   The constantly-changing billboards quoting rates outside
exchange offices is perhaps the most visible sign of the shock
waves Russia's financial crisis is sending across the former Soviet
Union.
	   The impact is felt most strongly in Ukraine and Belarus, whose
economies and trade are closely linked with their much bigger
neighbor.
	   ``If not today, than tomorrow this crisis situation will affect
Ukraine,'' Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said Thursday.
	   But it already has.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency has fallen steadily against the U.S.
dollar, and some food prices have gone up at outdoor markets.
	   There are concerns that the flight of foreign investors, who now
hold 18 percent of state Treasury bills, will increase. The
cash-strapped government is offering domestic investors a bond debt
restructuring plan and is said to be considering a similar plan for
foreigners.
	   Ukraine also is worried that Russian goods _ which account for
about 40 percent of the country's imports _ will become more
expensive and that its exports to Russia _ one-third of the total _
would fall drastically.
	   In neighboring Belarus, the National Bank's press service said a
number of small banks that have invested in Russian bonds might
collapse. The crisis is even more painful there since authoritarian
President Alexander Lukashenko has signed a union treaty with
Russia, uniting their economies.
	   The Russian crisis has been pushing the Belarusian ruble down by
1,000 to the dollar a day. The ruble's official rate is 49,000 to
the dollar, but it's trading at 110,000 at the interbank currency
exchange, not fully controlled by the government.
	   And Belarus' financial experts like Alexander Potupa, vice
chairman of the Entrepreneurs' Union, say the nation is a step away
from a full-blown crisis. He points out that Russia accounts for
two-thirds of Belarus' foreign trade.
	   Unlike Belarus and Ukraine, the crisis, so far, has had little
effect on the Caucasus nations of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia,
whose economic ties with Russia have been declining in recent
years.
	   In Georgia, the Russian ruble went down from 21 lari to 100
rubles to 15, reflecting a general ruble downfall across the CIS.
The lari-dollar rate has stayed relatively stable, observers said.
	   ``The situation in Russia has not negatively affected the
situation in Georgia and the lari rate,'' said Soso Phakadze, chief
dealer of the National Bank.
	   In oil-rich Azerbaijan, the local manat currency has stabilized
against the U.S. dollar after gaining steadily for months, from
4,500 manat to the dollar to 3,900. Otherwise, there were no
visible effects of the crisis in Russia.
	   Russia's financial crisis also appeared to have little effect on
Armenia, where officials said business was proceeding as usual with
Moscow, Yerevan's No. 1 trade partner.
	   The crisis also has had little effect on Central Asian
republics, although it did cause some worries in Uzbekistan and
Kazakstan.
	   With Moscow accounting for up to 50 percent of Uzbekistan's
foreign trade, government officials reported a drop in the prices
of cotton, mainly exported to Russia, and an increase in the prices
of imported foodstuffs brought in through Russia.
	   In Kazakstan, whose financial market also long have been
separated from those of Russia, officials and experts did not
foresee major upheavals.
	   ``Kazakstan's reserve position is more than comfortable. There
are not too many investors on the T-bill market and the stock
exchange. We are optimistic in the medium-term,'' said Grigory
Marchenko, former head of the National Securities Commission and
now president of the Deutsche Bank subsidiary DB Securities.
	   However, other experts in Kazakstan said they expected the
effects to be more long-term.
	   ``What we expect is a lack of general confidence in emerging
markets and in investing in CIS countries,'' said Madina Dushimova,
director of research at Kazkommerts Securities.

North Korea's defense industry sagging
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's once-robust defense
industry is sagging, depriving the cash-strapped country of a vital
source of foreign currency, South Korean officials said Friday.
	   North Korea is believed to have earned dlrs 2.5 billion by
selling missiles and other weapons mostly to Middle East countries
in 1980-89, Unification Ministry officials said.
	   But the North is believed to have earned only dlrs 300 million
in arms sales between 1990 and 1995, the officials said.
	   ``Signs are clear that North Korea's defense industry is
declining,'' said one ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The officials said their information about the North's defense
industry was obtained from Germany and other friendly countries.
	   The centerpiece of North Korea's defense industry is its missile
development program. But it faces difficulty because of a lack of
technology and funds, the ministry officials said.
	   The officials believe that North Korea's missile sales to Iran,
Syria and other Middle East countries have dropped sharply because
of the weapons' low quality and difficulty in transporting them.
	   North Korea, the officials said, has made significant progress
in certain areas of missile development but its program faces
``serious technical problems,'' they said.
	   ``That is one reason they have recently proposed to the United
States that (North Korea) halt missile development and sales in
return for financial compensation,'' the same ministry official
said.
	   North Korea acknowledged for the first time in June that it has
been developing, manufacturing and selling missiles abroad to
obtain foreign currency. It said that if the United States wanted
it to stop, it would have to compensate it for the loss of sales.
	   A delegation of U.S. congressional aides, returning from a visit
to North Korea in July, said Pyongyang officials sought dlrs 500
million a year in compensation in return for halting its missile
exports.
	   North Korea's missile development is based on Scud technology
obtained from the Soviet Union.

German Greens leader splattered with eggs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A leader of the opposition Greens was pelted with
eggs at a campaign rally opening the party's final push for votes
in next month's German elections.
	   The assailant mixed with photographers and TV crews on stage
Thursday night and threw two eggs at Joschka Fischer, the
environmentalist party's best-known politician, just before he
began his speech, hitting him in the chest.
	   Fischer remained cool. ``Come on, it's only two eggs,'' he told
the crowd of about 1,000 at an eastern Berlin hall.
	   The young male assailant was hustled off stage and out of the
hall, apparently by other spectators. His motive remained unclear.
	   Fischer attacked Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his speech, accusing
him of bringing Germany to a ``standstill.''
	   He derided recent comments by Kohl that he could imagine his
conservative Christian Democrats ruling together with the Greens in
the future.
	   ``This shows the full depth of the government's confusion,'' he
said.
	   Kohl lags in opinion polls behind Gerhard Schroeder, candidate
of the main opposition Social Democrats.

Share prices close lower; turnover surges to record level
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices closed lower Friday, with turnover
surging to a record level as the government continued its
intervention to prevent the index from falling sharply.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 93.23 points, or 1.2 percent, closing at 7,829.74. On
Thursday, the index had gained 88.57 points.
	   Turnover surged to 79.00 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
10.1 billion), exceeding the previous record of 46.02 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.8 billion) posted last August.
	   Traders estimated that government buying accounted for more than
80 percent of Friday's trading volume in a showdown with
speculators.
	   By buying shares, the government was targeting those who were
short selling the stock and futures markets and the Hong Kong
currency.
	   Investors who sell the market short borrow shares, sell them
hoping the prices will fall, and then buy them back at the lower
price. The higher the stock index level is, the steeper the losses
of speculators are because they would have to buy the shares back
at higher prices.
	   The battle ended temporarily with the expiry on Friday of the
August Futures Index, which closed at 7853, down 87 points from
Thursday.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at Vickers Ballas
Holdings Ltd.
	   Traders said the government may have won the first round of the
battle but said they were concerned about the cost of the victory.
	   ``The government just won the August battle but what happens in
September?,'' asked George Chan, research manager at Celestial Asia
Securities Ltd.
	   After the market closed, the government announced that Hong Kong
has slid into recession, with the economy shrinking by 5 percent in
the second quarter.
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 Hong Kong dollars to
173.50, Cheung Kong fell 80 cents to 33.20, Sun Hung Kai Properties
fell 50 cents to 25.70, and Hang Seng Bank fell 10 cents to 44.30.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslims in black robes
and prayer garments rallied outside the U.S. Embassy Friday to
protest U.S. missile strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Clambering atop concrete ramparts fortifying the U.S. compound,
they shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' the Muslim rally cry meaning, ``God
is Great,'' and ``America, Terrorist!'' in English.
	   About 600 people marched to the embassy after completing their
afternoon prayers at a nearby mosque.
	   ``We ask God for fortitude to strengthen us against the enemies
of Islam,'' shouted the rally's organizer, Abu Baker Chik Ustaz,
through a megaphone as a dozens of women beside him held up
handwritten signs.
	   ``The Americans must be crushed,'' cried out Abu Bakar, who
heads the Pan Malaysian Islamic party's youth wing, as he waved his
fist at the fortified U.S. embassy. ``From today, they've no right
to be in Malaysia.''
	   ``Down with America! You people are spineless cowards killing
innocent lives,'' read one sign in Malay.
	   Muslims worldwide have strongly condemned U.S. President Bill
Clinton's orders to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected
terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Both countries said civilians were killed and dozens were
injured in the attacks.
	   A few Islamic leaders passed out leaflets during the rally which
blamed America for killing dozens of Afghan and Sudanese civilians
in its ``vicious'' pursuit of Muslims.
	   ``For Sudanese and Afghans, continue your Jihad against this
enemy of Allah. We support you!,'' said the statement issued by the
Pan Malaysian Islamic Party. ``May Allah give us strength and help
to defeat them.''
	   Dozens of Malaysian police and plain-clothed detectives could be
seen on the street outside the embassy, but they did not stop the
rally.

Taiwan pledges crackdown on gangsters, China money in polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking a fairer environment for elections
in December, Taiwan's justice minister pledged Friday to crack down
hard on gangsters meddling in politics and illegal campaign
financing by China.
	   ``Of course everyone has the right to participate in politics,
but a real democracy has no patience for those who use money and
violence to get elected as a means of obtaining respectability,''
Cheng Chung-mo said.
	   A campaign financing task force set up in June will hunt down
sources of campaign funding suspected of originating with organized
crime groups, as well as attempts by China to influence the
election's outcome by financing politicians friendly to its goal of
regaining control over Taiwan, Cheng said.
	   Taiwan elects an expanded legislature of 225 seats on Dec. 5,
along with the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung cities and their
councils.

Vietnam releasing 5,219 prisoners in massive amnesty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from WAN, vice police minister, U.S.
Embassy; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam said Friday it is releasing 5,219
prisoners as part of a general amnesty, including the country's
best-known dissident, whose case was recently criticized by the
European Parliament.
	   An unspecified number of expatriates, including Americans, who
had been in jail on criminal charges were to be freed, Nguyen Canh
Dinh, chairman of the president's office, told a news conference.
	   He said the amnesty took effect after it was signed Friday by
President Tran Duc Luong, who is on an official visit to Russia.
	   It was not immediately clear if some prisoners already have been
released. A spokesman for the Police Ministry's Prisons Management
Department said all would freed before National Day, Sept. 2.
	   Another batch will be considered after the holiday, Dinh said.
	   The U.S. Embassy said it could not divulge who was being
released or even how many, citing American privacy laws.
	   ``We have been working with the Vietnamese on releasing
prisoners held for political or religious crimes. We're very
pleased with this outcome,'' said an embassy official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Dinh reiterated Vietnam's claim that it holds no political or
religious prisoners, only people who have broken the law.
	   International human-rights groups claim a number of people are
in jail for their political or religious beliefs under the
all-encompassing national security law or strict regulation of
religious activities.
	   Dinh said Doan Viet Hoat _ the country's best-known dissident _
and Nguyen Dan Que were being released. Their cases were cited in a
July 16 resolution by the European Parliament _ sharply criticized
at the time by Vietnam _ that called for their convictions to be
quashed immediately.
	   However, Dinh did not mention a third man specified in the
resolution, Thich Khong Do.
	   Although relatively little is known about Hoat inside the
country because domestic media is government-controlled, he has
gained fame abroad for persistently crusading for personal and
press freedoms.
	   Serving a 15-year sentence for publishing pro-democracy
newsletters, Hoat was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the
World Association of Newspapers, or WAN, earlier this year for his
commitment to a free press.
	   ``We are delighted and gratified that the Vietnamese government
has ultimately been convinced that Professor Hoat should be
freed,'' WAN director general Timothy Balding said in a statement.
	   ``This is evidence that governments that are hostile to freedom
of expression can by influenced by international opinion, and it
highlights the need to continue such campaigns wherever journalists
and other prisoners of opinion and jailed and persecuted.''
	   Hoat was first arrested in 1976 when he was a professor of
literature for calling for greater civil liberties and spent 12
years in detention camps without trial.
	   He was arrested again in 1990 and held for 28 months without
charge, then sentenced to a 20-year term for publishing
``anti-communist'' articles in a small underground magazine. The
sentence later was reduced to 15 years.
	   Que was sentenced in 1991, in what the European Parliament
called ``totally unfair proceedings,'' to 20 years for seeking to
overthrow the government.
	   To qualify for the amnesty, Dinh said inmates must have served
at least a third of their sentences, or 12 years for a life
sentence. People sentenced to death were not eligible unless their
sentences already had been commuted to life.
	   Complete amnesty was granted to 5,166 inmates. Another 53
effectively are being paroled. Any who seek to immigrate abroad
will receive normal consideration, Dinh said.
	   Vice Police Minister, in an interview in Friday's editions of
the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan, said they should become
good citizens.
	   ``Those who are on the list ... are those considered to have the
desire to become good people and pose no threat to the security and
social order in their reintegration into society,'' he said.

Singapore main stock index closes below 900 level
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
closed Friday below the 900 level for the first time in more than
10 years, reacting to bad financial news in Malaysia and the
collapsing Russian currency.
	   The index, which is to be restructured on Monday to make it a
more accurate representation of the Singapore stock market, closed
Friday at 885.26, the lowest level since Feb. 15, 1988.
	   That will be the starting base level when the revamped and
renamed Straits Times Index opens Monday.
	   Traders began selling immediately after the market opened at
910.88, nervous about the resignation of the central bank governor
and his deputy in Malaysia a day after a recession was declared
there.
	   ``All that puts an additional pressure on Singapore dollar,''
said Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities.
	   Despite a brief buying effort in the afternoon, the Singapore
index closed down 18.49 points, or 2.8 percent by the end of the
day.
	   ``What's happening in Malaysia has a larger ramification in
Singapore than events on the global market, but those events put an
additional pressure on Singapore,'' Brooks said.
	   Also, he said, regional prospects are poor for the next couple
of years and foreign investors are worried that Southeast Asian
currencies will weaken further.
	   ``Why would you want to buy equities, when economic growth is
going to be collapsing for the next 12 months?'' Brooks said,
adding that foreign investors also worry that the currencies in the
region are going to weaken further.
	   The Straits Times Industrials Index drift below the
psychologically important support level of 1,000 began on Aug. 11.
The index has plummeted about 40 percent since the start of the
year, when it stood at 1529.84 points.
	   When the Stock Exchange of Singapore opens on Monday, the
benchmark index will no longer be price-weighted, a factor that has
allowed small players to buy at the last minute each day to prop up
the closing level, although such efforts failed on Friday.
	   The new index will be weighted according to market
capitalization and will cover a broader range of stocks instead of
the 30 industrials included in the current index.
	   The current index does not contain properties or banks, two of
Singapore's major industries.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An earthquake in a remote part of northwest China
killed three people and injured seven others, seismology
authorities said Friday.
	   The magnitude 6.6 quake Thursday cracked the walls of old houses
in the town of Jiashi, in the Xinjiang region about 3,500
kilometers (2,200 miles) west of Beijing, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   An official at Jiashi's seismology bureau, who gave just her
surname, Liu, said three people were killed and seven injured.
	   Jiashi has suffered three strong quakes in the past two years
that have killed 36 people.

Hong Kong economy shrinks in second quarter; recession declared

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession,
with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter, the government announced Friday.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang also said the economy is
expected to shrink by 4 percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99,
compared with a 3.5-percent growth forecast earlier this year.
	   The territory's economy shrank in the first quarter by 2.8
percent.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last
decade and expanded 5.3 percent in 1997, has now fallen into its
worst recession in 13 years.
	   A recession is generally defined as two quarters of shrinking
gross domestic product.
	   In its half-yearly economic report released Friday, the
government said the second quarter economic contraction was
``mainly due to a further slackening in both local consumer demand
and export performance in the second quarter.''
	   Inflation fell to 3.2 percent in July, sharply slower than 4
percent in June, Tsang said. Annual inflation is expected to by 3.5
percent, the lowest yearly rate in 13 years, reflecting the fall in
consumer spending.
	   Exports in July dropped 13 percent compared with the same month
last year. Tsang predicted Friday total trade this fiscal year
would drop 2 percent, sharply lower than its earlier forecast of
6.1 percent growth.
	   Tsang declined to forecast when the economy will rebound, saying
economic troubles in Japan and Russia and slowing trade threaten to
the territory's recovery.
	   ``Japan's economic and financial troubles seem to have
intensified,'' Tsang said. ``This is outside of our control.''
	   ``The (Russian) ruble would have an impact on Wall Steet, which
would affect global stock markets. Hong Kong will inevitable be
affected by the global market fluctuations,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
including Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia. All of which
have been jolted by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   However, the official announcement of a recession was no big
surprise to many who have watched their businesses slow down and
investments lose up to half their value over the past year.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent, property
values have fallen by up to 40 percent, and interest rates are
exorbitant.
	   Keeping interest rates high is Hong Kong's major tactic to
protect its currency link with the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong
dollar is the last fully convertible Asian currency that has not
depreciated in the region's financial crisis.
	   The strong currency is hurting the territory's competitiveness
in trade and tourism. Tourist arrivals fell by half in the first
six months this year, but rebounded in July.
	   ``The economy is not very good, but even before, in the good
times, it wasn't very healthy,'' says 63-year-old barber Wong Liang
Tsen, who says business has dropped by 25 percent since the
beginning of the year.
	   ``Before, people would earn 100 dollars and spend 80, now the
money isn't coming so easily.''
	   To fend off speculators threatening to force officials to scrap
the 13-year currency peg with the U.S. dollar, the government
continued Friday to scoop up shares Friday to drive the index up in
its two-week battle against speculators.
	   The Hang Seng Index shed 1.1 percent to close at 7,428.74
points.
	   To ease the burdens of unemployment and high interest rates, the
government has launched a series of economy-boosting measures,
including credit guarantees to small businesses.

Clashes erupt in Hebron as Israel lifts closure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS skirmish in Hebron, rubber bullets fired

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out in the West Bank city
of Hebron Friday hours after Israel lifted a week-long closure on
the city, witnesses said.
	   The closure preventing Palestinian travel in and out of the city
had been imposed after a rabbi was stabbed to death Aug. 20 in his
home in the Jewish enclave, apparently by Palestinians.
	   A curfew on the 30,000 Palestinians who live in the
Israeli-controlled section of the city where some 450 settlers also
reside was lifted for three hours early Friday.
	   Fighting broke out after the curfew had been reimposed when
about 30 Palestinian youths on the Palestinian side of the dividing
line of the city began throwing stones and empty bottles toward
Israeli soldiers on the other side, witnesses said.
	   A few Palestinian policemen initially stopped the stone throwing
but lost control of the youths when more arrived on the scene, they
added.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets in response,
slightly injuring a woman passerby who was treated at a local
hospital , Palestinians said.
	   The skirmish that soon abated occured close to the Jewish
enclave located in the center of the city but settlers were not
involved in Friday's fighting, the witnesses said.
	   Tensions have been high in the city holy to Jews and Muslims
with eruptions of periodic fighting since the rabbi's death but no
serious injuries have been reported.
	   Although the Palestinians control most of Hebron, the Israeli
army can seal the entire city to prevent Palestinian travel in and
out of the area. File Stored As: JEN0080 lcopans 282 08-28 09:53 ri

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker,
announced Friday it will buy a majority stake in its affiliate,
Daihatsu Motor Corp.
	   Toyota will pay about 37 billion yen (dlrs 259 million) to
increase its share in Daihatsu from its current 34.5 percent to
51.2 percent, Toyota said in a statement.
	   It will be the first time a Japanese automaker has taken a
majority stake in another domestic automobile manufacturer.
	   Toyota said that closer ties with Daihatsu will help the
companies confront intensifying global competition and share
technology in developing environment-friendly vehicles.
	   Toyota said it ``hopes to preserve the individuality'' of
Daihatsu, which specializes in small, low-cost vehicles.
	   Earlier Friday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of Daihatsu in order to verify reports that Toyota was
increasing its stake in the smaller carmaker.
	   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily,
reported that Toyota is also likely to take a majority stake in
Hino Motors Ltd., a truck maker in the Toyota group.

240 kilograms (528 pounds) of heroin seized in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Customs officials seized last month
240 kilograms (528 pounds) of pure heroin in northwest Romania, a
police officer said Friday.
	   The seizure, the biggest in recent years, was made in mid-July
as customs officials routinely searched a truck, said Col. Gheorghe
Tudor, a police spokesman in the city of Oradea, where the drug was
impounded.
	   Tudor could not say exactly when customs officers discovered the
heroin in the back of a truck traveling from Bucharest.
	   Information was apparently withheld because investigations are
still in progress. No one was arrested. Regional radio Cluj
reported that two Turkish citizens fled from the truck, but Tudor
refused to comment.
	   Oradea is near the Hungarian border, 425 kilometers (266 miles)
northwest of Bucharest

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Believing it's reinforced military has
the upper hand, the government broadcast an appeal Friday asking
turncoat soldiers now fighting for the rebels to lay down their
arms.
	   Shelling continued near the airport, but central Kinshasa was
quiet after a day of retribution killings and summary executions.
	   Rebels from a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army slipped
into parts of the capital in recent days and launched an assault to
take the airport.
	   But on Thursday, the government and allied Angolan, Zimbabwean
and Namibian troops were firmly in control of the airport.
	   More than 1,000 prisoners have been captured in and around the
capital, the government said.
	   Zimbabwe's official new agency, meanwhile, reported that about
half the 8,000-strong rebel force on Congo's southwestern front had
been either captured or killed.
	   Away from the capital, there was no immediate end in sight for
the conflict, with peace efforts on hold and neighboring Uganda
saying the war will continue unless Kabila accepts a cease-fire
proposal.
	   Kabila maintains Rwanda and Uganda are behind the rebellion that
began at the start of the month.
	   ``We launch a patriotic appeal to you Congolese soldiers
involved in this Rwandan adventure against our country to drop your
arms immediately,'' said Joseph Kabila, the president's son and new
chief of the military.
	   Speaking on state-controlled Voice of the People radio, Kabila's
son called on the public not to attack Congolese soldiers trying to
surrender. He said nothing of ethnic Tutsi fighters.
	   Government troops on Thursday ran amok in parts of Kinshasa,
venting revenge on suspected rebel fighters. The discarded bodies
of 18 men, some charred and disfigured, were spotted on city
streets and back alleys.
	   One captive, wailing for mercy, was hurled off the side of a
bridge and then shot to death.
	   The insurgents had scored repeated military successes early in
the rebellion, capturing a number of important cities in eastern
Congo and launching an airlift across the country to drive toward
Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of Angolan, Zimbabwean and now Namibian
troops has apparently turned the tide in the southwest.
	   Rebels forces, however, still occupy the Congo River port town
of Matadi and a major power dam that supplies Kinshasa with
electricity.
	   Far across the country in the east, the rebels control several
important cities, including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ whom they helped to oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border attacks by
militants based in eastern Congo.
	   Although both countries deny helping the rebels, they say they
retain the right to intervene in the conflict if it affects their
vital interests.
	   Uganda's presidential defense adviser, Maj.-Gen Salim Saleh,
told a government newspaper that Ugandan forces are being attacked
by Congolese, Zimbabwean and Angolan forces.
	   Saleh told the New Vision newspaper on Thursday that the
fighting will continue in Congo if Kabila continues to oppose peace
proposals spearheaded by South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   He said Ugandan forces will not leave Congo until Kabila accepts
a cease-fire. Uganda acknowledges its forces are inside Congolese
territory, but had earlier said they were there as part of a prior
defense agreement with Congo and not on behalf of the rebels.
	   Saleh's latest remarks apparently contradict Uganda's earlier
contention that its forces were not fighting Kabila's government.
	   ``We have evidence that Kabila was arranging to attack us on all
frontiers. We had to defend ourselves,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Mediation efforts by the Southern African Development Community
have been put on hold until a Non-Aligned Movement summit in South
Africa next week, South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
said.
	   Two key players in the conflict _ Kabila and Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe _ will attend the gathering in Durban,
Pahad said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday
to urge investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about
Russia's economic chaos and a new six-year low on Japan's benchmark
stock index proved more persuasive.
	   As soon as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged once
again, and by the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest
level in 12 years. Even the dollar _ normally sought as a safety
net in times of crisis _ tumbled against the Japanese currency.
	   In fact, by the time trading had ended across Asia on Friday and
begun once again in Europe, it was clear that the global free fall
that began Thursday was not yet complete. The Dow Jones industrial
average in New York tumbled 357.36 points Thursday as the deepening
crisis in Russia and doubts about Japan's handling of its recession
jolted stock markets around the world.
	   ``The drops are so large, it's not just fundamentals driving
this, people are scared,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly scheduled
news conference Friday to urge investors to remain calm. ``The most
important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped below 14,000 in early
trading and closed at its lowest level since March 1986.
	   At its deepest point, the index was down 591.56 points, or 4.10
percent, to 13,822.23. It recovered somewhat, closing 13,915.63,
down 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday.
	   On Thursday, the Nikkei fell 452.24 points, or 3.04 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar dropped sharply
in early trading, but recovered somewhat by the afternoon, buying
141.64 yen. That was down 2.02 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and
below its late New York rate of 142.18 yen overnight.
	   Stock markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also continued their
plunge Friday, with Singapore breaking through an important barrier
for the first time in more than a decade.
	   In Europe, prices plunged from the outset Friday.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off by 165.1
points, or 3.1 percent, at 5,203.4 by midmorning.
	   In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX index plunged 5.2 percent to
4,754.28 by midmorning. German investors have been concerned that
their banks are overexposed to the economic turmoil in Russia.
	   In Hong Kong, after only 15 minutes of heavy trading, the Hang
Seng Index was down 48.10 points to 7,874.87. It traded in negative
territory throughout the session, and closed 93.23 points, or 1.2
percent, lower at 7,829.74.
	   Trading volume reached an all-time record high of Hong Kong dlrs
79 billion (U.S. dlrs 10.13 billion), and traders estimated that
government buying accounted for more than 80 percent of the trading
volume. Market participants said the government may have used more
than 10 percent of its reserves in its two-week battle against
speculators.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd. ``There is a battle going on.'' For two weeks,
the Hong Kong government has been propping up the local stock and
stock futures markets in an effort to punish speculators.
	   Across Hong Kong, people watched nervously at computer monitors
flashing the latest market news at banks and Internet providers. On
buses and subways, they read front-page newspaper stories about a
showdown between officials and speculators.
	   As if that weren't enough, on Friday afternoon the government
announced that Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession, with
its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter. It also said the economy is expected to shrink by 4
percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index
crashed through the crucial 900-point level, tumbling 25.62 points,
or 2.8 percent, to 885.26. It was the first time in more than 10
years that it has closed below 900.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
``People are watching what is happening everywhere, in Russia, in
Latin America. They are sitting on the sidelines, very nervous.''
	   Much of the nervousness came from fears of another day like
Thursday. The Dow's 4.2 percent drop means the index is now 1,171
points below the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   In Russia, stocks plummeted 17 percent Thursday after trading
was twice suspended. The ruble continued to slide against the
dollar, and the government suspended dollar sales for the rest of
the week. Pressure also mounted on Boris Yeltsin to resign.
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   Japan, the world's second largest economy, has been widely
criticized for not doing enough to revive its economy. Its new
government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo on Friday.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that shows the Nikkei stock
prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   ``I'm afraid this might lead to a big depression,'' said
Takehiko Morooka, 29, another worker. If that happens, he said, he
will blame it on Japan's politicians.
	   The key stock indexes in other Asian countries also closed lower
Friday: Australia by 1.7 percent, South Korea 1.5 percent, Taiwan
1.3 percent, and the Philippines 1.6 percent.

Indonesian minister says Russian crisis will hurt Asian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The crisis in Russia won't harm the
International Monetary Fund's commitment to Indonesia but poses a
threat to the Asian region as a whole, a Cabinet minister said
Friday.
	   Financial and political turmoil in Russia has diverted
international attention from the year-old economic crisis in Asia.
	   ``The Russian problem won't affect the IMF commitments to
Indonesia but will affect the region,'' Indonesian senior economics
minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
	   Earlier this week, a senior World Bank official said future
lending to Indonesia could be hurt by the crisis in Russia. The IMF
is providing billions of dollars in aid to Indonesia, where
inflation is soaring and millions have lost their jobs.
	   Dennis de Tray, the World Bank's Indonesia director, said the
Group of Seven leading industrialized nations was now focused on
Russia, particularly given the huge exposure of German banks to
that economy.
	   De Tray also said that Indonesia's economic woes were worsened
by the Russian situation, as well as the downturn in other Asian
economies, particularly Japan.
	   Meanwhile, Ginandjar reiterated that Indonesia probably won't
have to reschedule as much sovereign debt as originally thought due
to the strengthening of the yen against the dollar.
	   Indonesia will meet its international creditors Sept. 22 in
Paris to finalize details of a dlrs 1.25 billion debt rescheduling.
The country has already begun to reschedule principal debt
repayments, as a way to help plug the hole in the 1998-99 budget
deficit.
	   Hubert Neiss, the IMF's director for Asia and Pacific Affairs,
is due in Jakarta next week to assess Indonesia's progress in
implementing economic reforms in exchange for loans.
	   The economic crisis helped oust former autocratic President
Suharto, who quit in May after riots and student protests.

Vietnam releasing 5,219 prisoners in massive amnesty

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam said Friday it is releasing 5,219
prisoners as part of a general amnesty. Two top dissidents, whose
cases were recently criticized by the European Parliament,
apparently will be allowed to resettle in the United States.
	   An unspecified number of expatriates _ including Americans _ who
had been jailed on criminal charges also were to be freed, Nguyen
Canh Dinh, chairman of the president's office, told a news
conference.
	   He said the amnesty took effect after it was signed Friday by
President Tran Duc Luong, who is on an official visit to Russia.
	   It was not immediately clear if some prisoners already have been
released. A spokesman for the Police Ministry's Prisons Management
Department said all would freed before National Day, Sept. 2.
	   Another batch will be considered after the holiday, Dinh said.
	   Dinh said Doan Viet Hoat and Nguyen Dan Que were being released.
Their cases were cited in a July 16 resolution by the European
Parliament _ sharply criticized at the time by Vietnam _ that
called for their convictions to be quashed immediately.
	   Dinh did not mention a third man specified in the resolution,
Thich Khong Do.
	   The U.S. Embassy said it could not divulge which Americans were
being released or even how many, citing American privacy laws, but
welcomed the amnesty.
	   ``Mr. Hoat and Mr. Que have been accepted for resettlement in
the United States, and we are currently working on the modalities
of that transfer,'' U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson said.
	   ``We congratulate the government of Vietnam on taking the very
positive step of releasing both these gentlemen.''
	   Dinh reiterated Vietnam's claim that it holds no political or
religious prisoners, only people who have broken the law.
	   International human-rights groups claim a number of people are
in jail for their political or religious beliefs under the
all-encompassing national security law or strict regulation of
religious activities.
	   Although relatively little is known about Hoat inside the
country because domestic media is government-controlled, he has
gained fame abroad for persistently crusading for personal and
press freedoms.
	   Serving a 15-year sentence for publishing pro-democracy
newsletters, Hoat was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the
World Association of Newspapers, or WAN, earlier this year for his
commitment to a free press.
	   ``We are delighted and gratified that the Vietnamese government
has ultimately been convinced that Professor Hoat should be
freed,'' WAN director general Timothy Balding said in a statement.
	   ``This is evidence that governments that are hostile to freedom
of expression can by influenced by international opinion, and it
highlights the need to continue such campaigns wherever journalists
and other prisoners of opinion and jailed and persecuted.''
	   Hoat was first arrested in 1976 when he was a professor of
literature for calling for greater civil liberties and spent 12
years in detention camps without trial.
	   He was arrested again in 1990 and held for 28 months without
charge, then sentenced to a 20-year term for publishing
``anti-communist'' articles in a small underground magazine. The
sentence later was reduced to 15 years.
	   Que, the only member of Amnesty International in Vietnam, was
sentenced in 1991, in what the European Parliament called ``totally
unfair proceedings,'' to 20 years for seeking to overthrow the
government.
	   To qualify for the amnesty, Dinh said inmates must have served
at least a third of their sentences, or 12 years for a life
sentence. Complete amnesty was granted to 5,166 inmates. Another 53
effectively are being paroled.
	   Vice Police Minister, in an interview in Friday's editions of
the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan, said they should become
good citizens.
	   ``Those who are on the list ... are those considered to have the
desire to become good people and pose no threat to the security and
social order in their reintegration into society,'' he said.

Security strengthened around U.S. installations in South Korea
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK-
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Security was tightened Friday at U.S.
military installations, businesses and the American embassy in
South Korea because of an unconfirmed terrorist threat.
	   South Korean police posted armed guards outside hotels, banks
and other businesses owned by American firms and the U.S. military
stepped up security at dozens of bases on the peninsula.
	   The heightened security came after the U.S. Embassy issued an
advisory Thursday saying it had received ``unconfirmed information
of a possible terrorist action'' against Americans in South Korea.
	   Patrick Linehan, the embassy spokesman, declined to discuss the
nature of the threat, but added: ``We're obviously taking it
seriously.''
	   The advisory urged U.S. citizens to review security procedures,
be alert for any unusual activity around their homes or businesses
and to report anything suspicious to local police.
	   About 100,000 Americans are living in South Korea, making them
by the largest foreign community. They include 37,000 troops
stationed here under a mutual defense treaty.
	   ``Tight security has been ordered at all ports of entry and
around U.S. facilities around the country,'' an officer at the
National Police Agency said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   At the U.S. Embassy in central Seoul, four uniformed South
Korean policemen carrying automatic rifles patrolled constantly,
while five truck-loads of riot police were standing by.
	   No taxis or other vehicles were allowed to stop or park close to
the embassy building.
	   Extra road blocks were erected in front of the gates of the U.S.
military command in Seoul, headquarters of the 8th Army. Command
officials said an increased number of guards were posted at all
bases in South Korea.
	   ``The command has upgraded its anti-terror readiness from `A' to
`B plus' status, one step higher. We are telling our soldiers to be
very careful,'' said Lee Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the command.
	   The command has advised its soldiers to wear civilian clothes
when they go off base and report any packages or mail that look
suspicious, she said.
	   At the Westin Chosun Hotel, where the American Chamber of
Commerce is located, six undercover South Korean police officers
were patrolling, in addition to the hotel's own security guards.
	   Police said they were providing similar protection at other
American-owned hotels in the city, including the Hyatt and the
Hilton.
	   An undisclosed number of police were sent to several branch
offices of Citibank as well, police officers said.
	   Chrysler Korea Sales, a local marketing firm of Chrysler
vehicles, said it had increased unspecified security around its
office, located in a busy commercial district.

Taiwanese doctor removes giant tumor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A doctor in southern Kaohsiung city claims
to have removed an ovarian tumor bigger than a newborn baby from a
middle-aged woman.
	   Fang Chia-hung, a obstetrician-gynecologist at Kaohsiung's
private Shengkung Hospital, said the 51 year-old woman's benign
tumor weighed 10 kilograms (22 pounds).
	   He said the tumor was 45 centimeters (22 inches) long _ nearly
twice as long as the largest ovarian tumor on record.
	   The patient said she began feeling abdominal pains four years
ago, but fear of surgery prevented her from seeking medical
treatment. During that time, the tumor kept growing but never
turned cancerous.
	   After Fang performed surgery, the woman said her waist shrunk by
over 10 inches (25 centimeters). Fang said he would write to the
world association of obstetrics and gynecology to report the tumor.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains that buffeted South
Korea earlier this month caused an estimated dlrs 300 million
damage to U.S. military buildings, equipment and supplies, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers said Friday.
	   Three U.S. servicemen were killed and more than 450 buildings
were damaged at three U.S. military bases in Seoul and its
satellite cities Uijongbu and Tongduchon, the corps said.
	   Some 37,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea.
	   More than 270 South Koreans were killed in three weeks of

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Foreign donors announced grants Friday
to help Bangladesh buy food and medicines to cope with the
century's worst floods that have kept two-thirds of the nation
under water for nearly two months.
	   Bangladesh appealed this week for dlrs 600 million in emergency
foreign aid as the lingering floods washed way thousands of homes,
roads, bridges and flood protection embankments.
	   The deluge has so far claimed nearly 600 lives and displaced
thousands of people. More than 25 million people have been marooned
in the flooded villages and towns.
	   In response to the appeal, the United States has promised to
give 260,000 tons of mostly wheat to feed the flood-hit people, the
American embassy in Dhaka said Friday.
	   The European Commission will give dlrs 500,000 to buy food and
medicines, Michael Drury, head of the EC delegation in Dhaka said
on Friday.
	   Germany has provided medicines and clothes worth dlrs 327,000,
its embassy in Dhaka said. The Japanese government has decided to
donate emergency aid _ including medicine and water-purifying
tablets _ worth dlrs. 209,000, the government said in a statement
Wednesday.

Students skip school to protest against racism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ More than 8,000 students took to the
streets across Australia on Friday to protest what they called the
racism of the right-wing populist One Nation party and the federal
government.
	   School, university and technical collage students staged noisy
but peaceful rallies in 14 cities and regional centers in what
organizers claimed was one of the biggest student protests in
Australian history.
	   Wendy Robertson, spokeswoman for Resistance, the socialist youth
group which organized the protests, said about 8,000 students
marched in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Newcastle,
Perth, Wollongong, Gympie, Ballarat and Bendigo.
	   In Sydney, about 500 students burned posters of One Nation
leader Pauline Hanson as they marched to Prime Minister John
Howard's office.
	   In Brisbane, a crowd of 200 was addressed by student leaders and
Aboriginal and ethnic community representatives. In Adelaide, union
representatives joined about 350 students at a protest in Victoria
Square.
	   State United Trades and Labor Council president Stephen Spence
thanked the students for coming and said it was inspiring to see
young people interested in Australia's future.
	   ``Thanks for being concerned enough about the society in which
we live, we need young people to be concerned about the world you
will inherit when you are older,'' Spence said.
	   Resistance launched its campaign against racism and Hanson with
protests on July 24 and 28, when more than 14,000 students were
estimated to have walked out of school to attend rallies.
	   One Nation's sole member of the federal Parliament, Hanson has
been labeled a racist for claiming Australia is in danger of being
``swamped by Asians,'' and calling for an end to specific welfare
benefits for Aborigines.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession,
with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter, the government announced Friday.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang also said the economy is
expected to shrink by 4 percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99,
compared with a 3.5-percent growth forecast earlier this year.
	   The territory's economy shrank in the first quarter by 2.8
percent.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which grew at a rapid pace for the last
decade and expanded 5.3 percent in 1997, has now fallen into its
worst recession in 13 years.
	   A recession is generally defined as two quarters of shrinking
gross domestic product.
	   In its half-yearly economic report released Friday, the
government said the second quarter economic contraction was
``mainly due to a further slackening in both local consumer demand
and export performance in the second quarter.''
	   Inflation fell to 3.2 percent in July, sharply slower than 4
percent in June, Tsang said. Annual inflation is expected to be 3.5
percent, the lowest yearly rate in 13 years, reflecting the fall in
consumer spending.
	   Exports in July dropped 13 percent compared with the same month
last year. Tsang predicted Friday total trade this fiscal year
would drop 2 percent, sharply lower than its earlier forecast of
6.1 percent growth.
	   Tsang declined to forecast when the economy will rebound, saying
economic troubles in Japan and Russia and slowing trade threaten to
the territory's recovery.
	   ``Japan's economic and financial troubles seem to have
intensified,'' Tsang said. ``This is outside of our control.''
	   ``The (Russian) ruble would have an impact on Wall Steet, which
would affect global stock markets. Hong Kong will inevitable be
affected by the global market fluctuations,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
including Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia. All of which
have been jolted by the year-old Asian currency crisis.
	   However, the official announcement of a recession was no big
surprise to many who have watched their businesses slow down and
investments lose up to half their value over the past year.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent, property
values have fallen by up to 40 percent, and interest rates are
exorbitant.
	   Keeping interest rates high is Hong Kong's major tactic to
protect its currency link with the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong
dollar is the last fully convertible Asian currency that has not
depreciated in the region's financial crisis.
	   The strong currency is hurting the territory's competitiveness
in trade and tourism. Tourist arrivals fell by half in the first
six months this year, but rebounded in July.
	   ``The economy is not very good, but even before, in the good
times, it wasn't very healthy,'' says 63-year-old barber Wong Liang
Tsen, who says business has dropped by 25 percent since the
beginning of the year.
	   ``Before, people would earn 100 dollars and spend 80, now the
money isn't coming so easily.''
	   To fend off speculators threatening to force officials to scrap
the 13-year currency peg with the U.S. dollar, the government
continued Friday to scoop up shares Friday to drive the index up in
its two-week battle against speculators.
	   The Hang Seng Index shed 1.1 percent to close at 7,428.74
points.
	   To ease the burdens of unemployment and high interest rates, the
government has launched a series of economy-boosting measures,
including credit guarantees to small businesses.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people were told to evacuate
their homes Friday as Tropical Storm Rex _ blamed for mudslides,
flooding and at least 13 deaths _ dumped torrential rains across
much of Japan.
	   Nearly 40,000 people were told to flee their homes in Mito, a
city about 100 kilometers (63 miles) northeast of Tokyo, because of
possible flooding from the rains, which began Wednesday night.
	   Police confirmed 13 deaths by Friday evening, with 3 missing and
30 injured.
	   Rex was located 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo at
early evening Friday and moving slowly northeast, according to the
Meteorological Agency. It said the storm had sustained wind speeds
of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour near its center.
	   The rains have been caused by the storm pushing warm, wet air
from the central Pacific Ocean north.
	   Some 1,000 soldiers trudged through mud and debris Friday near
the town of Nasu, just north of Tokyo, for the people still missing
after a river burst its banks Thursday. News reports said they
recovered the body of a man, leaving three people unaccounted for.
	   The torrent also killed a 60-year-old university professor and
destroyed or damaged more than 34 houses in the town, which has
seen a record 839 millimeters (33.6 inches) falling since the rains
began at about midnight Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was scheduled to inspect disaster
areas and evacuation sites in Fukushima, Tochigi and Nara on
Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, officials in Fukushima prefecture, 175 kilometers
(110 miles) north of Tokyo, were investigating why a warning never
reached an institution for the handicapped where five people died
when a mudslide slammed into their building Thursday morning.
	   In the immediate Tokyo area, the effects of the storm were
limited mainly to disruption of transportation.
	   Several highways and train lines were closed in and around
Tokyo. East Japan Railway Co. reduced traffic along the Chuo line
running through central Tokyo by 80 percent.
	   The railway also halted bullet trains between the cities of
Yokohama and Atami, southwest of the capital.

Hashimoto, Hirata share lead in Goyo Construction Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOMOZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Aiko Hashimoto and Mitsuyo Hirata shot
5-under-par 67s Friday and shared a one-stroke lead in the opening
round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 419,000) Goyo Construction
Ladies.
	   Hashimoto, Japan's 1986 women's amateur champion, sank five
birdies in a bogey-free round over the hilly 6,307-yard
(5,740-meter), par-72 Nomozaki Golf Club course.
	   ``I missed several short birdie putts,'' said Hashimoto, winner
of four tournaments in nine years as a pro. ``Otherwise I played
well and I was hitting my irons better. I think I missed the green
just once, on No. 4.''
	   Hashimoto returned to the tour earlier this season after a year
of rest and recuperation.
	   Hirata, in contention for her third victory, scored six birdies
against a bogey.
	   One shot back at 68 were Fuki Kido, winner of the Mizuno Ladies
three weeks ago, Chie Yoshida and South Korean Lee O-soon.
	   Defending champion Michiko Hattori shot a 75.

French cyclists looking for more gold

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - France's victory streak at the World
Cycling Championships has to end Friday. It has no rider in the
women's individual pursuit.
	   However it has good chances in two other finals of the evening.
Especially the women's individual sprint where Felicia Ballanger is
seeking her fourth consecutive title.
	   The French men's team pursuit is also in a good position to pull
a surprise after posting the top time in the quarterfinals of the
event Wednesday.
	   After three gold medals in three events over the first two days,
it will have to stop in the women's individual pursuit, where the
French didn't put any entries.
	   The French Federation judged that an aging Jeannie Longo -- with
more than a dozen world titles but approaching 40 -- was not of
world class shape despite that fact that she won the French title
last month.
	   Also Marion Clignet, who holds the world record and won the 1996
world title and Olympic silver medal, has been ill and also out of
shape.
	   So that leaves the battle between Germany's defending champion
Judith Arndt and Australia's Lucy Tyler-Sharman.
	   Tyler-Sharman led the women's individual pursuit qualifying on
Thursday.
	   Tyler-Sharman is one of the members of the Australian team that
is in conflict with Australian coach George Walsh and his methods.
That made Tyler-Sharman and two others to leave the team's training
camps to practice apart from the main group.
	   In the women's sprint event, Ballanger of France and Michelle
Ferris of Australia continued on their way to another showdown.
	   Ballnger faces Jennie Reed of the United States in one semifinal
and Ferris is against Tanya Dubnicoff of Canada in the other.
	   If Ballanger wins, it would be her seventh title since 1995. She
has won the sprint and the 500-meter time trial the last three
years.
	   France and Ukraine are the two top teams in the men's team
pursuit.
	   France won the first three events of the championship.
	   Philippe Ermenault won the individual pursuit title on Wednesday
beating teammate Francis Moreau.
	   Arnaud Tournant set a sea level best in capturing the kilometer
time trial and joined Florian Rousseau and Vincent Le Quellec for
the Olympic sprint team title the next day.
	   In Friday's qualifying, Rousseau, seeking his third consecutive
individual sprint title, had the best time of the 200 meters and
took his first round easily.
	   Another Frenchman, Laurent Gane, had the second fastest 200 and
joined Rousseau in the next round along with Tournant.
	   The track championships last until Sunday. The road
championships -- where France won three titles last year -- will be
in the Netherlands in October.

Government accuses opposition of sabotaging plans to end Tamil

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan government on Friday
accused the main opposition party of sabotaging its plan for a
political solution to the 15-year-old Tamil insurrection and urged
its rivals to rise above petty politics.
	   On the battlefield, government troops flushed out Tamil rebels
from their hide-outs in the country's northeast over the last two
weeks, killing 81 guerrillas and losing 12 soldiers, military
spokesman Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon said.
	   Most of the casualties were in an on-going battle near the town
of Mankulum, where 44 rebels and three soldiers died in an ongoing
military offensive to capture a strategic road.
	   ``We have examples in the world where similar issues have been
solved across the table and we see no reason why we can't do it
here,'' Constitutional Affairs Minister Lakshman Peiris told
reporters.
	   Sri Lanka's 100,000-strong armed forces are engaged in a costly
war to defeat the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The rebels
accuse the majority Sinhalese _ who dominate the government and the
military _ of discriminating against the minority Tamils.
	   The government wants the United National Party to support its
plan to give more powers to the country's nine regions, including
the ones where most of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils live.
	   After 15 years of fighting, more than 54,000 fatalities and the
drain of limited resources of the small country the size of Ireland
or West Virginia, there is no definite indication the war will come
to an end in the near future.
	   The UNP wants power to be devolved only through existing
provincial councils and not as extensively as proposed by the
government. It has also proposed that authority over education,
international finance, police and land should remain with the
central government.
	   The government had planned to retain only a few vital areas such
as foreign policy, defense, external finance and currency.
	   The government hopes that by giving more powers to the regions
and authority to run their own affairs, moderates among the Tamils
will eventually accept the sovereignty of Sri Lanka as one nation.
	   But the LTTE has already rejected the plan, saying it will not
settle anything less than an independent Tamil nation.

Russian uncertainty keeps regional markets reeling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Central banks in Romania and Hungary
intervened Friday to prop up their plummeting currencies while
share prices tumbled anew in central Europe due to uncertainty
about Russia's economic crisis.
	   While most former Soviet satellites have cut their economic
dependency on Russia, the possibility of a total collapse there has
foreign investors nervously abandoning their stakes in the region.
	   Polish shares dropped to their lowest levels in two years, down
9.5 percent in morning trading to 11,767.2 _ the third-largest fall
in the exchange's seven-year history.
	   ``It looks like the panic is growing,'' said Dawid Sukacz,
trader at brokerage Wood and Co. ``Right now, everybody is trying
to sell.''
	   The zloty currency fell to its weakest point this year, dipping
below the midpoint of its trading band against five Western
currencies to 3.825 to the U.S. dollar. It closed Thursday at
3.795.
	   In neighboring Hungary, the National Bank intervened for the
second time this week to prevent the forint currency from plunging
too far. Two separate infusions Friday morning followed the
suspension of trading on some shares after the stock exchange
opened 12.4 percent lower than Thursday's closing position.
	   The dollar was at 226.75-225.85 forints after the interventions,
compared to 228.30-228.50 on Thursday night.
	   Romania's Central Bank also stepped in to stabilize the leu,
infusing an estimated dlrs 20 million as the currency slumped as
far as 8.945 to the dollar after closing Thursday at 8.900 to
8.930.
	   Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech Republic's largest savings bank, was
hit hardest by falling share prices there. The bank, believed to
have large investments in Russia, saw its shares fall another 9.35
Friday after trade was suspended Thursday when the price fell more
than 20 percent.
	   Czech traders described selling as heavy and without precedent,
targeting the most popular shares such as CEZ, the country's
largest electricity utility.
	   But analysts throughout the region insist that Central European
economies were basically healthy, calling the market drops an
overreaction. They point out that Russia accounts for a very small
part of the world economy _ about the size of Holland _ and isn't a
major trading partner with most of Europe.
	   ``There's no fundamental danger, but the markets don't see
that,'' Ingolf Buhle at Delbrueck and Co. in Frankfurt said
Thursday.
	   Russia's financial meltdown has seen the Moscow stock market
virtually evaporate, the ruble plunge so badly that the Central
Bank halted its trade, and the government restructure much of its
debt in a package that would pay some foreign banks as little as 17
cents to the dollar for their investments.
	   Despite the negative reaction over the past two weeks, analysts
say investors eventually will realize Central European economies
are distinct from Russia and worthy of continued confidence. But
they concede further deterioration in Russia would likely cause
more investors to flee the region altogether.

Mubarak: Israeli policies will lead to more bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in
remarks published Friday that he feared that if the peace process
remained stalled, bombings similar to the Tel Aviv blast that
wounded 21 ``will spread to places around the world.''
	   Mubarak said the Thursday bombing was a ``natural result'' of
the breakdown of the peace process.
	   Talks stalled in March 1997 after Israel began construction of
new housing for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   ``Such explosions will be repeated and will continue to
victimize innocents as long as ... (Israel) adopts this hostile
position toward peace and refuses to hand over the land to its
owners, the Palestinians,'' Mubarak said.
	   ``I fear that these explosions will spread to places around the
world,'' he added.
	   Mubarak's remarks were published in the state-run Al-Gomhuria
newspaper.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the Tel Aviv blast.
	   Israel has refused to accept an American proposal for a troop
withdrawal from an additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank. Israel
sites security concerns.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the proposal.

Barcelona chases AC Milan Dutch forward Kluivert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ FC Barcelona confirmed Friday it was
holding talks with AC Milan in a bid to snap up Dutch forward
Patrick Kluivert a day before the Spanish league starts.
	   Club spokesman Javier Torres said Barcelona director Joan
Gaspart had discussed the matter with Milan's Adriano Galliani in
Montecarlo where they were for the European cup draw Thursday.
	   Torres said he could not comment on reports from Montecarlo that
a dlrs 17 million deal had already been struck for the 22-year-old.
	   AC Milan officials refused to comment on the matter. The side
has already rejected offers from English clubs Arsenal and
Manchester United to sign the Dutch striker.
	   At Barcelona, Kluivert would once again be under coach Louis Van
Gaal who helped him rise to international stardom while at Ajax of
Amsterdam. He would be eligible for Spanish league play if he signs
Friday but would not be able to line out for any European Champions
league games until the new year.
	   Kluivert joined Milan last year but had a disappointing first
season with the Italian club.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government horse-traded with
hard-line opponents Friday over their demands for President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation and a reversal of free-market reforms amid a
mounting political and financial crisis.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin accepted a package of
Soviet-era economic measures, which parliamentary leaders had
demanded as a condition for confirming his appointment, a news
agency said. The leaders called a special session of the State Duma
for Monday to consider the matter.
	   ``We must forget ambitions, we must stabilize the situation and
ease tension that reached a critical point,'' Chernomyrdin told
reporters.
	   But the Kremlin took a tougher line on a proposed power-sharing
agreement that would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   Yeltsin had a full day of meetings in the Kremlin on Friday,
after not being seen in public since Tuesday. He looked relaxed and
fit.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of him smiling and talking
energetically with acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he ``would not
even like to reproduce'' Yeltsin's reaction to calls for his
resignation. On Thursday Yastrzhembsky called the murmurings
``absolutely groundless idle inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as
scheduled next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov
and was scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Yeltsin's envoy to the State Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, said
Chernomyrdin agreed with the hard-liners' economic proposals and
would present them to parliament as his own program, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The package calls for such Soviet-style economic measures as
currency controls, fixed prices, state ownership and printing new
money.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   Chernomyrdin's spokesman, Konstantin Voitsekhovich, refused to
confirm the report. Chernomyrdin was expected to attend final
discussions on the power-sharing agreement and the economic
proposals later Friday.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed that lawmakers would meet Monday to
consider the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was appointed by
Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's mounting political
and financial crisis.
	   The decision was made by the agenda-setting council of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   The Kremlin said it disagreed with the parliament's
power-sharing plan and called for additional consultations.
	   The agreement would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policies. It would also offer certain
guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a president
steps down. This provision has fueled speculation that Yeltsin's
resignation was imminent.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Friday that the talks
on the agreement were stalled. He proposed alternative candidates
for prime minister, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, upper
house speaker Yegor Stroyev and Yuri Maslyukov, a former head of
the Soviet Gosplan state planning agency.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin, Stroyev and Luzhkov in an
apparent attempt to dissuade the latter two from entering the race.
Luzhkov and Stroyev indicated after the meeting they would not.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced leader
to handle the crisis.
	   But Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The government said it would try to sell 1 billion rubles
worth of short-term bonds next week. At the official exchange rate,
that would be dlrs 127 million.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The Central Bank moved Thursday to take control of one of the
country's largest commercial banks, SBS-Agro, to ensure that 25
million private depositors get their money.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks tried to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.
	   Ordinary Russians, meanwhile, struggled to make sense of the
crisis. Should they withdraw their bank deposits in rubles? Stock
up on groceries? Or assume they'll get by somehow as they have
during other post-Soviet crises?
	   Tatyana Atamas, a 30-year-old schoolteacher, pored over items in
a central Moscow grocery store but said she was buying at her usual
rate in part because she hasn't been paid.
	   ``In my circle there's no panic because there's no money,'' she
explained. ``And if they have money, they want to change it into
dollars. We're all trying to guess what will be next.''

Cambodian opposition leader calls for nationwide protests

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defying sharp government warnings,
opposition leader Sam Rainsy called Friday for nationwide
demonstrations against alleged election fraud as well as the ouster
of the country's leader, Hun Sen.
	   Speaking on the fifth morning of a sit-in protest in front of
the National Assembly, Sam Rainsy said that Cambodia was on the
brink of a ``revolution.''
	   Cambodians around the country should ``rise up'' against
dictatorship, he said, drawing cheers and applause from the crowd.
	   ``Victory is near,'' he said to an audience of about 2,000
people, which later in the day grew to more than 7,000.
	   His comments came on the heels of a government warning Thursday
that the sit-in is ``illegal'' and that Sam Rainsy is creating
social unrest.
	   Sam Rainsy will have to ``take responsibility in front of the
law for any kind of problems that could result from his
irresponsible and immoral behavior,'' the government said.
	   The statement raised speculation that the government _ which has
so far reluctantly allowed the rallies to go ahead _ may be
preparing to crack down and possibly arrest the opposition leader.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party and its bigger opposition ally FUNCINPEC
meanwhile appealed to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Friday to renew the U.N.'s role in the electoral process.
	   The U.N. helped to coordinate hundreds of international election
monitors who assessed the July 26 polls as generally free and fair.
	   ``We ask the United Nations under your leadership to renew its
central role in the international community's efforts to assess the
Cambodian elections,'' the two party leaders said, adding that the
positive assessment appears now to have been premature.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a majority, but not the
two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   Turnouts in front of the National Assembly have gotten
progressively larger since the sit-in began Monday.
	   The park in front of the parliament, dubbed ``Democracy Square''
by the opposition, is dotted with tents and the surrounding roads
are often closed to traffic by crowds.
	   The atmosphere in the tent-city is festive. Dozens of flags from
various opposition parties soar above blue tarpaulin roofs, vendors
sell fruit and other snacks, and demonstrators laugh, cheer and
clap as they listen to speeches over the loudspeakers.
	   Sam Rainsy, who visits the site at least twice a day, is always
given a hero's welcome by enthusiastic supporters.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party together won 58 of the 122 seats in the National Assembly but
have accused Hun Sen of massive fraud to ensure victory.
	   They have threatened to boycott the assembly to prevent a
government from forming.
	   While Sam Rainsy is seen as a freedom fighter by his followers,
critics consider him a rabble-rouser.
	   ``All compatriots join hands in overthrowing the Yuon puppet's
dictatorial regime,'' Sam Rainsy told Friday's crowd.
	   ```Yuon' is a pejorative term for Vietnamese. Prejudice against
the Vietnamese minority is widespread and an easy target for
politicians seeking popular approval.
	   Hun Sen's opponents cast him as a Vietnamese puppet because he
was part of a government installed in 1979 by the Vietnamese
invasion which toppled the brutal Communist regime of the Khmer
Rouge.
	   ``Cambodia does not need leaders who incite hatred and
confrontation,'' said Raoul Jennar, a Belgian expert on Cambodia
whose remarks were read over a television station associated with
Hun Sen's party. He called Sam Rainsy a ``dangerous and thoughtless
provocateur.''

Somali faction leader's visit could signal breakthrough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Somali faction leader Hussein
Mohammed Aidid arrived from Yemen for talks with Ethiopian
officials, and sources said he would meet with other Somali faction
leaders over the weekend as well.
	   The visit was seen as a potential breakthrough in efforts to
bring Somali faction leaders to the negotiating table. Aidid was
the only important warlord who in the past has consistently refused
to meet with other faction leaders in Ethiopia.
	   He has also been a major critic of the Ethiopian government's
cross-border attacks against fundamentalist Muslim groups'
suspected bases and training camps in Somalia. The government says
the radical Islamic movement was behind a spate of hotel bombings
in the Ethiopian capital and in two other cities.
	   Late last year in Cairo, 24 Somali faction leaders including
Aidid agreed to form a transition government and to hold a national
reconciliation conference. That has been postponed several times.
	   Somalia has had no central government since 1991 when warlords
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Farah Aidid joined forces to oust
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
	   They later turned on each other, and the country dissolved into
warring fiefdoms of clan-based factions.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday
to urge investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about
Russia's economic chaos and a new six-year low on Japan's benchmark
stock index proved more persuasive. But by the end of Friday, Tokyo
stocks plunged to their lowest level in 12 years. In fact, by the
time trading had ended across Asia on Friday and begun once again
in Europe, it was clear that the global free fall that began
Thursday was not yet complete. Japan's Nikkei markets closed at
13,915.63, down 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday. On
the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar dropped sharply in
early trading, but recovered somewhat by the afternoon, buying
141.64 yen. Stock markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also continued
their plunge Friday, with Singapore breaking through an important
barrier for the first time in more than a decade. In Europe, prices
plunged from the outset Friday. On the London Stock Exchange,
Europe's biggest market, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was off by 165.1 points, or 3.1 percent, at 5,203.4
by midmorning. In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX index plunged 5.2

lower house of parliament have said they will not approve new
premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday unless the government accepts
a power-sharing agreement and Soviet-era economic measures such as
currency controls, fixed prices and state ownership.
``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy and
has failed to create an effective class of property owners,'' the
draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the role
of the state in regulating the economy.'' The power-sharing
agreement would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet appointments
and government policies. The Kremlin on Friday said it disagrees
with the parliament's power-sharing plan and called for additional
consultations. It was clear, however, that after years and months
of insisting that free market reforms were inviolable, the Kremlin
is now willing to at least consider some retrenchment in the
economic field. Acting Economics Minister Yakov Urinson said Friday
the proposals would include printing more money _ another favored
Soviet response to covering budget deficits. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Central banks in Romania and Hungary
intervened Friday to prop up their plummeting currencies while
share prices tumbled anew in central Europe due to uncertainty
about Russia's economic crisis. While most former Soviet satellites
have cut their economic dependency on Russia, the possibility of a
total collapse there has foreign investors nervously abandoning
their stakes in the region. Polish shares dropped to their lowest
levels in two years, down 9.5 percent in morning trading to
11,767.2 _ the third-largest fall in the exchange's seven-year
history. The zloty currency fell to its weakest point this year,
dipping to 3.825 to the dollar. In neighboring Hungary, the
National Bank intervened for the second time this week to prevent
the forint currency from plunging too far. The dollar was at
226.75-225.85 forints after the interventions, compared to
228.30-228.50 on Thursday night. Romania's Central Bank also
stepped in to stabilize the leu, infusing an estimated dlrs 20
million as the currency slumped as far as 8.945 to the dollar after
closing Thursday at 8.900 to 8.930. (CENTRAL EUROPE-RUSSIA.)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession,
with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter, the government announced Friday. Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang also said the economy is expected to shrink by 4
percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99, compared with a 3.5-percent
growth forecast earlier this year. The Hong Kong economy, which
grew at a rapid pace for the last decade and expanded 5.3 percent
in 1997, has now fallen into its worst recession in 13 years. In
its half-yearly economic report released Friday, the government
said the second quarter economic contraction was ``mainly due to a
further slackening in both local consumer demand and export
performance in the second quarter.'' Inflation fell to 3.2 percent
in July, sharply slower than 4 percent in June, Tsang said. Annual
inflation is expected to be 3.5 percent, the lowest yearly rate in
13 years, reflecting the fall in consumer spending. (HONG

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker,
announced Friday it will buy a majority stake in its affiliate,
Daihatsu Motor Corp. Toyota will pay about 37 billion yen (dlrs 259
million) to increase its share in Daihatsu from its current 34.5
percent to 51.2 percent, Toyota said in a statement. It will be the
first time a Japanese automaker has taken a majority stake in
another domestic automobile manufacturer. Toyota said that closer
ties with Daihatsu will help the companies confront intensifying
global competition and share technology in developing
environment-friendly vehicles. Earlier Friday, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange suspended trading in shares of Daihatsu in order to verify
reports that Toyota was increasing its stake in the smaller
carmaker, which specializes in small, low-cost
vehicles.(JAPAN-TOYOTA)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government struggled to keep the
lid on the country's exploding economic and political crisis
Friday, claiming the situation was under control as the opposition
demanded Boris Yeltsin step down. ``Now I have sorted out the
situation in full and can say: Although it is certainly not simple,
it is absolutely controllable,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin told reporters Thursday night. President Yeltsin was
at work in the Kremlin on Friday, after not being seen in public
since Tuesday, adding to the sense of crisis. He looked relaxed and
fit. Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he ``would
not even like to reproduce'' Yeltsin's reaction to calls for his
resignation. Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that
the summit with President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as
scheduled next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov
and was scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
introduced a constitutional amendment Friday to scrap the country's
legal system and replace it with one based on the Muslim holy book,
the Koran. Sharif's majority government is not expected to have any
trouble acquiring the two-thirds majority required to pass the
amendment. Parliament is expected to debate for several days before
taking a vote. Sharif promised a ``true Islamic welfare state''
that would be based exclusively on the Koran as well as the Sunnat,
the writings of Islam's prophet Mohammed. Sharif promised that the
new laws will protect the rights of women and minorities in
Pakistan, where 95 percent of the country's 140 million people are
Muslims. While the current legal system is rooted in British common
law, Pakistan already has taken tentative steps toward Islamic
rule, for example requiring four male witnesses to prove rape.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defying sharp government warnings,
opposition leader Sam Rainsy called Friday for nationwide
demonstrations against alleged election fraud as well as the ouster
of the country's leader, Hun Sen. Speaking to a crowd of about
2,000 supporters on the fifth day of a sit-in in front of the
National Assembly, Sam Rainsy said that Cambodia was on the brink
of a ``revolution.'' Cambodians around the country should ``rise
up'' against dictatorship, he said, drawing cheers and applause
from the crowd. ``Victory is near,'' he said. His comments come on
the heels of a government warning Thursday that the sit-in is
``illegal'' and that Sam Rainsy will be held responsible for the
social unrest he is allegedly creating. The statement raised
speculation that the government _ which has so far reluctantly
allowed the rallies to go ahead _ may be preparing to crack down
and possibly arrest the opposition leader. (CAMBODIA-PROTEST)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With millions left homeless and the Yangtze River
still dangerously swollen, Chinese dissidents and legislators have
attacked misguided government policies for exacerbating China's
worst flood season in decades. The outpouring of criticism shows
how the summer-long disaster has laid bare the environmental cost
of rapid economic growth and touched disparate and often divided
groups across the political spectrum. In the largest petition since
the military crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy movement nine
years ago, 309 dissidents urged the government to abandon
environmentally disastrous policies, a human rights group said
Friday. ``For so many years, by blindly following the concept that
`man can conquer nature,' we have built up vast, evil debts to the
Yangtze River,'' said the petition, completed Wednesday and
released by New York-based Human Rights in China. ``We are now
swallowing the bitter fruit of nature's revenge and pay-back,''
said the petition. By the government's own count, flooding
nationwide has killed 3,004 people, destroyed more than 5 million
houses and caused economic losses of more than 166.6 billion yuan
(dlrs 20.2 billion). (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam said Friday it is releasing 5,219
prisoners as part of a general amnesty. Two top dissidents, whose
cases were recently criticized by the European Parliament,
apparently will be allowed to resettle in the United States. An
unspecified number of expatriates _ including Americans _ who had
been jailed on criminal charges also were to be freed, Nguyen Canh
Dinh, chairman of the president's office, told a news conference. A
spokesman for the Police Ministry's Prisons Management Department
said all would freed before National Day, Sept. 2. Being released
were Doan Viet Hoat and Nguyen Dan Que, whose cases were cited in a
July 16 resolution by the European Parliament. The U.S. Embassy
said it could not divulge which Americans were being released or
even how many, but welcomed the amnesty. (VIETNAM-AMNESTY)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Calling on Libya to honor its pledges, the
Security Council has unanimously agreed to suspend sanctions
against Tripoli once it turns over two suspects in the fatal
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The council voted 15-0 Thursday night
to approve a resolution that also threatens additional measures if
the suspects fail to appear for trial before a three-judge Scottish
panel in the Netherlands. ``This unanimous signal from the Security
Council to the authorities of Libya could not have been stronger,''
said Britain's deputy ambassador, Stephen Gomersall. ``This is now
the moment of truth for Libya to come good on the commitments it
has made.'' The two suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the
flight, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 270 people. Libya's U.N. ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda,
harshly criticized the 6-year U.N. sanctions and the short amount
of time Libya was given to respond to a U.S.-British proposal for a
trial in the Netherlands. But he said Libya accepted that the two
suspects be tried in a Scottish court in the Netherlands.

Clashes erupt in Hebron as Israel lifts closure

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with shots fired on Palestinian refugee camp, settler

 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian teen-agers threw stones and
empty bottles at Israeli soldiers in Hebron on Friday, just hours
after Israel lifted a weeklong closure of the city.
	   The closure preventing Palestinian travel in and out of Hebron
had been imposed after a rabbi was stabbed to death Aug. 20 in his
home in a Jewish enclave in Hebron. The killer, apparently a
Palestinian, remains at large.
	   A curfew on the 30,000 Palestinians who live in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron was lifted for three hours
early Friday to allow people to buy supplies.
	   Clashes broke out after the curfew was reimposed and about 30
Palestinian youths on the Palestinian side of the city began
throwing stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers.
	   A few Palestinian policemen initially stopped the stone-throwing
but lost control of the youths when the crowd grew.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets in response,
slightly injuring a woman passerby who was treated at a local
hospital.
	   Also Friday, shots were fired from a passing car into the Aroub
refugee camp north of Hebron, the army said. The bullets struck a
water heater on a Palestinian home, and no one was hurt.
	   Shortly after the shots were fired, a 30-year-old resident of
the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron was detained in connection
with the shooting, police said.
	   Tensions have been running high in Hebron, a city holy to Jews
and Muslims, and there has been periodic fighting between settlers
and Palestinians since the rabbi's death.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Believing it's reinforced military has
the upper hand, the government broadcast an appeal Friday asking
turncoat soldiers now fighting for the rebels to lay down their
arms.
	   Shelling continued near the airport, but central Kinshasa was
quiet after a day of retribution killings and summary executions.
	   Rebels from a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army slipped
into parts of the capital in recent days and launched an assault to
take the airport.
	   But on Thursday, the government and allied Angolan, Zimbabwean
and Namibian troops were firmly in control of the airport.
	   More than 1,000 prisoners have been captured in and around the
capital, the government said.
	   Zimbabwe's official new agency, meanwhile, reported that about
half the 8,000-strong rebel force on Congo's southwestern front had
been either captured or killed.
	   Away from the capital, there was no immediate end in sight for
the conflict, with peace efforts on hold and neighboring Uganda
saying the war will continue unless Kabila accepts a cease-fire
proposal.
	   Kabila maintains Rwanda and Uganda are behind the rebellion that
began at the start of the month.
	   ``We launch a patriotic appeal to you Congolese soldiers
involved in this Rwandan adventure against our country to drop your
arms immediately,'' said Joseph Kabila, the president's son and new
chief of the military.
	   Speaking on state-controlled Voice of the People radio, Kabila's
son called on the public not to attack Congolese soldiers trying to
surrender. He said nothing of ethnic Tutsi fighters.
	   Government troops on Thursday ran amok in parts of Kinshasa,
venting revenge on suspected rebel fighters. The discarded bodies
of 18 men, some charred and disfigured, were spotted on city
streets and back alleys.
	   One captive, wailing for mercy, was hurled off the side of a
bridge and then shot to death.
	   The killings infuriated the rebel command, who warned they would
``severely punish those who think like Kabila and are guilty of
bloody crimes of lynching people in Kinshasa.''
	   ``People suspected of supporting freedom fighters are being
lynched, burned alive or macheted to death in a macabre spectacle
resembling the genocide,'' said a statement issued from the rebel
base in the eastern city of Goma.

Economy shrinks in 2nd quarter, but 1998 growth target attainable:
</HEADLINE>
Official
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reason for government monitoring of GNP growth in 10th
graf

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A slump in agricultural production
caused by a severe El Nino-induced drought dragged the Philippine
economy down in the second quarter, but the 1998 growth target is
still attainable, the government's chief economic planner said
Friday.
	   The gross national product shrank 0.7 percent in April-June from
the same period in 1997 after expanding 2 percent during the first
three months this year.
	   As a result, GNP grew by only 0.6 percent during the first six
months this year, the National Economic and Development Authority
said.
	   The agriculture sector declined 7.5 percent during the period,
the worst performance in 31 years, the economic planning agency
said.
	   In the first semester, rice production fell 26.6 percent and
corn by 43.6 percent, the crops hardest hit by the drought.
	   Industry posted zero growth in the first semester, despite an
11.7 percent growth in mining and quarrying. Utilities grew 6.6
percent, but the gain was negated by a 0.4 percent drop in
manufacturing and a 3.8 percent decline in construction.
	   Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said the government
is still sticking to its 2 percent-3 percent GNP growth target in
1998, but conceded that only the lower end of the band is now
attainable.
	   The International Monetary Fund says the Philippines will be
``lucky'' to post 1 percent growth this year.
	   The gross domestic product, which excludes billions of dollars
earned by millions of Filipinos working abroad, shrank 1.2 percent
during the second quarter, the economic planning agency said.
	   The Philippine government monitors GNP growth closely because a
large portion of it is accounted for by remittances of Filipinos
overseas.
	   Medalla said he expects ``strong'' growth in 1999 and the
government is maintaining its target of GNP growth of 4 percent-5
percent next year.
	   Medalla believes a recession is unlikely, saying, ``Our slowdown
is very very mild compared to the other crisis-affected
countries.''
	   Rep. Joey Salceda, an economist, said that after reeling from
the impact of El Nino, the Philippines should now brace itself for
a blow from the Asian Financial crisis starting in the third
quarter.
	   ``The recessionary momentum is starting to accelerate in the
Philippines,'' Salceda said.
	   He said, however, that a study of 57 recessions in 24 Asian
countries since 1970 showed that an Asian recession generally lasts
for no more than one year, and it may be over by the first quarter
of 1999 in the case of the Philippines.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession,
with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter, the government announced Friday.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang also said the economy is
expected to shrink by 4 percent for the fiscal year of 1998-99,
compared with a 3.5-percent growth forecast earlier this year.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which grew at around 4.5 percent annually
over the past decade and expanded 5.3 percent in 1997, has now
fallen into its worst recession in 13 years.
	   A recession is generally defined as two quarters of shrinking
gross domestic product. The territory's economy shrank in the first
quarter by 2.8 percent.
	   The second quarter contraction was ``mainly due to a further
slackening in both local consumer demand and export performance,''
a government report released Friday said.
	   Inflation fell to 3.2 percent in July, sharply slower than 4
percent in June, Tsang said. Annual inflation is expected to be 3.5
percent, the lowest yearly rate in 13 years, reflecting shrinking
consumer spending.
	   Exports in July dropped 13 percent compared with last July. The
government forecast total trade this fiscal year would drop 2
percent, sharply lower than its earlier forecast of 6.1 percent
growth, officials said.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa told a news conference the
economic difficulty will ``continue for some time to come.''
	   Tsang declined to forecast when the economy will rebound, saying
economic troubles in Japan and Russia and slowing trade threaten to
the territory's recovery.
	   ``Japan's economic and financial troubles seem to have
intensified,'' Tsang said. ``This is outside of our control.''
	   ``The (Russian) ruble would have an impact on Wall Steet, which
would affect global stock markets. Hong Kong will inevitably be
affected by the global market fluctuations,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong now joins the other Asian countries also in recession,
including Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia. All of which
have been jolted by the year-old Asian financial crisis.
	   However, the official announcement of a recession was no big
surprise to many who have watched their businesses slow down and
investments lose up to half their value over the past year.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent and property
values have fallen by up to 40 percent. Interest rates are
exorbitant, a price for keeping the Hong Kong currency's link to
the U.S. dollar.
	   ``The economy is not very good, but even before, in the good
times, it wasn't very healthy,'' says 63-year-old barber Wong Liang
Tsen, who says business has dropped by 25 percent since the
beginning of the year.
	   ``Before, people would earn 100 dollars and spend 80, now the
money isn't coming so easily.''
	   To root out speculatorsand others betting stock prices would
tumble, the government continued Friday to pour money into the
market to drive the index higher.
	   Still, the Hang Seng Index shed 1.2 percent to close at 7,829.74
points.

Italian striker arrives in Rome to sign contract with Lazio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ World Cup striker Christian Vieri arrived in Rome
Friday to possibly sign the richest contract in Italy's soccer
history.
	   The 25-year-old Italian forward is expected to move from Spain's
Atletico de Madrid to Lazio of Rome on a dlrs 30 million transfer
fee.
	   The player would get dlrs 3 million a year for five years,
according to reports published in Italy.
	   The value of the deal is higher than last year's dlrs 28 million
record transfer of Brazilian star Ronaldo from Barcelona to Inter
Milan.
	   Vieri, who scored four goals in five games with the Italian team
at France '98, refused to comment on his transfer plans as he
arrived at Rome's international airport.
	   Lazio officials said they could not immediately comment on
Vieri's contract details.
	   Vieri is leaving Atletico after a single season in which he
ended up as leading scorer of the Spanish League.
	   The young striker, who has never stayed with the same club for
more than one year so far, had joined Atletico de Madrid moving
from Juventus of Turin for dlrs 19 million.
	   According to some published reports Vieri decided to leave the
Spanish club after growing tense relations with Atletico's
newly-appointed Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi.
	   Sacchi, a former coach of AC Milan and of the Italian national
team, dismissed the reports in an interview with Milan's daily
Corriere della Sera.
	   ``Vieri told me he was homesick and wanted to return to Italy
... He put us in a blind alley,'' Sacchi was quoted as saying on
Friday.
	   At Lazio, which is owned by Italian financier-industrialist
Sergio Cragnotti, Vieri will team with newly-signed Chilean striker
Marcelo Salas at the orders of Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson.

Clashes erupt in Hebron as Israel lifts closure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with shots fired on Palestinian refugee camp, settler
detained; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian teen-agers threw stones and
empty bottles Friday at Israeli soldiers in Hebron, just hours
after Israel lifted a weeklong closure of the city.
	   The closure preventing Palestinian travel in and out of Hebron
had been imposed after a rabbi was stabbed to death Aug. 20 in his
home in a Jewish enclave in Hebron. The killer, apparently a
Palestinian, remains at large.
	   A curfew on the 30,000 Palestinians who live in the
Israeli-controlled sector of Hebron was lifted for three hours
early Friday to let people buy supplies.
	   Clashes broke out after the curfew was reimposed and about 30
Palestinian youths on the Palestinian side of the city began
throwing stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers.
	   A few Palestinian policemen initially stopped the stone-throwing
but lost control of the youths when the crowd grew.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets in response,
slightly injuring a woman passerby who was treated at a local
hospital.
	   Also Friday, shots were fired from a passing car into the Aroub
refugee camp north of Hebron, the army said. The bullets struck a
water heater on a Palestinian home, and no one was hurt.
	   Shortly after the shots were fired, a 30-year-old resident of
the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron was detained in connection
with the shooting, police said.
	   Tensions have been running high in Hebron, a city holy to Jews
and Muslims, and there has been periodic fighting between settlers
and Palestinians since the rabbi's death.

 &UR; Global selloff rattles investors
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with fresh values for European markets, comment, changes

 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock prices plunged around the world on Friday,
as frightened investors staged sharp sell-offs and wondered when
the carnage would end.
	   Tokyo blue chips dove to a 12-year low, Hong Kong's key index
fell 1.2 percent despite heavy buying by the government and red ink
spread wildly through European exchanges early in the day.
	   ``The drops are so large. It's not just fundamentals driving
this, people are scared,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd.
	   Prices were sharply lower by early afternoon on the London Stock
Exchange, Europe's biggest market, although analysts pointed out
that shares showed a big recovery from their lowest points in the
morning.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by 108.1 points, or 2 percent, at 5,260.4 by noon, more than
halving its early losses of 4.8 percent.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 5 percent in early dealings but
had recovered by early afternoon to show a loss of 1.4 percent on
the day at 4,941.82 points.
	   ``An awful lot of uncertainties are still out there,'' said
George Hodgson, a European stock strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare
Govett in London.
	   The economic collapse in Russia, coupled with dramatic drops on
Wall Street, fueled the negative sentiment. Traders around the
world nervously awaited the New York Stock Exchange's opening on
Friday.
	   But Hodgson said investors may have been overlooking some
positive factors: Global economic troubles could make lower
interest rates more likely, and some share prices may have plunged
to levels where they had become a bargain.
	   ``It doesn't look particularly good, but I don't think we are
too far away from the bottom in most European share markets,'' said
Gareth Evans, European equities strategist at Nikko Europe.
	   Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday to urge
investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about Russia's
economic chaos and tumbling share prices proved more persuasive.
	   As soon as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged again, and
by the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest level in 12
years. Even the dollar _ normally sought as a safety net in times
of crisis _ tumbled against the Japanese yen.
	   By the time trading had ended across Asia on Friday and begun
once again in Europe, it was clear that the global free fall that
began Thursday was not yet complete.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average in New York tumbled 357.36
points Thursday as the deepening crisis in Russia and doubts about
Japan's handling of its recession jolted stock markets around the
world.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly
scheduled news conference Friday to urge investors to remain calm.
``The most important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   Japan's Nikkei stock index dropped below 14,000 in early trading
and closed at 13,915.63 points, down 498.16 points, or 3.46
percent, from Thursday. It was the Nikkei's lowest level since
March 1986.
	   Stock markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also continued their
plunge Friday, with Singapore breaking through an important barrier
for the first time in more than a decade.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed down 93.23 points, or
1.2 percent lower, at 7,829.74.
	   Trading volume reached an all-time record high of Hong Kong dlrs
79 billion (U.S. dlrs 10.13 billion), and traders estimated that
government buying accounted for more than 80 percent of the trading
volume.
	   For two weeks, the Hong Kong government has been propping up the
local stock and stock futures markets in an effort to punish
speculators, whom officials say have been selling the Hong Kong
dollar to drive up interest rates and weaken the stock market.
	   Market participants said the government may have used more than
10 percent of its reserves in the battle.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd.
	   As if that wasn't enough, on Friday afternoon the government
announced that Hong Kong has fallen into full-blown recession, with
its once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second
quarter. Hong Kong officials sid their economy is expected to
shrink by 4 percent this fiscal year.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
``People are watching what is happening everywhere, in Russia, in
Latin America. They are sitting on the sidelines, very nervous.''
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   Japan, the world's second largest economy, has been widely
criticized for not doing enough to revive its economy. Its new
government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo on Friday.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that shows the plunging
Nikkei stock prices in Tokyo's main railway station.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government horse-traded with
hard-line opponents Friday over their demands for President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation and a reversal of free-market reforms amid
mounting political and financial crisis.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin accepted a package of
Soviet-era economic measures, which parliamentary leaders had
demanded as a condition for confirming his appointment, a news
agency said. The leaders called a special session of the State Duma
for Monday to consider the confirmation.
	   ``We must forget ambitions, we must stabilize the situation and
ease tension that reached a critical point,'' Chernomyrdin told
reporters.
	   But the Kremlin took a tougher line on a proposed power-sharing
agreement that would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   In an apparent concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin also fired
prominent reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter
for the third time. Chubais was the government's chief negotiator
with international lenders, obtaining a dlrs 22.6 billion emergency
bailout package that failed to stem the financial crisis. Both men
are hated by the opposition for being the chief proponents of
reform.
	   Trying to show he was still in charge, Yeltsin had a full day of
meetings in the Kremlin on Friday, after not beingrsday Yastrzhembsky called the murmurings
``absolutely groundless idle inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as
scheduled next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov
and was scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Yeltsin's envoy to the State Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, said
Chernomyrdin agreed with the hard-liners' economic proposals and
would present them to parliament as his own program, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The package calls for such Soviet-style economic measures as
currency controls, fixed prices, state ownership and printing new
money.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   Chernomyrdin's spokesman, Konstantin Voitsekhovich, refused to
confirm the report. Chernomyrdin was expected to attend final
discussions on the power-sharing agreement and the economic
proposals later Friday.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed that lawmakers would meet Monday to
consider the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was appointed by
Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's mounting political
and financial crisis.
	   The decision was made by the agenda-setting council of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament.
	   The Kremlin said it disagreed with the parliament's
power-sharing plan and called for additional consultations.
	   The agreement would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policies. It would also offer certain
guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a president
steps down. This provision has fueled speculation that Yeltsin's
resignation was imminent.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Friday that the talks
on the agreement were stalled. He proposed alternative candidates
for prime minister, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, upper
house speaker Yegor Stroyev and Yuri Maslyukov, a former head of
the Soviet Gosplan state planning agency.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin, Stroyev and Luzhkov in an
apparent attempt to dissuade the latter two from entering the race.
Luzhkov and Stroyev indicated after the meeting they would not.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced leader
to replace the youthful former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Kiriyenko warned on Friday that Russia is yet to hit the bottom
and a full-blown chaos can't be ruled out. ``I don't want to talk
about it because words have an unpleasant tendency to come true,''
he said ``For Russia it (chaos) would be of an extreme type.''
	   Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The government said it would try to sell 1 billion rubles
worth of short-term bonds next week. At the official exchange rate,
that would be dlrs 127 million.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks tried to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Economic crisis? One Thai celebrity
decided to just grin and ``bare'' it.
	   Breaking with its usual diet of photos of corpses and half-naked
women, the country's biggest newspaper, Thai Rath, featured
semi-nude front-page photos on Thursday and Friday of Lek Isoon, a
popular model and actor.
	   Isoon decided to pose au naturel to help pay off his 40 million
baht (dlrs 950,000) in debts.
	   The photos are from an upcoming special issue magazine. Such
albums usually feature women.
	   Lek, of Thai-Scandinavian descent, was a popular TV star a few
years ago, but generally withdrew from the public eye to enter
business. He invested heavily in real estate, the most devastated
sector since Thailand's boom went bust last year.
	   Newspaper reports said he sold off his house, a Mercedes-Benz, a
BMW and a Lotus sports car, but still cannot keep up with the 1
million baht (dlrs 23,800) a month in payments he owes his
creditors.
	   He was quoted as saying that sales of his photo album may not
erase his debts, but will give him a little breathing space.

Korean-American pastor released by North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Korean-American pastor under
captivity in North Korea since May on spy charges was released
Friday at the request of the U.S. government, North Korea's media
said.
	   Lee Kwang-dok, 73, a Christian minister from Los Angeles, was
expelled from North Korea after he paid an unspecified amount of
fine, the North's Korean Central News Agency said.
	   Lee was arrested on May 27, a week after he entered North Korea
to visit relatives. He was charged with spying for South Korea's
intelligence agents.
	   There was no immediate South Korean comment on Lee's release.
	   The North Korean report said Lee posed as a businessman pushing
a joint venture project but actually spied on North Korea for rival
South Korea.
	   ``He was caught red-handed while committing such crimes as
alluring citizens of the DPRK (North Korea) into South Korea,
spying on the actual conditions of the DPRK and distributing
anti-DPRK propaganda materials,'' it said.
	   Instead of trying him in court, the North Korean government
decided to expel him at the request of Washington, the agency
report said.
	   The report did not say how much of a fine was levied on Lee but
South Korean news reports, quoting Lee's family in Los Angeles,
earlier said North Koreans had imposed a fine of more than dlrs
100,000.
	   The United States and North Korea have no diplomatic relations
but the two countries have unofficial channels of government
contact. Lee's release was reportedly arranged at a high-level
contact between the sides in New York last week.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a bloody three-year war
in the early 1950s.

New U.N. envoy to Angola arrives in Luanda to rescue peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The new United Nations envoy to Angola,
Issa Diallo, arrived Friday and said his first task would be to
rescue the ailing peace process from collapse.
	   The implementation of the peace deal between the government and
rebels ``is going through its gravest crisis since it was signed''
in 1994, Diallo told reporters at Luanda airport.
	   Diallo, from the Republic of Guinea, replaced Alioune Blondin
Beye, who was killed in an air crash in June. Beye negotiated the
peace deal which ended a two-decade civil war and had been
overseeing its delayed implementation when he was killed.
	   The peace process has been drifting dangerously since then, with
reports of a military buildup by the goverment and the former rebel
group UNITA. The recent massacre of over 100 civilians triggered
fears of an imminent return to civil war.
	   In the latest setback, UNITA on Monday accused U.S., Russian and
Portuguese observers monitoring the accord of being biased towards
the government and said it was severing ties with the three
countries.
	   Diallo was to be briefed later Friday by U.N. officials and meet
separately with government and UNITA delegations.
	   He said he would meet early next week with President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and with rebel chief Jonas Savimbi at his
highland base at Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
Luanda.
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its central highland
strongholds, including Andulo, has been a major sticking point,
prompting the U.N. and United States to impose harsh sanctions.

Malaysia's central bank chief resigns, acting governor named
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with acting governor named, comment

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An acting governor of the central
bank was appointed Friday after the bank's top officials resigned
over a policy rift with the prime minister.
	   Bank Negara Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng
Phak, submitted their resignations Friday, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement.
	   Meanwhile, Assistant Governor Dr. Zeti Akhtar Aziz will assume
the the post of acting governor Tuesday.
	   The resignation of the country's most senior bankers was
prompted by irreconcilable differences with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over monetary policy, sources close to the bank said.
	   Ahmad and Fong were absent from a news conference Thursday when
Bank Negara announced Malaysia's dismal GDP figures for the second
quarter. Gross domestic product shrank by 6.8 percent, formally
pitching the economy into recession for the first time since 1985.
	   It wasn't those numbers that prompted Ahmad and Fong to quit,
but rather a growing discord over the direction of monetary policy,
the sources said.
	   ``Both Ahmad Don and Fong Weng Phak are men of principle,'' said
a senior bank official, pointing out that Ahmad offered to resign
to take responsibility for the first quarter GDP contraction.
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim refused that offer.
	   Earlier in 1998, Anwar and the central bank engineered a
tight-money, low spending policy to help Malaysia recover from the
prolonged regional economic turmoil.
	   But when that failed to avert negative GDP figures for the first
quarter, Mahathir began pushing for a looser fiscal policy.
	   Mahathir has long blamed high interest rates _ a policy Bank
Negara adopted to stabilize the ringgit and keep a lid on inflation
_ as largely responsible for strangling business activity and
curbing economic activity.
	   He drafted former finance minister and close confidant Daim
Zainuddin into the Cabinet in June; soon afterward government
spending surged by 20 percent and benchmark interest rates were
cut.
	   ``This is very worrisome when the top technocrats are leaving
their seats,'' said Jimmy Koh, an economist with Independent
Economic Analysis Ltd. in Singapore. ``It shows that Mahathir is
firmly in the driving seat.''
	   On Thursday, Bank Negara announced it was easing interest rates
still further to provide a lifeline for troubled companies.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan police blocked a procession
Friday of several dozen Muslim protesters headed for the American
Embassy to protest recent U.S. air strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
	   ``There is only one path open for the oppressed Muslims of the
world. We, the Muslims, must unite in our struggle against
imperialist American oppressions,'' read leafets of the group, The
New Left Front.
	   The marchers were stopped about 100 meters (yards) from the U.S.
embassy.
	   Police reported no arrests.
	   Muslims, who are generally traders, make up about seven percent
of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people.

Croatia's coach lists players for Sept. 5 Euro 2000 qualifications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's coach counts on Davor Suker _
the World Cup's No. 1 scorer _ and recovered Alen Boksic in his
team's Sept. 5 match against Ireland, a qualifier for the 2000
European Championship.
	   Miroslav Ciro Blazevic, who announced his squad on Friday,
listed Alen Boksic, who missed the World Cup due to a knee surgery.
Boksic is fully recovered now.
	   Blazevic, however, left out seven players who won the bronze
medal at the World Cup in France this summer, a historical
achievement for the young nation.
	   Robert Prosinecki, one of Croatia's top strikers, was left out,
presumably because he and Blazevic have not been at loggerheads for
years.
	   In a recent interview, Prosinecki stated categorically he would
not play for the national team as long as Blazevic is in charge.
	   Blazevic was recently appointed for a new four-year term as
Croatia's coach.
	   Drazen Ladic, the goalkeeper who also excelled at the World Cup,
decided not to join.
	   ``He said The World Cup in France was the top of his carrier and
I do not want to force him,'' Blazevic told the Jutarnji list
daily.
	   Goran Vlaovic and Slaven Bilic have slight injuries so they
cannot take part. Midfielder Robert Jarni, who recently signed for
Real Madrid, and Igor Tudor, who now plays for Juventus, will join
the squad.
 &UR; Blazevic's list:
	   Goalkeepers: Marijan Mrmic, Zeljko Pavlovic (Drazen Ladic, who
performed greatly at the World Cup, asked not to be listed)
	   Defenders: Igor Stimac (Derby County); Zvonimir Soldo
(Stuttgart); Dario Simic (Croatia); Igor Tudor (Juventus); Mario
Tokic (Croatia); Mario Cvitanovic (Croatia).
	   Midfielders: Tomislav Rukavina (Croatia); Aljosa Asanovic
(Panathinaikos); Silvio Maric (Croatia); Zvonimir Boban (Milan);
Krunoslav Jurcic (Croatia); Robert Jarni (Real Madrid).
	   Strikers: Mario Stanic (Parma); Alen Boksic (Lazio); Davor Suker
(Real Madrid); Petar Krpan (osijek).

Police still quizzing one over Planet Hollywood blast

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with charges dropped against two women in graf 3,

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police questioned a man about the
bombing of a Planet Hollywood restaurant but said Friday they had
no evidence so far to link him to the fatal blast.
	   Reacting to an anonymous tip, police arrested the suspect with
two women at Cape Town International Airport as they were about to
board a flight to Egypt with allegedly incorrect travel documents
Thursday night.
	   The three are members of a Muslim vigilante group that targets
drug dealers in the Cape Town slums. Charges against the two women
related to problems with their passports were later dropped, police
said, and they were released.
	   ``We are still questioning the man about the Planet Hollywood
blast,'' said police spokesman Senior Superintendent John
Sterrenberg ``But at this stage there is no evidence to connect him
to it.''
	   The bombing at the crowded tourist spot Tuesday evening killed a
man and injured 27 people.
	   All three are members of the group People Against Gangsterism
and Drugs, which police suspect of carrying out a wave of bomb
attacks this year on drug dealers in Cape Town's sprawling
townships.
	   The arrests sparked anger among some in the Muslim community
that their religion was being singled out in a rush to judgment.
Most of the country's nearly half-million Muslims live in the Cape
Town area.
	   About 80 PAGAD supporters protested Thursday night outside the
Cape Town home of Justice Minister Dullah Omar. Shouting slogans
accusing the police of carrying out a witch-hunt against Muslims,
the protesters later peacefully dispersed.
	   ``It is unfortunate that the police seem to be just focusing on
Muslims at the moment,'' said PAGAD lawyer Ardiel Theunissen.
	   Originally conceived as an anti-crime group, local newspaper
reports have said PAGAD has adopted an increasingly Islamic and
anti-Western agenda.
	   However, police say they are sensitive to the accusation that
they are only targeting Muslims. ``We are exploring all avenues of
this investigation,'' Sterrenberg said.
	   Local media have rushed to pin the Tuesday night attack on
Muslim groups. One newspaper ran a front page report on Wednesday
describing a ``swarthy man'' who was ``Moroccan-looking'' captured
acting suspiciously on security cameras moments before the blast in
Planet Hollywood. Police on Thursday issued a statement saying the
film was at least a month old.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the bombing has come from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented the
anti-American, anti-Israeli group called Muslims Against Global
Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.
	   On Friday the group held a prayer meeting for victims of the
blast. Kneeling on a sports field at the University of Cape Town,
about 200 supporters prayed for peace in the city and condemned the
attack.
	   The organization plans a march on Saturday to the U.S. consulate
in Cape Town to protest American cruise missile attacks on
suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   The bomb has shocked a city proud of its image as a safe tourist
destination in a country infamous for its high crime rate.
	   Tourism industry consultant Joseph Aminzadeh said he thought the
number of visitors from the United States would drop by a third due
to the attack. In 1997 143,000 Americans visited South Africa.

Officials inform family members plane crash victims dead

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A missing Myanmar Airways passenger plane
previously reported to have crashed into a mountain in Laos
actually went down inside Myanmar, government officials said
Friday.
	   There were apparently no survivors. Officials were informing
family members, who had been told Tuesday that their relatives were
alive.
	   Thirty-three people were believed to have been abroad the Fokker
Friendship F-27 aircraft, although the passenger manifest lists
fewer.
	   Contradictory information on the plane had been issued every day
since it went missing Monday on a flight from Yangon to the
northeastern city of Tachilek.
	   Various reports from airline and government officials in
Myanmar, Laos and Thailand said it had ended up in each of the
countries, variously crashing, making a forced landing in a rice
field, or landing safely at an old airstrip.
	   On Friday, officials began informing family members that the
remains of some of those aboard from the plane had been found at a
place called Manibagi, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of
Tachilek. The area is close to the border with Laos.
	   A government spokesman, contacted by The Associated Press, gave
the same information.
	   State-run newspapers reported their first stories about the
crash Friday, saying that the search for the plane was continuing
on the basis of unconfirmed reports it had landed.
	   Some of the victim's families were preparing Friday to travel to
Tachilek. Some had prepared for a funeral at the first news of the
plane's disappearance, but suspended their plans after the more
hopeful reports emerged.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ Thailand and
Laos converge.
	   The area is extremely rugged and isolated and communications are
difficult. Before the plane disappeared, its crew had contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were reportedly infants.

Authorities urge novice climbers to quit, after 14 deaths in a week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ French authorities on Friday urged
less-experienced climbers to stay away from Mont Blanc after at
least 14 people died in a week, falling to their deaths from the
rain-slicked face of Europe's highest mountain.
	   ``Climbers who don't have great experience with how ice develops
and with cramping techniques must currently avoid scaling Mont
Blanc,'' Jean-Yves Claudon, assistant chief of mountain gendarmes
in Chamonix said by telephone.
	   High-altitude rains last week left a coat of ice on the
mountain, leaving some usually simple routes highly treacherous.
Authorities said 14 climbers from around Europe, including a German
father and son, suffered fatal falls.
	   Mont Blanc rises to 4,800 meters (15,750 feet) between the
borders of France and Italy.

Bomb-wrecked businesses face long haul of reconstruction

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Twelve wreaths and a prayer for Kenya's
economy marked a brief memorial service Friday for the 11 dead and
more than 1,000 injured from Kenya's Cooperative Bank.
	   The 22-story bank building, adjacent to the U.S. Embassy and a
now-demolished office building, was left unusable by the bomb
attack three weeks ago Friday that killed 247 people and wounded
more than 5,400 others.
	   With most of the bombing's dead buried, the bank held a memorial
service in front of the rubble. But the ceremony was meant as a
rallying cry for rebuilding as well as a tribute to the victims,
said the bank's managing director, Erastus Mureithi.
	   With the blast, 30 years of bank work ``fell down within a
second,'' said Mureithi, his loudspeakered voice intermittently
drowned out by the din of construction.
	   ``Until now, the major preoccupation of the bank was to put
ourselves back on our feet,'' he said, calling on listeners ``to
regain our strength from here.''
	   Cooperative Bank estimates it will cost more than 2 billion
shillings (dlrs 3.3 million) just to temporarily relocate the
bank's many branches and facilities and to rebuild its
headquarters, the Cooperative Bank House building.
	   The bomb blast wrecked five buildings and countless vehicles
closest to the explosion, and shattered windows as far as ten
blocks away. Now, all around the blast site, construction workers
are pounding in new beams and posts, repairing walls and ceilings,
replacing awnings.
	   Several businesses are back at work without windows, while
dozens of new storefronts line sidewalks still littered with small
pieces of rubble and glass.
	   Although there has been no detailed tally of total damages from
the blast, some estimates go as high as 30 billion shillings (dlrs
500 million). But some consider that figure too high.
	   Mureithi said the bank would move into several new buildings
over the weekend and begin the long rebuilding. He urged
shareholders to stick with the bank as it slowly makes its way
back.
	   ``We shall pick up the pieces ... and rebuild to even bigger
heights,'' he said.

Israeli-allied militiaman wounded in south Lebanon attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with civilian wounded in roadside bombing

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Shiite Muslim guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb Friday as a patrol of the Israeli-allied militia
passed, wounding one fighter and sparking artillery retaliation,
security officials said.
	   A Lebanese civilian was lightly injured Friday when another
roadside bomb exploded as he was driving near the Christian town of
Jezzine, the officials said.
	   Louis Nasr, a schoolteacher, was taken to a hospital, but was
quickly released, the Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility for that bombing.
	   The blasts kept tensions high in southern Lebanon, which has
seen an increase in fighting during the past two weeks.
	   Three Israeli soldiers and a guerrilla commander have been
killed and six Lebanese civilians wounded during that time.
	   Nineteen Israeli civilians were injured Tuesday night when
guerrillas fired rockets into northern Israel.
	   Lebanese security officials said one bomb Friday targeted an
infantry unit of the South Lebanon Army militia patrolling the
perimeter of their outpost at Shihin, some four kilometers (2.5
miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   Militiamen retaliated by firing artillery shells at guerrilla
infiltration trails in nearby ravines, said the officials, who
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   They added that the wounded fighter was evacuated to Israel in
an Israeli military helicopter.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which is waging a guerrilla war to
oust Israeli troops and allied Lebanese militiamen from a border
enclave they occupy in south Lebanon, claimed responsibility for
the attack.
	   Israel established the border security zone in 1985 to protect
its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS LEAD to mention Russian turmoil, raising references to
Wall Street and adding two new grafs at end with information on
markets in Russia, Budapest &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock prices plunged around the world on Friday,
as the turmoil in Russia sparked more wild sell-offs and left
jittery traders wondering when the carnage might end.
	   Tokyo blue chips dove to a 12-year low, Hong Kong's key index
fell 1.2 percent despite heavy buying by the government and red ink
spread wildly through European exchanges early in the day.
	   ``The drops are so large. It's not just fundamentals driving
this, people are scared,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street fueled the negative sentiment
and had traders nervously waiting for the New York Stock Exchange
to open again on Friday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 357.36 points Thursday
_ or 4.2 percent _ as the deepening crisis in Russia and doubts
about Japan's handling of its recession jolted markets.
	   Prices were sharply lower by early afternoon on the London Stock
Exchange, Europe's biggest market, although analysts pointed out
that shares showed a big recovery from their lowest points in the
morning.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by 108.1 points, or 2 percent, at 5,260.4 by noon, more than
halving its early losses of 4.8 percent.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 5 percent in early dealings but
had recovered by early afternoon to show a loss of 1.4 percent on
the day at 4,941.82 points.
	   ``An awful lot of uncertainties are still out there,'' said
George Hodgson, a European stock strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare
Govett in London.
	   The panicky selling was set off by Russia's economic troubles.
The Russian government struggled Friday to find a way out of its
mess, while opposition leaders were clamoring for the removal of
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   But Hodgson said investors may have been overlooking some
positive factors: Global economic troubles could make lower
interest rates more likely, and some share prices may have plunged
to levels where they had become a bargain.
	   ``It doesn't look particularly good, but I don't think we are
too far away from the bottom in most European share markets,'' said
Gareth Evans, European equities strategist at Nikko Europe.
	   Japan's finance minister went out of his way Friday to urge
investors to remain calm, but front-page headlines about Russ)`dokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that showed the plunging
Nikkei stock prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   In Moscow, Russian shares fell by 1.25 percent, a drop that was
modest compared to recent heavy losses. Other Eastern European
markets were hit much harder.
	   ``It's complete panic selling,'' said John Barnett, equities
analyst at Raiffeisen Securities and Investment in Budapest, where
shares fell 12 percent on the opening.

	   Believing its reinforced military has the upper hand, Congo's
government broadcast an appeal earlier Friday asking turncoat
soldiers now fighting for the rebels to lay down their arms.
	   Shelling continued near the airport, but central Kinshasa was
quiet after a day of retribution killings and summary executions.
	   Rebels from a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of Kabila's army in recent days slipped into
parts of the capital and launched an assault to take the airport.
	   But on Thursday, the government and allied Angolan, Zimbabwean
and Namibian troops were firmly in control of the airport.
	   More than 1,000 prisoners have been captured in and around the
capital, the government said.
	   Zimbabwe's official new agency, meanwhile, reported that about
half the 8,000-strong rebel force on Congo's southwestern front had
been either captured or killed.

Suu Kyi's party tells regime to let people, car go
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with party demanding release of members,
car. RAISES reference to Suu Kyi health. TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party demanded Friday that the government free seven members
detained two weeks ago when they tried to check up on their leader
during her latest roadside standoff against authorities.
	   The National League for Democracy also demanded that the
military government give Suu Kyi back her car, one of the vehicles
the seven had been using. Without the car, it could be difficult
for her to attempt further trips out of the capital.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, spent 13 days in a mini-van on bridge 32 kilometers
(19 miles) outside of Yangon, blocked by authorities from meeting
party members in the provinces. She returned home Monday because of
fears for her health.
	   The detained party members include two women. The NLD said their
detention ``shows that the authorities used excessive power and
shows that they bear a grudge against the people.''
	   One of Suu Kyi's colleagues reported that she was feeling
better.
	   ``Her blood pressure is back to normal and her health has
improved,'' said NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo. ``She is still under
medical care and is resting.''
	   Tin Oo said that more than 200 party members came to see her at
her home Thursday.
	   An official commentary in the Mirror newspaper accused diplomats
of aiding and abetting anti-government organizations, refusing to
call the country Myanmar instead of Burma, and having a ``negative
outlook toward the host country.''
	   The generals who came to power in 1988 after quelling an
uprising against military rule changed the country's official name
from Burma to Myanmar. The opposition refuses to recognize the
change, claiming it was illegal.
	   The commentary came a day after the government claimed it wants
substantive talks with the opposition. The U.S. Embassy said that
it was ``skeptical'' the government was serious.
	   Despite rhetoric about dialogue, the government continues to
attach conditions that would keep Suu Kyi, recognized in the
country and abroad as the leader of the pro-democracy opposition,
from taking part in any meetings.
	   International human rights groups, the United States, the
European Union and Japan, and some of Myanmar's regional neighbors
have all urged a dialogue with her to ease political tensions.
	   But the government has failed to move toward democratization,
instead engaging in heavy-handed repression of dissent.
	   Suu Kyi and the NLD have also been putting low-level but
concerted pressure on the government to release political prisoners
and convene a pro-democracy parliament whose members were elected
in 1990 but never allowed to convene.

	   Away from the capital, there was no immediate end in sight for
the conflict, with peace efforts on hold and neighboring Uganda
saying the war will continue unless Kabila accepts a cease-fire
proposal.
	   Kabila maintains Rwanda and Uganda are behind the rebellion that
began at the start of the month.
	   ``We launch a patriotic appeal to you Congolese soldiers
involved in this Rwandan adventure against our country to drop your
arms immediately,'' said Joseph Kabila, the president's son and new
chief of the military.
	   Speaking on state-controlled Voice of the People radio, Kabila's
son called on the public not to attack Congolese soldiers trying to
surrender. He said nothing of ethnic Tutsi fighters.
	   Government troops on Thursday ran amok in parts of Kinshasa,
venting revenge on suspected rebel fighters. The discarded bodies
of 18 men, some charred and disfigured, were spotted on city
streets and back alleys.
	   One captive, wailing for mercy, was hurled off the side of a
bridge and then shot to death.
	   The killings infuriated the rebel command, who warned they would
``severely punish those who think like Kabila and are guilty of
bloody crimes of lynching people in Kinshasa.''
	   ``People suspected of supporting freedom fighters are being
lynched, burned alive or macheted to death in a macabre spectacle
resembling the genocide,'' said a statement issued from the rebel
base in the eastern city of Goma.

Pat Robertson in China meets official church, avoids underground
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Pat Robertson met leaders of China's
state-sanctioned Christian church during a visit in China, but said
Friday he did not see underground church leaders because his
government hosts asked him not to.
	   Robertson said in an interview he was in China to discuss
religion and tell Chinese leaders that Christianity was not a
threat.
	   He said he told Premier Zhu Rongji that ``religion, particularly
Christianity, was not in any way shape or form an enemy of China
but would be a support of the things I knew he wanted in building a
strong future China.''
	   The religious broadcaster and Christian Coalition founder said
his organizations have condemned abuses of religious freedom in
China in the past and had contacts with the underground church.
	   But he said he did not raise problems or present a list of
jailed church members during his talks.
	   ``I think we're entering into a new era of peace in relations
between the United States and China and I want to foster those
relations,'' Robertson said. ``I think I can do a great deal more
subtly and quietly as a friend than I can ever do as a combatant.''
	   He told officials he was willing to grant scholarships for
Chinese students to his Regent University to help China meet some
of its need for new church leaders. Christianity is growing fast in
China, and churches have far too few ministers.
	   Robertson said his Christian Broadcasting Network had business
ties in China. The network's U.S. Media Corp. creates programs with
government-run China Central Television and sells children's
programs to Chinese stations, he said.
	   During Robertson's visit, police restricted Protestant minister
Yuan Xiangchen to his home, preventing him from holding services at
his unregistered house church in Beijing, church members said.
	   Chinese law requires all churches to register with the
government. Many unregistered churches remain active, but in some
cases authorities harass and detain members and shut down services.

	   The insurgents had scored repeated military successes early in
the rebellion, capturing a number of important cities in eastern
Congo and launching an airlift across the country to drive toward
Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of Angolan, Zimbabwean and now Namibian
troops has apparently turned the tide in the southwest.
	   Rebels forces, however, still occupy the Congo River port town
of Matadi and a major power dam that supplies Kinshasa with
electricity.
	   Far across the country in the east, the rebels control several
important cities, including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ whom they helped to oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border attacks by
militants based in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda's presidential defense adviser, Maj.-Gen Salim Saleh,
told a government newspaper that Ugandan forces are being attacked
by Congolese, Zimbabwean and Angolan forces.
	   Saleh told the New Vision newspaper on Thursday that the
fighting will continue in Congo if Kabila continues to oppose peace
proposals spearheaded by South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   He said Ugandan forces will not leave Congo until Kabila accepts
a cease-fire.
	   Saleh's latest remarks apparently contradict Uganda's earlier
contention that its forces were not fighting Kabila's government.
	   ``We have evidence that Kabila was arranging to attack us on all
frontiers. We had to defend ourselves,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Mediation efforts by the Southern African Development Community
have been put on hold until a Non-Aligned Movement summit in South
Africa next week, South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
said.
	   Two key players in the conflict _ Kabila and Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe _ will attend the gathering in Durban,
Pahad said.

Indonesians in Singapore to help overcome economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesians living in Singapore, many
of them ethnic Chinese, have set aside dlrs 3 billion worth of aid
for distribution to economically struggling Indonesia, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The group has asked the Indonesian military to help supervise
the distribution of the aid, which includes foods and raw materials
for medicine.
	   The daily Suara Pembaruan quoted Maladi, chairman of the
foundation Sembilan Adil Makmur, as saying the aid was gathered by
hundreds of wealthy Indonesians who have lived in Singapore since
the 1960s.
	   The foundation is helping to distribute the aid.
	   Resented for their relative affluence and ties to government
officials, ethnic Chinese in Indonesia have been targeted as
scapegoats in the nation's worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Mobs looted Chinese-owned homes and shops during deadly rioting
in Jakarta and other cities in May that helped oust former
President Suharto.
	   The Indonesian aid contributors in Singapore were very concerned
about the welfare of their country, Maladi said.
	   ``Many Indonesians in Singapore were sobbing to hear that many
of their fellows at home are suffering,'' Maladi said after meeting
with Indonesia's coordinating minister for people's welfare,
Haryono Suyono.
	   ``They don't expect any reward except that (the aid) will able
to reach the needy,'' said Maladi, a former sports minister.
	   Donors were ready to send 100,000 tons of rice to Indonesia, he
said, adding that scholarships and other assistance would follow.
	   The crisis is expected to shrink the national economy by 15
percent and push at least 50 million people into the ranks of the
poor by the end of 1998. Indonesia is the world's fourth most
populous nation, with 202 million people.

Government's battle with speculators intensifies, new measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials declared they won the two-week battle
to stabilize the financial markets in the showdown with speculators
Friday, and said they would introduce new regulation to make it
harder for speculators to profit.
	   But analysts warn this is a short-term victory in a war with no
end. They wonder how long the government can keep on winning, and
say it would be unable to unload the massive amount of shares it
holds without triggering a market collapse and inviting more
speculators to the market.
	   ``The government just won the August battle but what happens in
September?,'' asked George Chan, research manager at Celestial Asia
Securities Ltd.
	   ``If throwing money in the market is all the government can do,
victory will finally go to the speculators,'' the Hong Kong
Standard editorialized.
	   The government has been buying aggressively to in an effort to
drive the index to a level at which speculators short selling
stocks and futures would not profit or would lose money.
	   Friday was a crucial day in the battle as August futures
contracts expired. Those stuck with short positions August
contracts paid dearly as the market closed at a high level.
	   Investors who sell the market short borrow shares, sell them
hoping the prices will fall, the then buy them back at the lower
prices, pocketing the difference. They risk huge losses if the
index is kept high.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index traded in negative territory
throughout the session, ending 93.23 points, or 1.2 percent, lower
at 7,829.74.
	   Trading volume reached an all-time record high of 79 billion
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.2 billion), sharply higher than the
22.97 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.9 billion in the
previous session, which was already one of the highest levels all
year.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang refused to disclose the amount
spending on the buying spree, but analysts say much of Friday's
trading was government-related, and that it may have spend up to
dlrs 6 billion before Friday.
	   In a press conference, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said the
government is determined to fend off speculators.
	   They have been blamed for driving up interest rates, putting the
13-year old currency link with the U.S. dollar at risk, and sending
the stock market to five-year lows.
	   ``We'll do whatever we can,'' to restore order in the markets,
Tung said.
	   Tsang said the government will propose next month new measures
to make it harder for speculators to profit, and make futures
trading more transparent. He didn't give more details.
	   The government's market intervention has sparked a heated debate
in the territory. A poll commissioned by the mass-circulation Apple
Daily said 59.4 percent of respondents supported the government
buying spree, and 23.4 percent were against it.

Kuwabara takes one-shot lead in Hisamitsu KBC Augusta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Up-and-coming Katsunori Kuwabara shot a
5-under-par 67 Friday and surged ahead for a one-stroke lead midway
through the 100 million yen (dlrs 699,000) Hisamitsu KBC Augusta.
	   Kuwabara, winless since his only career victory in the 1995 Acom
International, scattered six birdies and a bogey en route to an
8-under 136 total.
	   ``I'm in good shape this season but so far without good
results,'' said Kuwabara. ``I think I need the sense of urgency to
win.''
	   Taiwan's Chen Tze-chung, winner of six tournaments in Japan,
also fired a 67, the day's best score, and was one stroke behind
the leader at 137.
	   Defending champion and overnight leader Masashi ''Jumbo'' Ozaki
shot a 72 and fell into a four-way tie for third at 138.
	   The 51-year-old Ozaki, Japan's winningest golfer with 107 career
victories, is in contention for his second title this season. He
won the Yonex Open Hiroshima in July.

Government shoots down rebel helicopter over Kinshasa suburb

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government forces shot down a rebel
helicopter Friday over an eastern suburb of Kinshasa, witnesses
said. Several civilians were killed and more wounded when the
helicopter slammed into the ground and burst into flames.
	   Thousands were fleeing the suburb of Kingasani near the airport,
where heavy fighting was reported between government troops and
rebel forces trying to topple President Laurent Kabila, when the
helicopter was shot down.
	   ``The body of the helicopter was still burning on the ground,''
said Bernard Makenga, a local Congolese journalist who witnessed
the incident and fled to the center of town. ``People were crying
and screaming.''
	   It was not immediate clear how many people were killed, though
Makenga said he saw many bodies scattered about.
	   The helicopter was a green military aircraft flown by rebel
pilots, a government commander said on condition of anonymity. It
was unclear where the helicopter had come from.
	   Earlier Friday, believing its reinforced military has the upper
hand, Congo's government broadcast an appeal asking turncoat
soldiers fighting for the rebels to lay down their arms.
	   Shelling continued near the airport, but central Kinshasa was
quiet after a day of retribution killings and summary executions.
	   Rebels from a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of Kabila's army in recent days slipped into
parts of the capital and launched an assault to take the airport.
	   But on Thursday, the government and allied Angolan, Zimbabwean
and Namibian troops were firmly in control of the airport.
	   More than 1,000 prisoners have been captured in and around the
capital, the government said.
	   Zimbabwe's official new agency, meanwhile, reported that about
half the 8,000-strong rebel force on Congo's southwestern front had
been either captured or killed.
	   Away from the capital, there was no immediate end in sight for
the conflict, with peace efforts on hold and neighboring Uganda
saying the war will continue unless Kabila accepts a cease-fire
proposal.
	   Kabila maintains Rwanda and Uganda are behind the rebellion that
began at the start of the month.
	   ``We launch a patriotic appeal to you Congolese soldiers
involved in this Rwandan adventure against our country to drop your
arms immediately,'' said Joseph Kabila, the president's son and new
chief of the military.
	   Speaking on state-controlled Voice of the People radio, Kabila's
son called on the public not to attack Congolese soldiers trying to
surrender. He said nothing of ethnic Tutsi fighters.
	   Government troops on Thursday ran amok in parts of Kinshasa,
venting their rage on suspected rebel fighters. The discarded
bodies of 18 men, some charred and disfigured, were spotted on city
streets and back alleys.
	   One captive, wailing for mercy, was hurled off the side of a
bridge and then shot to death.
	   The killings infuriated the rebel command, who warned in a
statement from their base in eastern Congo that they would
``severely punish those who think like Kabila and are guilty of
bloody crimes of lynching people in Kinshasa.''
	   The insurgents had scored repeated military successes early in
the rebellion, capturing a number of important cities in eastern
Congo and launching an airlift across the country to drive toward
Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of Angolan, Zimbabwean and now Namibian
troops has apparently turned the tide in the southwest.
	   Rebels forces, however, still occupy the Congo River port town
of Matadi and a major power dam that supplies Kinshasa with
electricity.
	   Far across the country in the east, the rebels control several
important cities, including Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ whom they helped to oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border attacks by
militants based in eastern Congo.
	   Uganda's presidential defense adviser, Maj.-Gen Salim Saleh,
told a government newspaper that Ugandan forces are being attacked
by Congolese, Zimbabwean and Angolan forces.
	   Saleh told the New Vision newspaper on Thursday that the
fighting will continue in Congo if Kabila continues to oppose peace
proposals spearheaded by South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   He said Ugandan forces will not leave Congo until Kabila accepts
a cease-fire.
	   Saleh's latest remarks apparently contradict Uganda's earlier
contention that its forces were not fighting Kabila's government.
	   ``We have evidence that Kabila was arranging to attack us on all
frontiers. We had to defend ourselves,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Mediation efforts by the Southern African Development Community
have been put on hold until a Non-Aligned Movement summit in South
Africa next week, South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
said.
	   Two key players in the conflict _ Kabila and Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe _ will attend the gathering in Durban,
Pahad said.

Urging confidence, Taiwan's cabinet pushes stimulus package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking to boost confidence in his
handling of the economy, Premier Vincent Siew ordered officials
Friday to quickly put in place a sweeping stimulus package
announced last week.
	   Task forces are being set up to ensure the best use of an
additional 200 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.7 billion) being
pumped into infrastructure and housing construction over the next
two years, Siew was quoted saying by his spokesman Chen Chien-jen.
	   As Chen spoke, Taiwan main stock index fell 89 points to finish
at 6,723, amid fallout from the financial crisis gripping Russia
and its knock-on effects in Europe, the U.S. and Latin America.
	   The market jitters come on top of amplifying affects of the
Asian economic crisis on Taiwan that has bit hard into exports and
forced the government to reduce its estimate for economic growth
this year from 6.2 percent to 5.5 percent.
	   The government intervened heavily during trading, and Chen
quoted Siew saying stability in financial markets would be
maintained ``at all costs.''
	   Officials have repeatedly called on the public to maintain
confidence in Taiwan's economic fundamentals, and top business
leaders have urged investors to buy stocks.
	   Siew ordered that projects under the stimulus package be held to
strict timetables, with financial incentives given for those
completed on time, Chen quoted the premier saying.
	   The government will seek to further boost the real estate market
by setting aside 160 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.5 billion)
as loans to first time home buyers, Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
said. Most of that money has already been budgeted, Liu said.
	   Funds set aside for construction of military dependents housing
will meanwhile be spent instead on existing units to help absorb
oversupply in the housing market, Liu said.

England makes slow progress to 286 for six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lankan bowlers kept a tight rein on England's
hopes of a big first innings total as they restricted the home side
to 286 for six at lunch on the second day of the one-off cricket
test at the Oval Friday.
	   After the experienced Pramodaya Wickramasinghe had removed first
day's hero Graeme Hick 15 minutes into the day, off spinner Muttiah
Muralitharan broke the backbone of a another threatening stand,
removing Ben Hollioake just before the break.
	   But John Crawley, 26, celebrated his England recall with a
tenacious half century, 51 not out at the break and held the
innings together in his near three-hour innings. Dominic caught has
yet to score.
	   Hick, who hit a chanceless 107 on the first day, failed to add
to his score and faced eight more balls before he was caught by
wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana off medium paceman Wickramasinghe
in the fourth over.
	   Hick's fifth century in his 49 tests lasted 345 minutes and
included 14 boundaries and a five off 238 balls.
	   After Hick's departure, England's young guns _ Crawley and Ben
Hollioake _ began to rebuild the innings, grafting 47 runs in 89
minutes lasting over 20 overs.
	   Hollioake (14), never at ease against the spin of Muralitharan,
finally holed out to Marvan Atapattu at deep mid on to end the
stand.
	   Crawley, who replaced the injured Nasser Hussain, was given a
`life' before he had scored. He hit a return catch off a no-ball to
Muralitharan off the second ball he had faced on the first evening.
	   He put it to good use, hitting eight boundaries in facing 126
balls.
	   Muralitharan, the 42-test veteran extended his career tally to
190 wickets with the figures of 3-84 in 42 overs while
Wickramasinghe took 2-68.

Chelsea to defend Cup Winners' Cup against Helsingborgs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Chelsea will return to Sweden to
defend the European Cup Winners' Cup crown that it won in Stockholm
last May, after Fridays's European soccer draws.
	   The London team will face minnow Helsingborgs in a tie that it
is expected to win comfortably.
	   The first leg is at Stamford Bridge on Sept. 17, with the return
two weeks later.
	   Italy's Lazio, which could soon be boosted by the arrival of
star striker Christian Vieri from Athletico Madrid, is the favorite
to win the Cup Winners' Cup.
	   The Rome club also has an easy-looking start, against Lausanne
of Switzerland, but club officials are taking nothing for granted.
	   ``We are glad that we do not have to make a long trip, but the
opposition will be difficult,'' general manager Julio Velasco told
reporters after the draw. ``The Swiss season also starts early, so
Lausanne will be well prepared.''
	   Spain's Majorca, which is also tipped to go far, starts with a
tricky tie against Scotland's Hearts.
	   Germany's Duisburg faces Genk of Belgium, while Paris
Saint-Germain comes up against Israeli cup winners Maccabi Haifa.
	   In the UEFA Cup, neither last year's winner or runner-up was in
Friday's draw.
	   Holder Inter Milan qualified for the Champions League, while
Lazio, the team it beat 3-0 in last season's final, is in the Cup
Winners' Cup.
	   Among the most eagerly-awaited contests will be that between
Stuttgart, last season's runner-up in the Cup Winners' Cup and
Feyernoord of the Netherlands, which won the UEFA Cup in 1974 and
is among the favorites this year.
	   Italian clubs have won seven of the last 10 UEFA Cup
competitions, but this year its entrants face difficult first-round
hurdles.
	   Parma has a tricky match against Fenerbahce of Turkey and
Fiorentina has tough opposition in Hadjuk Split.
	   Udinese, one of the surprise packages of Serie A last year, had
the roughest luck of all, being paired against Germany's Bayer
Leverkusen.
	   Among the other ties, England's Blackburn Rovers and Lyon of
France will contest an evenly-matched tie, Germany's Schalke faces
Slavia Prague, Liverpool meets Kosice of Slovakia, and Werder
Bremen plays Brann of Norway.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A missing Myanmar Airways passenger plane
whose fate had been a mystery for five days was reported by the
government Friday to have crashed into a mountain, killing all 36
people on board.
	   Officials were informing family members, who had been told
Tuesday that their relatives were still alive and that the Fokker
Friendship F-27 plane had landed safely in neighboring Laos.
	   Contradictory information on the plane had been issued every day
since it went missing Monday on a flight from Yangon to the
northeastern city of Tachilek.
	   Various reports from airline and government officials in
Myanmar, Laos and Thailand said it had ended up in each of the
countries, variously crashing, making a forced landing in a rice
field, or landing safely at an old airstrip.
	   On Friday, officials began informing family members that the
remains of those aboard from the plane had been found at a place
called Manibagi, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of Tachilek.
The area is close to the border with Laos.
	   A government statement said that the wreckage was discovered
about 2 a.m. Friday by a search party.
	   State-run newspapers reported their first stories about the
crash Friday, saying that the search for the plane was continuing
on the basis of unconfirmed reports it had landed.
	   Some of the victim's families were preparing Friday to travel to
Tachilek. Some had prepared for a funeral at the first news of the
plane's disappearance, but suspended their plans after the more
hopeful reports emerged.
	   Tachilek, 560 kilometers (350 miles) north of Yangon, straddles
the border with Thailand in the remote, opium-rich Golden Triangle,
where the borders of Myanmar _ also known as Burma - Thailand and
Laos converge.
	   The area is extremely rugged and isolated and communications are
difficult. Before the plane disappeared, its crew had contacted the
Tachilek control tower and complained of poor weather.
	   Shortly afterward, contact was lost and Myanmar authorities
mounted a search and rescue operation. There were no foreigners on
board. Two of the passengers were reportedly infants.

Ukraine's central bank chief confident in stability of country's
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will try to seek stability in its
economy despite the financial crisis in neighboring Russia, the
central bank chief said Friday.
	   Although the national currency, the hryvna, has been falling
rapidly in the past two weeks along with the Russian ruble, it will
not slide significantly further, National Bank chief Viktor
Yushchenko predicted.
	   ``There are no reasons for a sharp devaluation of the hryvna and
its rate is under control,'' Yushchenko told a news conference.
	   The hryvna has fallen from 2.14 to the U.S. dollar _ or 46 cents
each _ two weeks ago to 2.25 _ or 44 cents each _ on Thursday.
That's close to the limit of a currency fluctuation corridor of 1.8
to 2.25 to the dollar the government set for 1998.
	   The National Bank restricted dollar transactions at the
country's main currency exchange and limited the number of banks
allowed to purchase dollars.
	   In another move linked with the Russian crisis, the government
offered to allow domestic banks to exchange their short-term
government bonds for longer-term papers.
	   Yushchenko insisted that Ukraine's current financial turmoil was
a psychological response to events in neighboring Russia.
	   However, the country does have serious economic problems and
investors have been fleeing in droves for months.
	   Russia remains Ukraine's largest trading partner, accounting for
33 percent of its foreign trade. But only 8.6 percent of that trade
in the first half of 1998 was in rubles, while 70 percent was in
dollars, Yushchenko said.
	   In addition, Ukrainian banks held only 18 percent of their
foreign accounts in rubles.
	   ``The crisis in Russia could not trigger a financial crisis in
Ukraine through economic factors,'' Yushchenko said. ``But we have
the psychology of investors to deal with, and we need to maintain
their trust in Ukraine.''
	   Yushchenko said the confusion in the country's financial market
was bound to stop soon, given the plans of the International
Monetary Fund to consider approval of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to
Ukraine.
	   He said the IMF was to set the date for its board meeting on
Ukraine Friday.
	   Approval of the loan would allow the National Bank to nearly
double its current reserves of dlrs 950 million by the end of the
year, allowing the government to pay its foreign debt obligations
without delay, the National Bank chief said.
	   ``We remain firmly committed to timely payment of our foreign
debt, and we do not plan any other actions,'' Yushchenko said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talk about bad luck!
	   An Israeli woman who was injured a year ago in bombing attack by
Islamic militants in Jerusalem was hurt again, this time in a Tel
Aviv blast, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Ora Kaufman was among the 21 people injured Thursday in downtown
Tel Aviv when a bomb hidden in a trash can exploded. Her injuries
were not serious, and she returned home after treatment in
hospital.
	   Police said they thought the bomb was planted by a Palestinian
militant.
	   On Sept. 4, 1997, Kaufman was on the last day of her vacation in
Jerusalem when Palestinian suicide bombers set off explosives a few
yards from where she was sitting with her baby daughter in a
sidewalk cafe.
	   ``A wall of flame hit us,'' Kaufman told the daily Yediot
Ahronot. ``I held my baby tight but she was crying from the pain.''
	   The baby, 6-month-old Tamar, suffered multiple burns. Kaufman
was burned on the face and left hand, but was allowed to leave the
hospital the same day.
	   The baby spent two weeks in hospital but recovered quickly,
Kaufman said.
	   The paper showed two pictures, one taken after the 1997 blast in
Jerusalem, showing Kaufman clutching the injured baby. The other,
taken Thursday, shows Kaufman being wheeled into Tel Aviv's Ichilov
Hospital, lying on a stretcher but conscious.

Canada aims high in coming Commonwealth Games in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada, which is sending one of
the largest contingents to the 16th Commonwealth Games next month
in Malaysia, aims to win 100 to 115 medals.
	   In the last games in Victoria, Canada finished second to
Australia, the country's Chef-de-mission Margie Schuett was quoted
as saying in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
	   She said the Canadian contingent would include 278 athletes and
100 officials, adding that the first batch of athletes would arrive
here on Monday.
	   ``We are counting on all the sports to do well here. Shooting
was our top medal provider in Victoria,'' Schuett, who arrived here
Thursday, was quoted as saying by national news agency Bernama.
	   However, Schuett said winning medals was not their top most
priority as all athletes are expected to do well, with some chasing
medals while others aiming for their personal best.
	   She picked Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa as
front runners in the Kuala Lumpur 98 Games but surprised everyone
by saying that host Malaysia would be the one to watch.
	   ``Your athletes will be competing on home ground and they get
motivated to do well with the local crowd cheering them. I heard
the ticket sales is low but I am sure the fans will be there to
cheer their athletes,'' she said.

Suu Kri's party tells regime to let people, car go
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with govt statement, grafs 5-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party demanded Friday that the government free seven members
detained two weeks ago when they tried to check up on their leader
during her latest roadside standoff against authorities.
	   The National League for Democracy also demanded that the
military government give Suu Kyi back her car, one of the vehicles
the seven had been using. Its absence could make further attempted
trips out of Yangon more difficult.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, spent 13 days in a mini-van on bridge 32 kilometers
(19 miles) outside of Yangon, blocked by authorities from going
further to meet party members in the provinces. She returned to her
home Monday amid fears for her health.
	   The detained party members include two women. The NLD said their
detention ``shows that the authorities used excessive power and
shows that they bear a grudge against the people.''
	   A government spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press in a fax that the NLD had been claiming so
many members were arrested lately the detentions were difficult to
verify.
	   ``Suu Kyi's car has never been seized and I am quite surprised
to hear this story,'' the spokesman said. ``I believe her car is in
her compound.''
	   Earlier, one of Suu Kyi's colleagues reported she was feeling
better.
	   ``Her blood pressure is back to normal and her health has
improved,'' said NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo. ``She is still under
medical care and is resting.''
	   Tin Oo said that more than 200 party members came to see her at
her home Thursday.
	   An official commentary in the Mirror newspaper accused diplomats
of aiding and abetting anti-government organizations, refusing to
call the country Myanmar instead of Burma, and having a ``negative
outlook toward the host country.''
	   The generals who came to power in 1988 after quelling an
uprising against military rule changed the country's official name
from Burma to Myanmar. The opposition refuses to recognize the
change, claiming it was illegal.
	   The commentary came a day after the government claimed it wants
substantive talks with the opposition. The U.S. Embassy said that
it was ``skeptical'' the government was serious.
	   Despite rhetoric about dialogue, the government continues to
attach conditions that would keep Suu Kyi, recognized in the
country and abroad as the leader of the pro-democracy opposition,
from taking part in any meetings.
	   International human rights groups, the United States, the
European Union and Japan, and some of Myanmar's regional neighbors
have all urged a dialogue with her to ease political tensions.
	   But the government has failed to move toward democratization,
instead engaging in heavy-handed repression of dissent.
	   Suu Kyi and the NLD have also been putting low-level but
concerted pressure on the government to release political prisoners
and convene a pro-democracy parliament whose members were elected
in 1990 but never allowed to convene.

New U.N. envoy to Angola tries to rescue peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The new U.N. envoy to Angola vowed Friday
to try to keep the ailing peace process from collapsing.
	   Speaking upon arrival at Luanda airport, Issa Diallo, said the
peace deal between the government and rebels ``is going through its
gravest crisis since it was signed'' in 1994.
	   The peace process has been drifting dangerously since the June
death of Diallo's predecessor, Alioune Blondin Beye, who negotiated
the peace deal that ended a two-decade civil war.
	   Fueling fears of an impending return to civil war in Angola are
a recent massacre of more than 100 civilians and reports that both
the goverment and the former rebel group UNITA are building up
their forces.
	   In the latest setback, UNITA severed ties Monday with U.S.,
Russian and Portuguese monitors of the accord, saying they were
biased toward the government.
	   Diallo, from the Republic of Guinea, was to be briefed later
Friday by U.N. officials and meet separately with government and
UNITA delegations.
	   He said he would meet early next week with President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and with rebel chief Jonas Savimbi at his
highland base at Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
Luanda.
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its central highland
strongholds, including Andulo, has been a major sticking point,
prompting the United Nations and United States to impose harsh
sanctions.
	   Beye, five other members of the U.N. Angola mission, and two
pilots died when their plane went down over the Ivory Coast.

Schumacher reigns as Hakkinen, Villeneuve crash out in free

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Michael Schumacher finished
first in Friday's free practice for the Belgian Grand Prix to put
more pressure on world championship leader Mika Hakkinen, who
escaped uninjured from a crash during the tumultuous warmup
session.
	   Reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve was even luckier than
Hakkinen when he lost control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the
famed uphill and high-speed Eau Rouge curve at some 280 kilometers
per hour. The Canadian demolished his car when he crashed backwards
into the tires, yet he was soon waving to the anxious fans.
	   Hakkinen walked away from his damaged McLaren-Mercedes after it
spun off a slippery track and slammed sideways into the protective
tires at some 230 kph. He came back to challenge Schumacher's time
later but fell just short.
	   In an indication of how close their rivalry is, Schumacher and
Hakkinen were separated by a mere 0.011 seconds over the
6.968-kilometer (4.329-mile) circuit.
	   No such problems for Schumacher on his favorite track. Bouncing
his Ferrari off the curbstones on the final chicane, he finished
with a time of 1 minute 51.895 seconds, compared to Hakkinen's
1:51.906. Scotland's David Coulthard was third in his
McLaren-Mercedes, already 0.734 seconds back.
	   Former world champion Damon Hill confirmed the increasing form
of Jordan-Mugen Honda, finishing fourth in 1:53.100.
	   He edged the Williams-Mecachrome teammates Heinz-Harald Frentzen
and Villeneuve, who were fifth and sixth.
	   Schumacher is going for his fourth straight win in Belgium and
he will need it to keep his momentum going. The German surprised
many by winning the Hungarian Grand Prix and now has the Finn
within his reach with only four races to go.
	   Hakkinen has 77 points while Schumacher has narrowed the gap to
just 7 points. And with 10 points at stake in the wooded hills of
the Ardennes, he could reclaim the lead after Sunday's race.
	   He said it would be a fitting present for Ferrari's 600th
Formula One race Sunday. Pole position will be decided during
Saturday's qualifying session. Hakkinen is going for his ninth pole
of the season while Schumacher has yet to start first on the grid
this season.
	   Pole position is hardly the decisive factor in the Belgian Grand
Prix where the wide curves and long straightaways on leave plenty
of opportunities for passing.
	   The right choice of tires and the ability to adapt to the fickle
weather are just as important.
	   And Schumacher has proved time and again he is a master at that.
On Friday again, some 40,000 German fans roared their appreciation.
	   Schumacher's home town of Kempen is only 100 kilometers (65
miles) across the border in Germany and Spa-Francorchamps has
become his third home track, together with Hockenheim and the
Nurburgring.
	   Apart from being his home track, Spa-Francorchamps is also his
lucky circuit.
	   In his first-ever Grand Prix, the rookie placed seventh on the

race here. In 1995, he came from 16th on the grid to clinch a
spectacular victory. He hasn't lost in Belgium since.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Explosions ripped through a densely
populated eastern suburb of Kinshasa on Friday after soldiers
opened fire on a helicopter that was buzzing overhead, witnesses
said. Several people were killed and many more were wounded.
	   Early reports were contradictory, with some witnesses saying a
rebel helicopter had been shot down and crashed. Others said it was
actually a government helicopter _ that did not crash _ but that
stray rebel rockets fired at the aircraft had exploded on the
ground.
	   Thousands of people were fleeing the Kingasani suburb near the
airport, where the helicopter incident took place, and heavy
fighting was reported.
	   ``The body of the helicopter was still burning on the ground,''
said Bernard Makenga a local Congolese journalist who said he
witnessed the crash. ``People were crying and screaming.''
	   But other witnesses claimed the helicopter escaped the ground
fire, with at least one rocket slamming down on a crowded area.
	   A government commander described the helicopter as a green
military aircraft and claimed it was flown by rebel pilots.
	   It was not immediate clear how many people were killed, though
Makenga said he saw many bodies scattered about.
	   The reports of the crash or ground fire could not be
independently confirmed, but dozens of people leaving the area
confirmed the overflight and explosions.

Hamas founder distances group from Saudi terror suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The founder of Hamas on Friday
distanced his group from Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, the
suspected mastermind of bombing attacks on two U.S. embassies in
East Africa earlier this month.
	   ``Hamas has no connection to bin Laden,'' Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin told The Associated Press. ``Bin Laden is one of the
Muslim fighters against American aggression, but we have not met
bin Laden and he is not in our country.''
	   Yassin was responding to reports that CIA agents have questioned
six Hamas members imprisoned in Israel about their possible links
to bin Laden in recent days. The United States contends that bin
Laden runs a worldwide terrorist network from Afghanistan.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz, citing information from the Hamas web
site, said the prisoners were taken from their cells in Ashkelon in
southern Israel to another lockup for questioning several days ago.
	   In response to the embassy bombings, the United States has
bombed targets in Sudan and Afghanistan believed to be linked to
bin Laden. Hamas has staged several rallies in recent days to
protest the air strikes, but Yassin has been careful not to
threaten the United States.
	   In his speeches, Yassin has reiterated that Hamas' only
objective is to destroy Israel, and that there is no point in
attacking U.S. targets.

Dustup over dog-dubbing in Dr. Dolittle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There's a dustup over the dog-dubbing in ``Dr.
Dolittle.''
	   Italy's dubbers, who walked off the job in mid-July, say the
actor who gave the dog in the Eddie Murphy film his Italian voice
has violated their strike.
	   The new comedy opened Friday in Italy, with the voice of Pino
Insegno as the dog, speaking in a cocky Roman accent.
	   The pig, for the record, has an earthy Neapolitan accent, while
the tiger speaks with the slow-and-easy accent of Bologna.
	   The dubbers' strike has put the brakes on the fall movie season
in Italy, where virtually all foreign films are dubbed. Some of the
biggest Hollywood releases, such as ``Saving Private Ryan,'' are on
hold.
	   At this week's premiere of ``Dr. Dolittle,'' Insegno defended
himself against the complaints of fellow dubbers that he'd violated
the strike. He told reporters he'd finished his part while the
union and the studios were holding talks and that this, by his
interpretation, qualified as a pause in the strike.
	   The dubbers want more money and royalties when movies they've
done are shown on television.

Sudan seeks apology from U.S. for missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Sudan seeks an apology from the
United States for its missile strikes on a pharmaceutical factory
that Washington claimed was producing chemical weapons, a news
report said Friday.
	   Sudan's Minister for Energy and Mining Awad Ahmed Aljaz was
quoted as saying by national news agency Bernama that besides an
apology, the country wanted financial compensation.
	   Speaking at a news conference here, he said the United States
had now become the ``world's biggest terrorist'' and must be
stopped.
	   Awad was in Kuala Lumpur to brief Malaysia on last week's
missile strikes.
	   He had meetings with Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and
was to meet Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Bernama reported.

Turkish teachers protest head scarf ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A group of about 100 teachers, students
and parents demonstrated outside a downtown local education agency
office Friday over reprisals against teachers wearing Islamic-style
head scarves in schools.
	   The government has banned head scarves and other Islamic-style
attire in schools, saying they are a pro-Islamic political
statement that challenges Turkey's secular system.
	   Teachers rarely demonstrate, but the group said they took to the
streets because they'd been transferred to schools outside Ankara
to punish them for wearing scarves.
	   Several said they were punished even though they'd given up the
scarves after being admonished by education authorities.
	   The protest ended when a local education official promised to
review their cases, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The government often transfers civil servants to remote places
as a disciplinary measure.
	   The pro-Islamic daily Akit said Friday as many as 100 teachers
had been transferred from schools in Ankara. Education officials
were not available for comment.
	   Turkey is bracing for a wave of protests when universities open
in October. Many campuses have vowed to strictly enforce the ban
and refuse to register students wearing scarves.
	   There were several clashes last year between security forces and
pro-Islamic students.

Germany, France to take `active role' in helping Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ After days of insisting Russia must solve
its financial crisis itself, Germany changed tack Friday, saying it
would take an ``active role'' with France in offering support to
Moscow.
	   The more aggressive tone came as the Frankfurt stock exchange,
like others around Europe, continued to slide and Germany's biggest
bank indicated Russia's financial meltdown was starting to hurt its
bottom line.
	   Speaking at his party's convention in Munich, Finance Minister
Theo Waigel reiterated the German government's concern about
developments in Russia.
	   But while he and other officials were saying this week that
Russia must help itself out of the mess by pushing through
structural reforms, Friday's talk was more aggressive.
	   ``Germany must in this situation take an active role within the
framework of international cooperation,'' Waigel said.
	   He said he and French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
have agreed to jointly ``turn to the new Russian prime minister,
(Viktor) Chernomyrdin, to offer our support for the reform
process.''
	   He said he and his French counterpart also have agreed to
jointly ``appeal for structural reforms and the implementation of
the (International Monetary Fund) program to restore the confidence
of the financial markets and create the foundations for growth'' in
Russia.
	   In addition, Germany, Britain, France and Italy are drafting a
letter to send to Russia in the next few days regarding the crisis,
he said.
	   In a brief statement, Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG,
said ``most'' of its dlrs 290 million in short-term Russian
Treasury bonds were in the form of GKOs.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday, giving investors two not-very-attractive
options for trading them in at maturity. Analysts say foreign banks
can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   The Deutsche Bank spokesman also said the bank ``will raise its
risk provisions for Russia,'' without specifying by how much.
	   German commercial banks are Russia's biggest private lenders,
with about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans at the end of 1997. Unlike
the bonds, almost 90 percent of them are guaranteed by the German
government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   Deutsche Bank said earlier this week it had set aside 60 cents
on the dollar to cover its unsecured loans to Russia, which total
1.35 billion marks (dlrs 750 million).

 &UR; EU assessing economic, humanitarian fallout from Russia crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU head office predicted Friday
Russia's financial crisis will have ``no serious effect'' on West
European economies and banks.
	   Even so, officials were drafting a detailed economic and
financial impact study for the 20-member EU executive commission
which returns from its month-long summer recess Monday.
	   Also, said EU spokeswoman Martine Reicherts, the European
Commission will do a humanitarian impact study to see what effect
the financial crisis will have on the average Russian.
	   Since the onset of the crisis in Russia, the EU head office has
played down suggestions it will seriously impact on the EU economy.
	   So far, officials have been considering ``retargeting''
assistance under the EU's dlrs 1.6 billion economic aid program for
Russia. ``But for that we need the cooperation of Russia,'' said
Reicherts.
	   The financial crises in Russia and Asia was having some effects
on the currencies of the 11 nations that will launch a single
European currency in January.
	   The parities of these currencies have been locked irrevocably
ahead of the euro's launch and central banks are committed to
jointly defend these parities.
	   ``Break-up risk is a very minimal risk, but people are beginning
to talk about it,'' said Sally Wilkinson, senior economist at Daiwa
Europe in London.
	   Friday, for the first time in months, a euro-zone central bank
was seen openly intervening to support its currency. Traders in
Madrid said the Bank of Spain was selling German marks.
	   After months of near rock-like stability, some euro-zone
currencies have begun to drift slightly from their fixed parities.
The Italian lira has moved more against the mark in recent days
than it did in the past three months.

Global selloff rattles investors

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with European markets bouncing back, indications that
Wall Street might open higher, picking up 13th graf pvs, ``Japan's

 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The economic turmoil in Russia threw global stock
markets into a wild sell-off on Friday, but the panic subsided
midway through the European trading day and prices showed some
signs of stability.
	   Investors remained nervous as they waited for Friday's opening
on Wall Street, but futures markets indicated the Dow Jones
industrial average might open higher after its loss of 4.2 percent
on Thursday.
	   ``An awful lot of uncertainties are still out there,'' said
George Hodgson, a European stock strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare
Govett in London.
	   Throughout the earlier Asian trading day, shares were getting
hammered, pushing some key indexes to levels unseen in more than a
decade.
	   European markets opened with a tumble, with London and Frankfurt
blue chips falling by around 5 percent before showing a powerful
rebound by the afternoon.
	   ``It doesn't look particularly good, but I don't think we are
too far away from the bottom in most European share markets,'' said
Gareth Evans, European equities strategist at Nikko Europe.
	   Hodgson said the jittery selling may have obscured some positive
factors: Global economic troubles could make lower interest rates
more likely, and some share prices may have plunged to levels where
they had become a bargain.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by just 23.8 points, or 0.4 percent, at 5,344.7 midafternoon,
bouncing back dramatically from its early losses of 4.8 percent.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index plunged 5 percent in early dealings
but had recovered by midafternoon to show a loss of just 0.4
percent on the day at 4,992.30 points.
	   Big Asian markets never saw any chance of recovery.
	   Tokyo blue chips dove to a 12-year low, Hong Kong's key index
fell 1.2 percent despite heavy buying by the government.
	   ``The drops are so large. It's not just fundamentals driving
this, people are scared,'' said Robert Allen Feldman, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan) Ltd.
	   The panicky selling was set off by Russia's economic troubles.
The Russian government struggled Friday to find a way out of its
mess, while opposition leaders were clamoring for the removal of
President Boris Yeltsin.

Market rebounds after nearly closing limit down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Athens stock exchange general price
index continued its plunge Friday, while the central bank
intervened to defend the drachma.
	   ``The crisis is serious but appears to be under control,'' said
Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou.
	   Papantoniou said an auction for 12-month Treasury bills worth
200 billion drachmas (dlrs 643 million) was successful.
	   ``This means that things are heading back to normal,'' he said.
	   But Greek markets were reeling from the fall-out from the
Russian crisis and government officials called on investors not to
panic.
	   ``We need calm here,'' said government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas.
	   At mid-trading, the Athens Stock Exchange's general price index
was nearly limit down with a nose dive of 7.9 percent. Trading has
to stop at 8 percent.
	   But it managed to recover from its early heavy losses to close
down 4.9 percent at 2169.83 points. The index had slipped 7.7
percent Thursday.
	   Greek bond prices tumbled more than 300 basis points, with most
banks refusing to quote prices.
	   The central Bank of Greece intervened several times in the
currency market, selling dollars to support the drachma. It also
sold around dlrs 340 million at the daily foreign currency fixing.
	   It has spent an estimated dlrs two billion over the past three
days.
	   Reppas blamed the turmoil on the crisis in Russia, which he
described as ``unprecedented for humanity in recent years.''
	   He said Premier Costas Simitis discussed the crisis at a Cabinet
meeting. Reppas said the government may have to make a few policy
changes to ensure the country does not slip from its aim of full
participation in the European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   ``It is affecting the changes we want to make,'' Reppas said of
the crisis.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top cop pledged Friday that his officers
will make every effort to prevent businesses from taking unfair
advantage of the financial crisis and jacking up prices, a news
agency reported.
	   ``The essential thing is that the majority of the population
doesn't wind up in the clutches of speculators,'' Interior Minister
Sergei Stepashin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``Speculator'' is a derogatory Soviet-era word for those who trade
on the black market.
	   Devaluation of the ruble has begun to raise consumer prices,
especially on the imports that account for more than a half of the
food in Russian stores.
	   Fearing the impact of higher prices on the hard-pressed
population, the Russian government warned that it would punish
businesses found to make ``unjustified'' price increases.
	   ``I understand that we have a market economy, but the government
and the law enforcement agencies exist to regulate it,'' Stepashin
said. ``The situation is under control.''
	   He said police were also keeping an eye on banks and exchange
offices to prevent capital flight from closing banks.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Explosions ripped through a densely
populated eastern suburb of Kinshasa on Friday after soldiers
opened fire on a helicopter that was buzzing overhead, witnesses
said. Several people were killed and many more were wounded.
	   Early reports were contradictory, with some witnesses saying a
rebel helicopter had been shot down and crashed. Others said it was
a government helicopter _ which did not crash _ but that stray
rebel rockets fired at the aircraft had exploded on the ground.
	   Thousands of people were fleeing the Kingasani suburb near the
airport, where the helicopter incident took place, and heavy
fighting was reported.
	   ``The body of the helicopter was still burning on the ground,''
said Bernard Makenga a Congolese journalist who said he witnessed
the crash. ``People were crying and screaming.''
	   But other witnesses claimed the helicopter escaped the ground
fire, with at least one rocket slamming down on a crowded area.
	   A government commander described the helicopter as a green
military aircraft and claimed it was flown by rebels.
	   It was not immediate clear how many people were killed, though
Makenga said he saw many bodies scattered about.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled, but
dozens of people confirmed the overflight and explosions.
	   Earlier Friday, believing its reinforced military has the upper
hand, Congo's government broadcast an appeal asking turncoat
soldiers fighting for the rebels to lay down their arms.
	   Shelling continued near the airport, but central Kinshasa was
quiet after a day of retribution killings and summary executions.
	   Rebels from a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of Kabila's army in recent days slipped into
the capital and tried to take the airport.
	   But on Thursday, the government and allied Angolan, Zimbabwean
and Namibian troops firmly controlled the airport.
	   More than 1,000 prisoners have been captured during the
fighting, the government said.
	   Zimbabwe's official new agency, meanwhile, reported that about
half the 8,000-strong rebel force on Congo's southwestern front had
been captured or killed.
	   Away from the capital, there was no immediate end in sight for
the conflict.
	   Kabila maintains Rwanda and Uganda are behind the more than
three-week-old rebellion, but both countries deny that.
	   ``We launch a patriotic appeal to you Congolese soldiers
involved in this Rwandan adventure against our country to drop your
arms immediately,'' said Joseph Kabila, the president's son and new
chief of the military.
	   Speaking on state-controlled radio, Kabila's son called on the
public not to attack Congolese soldiers trying to surrender. He
said nothing of ethnic Tutsi fighters.
	   Government troops on Thursday ran amok in parts of Kinshasa,
venting rage on suspected rebel fighters. The discarded bodies of
18 men, some charred and disfigured, were spotted on city streets
and back alleys.
	   One captive, wailing for mercy, was hurled from a bridge and
then shot to death after he'd landed below.
	   The killings infuriated the rebel command, who warned from their
base in eastern Congo that they would ``severely punish those who
think like Kabila and are guilty of bloody crimes of lynching
people in Kinshasa.''
	   The insurgents had scored repeated military successes early in
the rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern Congo and
launching an airlift across the country to drive toward Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of foreign troops has apparently turned the
tide in the southwest.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ whom they helped to oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border rebel
attacks.
	   Uganda's presidential defense adviser, Maj.-Gen Salim Saleh,
told a government newspaper that Ugandan forces are being attacked
by Congolese, Zimbabwean and Angolan forces.
	   Saleh told New Vision newspaper that the fighting will continue
in Congo if Kabila continues to oppose peace proposals spearheaded
by South Africa.
	   Saleh's latest remarks apparently contradict Uganda's earlier
contention that its forces were not fighting Kabila's government.
	   Mediation efforts by the Southern African Development Community
have been put on hold until a Non-Aligned Movement summit in South
Africa next week, South African officials said.

Japanese importer arrested on suspicion of marketing Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested the owner of a trading company
Thursday on suspicion of illegally marketing the impotence drug
Viagra in Japan, where it has not yet been approved, officials said
Friday.
	   Kiyoyuki Takagi, 38, was arrested in Nagoya, 269 kilometers (168
miles) west of Tokyo, for allegedly violating the Pharmaceuticals
Affairs Law by selling Viagra wholesale, said a police spokesman,
who requested anonymity.
	   Police confiscated two bottles of Viagra containing a total of
60 tablets at Takagi's company in Nagoya, the spokesman said.
	   Authorities were alerted to the illegal sales by another Viagra
suspect, Hiroyuki Shikata, who was arrested last week on charges of
selling the drug. Shikata told police he bought five bottles of
Viagra from Takagi for 360,000 yen (dlrs 2,500) in June.
	   A thriving black market for Viagra has reportedly developed in
Japan. Magazines advertise Viagra-buying ``tours'' to the United
States and ways to purchase the drug through mail-order.
	   Viagra, produced by U.S.-based Pfizer Inc., is currently
undergoing goverment testing in Japan and is not expected to be
approved for sale anytime soon.

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) - President Sam Nujoma has ordered
Namibian schoolchildren to sing the Organisation of African Unity's
anthem alongside the national anthem.
	   All government institutions, embassies and high commissions must
fly the OAU flag, he said.
	   Nujoma made the orders Thursday at the opening of a ruling
Congress in Windheok, local media reported.
	   Government institutions must fly the OAU flag to remind them
that they are part of a larger Africa, Nujoma said.
	   Nujoma said he was acting in line with the 1991 Abuja Treaty,
signed by African heads of state, which requires member countries
to implement pan-Africanist measures over a period of 30 years.
	   Student appeared non-plussed by Nujoma's announcement.
	   ``At our school, the children have not even learned the national
anthem properly,'' said Sebastian Andreas, 15. ``They play it to us
on a tape recorder. They will have to tape (the OAU anthem too...
where is that anyway, the OAU?''

	   PATTERSON, South Africa (AP) _ An extensive manhunt involving an
air force helicopter, commandos, police and dogs was underway
Friday for the killers of an Eastern Cape farmer.
	   The search continued through the night, said police
Superintendent Jacobus Nel.
	   Jacobus Human was shot when four men, apparently posing as
cattle buyers, showed up at his home Thursday afternoon. A domestic
worker found his body in a lounge chair after hearing shots.
	   ``It appears that the attackers fled without taking anything,''
Nel said. ``They apparently took fright when another farmer arrived
shortly after the shooting.''
	   Human was not married and lived alone.
	   More than 550 mainly white farmers have been killed in the past
four years. Conservative parties say the killings are politically
or racially motivated, but government reports cite robbery as the
main motive.
	   -----
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghanaian officials gave United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan a different kind of mission during his
vacation in his home country: carry abroad the message about
Ghana's tourism potential.
	   Annan, accompanied by his wife and a number of U.N. officials,
on Thursday visited the regional capital of Cape Coast, located
about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Accra.
	   The group were given a tour of Cape Coast Castle, a former slave
castle and now a major Ghanaian tourist attraction, and also
visited a nearby trade and investment fair.
	   Later Thursday, Cape Coast town officials presented Annan with a
wooden carving depicting a horn-blower.
	   It's message, they told him, was clear: spread the word about
tourism potential in the region.
	   -----
	   ACCRA, Ghana, (AP) _ Some 150 Indian companies have invested in
the Ghanaian economy since 1995, making India the fifth largest
investor in Ghana, officials have announced.
	   In the past year, exports to Ghana from India amounted to dlrs
42 million, while those from Ghana to India totaled dlrs 55
million, Trade Minister John Abu said.
	   He was speaking Thursday at a reception in honor of the Indian
textiles minister, Kashiram Rana, who led a 12-member delegation of
jute bag manufacturers on a mission to West Africa.
	   Jute is a fiber used in the manufacture of burlap. Ghana imports
an enormous number of jute sacks from India to package its cocoa,
coffee, grains and other exports.
	   Abu said he would soon be leading a trade delegation to India
where he would, among other things, assess the quality of jute bags
produced there.
	   The delegation was to continue to neighboring Ivory Coast.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, has
promised to help raise funds for Kenya's national hospital, which
treated more than 1,500 victims of the U.S. Embassy bombing, a
newspaper said Friday.
	   Ferguson, who is in Kenya on a private holiday, visited blast
victims at Kenyatta National Hospital in the capital on Thursday
and promised to help raise awareness of the hospital's need for
assistance.
	   ``I am going to raise funds,'' the East African Standard
newspaper quoted her as saying.
	   The duchess spoke with several victims of the Aug. 7 bombing,
which killed 247 people and wounded more than 5,400 others.
	   She listened to the harrowing tales of several survivors and
then spoke with hospital staff to determine what kind of assistance
the hospital needed.
	   ``I will spread the word around _ we must help the bomb blast
victims,'' the duchess said.

Russian prime minister insists he has crisis under control

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government horse-traded with
hard-line opponents Friday over their demands for President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation and a reversal of free-market reforms amid
mounting political and financial crisis.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin accepted a package of
Soviet-era economic measures, which parliamentary leaders had
demanded as a condition for confirming his appointment, a news
agency said. The leaders called a special session of the State Duma
for Monday to consider the confirmation.
	   ``We must forget ambitions, we must stabilize the situation and
ease tension that reached a critical point,'' Chernomyrdin told
reporters.
	   But the Kremlin took a tougher line on a proposed power-sharing
agreement that would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   In an apparent concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin also fired
prominent reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter
for the third time. Chubais was the government's chief negotiator
with international lenders, obtaining a dlrs 22.6 billion emergency
bailout package that failed to stem the financial crisis. Both men
are hated by the opposition for being the chief proponents of
reform.
	   Russians, who have weathered one government crisis after another
in recent years, were taking the latest one in stride, too.
Although there were lines outside some banks, there was no sign of
food-hoarding or social unease.
	   Trying to show he was still in charge, Yeltsin had a full day of
meetings in the Kremlin on Friday after not being seen in public
since Tuesday. He looked relaxed and fit.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of him smiling and talking
energetically with acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria.
	   He gave a television interview that was to be broadcast Thursday
night, and the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Yegor
Stroyev, said the president would make a political statement on
behalf of all branches of government. It was not clear whether the
statement would be made during the TV appearance or separately.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he ``would not
even like to reproduce'' Yeltsin's reaction to calls for his
resignation. On Thursday Yastrzhembsky called the murmurings
``absolutely groundless idle inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as
scheduled next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov
and was scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Yeltsin's envoy to the State Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, said
Chernomyrdin agreed with the hard-liners' economic proposals and
would present them to parliament as his own program, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The package calls for such Soviet-style economic measures as
currency controls, fixed prices, state ownership and printing new
money.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   Chernomyrdin's spokesman, Konstantin Voitsekhovich, refused to
confirm the report. Chernomyrdin was expected to attend final
discussions on the power-sharing agreement and the economic
proposals later Friday.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed that lawmakers would meet Monday to
consider the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was appointed by
Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's mounting political
and financial crisis.
	   The Kremlin said it disagreed with the parliament's
power-sharing plan and called for additional consultations.
	   The agreement would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policies. It would also offer certain
guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a president
steps down. This provision has fueled speculation that Yeltsin's
resignation was imminent.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Friday that the talks
on the agreement were stalled. He proposed alternative candidates
for prime minister, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, upper
house speaker Yegor Stroyev and Yuri Maslyukov, a former head of
the Soviet Gosplan state planning agency.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin, Stroyev and Luzhkov in an
apparent attempt to dissuade the latter two from entering the race.
Luzhkov and Stroyev indicated after the meeting they would not.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced leader
to replace the youthful former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Kiriyenko warned on Friday that Russia is yet to hit the bottom
and a full-blown chaos can't be ruled out. ``I don't want to talk
about it because words have an unpleasant tendency to come true,''
he said ``For Russia it (chaos) would be of an extreme type.''
	   Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The government said it would try to sell 1 billion rubles
worth of short-term bonds next week. At the official exchange rate,
that would be dlrs 127 million.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The last transactions on Tuesday left the
official exchange rate at 7.86 rubles to the dollar, or 12.7 cents.
The street rate is below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   The halt has created a severe shortage of dollars both for banks
and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of their
reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want to
buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of luck.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks tried to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ The Russian Trading System suspended trading twice Thursday,
and the index ended down 17 percent at 63.2 points.

Schumacher reigns as Hakkinen, Villeneuve crash in practice

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Michael Schumacher looked like
the early favorite in Friday's practice for the Belgian Grand Prix,
a session that saw Mike Hakkinen and Jacques Villenenueve walk away
from crashes.
	   Villeneuve lost control of his Williams-Mecachrome on the famed
uphill and high-speed Eau Rouge curve at about 280 kph (175 mph),
demolishing his car when and crashing backwards into a tire
barrier. Witmesses reported smoke and fire coming from Villeneuve's
car, but the Canadian was seen waving and smiling as he walked to a
waiting ambulance.
	   Hakkinen also walked away from his incident which damaged his
McLaren-Mercedes after it spun off a slippery track and slammed
sideways into the protective tires at about 230 kph (143 mph).
	   He returned in his backup to challenge Schumacher, getting
within 0.011 of a seconds over the 6.968-kilometer (4.329-mile)
circuit.
	   Schumacher's only mishap was bouncing his Ferrari off the
curbstones on the final chicane. He finished with a time of 1
minute, 51.895 seconds. Scotland's David Coulthard was third in the
other McLaren, 0.734 seconds back.
	   Damon Hill continuted along with the improving performance of
his Jordan-Mugen Honda, finishing fourth in 1:53.100.
	   He edged the Williams-Mecachrome teammates Heinz-Harald Frentzen
and Villeneuve, who were fifth and sixth.
	   Schumacher is going for his fourth straight victory in Belgium
and he will need it to keep his momentum going. The German
surprised many by winning the Hungarian Grand Prix and now has
Hakkinen within his reach with only four races to go.
	   Hakkinen has 77 points, only seven more than Schumacher. With
the race in the wooded hills of the Ardennes worth 10 points to the
winner, Schumacher could reclaim the lead Sunday.
	   The German said it would be a fitting present for Ferrari's
600th Formula One race Sunday. The pole position will be decided
during Saturday's qualifying session. Hakkinen is going for his
ninth pole of the season while Schumacher has yet to start first on
the grid this season.
	   Pole position is hardly the decisive factor in the Belgian Grand
Prix, where the wide curves and long straightaways on leave plenty
of opportunities for passing.
	   The right choice of tires and the ability to adapt to the fickle
weather are considered more important.
	   Schumacher has proved repeatedly he is a master at that. On
Friday again, some 40,000 German fans roared their appreciation.
	   Schumacher's home town of Kempen is only 100 kilometers (65
miles) across the border in Germany and Spa-Francorchamps has
become his third home track, together with Hockenheim and the
Nurburgring.
	   Apart from being nearly his home, Spa-Francorchamps is also his
lucky circuit.
	   Schumacher made his Formula One debut at Spa in 1991 and started
seventh on the grid. A year later, he won his first Formula One
race at Spa and in 1995 he came from 16th on the grid to win. He
hasn't lost in Belgium since.

Hamas founder distances group from Saudi terror suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The founder of Hamas on Friday
distanced his group from Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, the
suspected mastermind of bombing attacks on two U.S. embassies in
East Africa earlier this month.
	   ``Hamas has no connection to bin Laden,'' Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin told The Associated Press. ``Bin Laden is one of the
Muslim fighters against American aggression, but we have not met
bin Laden and he is not in our country.''
	   Yassin was responding to reports that CIA agents have questioned
six Hamas members imprisoned in Israel about their possible links
to bin Laden in recent days. The United States contends that bin
Laden runs a worldwide terrorist network from Afghanistan.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz, citing information from the Hamas web
site, said the prisoners were taken from their cells in Ashkelon in
southern Israel to another lockup for questioning several days ago.
	   In response to the embassy bombings, the United States has
bombed targets in Sudan and Afghanistan believed to be linked to
bin Laden. Hamas has staged several rallies in recent days to
protest the air strikes, but Yassin has been careful not to
threaten the United States.
	   In his speeches, Yassin has reiterated that Hamas' only
objective is to destroy Israel, and that there is no point in
attacking U.S. targets.

Havel released from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel was
released from Prague's military hospital Friday, more than a month
after he underwent abdominal surgery.
	   Spokesman Ladislav Spacek said Havel now will rest in the
presidential residence in Lany, outside Prague, where he will
prepare for his official visit to the United States, scheduled for
Sept. 14-19.
	   A doctor and nurse will stay with Havel in Lany, Spacek said.
	   ``I'm glad that the surgery was successful and that we got over
the post-surgery complications,'' the news agency CTK quoted Havel
as saying as he was leaving the hospital.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed a
colostomy performed on Havel in April when he suffered a ruptured
colon while vacationing in the Austrian Alps.
	   Havel later developed pneumonia related to the operation and
doctors had to perform tracheotomy Aug. 3 to help him breathe.
	   The following day, Havel's heart rate soared to 200 beats per
minute and his blood pressure dropped. He had to be stabilized with
electroshocks and was reported in critical condition.
	   ``I'm sorry (my recovery) took a little longer than I
expected,'' Havel said Friday.
	   Doctors said Thursday a tube from Havel's trachea was removed
Wednesday and the small opening has closed spontaneously.
	   Havel has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when
a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.

ATP Tour latest to ban androstenedione
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Men's tennis joined the list of the sports
organizations banning the use of androstenedione, the over-the
counter strength-building substance at the heart of a debate
involving American baseball slugger Mark McGwire.
	   Health reasons were cited for the decision by Bill Norris,
medical trainer for the ATP Tour, who said the subject became
pertinent after McGwire acknowledged using the
testosterone-building substance.
	   Norris said Thursday the ban was being put into effect on the
recommendation of Managed Athletic Testing Service, the tour's
medical consultant. He said he requested an opinion after players
on the tour asked him about the substance
	   The company felt that there were enough potential side effects,
including brittle joint ligaments, to warrant a ban, Norris told
The New York Times.
	   While androstenedione can be readily purchased without a
prescription, its use is banned by the International Olympic
Committee and several American sports leagues and assocaitions.
	   The issue came to light with McGwire, who is closing on the U.S.
Major League Baseball record for home runs in a single season and
has said he has taken the dietary supplement for about a year.
	   MLB said this week it would look into the use of all dietary
supplements.
	   Norris said the players will be informed of the ban on Monday
when the U.S. Open begins. A ban on the substance already exists in
Grand Slam tournaments, which are governed by the International
Tennis Federation, a member of the IOC.
	   Norris told the Times no punishment had yet been determined for
using androstenedione, which is said to enhance strength and the
ability to recover from rigorous training and injuries.
	   Norris said he knew of no player who used the substance, but
added that several used creatine, also used for strenghth-building.

Linford Christie to run relay in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former world and Olympic 100-meter champion
Linford Christie is coming out of retirement _ for one night only _
to compete in a relay race in Berlin next week.
	   Christie's manager, Sue Barrett, confirmed Friday that the
British sprinter would run the anchor leg in a 4-by-100 relay at
Wednesday's ISTAF 98 Golden League meet.
	   The relay team will also include fellow British runners Darren
Campbell, Dwain Chambres and Christian Malcolm.
	   Campbell, who is coached by Christie, is the new European
100-meter champion. Chambers, silver medalist at the European
championships, and Malcolm, the junior world champion, are part of
Christie's ``Nuff Respect'' management company.
	   ``We were asked to put a relay team from Nuff Respect together
for the meeting,'' Barrett said. ``If we had not done so there
would have been no British team there.''
	   Barrett stressed that Christie, who retired last year, was
returning for one meet only.
	   ``Linford is not coming back to serious competition,'' she said.
``You will never see Linford on the international stage again.''

Japan leads the world in life expectancy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan led the world in life expectancy in 1997,
with baby girls under the age of one that year likely to live to
nearly 84, according to a report released Friday.
	   Japanese women led the world for the 13th straight year in
expected longevity at 83.82 years, Japanese media reports said
citing a report from the Health and Welfare Ministry.
	   Japanese boys less than one-year old in 1997 were expected to
live to 77.19 years, the longest in the world for the second
straight year, the reports said.
	   Life expectancy for both Japanese men and women improved from
the previous year although women made a bigger gain. The gap
between women's and men's life expectancy was the highest ever at
6.63 years.
	   The reports did not give life expectancy figures for other
nations.
	   Ministry officials were unavailable for comment late Friday
evening.
	   A cure for cancer would boost the average life expectancy for
Japanese men by 4.02 years and for women by 2.92 years, the reports
said.

Japanese importer arrested on suspicion of marketing Viagra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that arrest was Friday sted Thursday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested the owner of a trading company
Friday on suspicion of illegally marketing the impotence drug
Viagra in Japan, where it has not yet been approved, officials
said.
	   Kiyoyuki Takagi, 38, was arrested in Nagoya, 269 kilometers (168
miles) west of Tokyo, for allegedly violating the Pharmaceuticals
Affairs Law by selling Viagra wholesale, said a police spokesman,
who requested anonymity.
	   Police confiscated two bottles of Viagra containing a total of
60 tablets at Takagi's company in Nagoya, the spokesman said.
	   Authorities were alerted to the illegal sales by another Viagra
suspect, Hiroyuki Shikata, who was arrested last week on charges of
selling the drug. Shikata told police he bought five bottles of
Viagra from Takagi for 360,000 yen (dlrs 2,500) in June.
	   A thriving black market for Viagra has reportedly developed in
Japan. Magazines advertise Viagra-buying ``tours'' to the United
States and ways to purchase the drug through mail-order.
	   Viagra, produced by U.S.-based Pfizer Inc., is currently
undergoing goverment testing in Japan and is not expected to be
approved for sale anytime soon.

Jewish leader calls on government to establish fund for Nazi slave
</HEADLINE>
laborers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jews, Ignatz
Bubis, urged the government on Friday to at least symbolically back
an industry initiative to establish a fund for Nazi slave laborers.
	   Faced with the threat of lawsuits of the kind that dogged the
Swiss banks, German industry has proposed paying into a
government-sponsored fund that would compensate former slave
workers.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has rejected reopening restitution
coffers. Germany has paid more than 100 billion marks (dlrs 58
billion) in reparations to Nazi victims.
	   Bubis supported Bonn's position that Germany had fulfilled its
duty to pay restitution to Nazi victims. However, he urged the
German government to ``at least symbolically'' support industry's
efforts to make direct payments to people forced into labor under
the Nazis.
	   ``If industry proposes such a foundation, and asks the
government to take part symbolically, then it's my opinion that the
government should not refuse,'' Bubis was quoted as saying Friday
by the Braunschweiger Zeitung.
	   Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial group, said Thursday it
would be willing to contribute. Automaker BMW and the Hochtief
construction firm have also signaled readiness to take part.
	   Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, made a surprise
announcement last month that it would pay its World War II slave
laborers.

Fifth-richest tennis tournament switches from tea to telephones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The world's fifth richest tennis tournament will
switch from tea to telephones in 2000 when The Lipton Championships
will be renamed the Ericsson Open.
	   Ericsson Mobile Phones, which manufactures cellular and PCS
telephones and accessories, Thursday announced it will become the
title sponsor of the tournament played on Key Biscayne annually
since 1985.
	   The new sponsor is a division of Ericsson Inc., an international
telecommunications manufacturer based in Lund, Sweden, that has
100,000 employees in 130 countries. Ericsson employs 8,000 people
in the United States and its U.S. headquarters is in Richardson,
Texas, a Dallas suburb.
	   ``As a true global company, we want to associate ourselves with
the most popular sports in the world,'' said Hakan Wretsell,
executive vice president and general manager for Ericsson Mobile
Phones' Americas region.
	   The company also sponsors Copa Ericsson, Latin America's only
combined ATP Tour Challenger and ITF Women's Circuit tournaments.
	   For Ericsson it is a rare opportunity to become a title sponsor
of one of the world's foremost tournaments, Wretsell said from his
Miami office. He noted as well that a high percentage of tennis
fans also are cellular phone users.
	   ``It's a nice match,'' he said.
	   The tournament had dlrs 4.8 million in prize money and
attendance of 228,968 this year.
	   Thomas J. Lipton Co., part of Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch consumer
goods conglomerate, will bow out after next year's tournament, set
for March 18-28. Unilever spokesman John Gould declined to say why
the tea maker decided to withdraw. He said Lipton was looking into
other events for possible sponsorship.
	   ``I'm very grateful and thankful to Lipton,'' said tournament
founder and chairman Butch Buchholz. ``I hope they stay in tennis.
They are good people.''
	   Buchholz said Ericsson has agreed to sponsor the tournament for
five years with an option for another five years. He said he is not
allowed by the contract to discuss financial terms. Wretsell said
only that it was a multimillion-dollar-agreement.
	   Originally known as the International Players Championships, it
is the only 11-day, 96-man and 96-woman draw tournament on the
professional tennis calendar. That format will remain unchanged
with the new sponsorship, Buchholz said.

Yeltsin's wife tries to comfort Russians over crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's wife, Naina, sought
Friday to console Russians worried about the financial crisis which
has put some banks on the verge of collapse.
	   ``Intuition is telling me that everything will be all right,''
Mrs. Yeltsin told reporters while showing the Kremlin to Antonina
Stoyanov, the wife of the visiting Bulgarian president.
	   ``We need time. But with our rich country and with our people we
won't fall down a precipice,'' Naina Yeltsin said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``We just need patience. We should overcome
the crisis by acting together rather than separately.''
	   The government is now seeking a compromise with Communists and
other hard-liners in parliament who demand Yeltsin's resignation
and the reversal of free-market reforms.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Flanders Prime Minister Luc van den Brande
met Friday with his Polish counterpart to discuss steps Poland must

full-right member of the European Union.''
	   He listed those needs as reforms in the pension system and the
health care, agriculture, mining and steel industries.
	   ``We are planning close cooperation in all these areas and on
other projects,'' van den Brande said.
	   Poland and Flanders signed a cooperation agreement in 1994, and
van den Brande described Poland on Friday as ``our very important

Restore the pink to the Mona Lisa's cheeks? Never, says the Louvre!
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Yellowed by varnish layers applied over the
centuries, the jaundice-faced Mona Lisa remains the Louvre's top
attraction. Some experts say it's high time for a facelift, but the
Louvre says, ``Hands off.''
	   Thanks to computer technology, a French art magazine is offering
a glimpse of what the Mona Lisa may have looked like when Leonardo
da Vinci painted her in 1503: rosy cheeks instead of yellow pallor,
pale blue skies instead of the famed sunset glow.
	   Today's debate, to clean or not to clean, follows the Louvre's
decision to give the world's most famous painting a room of her
own. The new gallery won't be completed until at least 2001.
	   Art experts are urging the Louvre to take advantage of the move
to scrape off the varnish applied to preserve the work's magical
lustre.
	   The bi-monthly magazine Journal des Arts published two photos of
the Mona Lisa _ one touched up, the other as is _ in its current
edition, along with divergent opinions on a possible facelift.
	   For the Louvre, there's no debate at all.
	   ``It's absolutely out of the question to restore the Mona Lisa
in any way,'' Jean-Pierre Cuzin, chief paintings' curator at the
Louvre, told The Associated Press on Friday.
	   Cuzin said that despite its yellow hues, the painting is in good
condition and doesn't need cleaning now.
	   And besides, the new gallery's state-of-the-art lighting and
special, non-reflective glass will enhance the painting's beauty.
	   ``The Mona Lisa isn't as dark as people think,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``We'd rather wait until we're sure that a
cleaning wouldn't do any irreparable damage.''
	   Yet others insist the Louvre's 5.2 million visitors deserve Mona
Lisa at her best.
	   ``I consider the Mona Lisa to be a work of art and not an icon,
so there's no reason to treat it differently from any other
painting,'' British expert Alastair Laing told the Journal des
Arts.
	   ``I think the Louvre should consider removing the varnish, just
as they have in other works.''
	   Experts agree that a facelift would be tricky, if not a
nightmare.
	   Da Vinci himself pioneered complex techniques to achieve the
brilliance and subtlety that have made the work so famous.
	   To complicate matters further, resin and lacquer as well as
varnish have been layered onto the painting at different intervals
in the past 495 years.
	   Their chemical reaction to natural light have contributed to
making the Mona Lisa look as though she's suffering from hepatitis,
and all require different types of solvent for removal.
	   ``Anyone who thinks a facelift would bring back da Vinci's
orignal colors is sorely mistaken, because there aren't any,''
Cuzin said. ``Unlike Raphael, for example, Da Vinci used very
little contrast. His palette was different hues of brown and
gray.''
	   Cuzin said the last touch-up dates to the mid 1950s when experts
removed several age spots.
	   ``If you want a restoration expert to commit suicide, put him to
work on the Mona Lisa,'' said Jean-Gabriel Goulinat, who worked on
the masterpiece for more than 30 years.

	   The drop Thursday left the Dow down 1,171 points from its July
17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 12.6 percent.
	   It was the first time since last October's selloff, which was
also induced by fears that foreign economic troubles would hurt
American companies, that the Dow has finished a day more than 10
percent below its previous high, a loss commonly referred to as a
``market correction.'' A sustained drop of 20 percent marks a bear
market.
	   European markets opened Friday with a tumble, with London and
Frankfurt blue chips falling by around 5 percent before showing a
powerful rebound by the afternoon.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by just 23.8 points, or 0.4 percent, at 5,344.7 midafternoon,
bouncing back dramatically from its early losses of 4.8 percent.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index plunged 5 percent in early dealings
but had recovered by midafternoon to show a loss of just 0.4
percent on the day at 4,992.30 points.
	   Big Asian markets never saw any chance of recovery.
	   Tokyo blue chips dove to a 12-year low, Hong Kong's key index
fell 1.2 percent despite heavy buying by the government.
	   The panicky selling was set off by Russia's economic troubles.
The Russian government struggled to find a way out of its mess,
while opposition leaders were clamoring for the removal of
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``An awful lot of uncertainties are still out there,'' said
George Hodgson, a European stock strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare
Govett in London.
	   But Hodgson said investors may have been overlooking some
positive factors: Global economic troubles could make lower
interest rates more likely, and some share prices may have plunged
to levels where they had become a bargain.
	   ``It doesn't look particularly good, but I don't think we are
too far away from the bottom in most European share markets,'' said
Gareth Evans, European equities strategist at Nikko Europe.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly
scheduled news conference to urge investors to remain calm. ``The
most important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged again, and by
the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest level in 12
years. Even the dollar _ normally sought as a safety net in times
of crisis _ tumbled against the Japanese yen.
	   Japan's Nikkei stock index closed at 13,915.63 points, down
498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday. It was the Nikkei's
lowest level since March 1986.
	   Stock markets in Hong Kong and Singapore also continued their
plunge with Singapore breaking through an important barrier for the
first time in more than a decade.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed down 93.23 points, or
1.2 percent lower, at 7,829.74.
	   Trading volume reached an all-time record high of 79 billion
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 10.13 billion U.S.), and traders estimated
that government buying accounted for more than 80 percent of the
trading volume.
	   For two weeks, the Hong Kong government has been propping up the
local stock and stock futures markets in an effort to punish
speculators, whom officials say have been selling the Hong Kong
dollar to drive up interest rates and weaken the stock market.
	   Market participants said the government may have used more than
10 percent of its reserves in the battle.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd.
	   As if that wasn't enough, the government announced in the
afternoon that Hong Kong has fallen into recession, with its
once-booming economy shrinking by 5 percent in the second quarter.
Hong Kong officials said their economy is expected to shrink by 4
percent this fiscal year.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has been widely
criticized for not doing enough to revive its economy. Its new
government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that showed the plunging
Nikkei stock prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   In Moscow, Russian shares fell by 1.25 percent, a drop that was
modest compared to recent heavy losses. Other Eastern European
markets were hit much harder.

Cost factor behind Malaysia's pullout from war games:Official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has pulled out of
regional military exercises to save money and not because of
frictions with Singapore, Malaysia's defense minister was quoted as
saying Friday.
	   Malaysia has cancelled its participation this year in the Five
Power Defense Arrangement, a 27-year-old pact which includes
Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Britain.
	   The cost factor and the country's present economic difficulties
were the prime movers behind the decision, the national news agency
Bernama quoted Defence Minister Syed Hamid Albar as saying Friday.
	   ``We have to conserve our resources and energy towards our own
well being,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Syed Hamid denied a report in the Far Eastern Economic Review
which cited border tension with Singapore as the reason behind its
decision.
	   Syed Hamid said military ties between the Malaysian and
Singapore armed forces remained cordial despite a diplomatic row.
	   The two Southeast Asian neighbors have been squabbling over a
wide range of issues since the 1960s, soon after their governments
gained independence from British rule.
	   The most recent diputes revolve around differences caused by the
shifting of a shared railroad immigration and customs point. Other
longstanding tiffs include land disputes and the sale of Malaysian
water, on which Singapore depends heavily.

For third time, Russian reformer gets the ax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ He is often called the architect of Russian
privatization, but Anatoly Chubais has earned another title:
three-time loser.
	   Chubais, one of Russia's leading advocates of market capitalism,
was fired Friday from his latest job, special presidential envoy to
international financial organizations.
	   It was the third time he had been fired by President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   In January 1996, Yeltsin fired the unpopular Chubais as deputy
prime minister. He brought him back into government a few months
later to run his presidential re-election campaign.
	   Yeltsin fired Chubais again last March, then hired him in June
as his envoy to the International Monetary Fund and other
organizations. In that job, Chubais negotiated dlrs 17 billion in
new international loans in a futile attempt to bail out Russian
financial markets.
	   Yeltsin gave no reason for the latest firing, but it was widely
expected in light of the wholesale sacking of the reform-oriented
government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and the devaluation
of the ruble.
	   Among the other casualties of the government's dismissal was
former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, another leading
reformer who was being touted as a future presidential candidate
less than a year ago.
	   Nemtsov's current job prospects look considerably bleaker,
although he can take heart from Chubais, for whom the revolving
door of government seems to keep on spinning.

Havel released from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel was
released from Prague's military hospital Friday, more than a month
after he underwent abdominal surgery.
	   Spokesman Ladislav Spacek said Havel now will rest in the
presidential residence in Lany, outside Prague. There, he will
prepare for his official visit to the United States, scheduled for
Sept. 14-19.
	   A doctor and nurse will stay with Havel in Lany, Spacek said.
	   ``I'm glad that the surgery was successful and that we got over
the post-surgery complications,'' the news agency CTK quoted Havel
as saying as he was leaving the hospital.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed a
colostomy performed on Havel in April when he suffered a ruptured
colon while vacationing in the Austrian Alps.
	   Havel later developed pneumonia related to the operation and
doctors had to perform tracheotomy Aug. 3 to help him breathe.
	   The following day, Havel's heart rate soared to 200 beats per
minute and his blood pressure dropped. He had to be stabilized with
electroshocks and was reported in critical condition.
	   ``I'm sorry (my recovery) took a little longer than I
expected,'' Havel said Friday.
	   Doctors said Thursday a tube from Havel's trachea was removed
Wednesday and the small opening has closed spontaneously.
	   Havel has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when
a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.

Dow turns higher, European markets begin to rebound after Asian

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow Jones industrial average turned higher
Friday as Wall Street attempted to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge.
	   European stocks also began rebounding after opening sharply
lower, but the recovery bid came too late for Asian markets, where
some key indexes plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years
ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   The Dow opened with a small loss but quickly turned higher and
was up 69.52 at 8,235.51 in the early going Friday morning. Its
drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third biggest point drop
ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997 and
the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop, while
the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the record
22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   The drop Thursday left the Dow down 1,171 points from its July
17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 12.6 percent.
	   It was the first time since last October's selloff, which was

_ bouncing back dramatically from its early losses of 4.8 percent.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index plunged 5 percent in early dealings

	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed down 93.23 points, or

government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that showed the plunging
Nikkei stock prices in Tokyo's main railway station.
	   In Moscow, Russian shares fell by 1.25 percent, a drop that was
modest compared to recent heavy losses. Other Eastern European
markets were hit much harder.

Mountaineer Albert Eggler dies at 85
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Albert Eggler, who headed the first
team to climb the 8,516-meter (28,103-foot) Lhotse Peak on Nepal's
border with China, has died in a mountain accident, it was
announced Friday. He was 85.
	   Obituary notices published in the Bern daily Der Bund said
Eggler died Tuesday in the Bernese Oberland mountains.
	   Eggler was born in 1913 in the lakeside town of Brienz. An
obituary notice from the Swiss Alpine Club said he was involved in
climbing for more than 50 years.
	   In 1956, he led a Swiss expedition to the Himalayas which was
the first to conquer Lhotse, the world's fourth highest peak. Days
later, it became one of the first three to climb the world's
highest peak, the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) Mount Everest.
	   Last year, at the age of 84, Eggler climbed the 4,099-meter
(13,448-foot) Moench in the Swiss Alps. He was planning to leave on
a trekking tour of Nepal in September.
	   He was killed in an accident on the Simmenfluh mountain.
	   A funeral service will be held next Tuesday at the Nydegg church
in the Swiss capital, Bern. Details of survivors were unavailable.

Chinese politicians, dissidents attack government over flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts, UPDATES with floods on upper tributaries of
Yangtze. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dissidents and legislators alike are saying the
severity of China's summer-long flood disaster can be blamed on
misguided government policies that allow high-speed growth at a
high cost to the environment.
	   Millions of people are homeless and 3,004 are dead by the
official count in the worst floods in decades on the Yangtze River
and in the northeast.
	   In the largest petition since the military crushed the Tiananmen
Square democracy movement nine years ago, 309 dissidents urged the
government to abandon environmentally disastrous policies, a human
rights group said Friday.
	   ``For so many years, by blindly following the concept that `man
can conquer nature,' we have built up vast, evil debts to the
Yangtze River,'' said the petition, completed Wednesday and
released by New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   ``We are now swallowing the bitter fruit of nature's revenge and
pay-back,'' said the petition signed by dissidents from 19
provinces and major cities, from scientists to labor rights
campaigners and democratic reformers.
	   The dissidents catalogued environmental ills that the flooding
has made plain. Some government officials already have acknowledged
them.
	   At issue is clear-cutting that has reduced forest cover in the
Yangtze basin by half in four decades, causing an upsurge in soil
erosion. Silty runoff helps raise river beds and causes flooding.
	   ``Finally the long-term strain has pushed the ailing Mother
River to the breaking point, and it has gone crazy,'' the petition
said.
	   A vice director of the State Forestry Administration, Li Yucai,
said on Friday that deforestation on the upper reaches of major
rivers was one of the reasons for the floods.
	   The government will spend 3 billion yuan (dlrs 380 million) in
infranstructure spending and another 3 billion yuan in loans and
financial allocations to protect forests, Xinhua reported. It gave
no time frame for the spending.
	   Flooding nationwide destroyed more than 5 million houses and
caused economic losses of more than 166.6 billion yuan (dlrs 20.2
billion), the government estimates. Across the Yangtze and in the
northeast, millions of hectares (tens of millions of acres) of
fertile farmland lie under muddy water.
	   Recent heavy rains on the upper reaches of the Yangtze have
caused flooding on the river's upstream tributaries, the Xinhua
News Agency reported Friday. High levels upstream signal more
trouble ahead for downstream dikes that already are weakened and
waterlogged.
	   Heavy rains and winds whipped up waves on swollen Dongting Lake
along the Yangtze, lashing soggy, weakened dikes; in the northeast,
a swollen tributary of the Songhua River sent 200 meters (650 feet)
of dike crumbling outside Jiamusi city, the People's Daily
reported.
	   Members of the tightly controlled legislature were unusually
sharp with criticisms, decrying the environmental ruin, low
investment in flood control projects and the corruption and
indifference of some officials, state media reported.
	   Wang Xuan, a member of the legislature's executive committee,
said some officials who went to inspect the flooding asked to be
housed in airconditioned rooms and requested such delicacies as
soft-shelled turtles, the China Daily reported.
	   One legislator noted that a belated ban on logging along the
upper Yangtze did not cover the depleted forests of the northeast.
	   The dissidents' appeal was bolder and broader, demanding Chinese
leaders keep development from depleting natural resources, halt
land reclamation projects and draft stringent rules to protect the
environment.

UEFA finalizes bid to head off threat of breakaway Super League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ As directors of Europe's biggest clubs swirled
around Monte Carlo's famous casino after the Champions League draw,
UEFA was finalizing plans Friday to dissuade them from making the
gamble of their soccer lives: joining the proposed breakaway Super
League.
	   UEFA's governing Executive Committee will meet here Saturday,
and is expected to make changes to its main club competitions to
avert an unprecedented split in European soccer.
	   With big clubs in negotiations with Milan-based media rights
company Media Partners about forming a breakaway league, UEFA has
never faced such a threat to its pan-European governance since its
formation in 1954.
	   In its attempts to keep top clubs in line, UEFA has used the
stick, the carrot and the carrot-shaped stick.
	   ``There are mixed signals coming from UEFA,'' said David Brooks,
chief soccer analyst at securities house Nomura International, in
London. ``On the one hand it seems that it wants nothing to do with
Media Partners, but at other times its tone is much more
conciliatory.''
	   UEFA is expected to make several changes to the setup of its
competitions.
	   The Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup are likely to be combined,
while the number of matches in the Champions League will probably
be increased by changing the format from six groups of four to four
groups of six.
	   Among the more contentious issues: whether UEFA will agree to
work with Media Partners, and if it will distribute more of the
income from the Champions League to clubs.
	   Of the dlrs 322 million generated by the Champions League in
1997-98, just dlrs 157 million went to participating teams.
	   Last season's biggest Champions League earner was winner Real
Madrid, yet the dlrs 14 million it received was less than UEFA paid
to its marketing and media rights holder, Team Marketing.
	   ``Clubs are increasingly dissatisfied with the Champions
League,'' Brooks said. ``At the same time they are being forced to
pay spiralling wages to players and become much more
commerically-oriented. So they need to look at any way to maximize
revenue.''
	   Another sensitive issue to be tackled by UEFA is whether
entrance to the Champions League should continue to be based
entirely on merit, or whether some of Europe's biggest clubs should
get automatic access.
	   Big clubs being wooed by Media Partners include: Italy's AC
Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus; Spain's Real Madrid and Barcelona;
England's Arsenal and Manchester United; Bayern Munich and Borussia
Dortmund of Germany; France's Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille;
and Ajax Amsterdam of the Netherlands.
	   Rich clubs grumble that they are gradually outgrowing their
domestic leagues and should play more money-spinning matches
against other European giants.
	   In France, Germany, Italy and Spain, more than 25 percent of
soccer fans support the country's most popular club, according to a
recent report by London media consultancy Oliver and Ohlbaum, while
more than 40 percent support one of the two biggest clubs.
	   ``We need a Super League. But we don't know if it will be in
UEFA or not,'' Juan Antonio Samprer, Real Madrid's legal director,
told The Associated Press.
	   Media Partners, backed by U.S. merchant bank J.P. Morgan, is
tempting clubs to quit UEFA competitions with incentives that would
catapult them into the financial stratosphere.
	   With rich digital TV broadcasters searching for content to fill
new channels, and international sponsors eager for more matches
between famous clubs, Media Partners says a new structure could
easily outstrip the minimum dlrs 6.6 million clubs now get for
playing in the Champions League.
	   It said Friday it could raise dlrs 2 billion a year from a new
league.
	   ``Our project is extremely financially robust. We have spent
over 12 months intensely planning and finalizing the financial
details. There is also a rigorously-tested business plan to support
every aspect of this project,'' said Peter Ekelund, European
Football League project leader.
	   And the backers of the proposed league are becoming more
confident each week.
	   ``I definitely have the confidence and the mandate from the
clubs,'' to push ahead with the new league, Media Partners
president Rodolfo Hecht told reporters in London this week.
	   But opting out of UEFA and into a new breakaway league with an
uncertain future would be an enormous gamble, Brooks said.
	   ``It's true that clubs are looking for new revenue streams. The
question is: at what possible risk?''

Pakistan's new Islamic laws seen undermining constitution

Islamic order could fuel religious violence &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
introduced a law Friday to create a new Islamic order in Pakistan
and establish a whole legal system based on the Muslim holy book,
the Koran.
	   Sharif's majority government is not expected to have any trouble
acquiring the two-thirds majority required to pass the amendment.
Parliament is expected to debate for several days before taking a
vote.
	   The constitutional amendment was quickly condemned by human
rights activists, opposition politicians and constitutional
experts.
	   Pakistan's opposition, led by former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto, said the new Islamic order will worsen sectarian strife in
a country wracked by religiously motivated violence that has
already killed hundreds of people.
	   Human rights activists accused Sharif of using Islam to
strengthen his authority and a U.S. constitutional expert says the
proposed law would effectively destroy the rights of the provinces
and put the federal government above the constitution itself.
	   ``In the name of Islam, Nawaz Sharif is trying to perpetuate a
fascist rule . . . it repeals the entire constitution,'' said Asma
Jehangir, a prominent human rights activist and lawyer.
	   In a speech to Parliament, which was carried on national
television, Sharif promised a ``true Islamic welfare state.'' He
said all laws would be based exclusively on the Koran as well as
the Sunnat, which are writings of Islam's prophet Mohammed.
	   ``Simple changes in laws are not enough,'' Sharif said. ``I want
to implement complete Islamic laws where the Koran and the Sunnat
are supreme.''
	   The constitutional amendment says that the federal government
will be ``obliged'' to enforce prayers five times a day and collect
annual tithings.
	   The proposed law also says the federal government would be
obliged ``to prescribe what is right and to forbid what is wrong.''
	   The proposed law gives the federal government the authority to
interpret what is considered Islamic and not Islamic, said Ms.
Jehangir.
	   She also warned it would embolden militant Muslims to impose
their brand of Islam.
	   Paula Newberg, an American expert in Pakistan's constitutional
politics, said that the proposed law effectively puts the federal
government above the constitution itself.
	   ``In one fell swoop it demolishes the rights of provinces and
destroys the federal compact and appears to put the federal
government, which is an administrative entity, in a constitutional
position above both the Parliament and judiciary and effectively
above the constitution itself,'' she said in an interview.
	   Meanwhile, Sharif sought to assure minorities -- who make up
less than 5 percent of the country's 140 million people -- and
women that the new Islamic laws would not infringe upon their
rights.
	   Despite Sharif's promises, Ms. Jehangir said ``this amendment
does not say anything about the protection of women's rights.
	   Sharif's emphasis on education for women appeared to be an
attempt to make it clear that Pakistan's version of Islamic law is
not the same as neighboring Afghanistan, ruled by the Taliban
religious militia.
	   The Taliban's brand of Islam bans women from school and the work
force, forces them to stay indoors and travel outside only when
accompanied by a close male relative. They have been forced to wear
the all enveloping burqa. Anyone defying the Taliban's rules is
publicly beaten.
	   While the current legal system is rooted in British common law,
Pakistan already has taken tentative steps toward Islamic rule.
	   On the books since the late 1970s are laws governing rape, which
requires four male witnesses. The same law also provides the death
penalty by stoning for the crime of having sex outside of marriage.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An earthquake in a remote part of northwest China
killed three people and injured seven others, seismology
authorities said Friday.
	   The magnitude 6.6 quake Thursday damaged or destroyed thousands
of small building in a region of Xinjiang about 3,500 kilometers
(2,200 miles) west of Beijing, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   An official at Jiashi's seismology bureau, who gave just her
surname, Liu, said three people were killed and seven injured.
	   Hundreds of aftershocks shook the area, including three stronger
than magnitude 5.0, Xinhua said.
	   Jiashi has suffered three strong quakes in the past two years
that have killed 36 people. The latest quake was part of an
earthquake group that began on Jan. 21 and has included nine quakes
stronger than 6.0.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's powerful Interior Minister
accused the United States of double standards in dealing with
terrorism, newspapers reported Friday.
	   Lal Krishna Advani said it was unfair for the United States to
attack what it called terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan,
while denying India's right to strike at what it sees as terrorist
bases in Pakistan.
	   For years, India has accused Pakistan of providing Kashmiri
separatists with arms, training and funds, and allows them to
infiltrate the Indian frontier. Pakistan says it only gives them
moral support for their fight against Indian security forces in
Kashmir.
	   ``How is it that you can do something and we cannot do that? Is
it not double standards?'' said Advani. He was questioning a remark
by U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering warning India
that striking targets in Pakistan could ``run the risk of setting
off a wider conflict.''
	   ``Let it be clearly understood, however, that we will not rest
until the proxy war launched by Pakistan against India is
decisively defeated,'' Advani said Thursday.
	   ``The U.S. has chosen to ignore gross acts of terrorism being
aided and abetted from across the Indian border. Our nation is a
victim of terrorist conspiracy,'' the papers quoted Advani as
saying.
	   ``Americans are not expendable. ... But then, are Indians
expendable?'' he asked.
	   Meanwhile, two groups of Muslims held protests Friday in New
Delhi to condemn the United States for the missile attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   ``Clinton has hatched a conspiracy to divert attention from the
sex scandals,'' said Navidyar Khan, who organized one of the
protests near India's Parliament.
	   ``He is showing his might so that he can send the American war
machine into Asia and Africa. Did not the Americans settle down in
Saudi Arabia under the pretext of protecting them against Iraq?''
Khan said.
	   ``Rapist Clinton! Beware, the world is watching this
inappropriate action,'' read a poster.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ After days of insisting Russia must solve
its financial crisis itself, Germany changed tack Friday, saying it
would take an ``active role'' with France in offering support to
Moscow.
	   But Finance Minister Theo Waigel stressed direct German aid to
Russia was ``out of the question,'' and said ``clear signals'' were
still needed from Moscow on reforms.
	   The somewhat more aggressive tone came as the Frankfurt stock
exchange, like others around Europe, continued to slide and
Germany's biggest bank indicated Russia's financial meltdown was
starting to hurt its bottom line.
	   Speaking at his party's convention in Munich, Waigel reiterated
the German government's concern about developments in Russia.

Schumacher reigns as Hakkinen, Villeneuve crash in practice

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Michael Schumacher showed
Friday why he has won the Belgian Grand Prix the last three years.
The treacherous course showed Mika Hakkinen and Jacques Villeneuve
why it is part of Formula One lore.
	   Both drivers lost control at high speed on the slippery track
and slammed into the protective barriers. They walked away from
their crashes, a tribute to the safety standards of the sport.
	   Schumacher kept his Ferrari on the track and finished the free
practice first, just ahead of Hakkinen.
	   Villeneuve was sixth fastest, but should be happy the accident
did not finish his Grand Prix weekend. The Canadian daredevil was
left with a bruised knee and a new thrill.
	   The reigning world champion Villeneuve lost control of his
Williams-Mecachrome on the famed uphill and high-speed Eau Rouge
curve at about 280 kph (175 mph). He demolished his car when he
crashed backwards into a tire barrier. As soon as the car settled,
he jumped out and walked away.
	   ``This was my best crash in Formula One,'' he said afterwards.
``The car doesn't look very good now,'' he said. His father Gilles
was killed in an accident during the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen damaged his McLaren-Mercedes after it spun off a
slippery track and slammed sideways into the protective tires at
about 230 kph (143 mph). ``I hit a wet section and spun off,'' the
leader in the world standings said.
	   Hakkinen returned in his repaired car to challenge Schumacher,
getting within 0.011 of a seconds over the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit.
	   Schumacher bounced his Ferrari off the curbstones on the final
chicane. He finished with a time of 1 minute, 51.895 seconds.
Scotland's David Coulthard was third in the other McLaren, 0.734
seconds back.
	   ``As I expected, we seem to be quite competitive here,'' said
Schumacher afterwards.
	   Damon Hill continued along with the improving performance of his
Jordan-Mugen Honda, finishing fourth in 1:53.100.
	   He edged the Williams-Mecachrome teammates Heinz-Harald Frentzen
and Villeneuve, who were fifth and sixth.
	   Schumacher is going for his fourth straight victory in Belgium
and he will need it to keep his momentum going. The German
surprised many by winning the Hungarian Grand Prix and now has
Hakkinen within his reach with only four races to go.
	   Hakkinen has 77 points, only seven more than Schumacher. With
the race in the wooded hills of the Ardennes worth 10 points to the
winner, Schumacher could reclaim the lead Sunday.
	   ``We should be very strong in the race,'' Schumacher said.
	   The German added it would be a fitting present for Ferrari's
600th Formula One race Sunday. The pole position will be decided
during Saturday's qualifying session. Hakkinen is going for his
ninth pole of the season while Schumacher has yet to start first on
the grid this season.
	   Pole position is hardly the decisive factor in the Belgian Grand
Prix, where the wide curves and long straightaways leave plenty of
opportunities for passing.
	   The right choice of tires and the ability to adapt to the fickle
weather are considered more important.
	   Schumacher has proved repeatedly he is a master at that. On
Friday again, some 40,000 German fans roared their appreciation.
	   Schumacher's home town of Kempen is only 100 kilometers (65
miles) across the border in Germany and Spa-Francorchamps has
become his third home track, together with Hockenheim and the
Nurburgring.
	   Apart from being nearly his home, Spa-Francorchamps is also his
lucky circuit.
	   Schumacher made his Formula One debut at Spa in 1991 and started
seventh on the grid. A year later, he won his first Formula One
race at Spa and in 1995 he came from 16th on the grid to win. He
hasn't lost in Belgium since.

Foreign investors edgy amid financial turmoil, but not packing

 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign investors in Russia are a hardy breed,
having endured coup attempts, frequent government shakeups and
currency freefalls in their effort to tap into this huge consumer
market. But the current economic turmoil has rattled some of them.
	   ``Concern is probably at the highest level that I have seen,''
said Scott Blacklin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Russia. ``I stress that this is not cause for panic, but there
are folks running around in an agitated state.''
	   Moscow has become a plum assignment for many executives,
especially those on the career fast-track. Many live lavishly, in
dlrs 10,000 a month apartments supported by drivers, maids and
nannies, and enjoy perks such as extra vacations and living
allowances.
	   The big foreign companies that have invested dlrs 21 billion in
Russia since the country began its economic reforms in 1992 have no
plans to close up shop.
	   But some have started laying off workers, and others are
delaying new investment decisions until they see how the government
solves the current mess and whether it tackles the underlying
problems.
	   ``There's going to be a very strong psychological impact on
western investors who have lost their money and I think they are
going to be reluctant to throw good money after bad,'' said Charles
Keefe, head of the Coudert Brothers law firm in Moscow, which gives
investment advice to Russian and Western companies.
	   ``I think the amount of overall activity by Western businesses
who have come here will drop dramatically in the short term.''
	   Henry Briggs, general director of the St. Louis-based
Monsanto-Searle pharmaceutical firm, said the current chaos makes
him nervous but ``we're not pulling out.''
	   ``We're here for the long term. It's one of the last major
markets in the world that hasn't been exploited,'' he said.
Monsanto has been doing business in Russia for more than 20 years,
and has just built a dlrs 32 million factory with a Russian
partner.
	   ``The state of the economy today is different even than two days
ago, so it's too early to say what the impact of the ruble
devaluation and everything else is,'' Briggs said.
	   ``No one has said the state is going to take over your assets.
If they did something like that, then yes, we'll rethink'' the
company's future in Russia, he said.
	   Mary Pat Sloan, head of Alphagraphics Russia, called the current
situation ``the toughest period we've been through'' since the
printing company entered the market in 1989, mostly because of the
problems in the banking industry.
	   Only the smallest business transactions in Russia can be
conducted in cash; the rest must be done by bank transfers. Banks
have been slow to process such transfers, especially if they
involve dollars, which many don't have, Sloan said.
	   Sales at companies such as Alphagraphics are down because most
of their clients are in the banking and financial sectors worst hit
by the market meltdown.
	   The Moscow office of the Brunswick Warburg brokerage firm has
laid off 80 people in the past month, said spokesman Martin
Anderson. The Interfax news agency said the Lehman Brothers
investment house has also reduced staff and sent some non-Russians
home.
	   ``We think we're going to survive this because ultimately people
need this service and our fundamentals are good,'' Sloan said.
``The tricky part is the next couple of weeks or months or so with
the liquidity crisis being the most difficult thing to overcome.''
	   But Sloan predicted some foreign investors will leave,
especially those who arrived last year when the Russian stock
market was the best performing in the world and there were glowing
predictions things would only get better.
	   ``It will deter some people from coming in,'' she said. ``It
certainly would be silly to open a business in this market if you
don't know what the rules will be.''
	   Among many Western investors _ and many Russians _ there's a
certain sense of resignation, that this is yet one more crisis to
be weathered.
	   ``One does get the sense that it's that period after the Titanic
has struck the iceberg but before it has sunk and the band is still
playing,'' Keefe said.
	   ``People still come to the office. You don't see or I don't
sense ... impending doom or disaster reflected on people's faces.
... Maybe that, too, is part of the Russian experience. Over the
last 10 years they survived past disasters, they'll survive this
one.''

German television apologizes for airing graphic film from Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ The German television network ZDF
apologized Friday for airing graphic footage from Congo showing
soldiers killing a suspected rebel.
	   The footage showed soldiers throwing a suspected rebel over a
bridge, then focused on one soldier as he fired shots off the
bridge where the man had fallen.
	   Responding to a complaint by the Free Democrats' general
secretary, ZDF director Dieter Stolte said it was a mistake to air
the unedited footage Thursday evening.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials slipped Friday morning after
Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge.
	   European stocks were rebounding after opening sharply lower, but
Asian markets had already closed with some key indexes plummeting
to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   The Dow, at one point up as much as 78.53, then gave up its
gains and was down 31.92 at 8,134.07 in morning trading. Its drop
Thursday of 357.36 points was the third biggest point drop ever,
trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997 and the
508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop, while the
biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the record
22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   The drop Thursday left the Dow down 1,171 points from its July
17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 12.6 percent.
	   It was the first time since last October's selloff, which was
also induced by fears that foreign economic troubles would hurt
American companies, that the Dow has finished a day more than 10
percent below its previous high, a loss commonly referred to as a
``market correction.'' A sustained drop of 20 percent marks a bear
market.
	   European markets opened Friday with a tumble, with London and
Frankfurt blue chips falling by around 5 percent before showing a
powerful rebound by the afternoon.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by 19.4 points, or 0.36 percent, at 5,349.1 late in the trading day
_ bouncing back dramatically from its early losses of 4.8 percent.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index plunged 5 percent in early dealings
but had recovered by midafternoon to show a loss of just 0.4
percent on the day at 4,992.30 points.
	   Big Asian markets never saw any chance of recovery.
	   Tokyo blue chips dove to a 12-year low, Hong Kong's key index
fell 1.2 percent despite heavy buying by the government.
	   The panicky selling was set off by Russia's economic troubles.
The Russian government struggled to find a way out of its mess,
while opposition leaders were clamoring for the removal of
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``An awful lot of uncertainties are still out there,'' said
George Hodgson, a European stock strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare
Govett in London.
	   But Hodgson said investors may have been overlooking some
positive factors: Global economic troubles could make lower
interest rates more likely, and some share prices may have plunged
to levels where they had become a bargain.
	   ``It doesn't look particularly good, but I don't think we are
too far away from the bottom in most European share markets,'' said
Gareth Evans, European equities strategist at Nikko Europe.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly
scheduled news conference to urge investors to remain calm. ``The
most important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged again, and by
the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest level in 12
years. Even the dollar _ normally sought as a safety net in times
of crisis _ tumbled against the Japanese yen.
	   Japan's Nikkei stock index closed at 13,915.63 points, down
498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday. It was the Nikkei's
lowest level since March 1986.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed down 93.23 points, or
1.2 percent lower, at 7,829.74.
	   Trading volume reached an all-time record high of 79 billion
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 10.13 billion U.S.), and traders estimated
that government buying accounted for more than 80 percent of the
trading volume.
	   For two weeks, the Hong Kong government has been propping up the
local stock and stock futures markets in an effort to punish
speculators, whom officials say have been selling the Hong Kong
dollar to drive up interest rates and weaken the stock market.
	   Market participants said the government may have used more than
10 percent of its reserves in the battle.
	   ``There are tremendous selling orders and no one's buying except
the government,'' said Antony Mak, a dealer at the city's Vickers
Ballas Holdings Ltd.
	   As if that wasn't enough, the government announced that Hong
Kong has fallen into recession, with its once-booming economy
shrinking by 5 percent in the second quarter. Hong Kong officials
said their economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this fiscal
year.
	   ``People are very scared of financial markets right now,'' said
Nicholas Brooks of Santander Investment Securities in Singapore.
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has been widely
criticized for not doing enough to revive its economy. Its new
government is now deadlocked in a dispute with the opposition over
how to revive the nation's troubled banking sector.
	   The insecurity that this infighting is causing among Japanese
citizens and investors was evident in Tokyo.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that showed the plunging
Nikkei stock prices in Tokyo's main railway station.

Italian striker arrives in Rome to sign contract with Lazio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian striker Christian Vieri arrived in Rome
Friday, a trip that is expected to see him sign the richest
contract in Italy's soccer history.
	   The 25-year-old forward is expected to move from Spain's
Atletico Madrid to Lazio of Rome for a dlrs 30 million transfer
fee.
	   The player would get dlrs 3 million a year for five years,
according to reports published in Italy.
	   The value of the deal is higher than last year's record dlrs 28
million transfer of Brazilian star Ronaldo from Barcelona to Inter
Milan.
	   Vieri, who scored four goals in five games with Italy at France
98, refused to comment on his transfer plans on his arrival at
Rome's international airport.
	   Lazio officials said they could not immediately comment on
Vieri's contract details.
	   Vieri is leaving Atletico after a single season in which he led
the Spanish league in scoring.
	   The young striker, who has never played with the same club for
more than one season, joined Atletico Madrid from Juventus of Turin
for dlrs 19 million.
	   According to some published reports Vieri decided to leave the
Spanish club after relations with Atletico's newly appointed
Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi grew tense.
	   Sacchi, a former coach of AC Milan and of the Italian national
team, dismissed the reports in an interview with Milan's daily
Corriere della Sera.
	   ``Vieri told me he was homesick and wanted to return to Italy
... He put us in a blind alley,'' Sacchi was quoted as saying on
Friday.
	   At Lazio, Vieri will team with newly signed Chilean striker
Marcelo Salas under Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson.

Sixth Fleet flagship arrives in Romania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-Bulgaria-US

<TEXT>
	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ The flagship of the U.S. 6th Fleet,
the USS La Salle, sailed into this Black Sea port Friday afternoon
ahead of training exercises with the Romanian navy.
	   Earlier in the day, the ship left Bulgarian waters under tight
security, following an alleged bomb threat received while the ship
was docked at the port of Varna.
	   According to Bulgarian police, a man speaking with an Arabic
accent called and threatened to blast the ship during its three-day
visit to Bulgaria.
	   No explosive device was found and the port call continued amid
tight security.
	   On Saturday, the USS La Salle will head to sea for a day of
exercises, accompanied by a Romanian frigate
	   ``During the exercises, the command will pass from an American
to a Romanian ship and simulate attacks and war maneuvers to see
how compatible our fleet is with NATO ships,'' said Romanian Maj.
Marian Mosneagu.
	   The USS La Salle, under the leadership of Vice Admiral Daniel J.
Murphy Jr., commander of the 6th Fleet, carries 658 sailors.
	   Murphy didn't comment on the reported bomb threat in Bulgaria,
but said, ``terrorism is a reality in the contemporary world and
one never knows which the next target is going to be.''
	   Security has been tightened at all U.S. military installations
following recent bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
he added.
	   The stops in Bulgaria and Romania are part of a three-week
voyage around the Black Sea. Visits to Ukraine, Georgia and Turkey
also are planned.

Acehnese students demand Indonesian military Chief apologize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Wiranto, Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ University students from Indonesia's
northern province of Aceh on Friday demanded the country's top
military commander apologize for criticizing a recent probe into
human rights abuses there.
	   A four-member team of the National Commission on Human Rights
Commission announced this week that 781 people had been killed in
Aceh since the region was placed under a special anti-separatist
military operation in 1989.
	   The operation, which was lifted just this month, had led to the
torture of 388 people and 102 rapes. The commission found 163
people had disappeared in the area.
	   Armed Commander Gen. Wiranto criticized the commission for
releasing the findings, saying such a disclosure would not lead to
``conducive situation badly needed by the country'' in the midst of
a severe economic crisis.
	   The students said they were outraged.
	   ``We demand ... Gen. Wiranto to immediately apologize to the
Acehnese people over his statement,'' the self-proclaimed Student
Solidarity for the Case of Aceh said in a statement.
	   Investigation over various rights abuses have arisen since
President Suharto quit from his 32-year authoritarian rule in May
amid riots that killed 1,200 people.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who took over power from Suharto, has
pledged major political reform and more respect to human rights.
	   Aceh is one of three Indonesian provinces where separatist
rebels are fighting for independence. The other two are the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor and the former Dutch colony of
Irian Jaya on western New Guinea.

Zimbabwe counts the cost of escalating military role in Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabweans counted the cost of their
nation's military support of embattled Congolese President Laurent
Kabila after a newspaper claimed Friday more than 2,000 Zimbabwean
troop reinforcements were airlifted to the Congolese battle front.
	   The Zimbabwe Independent, a respected business weekly, said
unnamed military sources disclosed that two combat battalions had
been dispatched to Kinshasa since Wednesday, bringing the strength
of the Zimbabwean force to 2,800.
	   Officials at army headquarters in Harare declined to comment on
the report.
	   The Independent said its sources also indicated at least eight
Zimbabwean soldiers were killed in fighting around the Congolese
capital.
	   The government in Harare has confirmed only two of its soldiers
killed, three missing and 15 wounded.
	   No access was available to Harare's main air base Friday but
residents in nearby suburbs reported intense activity over the past
two days, including many overflights of military aircraft at night
and day sightings of giant Russian-built transport planes with
Angolan markings.
	   ``Planes have been going over my house almost non-stop,'' said
Michael Benson, a resident of the Greendale suburb.
	   Angolan troops are fighting alongside Zimbabweans in support of
Kabila and so far have provided most air power for the intervention
force.
	   Military officers in Harare refused Friday to elaborate on the
scale or cost of Zimbabwe's deployment, but independent economists
estimate a daily expense of between dlrs 60 and dlrs 150 a day, to
keep a single soldier in a combat arena, depending on his
individual role.
	   Zimbabwe is known to have shipped armored cars, vehicles and
attack helicopters to Congo and flown its own Spanish-built Casa
paratroop carriers to Kinshasa.
	   Their use would push operational costs far higher than dlrs
100,000 a day.
	   Economist John Robertson said the cost of a ``foreign war'' will
inevitably worry donors and Western financial institutions
providing much needed aid and balance of payments support for the
battered Zimbabwe economy, which already is suffering severe hard
currency shortages.
	   The Zimbabwe dollar has weakened against the U.S. currency by 70
percent since November and is continuing to slide, trading Friday
at around 25 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Last year the Zimbabwe currency was mostly stable at around 17
to the U.S. dollar.
	   Payment soon by the International Monetary Fund of a dlrs 20
million loan, the second tranche of a 13-month loan package, could
be stalled, Robertson said.
	   ``The IMF will be cautious about further disbursement because of
the money we are wasting,'' in Congo, he said.
	   Defense analyst Michael Quintana, editor of the authoritative
Africa Defense Journal, said Zimbabwe forces risked getting bogged

	   ``The deployment of extra Zimbabwe forces has the potential to
drag Zimbabwe into a longer term commitment, probably lasting in
excess of six months,'' he said.
	   Lupi Mashayakara, head of the Institute for the Advancement of
Freedom, a group pressing for political reform, accused Mugabe of
using the intervention to divert attention from domestic dissent
and boost his standing as leader of a regional power.

EU assessing economic, humanitarian fallout from Russia crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU head office predicted Friday
that Russia's financial crisis will have ``no serious effect'' on
West European economies and banks.
	   Even so, officials were drafting a detailed economic and
financial impact study for the 20-member EU executive commission,
which returns from its month-long summer recess Monday.
	   The European Commission will also do a humanitarian impact study
to see what effect the financial crisis will have on the average
Russian, said EU spokeswoman Martine Reicherts.
	   Since the onset of the crisis in Russia, the EU head office has
played down suggestions it will seriously impact the EU economy.
	   So far, officials have been considering retargeting assistance
under the EU's dlrs 1.6 billion economic aid program for Russia.
``But for that we need the cooperation of Russia,'' said Reicherts.
	   The financial crises in Russia and Asia was having some effects
on the currencies of the 11 nations that will launch a single
European currency in January.
	   The parities of these currencies have been locked irrevocably
ahead of the euro's launch and central banks are committed to
jointly defend those rates.
	   ``Break-up risk is a very minimal risk, but people are beginning
to talk about it,'' said Sally Wilkinson, senior economist at Daiwa
Europe in London.
	   Friday, for the first time in months, a euro-zone central bank
was seen openly intervening to support its currency. Traders in
Madrid said the Bank of Spain was selling German marks.
	   After months of stability, some euro-zone currencies have begun
to drift slightly from their fixed parities. The Italian lira has
moved more against the mark in recent days than it did in the past
three months.

Japan leads the world in life expectancy

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan led the world in life expectancy in 1997,
with baby girls under the age of one that year likely to live to
nearly 84, the Health and Welfare Ministry said Friday.
	   Japanese women led the world for the 13th straight year in
expected longevity at 83.82 years, the ministry said in its annual
report.
	   Japanese boys less than one-year old in 1997 were expected to
live to 77.19 years, the longest in the world for the second
straight year, the report said.
	   People in Hong Kong had the second-longest life expectancy, with
women there expected to live to 81.8 years and men to 76.3 years,
the report said.
	   Life expectancy for both Japanese men and women improved from
the previous year although women made a bigger gain. The gap
between women's and men's life expectancy was the highest ever at
6.63 years.
	   A cure for cancer _ a leading cause of death in Japan _ would
boost the average life expectancy for Japanese men by 4.02 years
and for women by 2.92 years, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Albert Eggler, who headed the first
team to climb the 8,516-meter (28,103-foot) Lhotse Peak on Nepal's
border with China, has died in a mountain accident, it was
announced Friday. He was 85.
	   Obituary notices published in the Bern daily Der Bund said
Eggler died Tuesday in the Bernese Oberland mountains.
	   He was born in 1913 in the lakeside town of Brienz. An obituary
notice from the Swiss Alpine Club said Eggler, a lawyer, was
involved in climbing for more than 50 years.
	   In 1956, he led a Swiss expedition to the Himalayas which was
the first to conquer Lhotse, the world's fourth highest peak. Days
later, it became one of the first three to climb the world's
highest peak, the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) Mount Everest.
	   The team was accompanied by 24 sherpas. Nearly 300 porters
carried the expedition's equipment to the base camp.
	   Last year, at the age of 84, Eggler climbed the 4,099-meter
(13,448-foot) Moench in the Swiss Alps. He was planning to leave on
a trekking tour of Nepal in September.
	   He was fatally injured when he fell down a steep slope on the
1,400-meter (4,593-foot) Simmenfluh mountain.
	   A funeral service will be held next Tuesday at the Nydegg church
in the Swiss capital, Bern. Details of survivors were unavailable.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli woman who was injured a year ago in
bombing attack by Islamic militants in Jerusalem was hurt again,
this time in a Tel Aviv blast, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Ora Kaufman was among the 21 people injured Thursday in downtown
Tel Aviv when a bomb hidden in a trash can exploded. Her injuries
were not serious, and she returned home after treatment in
hospital.
	   Police said they thought the bomb was planted by a Palestinian
militant.
	   On Sept. 4, 1997, Kaufman was on the last day of her vacation in
Jerusalem when Palestinian suicide bombers set off explosives a few
yards from where she was sitting with her baby daughter in a
sidewalk cafe.
	   ``A wall of flame hit us,'' Kaufman told the daily Yediot
Ahronot. ``I held my baby tight but she was crying from the pain.''
	   The baby, 6-month-old Tamar, suffered multiple burns. Kaufman
was burned on the face and left hand, but was allowed to leave the
hospital the same day.
	   The baby spent two weeks in hospital but recovered quickly,
Kaufman said.
	   The paper showed two pictures, one taken after the 1997 blast in
Jerusalem, showing Kaufman clutching the injured baby. The other,
taken Thursday, shows Kaufman being wheeled into Tel Aviv's Ichilov
Hospital, lying on a stretcher but conscious.

Bosnian Serb pleads innocent to enlarged rape indictment

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Defiant before a U.N. tribunal
prosecuting sexual assault as a war crime for the first time, a
Bosnian Serb pleaded innocent Friday to expanded charges that he
raped and allowed his troops to rape Muslim women.
	   Dragoljub Kunarac, 38, looked calm and composed as he entered
innocent pleas to 21 war crimes and crimes against humanity charges
at a brief hearing before a single Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
judge.
	   He originally faced just four charges, but his indictment was
broadened after investigators uncovered new evidence. He faces a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Prosecutors claim that Kunarac led a gang of 10-15 Serbs who
systematically raped and tortured at least 10 Muslim women. The
alleged attacks occurred in the eastern Bosnian town of Foca
between April 1992 and February 1993 after the Serb takeover of the
region.
	   Female civilians were imprisoned in houses across Foca and
repeatedly raped by Kunarac's gang. Many victims were left suicidal
by their ordeals.
	   One woman, identified in court papers only as ``FWS-191'' was
held by Kunarac for six months. The woman was treated ``as the
personal property of Dragoljub Kunarac'' and repeatedly raped,
prosecutors claim.
	   Another woman _ seven months' pregnant at the time _ was held
for at least a week by Kunarac and his men. That victim, identified
as FWS-101, was repeatedly raped, beaten and forced to clean their
quarters, according to Kunarac's indictment.
	   Kunarac is charged with personally raping seven women and
allowing his subordinates to rape, sodomize and assault others.
Some of the victims were also robbed.
	   A trial date was not immediately at Friday's hearing, which was
called so that Kunarac could enter pleas to his new indictment,
broadened after investigators uncovered new evidence.
	   Kunarac surrendered to the U.N. court March 4, saying he wanted
to tell the truth about what happened in Foca.
	   At his original arraignment in March, a confused-looking Kunarac
pleaded guilty to rape, but judges refused to accept it and entered
an innocent plea on his behalf, saying he had been poorly advised
by his lawyers.
	   On Friday he looked confident, smiling with his attorney,
Slavisa Prodanovic, before the hearing and bluntly answering ``not
guilty'' in Serbo Croat as each charge was read to him.
	   The original indictment, which named seven other rape suspects
still at large in Bosnia, was the first and only issued by tribunal
prosecutors dealing exclusively with rape as a war crime.
	   Rape reportedly was used throughout the Bosnian war to terrorize
and traumatize civilians as part of so-called ``ethnic cleansing''
campaigns _ purges aimed at driving entire ethnic groups out of
regions.
	   Established in 1993, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
indicted 60 suspects and has 25 in custody in The Hague. Its
most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, are still free.

Turkey eases taxes but fails to boost market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced
Friday a series of measures aimed at boosting Turkey's sliding
stock market, but failed to convince traders.
	   Yilmaz said his government was withdrawing some of the tax and
regulatory measures introduced in July. But the market only
recovered slightly Friday, up 2.6 percentage points after the
historic, 13.1 slide Thursday.
	   ``Yilmaz's statement was below the market expectations,'' said
Sinan Gumusdis, treasurer of Chase Manhattan Bank in Istanbul.
	   Despite government assurances that Russia's deepening financial
crisis would not effect Turkey's economy, the market has been shaky
since Russia announced an effective devaluation of its currency,
the ruble.
	   ``Russia and international pressures are continuing, with no end
in sight,'' said Soner Dolanay, Treasurer of WestLB Girozentrale in
Istanbul. ``I don't want to sound pessimistic, but I don't see a
sign of recovery.''
	   Russia is Turkey's second most important market for exports,
according to official statistics, and Turkey's first trade partner
when unofficial trade is taken into account.
	   Traders were hoping that Yilmaz would scrap a tax rule that
requires banks and corporations to pay corporate taxes quarterly.
Previously, this tax was paid at year-end and could be deferred for
another year. The market was also expecting a modification of the
capital gains tax on stocks that requires investors - with net
annual profits of dlrs 12,500 or above - to pay taxes.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government horse-traded with
hard-line opponents Friday over their demands for President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation and a reversal of free-market reforms amid
mounting political and financial crisis.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin accepted a package of
Soviet-era economic measures, which parliamentary leaders had
demanded as a condition for confirming his appointment, a news
agency said. The leaders called a special session of the State Duma
for Monday to consider the confirmation.
	   ``We must forget ambitions, we must stabilize the situation and
ease tension that reached a critical point,'' Chernomyrdin told
reporters.
	   But the Kremlin took a tougher line on a proposed power-sharing
agreement that would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   In an apparent concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin also fired
prominent reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter
for the third time. Chubais was the government's chief negotiator
with international lenders, obtaining a dlrs 22.6 billion emergency
bailout package that failed to stem the financial crisis. Both men
are hated by the opposition for being the chief proponents of
reform.
	   Russians, who have weathered one government crisis after another
in recent years, were taking the latest one in stride, too.
Although there were lines outside some banks, there was no sign of
food-hoarding or social unease.
	   Trying to show he was still in charge, Yeltsin had a full day of
meetings in the Kremlin on Friday after not being seen in public
since Tuesday. He looked relaxed and fit.
	   Russian television broadcast pictures of him smiling and talking
energetically with acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria.
	   He gave a television interview that was to be broadcast Friday
night, and the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Yegor
Stroyev, said the president would make a political statement on
behalf of all branches of government. It was not clear whether the
statement would be made during the TV appearance or separately.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said he ``would not
even like to reproduce'' Yeltsin's reaction to calls for his
resignation. On Thursday Yastrzhembsky called the murmurings
``absolutely groundless idle inventions.''
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as
scheduled next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans with Primakov
and was scheduled to meet later in the day with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Yeltsin's envoy to the State Duma, Alexander Kotenkov, said
Chernomyrdin agreed with the hard-liners' economic proposals and
would present them to parliament as his own program, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The package calls for such Soviet-style economic measures as
currency controls, fixed prices, state ownership and printing new
money.
	   ``Privatization didn't lead to a restructuring of the economy
and has failed to create an effective class of property owners,''
the draft proposals said. ``The situation demands increasing the
role of the state in regulating the economy.''
	   Chernomyrdin's spokesman, Konstantin Voitsekhovich, refused to
confirm the report. Chernomyrdin was expected to attend final
discussions on the power-sharing agreement and the economic
proposals later Friday.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed that lawmakers would meet Monday to
consider the confirmation of Chernomyrdin, who was appointed by
Yeltsin this week to try to stem the country's mounting political
and financial crisis.
	   The Kremlin said it disagreed with the parliament's
power-sharing plan and called for additional consultations.
	   The agreement would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policies. It would also offer certain
guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a president
steps down. This provision has fueled speculation that Yeltsin's
resignation was imminent.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Friday that the talks
on the agreement were stalled. He proposed alternative candidates
for prime minister, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, upper
house speaker Yegor Stroyev and Yuri Maslyukov, a former head of
the Soviet Gosplan state planning agency.
	   Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin, Stroyev and Luzhkov in an
apparent attempt to dissuade the latter two from entering the race.
Luzhkov and Stroyev indicated after the meeting they would not.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced leader
to replace the youthful former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Kiriyenko warned on Friday that Russia is yet to hit the bottom
and a full-blown chaos can't be ruled out. ``I don't want to talk
about it because words have an unpleasant tendency to come true,''
he said ``For Russia it (chaos) would be of an extreme type.''
	   Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ The government said it would try to sell 1 billion rubles
worth of short-term bonds next week. At the official exchange rate,
that would be dlrs 127 million.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The Central Bank lowered the official rate
Friday to 7.905, or 12.7 cents, while the street rate remained
below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   _ The crisis has created a severe shortage of dollars both for
banks and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of
their reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want
to buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of
luck.
	   _ The second bank merger in as many days was announced late
Thursday as banks tried to pool their dwindling dollar assets.
	   _ Russian stocks rebounded from their dramatic fall earlier in
the week, but traders cautioned that the move was exaggerated by
the fact that volume has fallen to a trickle. The Russian Trading
System, Russia's largest stock exchange, was up 5.7 percent at
66.77 points compared to Thursday's close of 63.2 points. Overall
volume was less than dlrs 2.2 million, and participants said the
overall mood remained grim.

Endangered bats get their own night across Europe

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Europe will be going a little batty this weekend.
	   Bat lovers in 14 countries, including a descendant of Count
Dracula, are promoting the benign side of the nocturnal creature
with festivals and exhibits aimed at improving bats' blood-sucking
image.
	   ``Phrases such as `bats in the belfry' and `blind as a bat'
really give a false impression,'' said bat enthusiast Eric
Blencowe, executive secretary of the Bonn-based Eurobats bat
conservation group.
	   ``Bats are neither mad nor blind.''
	   The second annual European Bat night Saturday is organized by
Bonn-based Eurobats as well as national and local organizations in
each country, all of which are signatories to a 1994 international
agreement on bat conservation.
	   The agreement seeks to coordinate research and conservation
efforts to help the endangered mammals, some of which migrate
across Europe. Bats in Europe have suffered a substantial decline
this century, mainly due to loss of roosts when trees are cut down
or buildings renovated.
	   Organizers also hope the night will help ease people's fears of
bats, real and imagined, fueled by blood-sucking Dracula stories
and concerns that the transmit rabies.
	   Advocates say the 31 species of bats in Europe only eat insects,
which people should actually be grateful for.
	   ``People and bats can happily co-exist across the continent,''
said Julia Hamner of Britain's Bat Conservation Trust.
	   Her group is sponsoring a Bat Discovery Evening in London,
allowing visitors to ``enter the secret ultrasonic world of bats
using bat detectors.''
	   The detectors, usually operated by researchers, turns the
inaudible sounds bats make to help themselves navigate into squeaks
people can hear. They'll be used in other countries, too.
	   ``We'll be watching bats at dusk emerging from their day
roosting sites and listening to the sounds they make as they feed
and they hunt,'' said Kate McAney of the Vincent Wildlife Trust in
Ireland. ``We're in a sense eavesdropping on the bats.''
	   In Bulgaria, there is a bat exhibit at the National Museum of
Natural history and a whole ``bat day'' planned in the town of
Burgas. In Latvia, people will visit bat roosts and catch real
bats.
	   But the biggest bat party will be held in Berlin's Spandau
Citadel, a centuries-old stone fortress that really does have bats
in its belfry _ about 10,000.
	   Count Dracula's descendant, Ottomar Rudolphe Vlad Dracula Prince
Kretzulesco, will even leave his wooded castle outside of Berlin to
autograph ``bat adoption certificates'' at the Citadel.
	   ``I'm very excited about bat night,'' said Kretzulesco. ``They
have such a sensitive radar system and are true flight acrobats ...
I've had some here in my castle and it's amazing.''

Government forces kill more ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three members of an ethnic Albanian
family were killed Thursday and two others wounded when they were
attacked by government forces as they fled their central Kosovo
village, an Albanian source said Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center claimed
Serb forces started shelling Friday morning three villages in the
vicinity of Komorane, a crossroad village just 20 kilometers (12.5
miles) west of Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
	   Bodies of two ethnic Albanians gunned down four days ago
remained lying on the road leading into these villages off
Komorane. The fighting has prevented anyone from approaching them.
	   The center said numerous houses had been burned down in Suva
Reka, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. All roads
leading into the town were sealed by police.
	   Eleven villages north of Suva Reka were completely destroyed,
the center claimed. Its detailed reports could not be independently
verified.
	   However, recent battlefield reports were clear signs that the
Serbian offensive against Kosovo rebels _ and often against their
families _ is not over.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Ramadan Berisha, 60, an
unidentified woman and a child of his family were gunned down
Thursday while fleeing the fighting in their village of Ladrovic
near Malisevoc, 45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Pristina,
which had come under Serbian fire.
	   The center also reported two elderly refugees and a baby _ only
a few weeks old _ died Thursday of exhaustion in the area of
Malisevo, where civilians fled a total of eight villages in the
latest fighting.
	   Two more ethnic Albanians died Thursday in another Malisevo area
village, Pagarusa. Both had been wounded in the latest fighting.
	   The police killed Thursday two KLA members in Suva Reka, the
center said. They were identified as Naim Berisha, 30, and Xhelal
Kuqi, 30.
	   Police buried four unidentified ethnic Albanians on the
outskirts of Suva Reka on the same day. According to the state-run
Tanjug news agency, police confirmed that two ``terrorists'' were
killed when militants ambushed police in Suva Reka Thursday.
	   The two Kosovo Liberation Army members were said to have been
armed with automatic rifles and had bullet-proof vests.
	   The KLA is fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, of
which it is a province, whose autonomy was abolished by then
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1989.
	   But Adem Demaci, a KLA representative, admitted earlier this
week that his rebel force cannot hope for a military victory,
suggesting it would be ultimately willing to start talks if
government forces pull out.
	   On Friday, several dozen reporters were escorted by Serbian
police to the vicinity of Dulje, a town about 35 kilometers (22
miles) southwest of Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
	   However, the press convoy did not actually enter Dulje, seeing
only abandoned KLA positions taken over by Serbian police outside
the town.
	   Serbian police said their forces entered the former KLA
strongholds on the previous day, thus opening up the major
Pristina-Prizren artery traversing the wartorn province.
	   The road around Dulje had been in rebel hands for most of the
past three months.
	   Police Col. Bozidar Filic, an escort, told reporters one
policeman was killed and four were wounded in the operation over
the past three days.
	   Filic also said no heavy artillery was used unless it was
``absolutely necessary'' to penetrate a stronghold position.

Dow slips, Europe also falters in comeback bid after Asian selloff

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials slipped Friday morning after
Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge and steep losses in Asia.
	   The Dow, at one point up as much as 78.53, gave up its gains and
was down 40.68 at 8,125.31 at midmorning.
	   European stocks, which had been rebounding after opening sharply
lower, were faltering late in the session. In Asia, some key
indexes plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   Its drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third biggest point
drop ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997
and the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop,
while the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the
record 22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   The drop Thursday left the Dow down 1,171 points from its July
17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 12.6 percent.
	   It was the first time since last October's selloff, which was
also induced by fears that foreign economic troubles would hurt
American companies, that the Dow has finished a day more than 10
percent below its previous high, a loss commonly referred to as a
``market correction.'' A sustained drop of 20 percent marks a bear
market.
	   European markets opened with a tumble, but attempted a comeback
with a powerful rebound in the afternoon before also retreating.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off
by 85.3 points, or 1.6 percent, at 5,283.2 late in the session
after plunging 4.8 percent early in the day.
	   Frankfurt, Germany's Xetra DAX index plunged 5 percent in early
dealings but had recovered by late afternoon to show a loss of 1.3
percent on the day.

Thatcher predicts Labor victory in next election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher blames the
Conservative lawmakers who forced her resignation for the party's
worst election defeat _ and predicts Tony Blair's Labor Party will
win the next election.
	   Nearly eight years after Britain's first woman prime minister
stepped down, rather than face the second round of a leadership
challenge, she still appeared deeply angry over what she viewed as
the negative consequences of her departure.
	   ``The people who brought about that incident ... are responsible
for the biggest defeat the Conservative Party has ever had. ...
They have let the Labor Party in, and big! You won't turn that
around in one election,'' Lady Thatcher was quoted as saying in an
interview in the September issue of Saga, a magazine for older
people.
	   The Labor Party won a landslide victory in May 1997 _ defeating
the Conservatives and Thatcher's successor as prime minister, John
Major. Blair's popularity as prime minister consistently tops 60
percent in opinion polls.
	   Senior Conservative lawmaker Stephen Dorrell on Friday rejected
Thatcher's prediction that Labor will win the next election, and
accused her of an ``unconvincing rewriting of history.'' He blamed
the Tories' election defeat on divisions within the party stemming
from Thatcher's administration, not her overthrow as party leader
in November 1990.
	   Thatcher, 72, was asked by interviewer Douglas Keay if she would
ever consider standing for election again.
	   ``There are plenty of young people coming up. I'm now a
backstop. Always there for anything anyone may want,'' she was
quoted as saying.
	   Since she left office, Thatcher has set up a foundation and
travels the world giving speeches. She expressed regret that she
doesn't spend a great deal of time with her grown-up children,
twins Carol and Mark, and two grandchildren.
	   ``It's very sad. It's something I thought would never happen,''
Thatcher was quoted as saying, noting that Mark lives in South
Africa and Carol in Switzerland.
	   ``You can't have everything ... There's no point in bewailing
what might have been ... I haven't lost my children. They have to
live their lives. I took a different life,'' she was quoted as
saying. ``My greatest delight is when my daughter-in-law sends me
photographs of the grandchildren. Apart from seeing them in the
flesh, that is the greatest pleasure I have in the whole year, far
exceeding everything else.''

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ Michael Schumacher showed
Friday why he has won the Belgian Grand Prix the last three years.
The treacherous course showed Mika Hakkinen and Jacques Villeneuve
why it is part of Formula One lore.
	   Both drivers lost control at high speed on the slippery track
and slammed into the protective barriers. Both walked away from
their crashes.
	   Schumacher kept his Ferrari on the track and posted the fastest
time in practice, just ahead of Hakkinen.
	   Villeneuve was sixth fastest despite a harrowing crash that
destroyed his car and left him with a bruised knee.
	   The reigning world champion Villeneuve lost control of his
Williams-Mecachrome on the famed uphill, high-speed Eau Rouge curve
at about 280 kph (175 mph). His car disintigrated as it crashed
backwards into a tire barrier.
	   After the car came to a stop, he jumped out and walked away.
	   ``This was my best crash in Formula One,'' he said afterwards.
``The car doesn't look very good now.''
	   Villeneuve's father Gilles was killed while trying to qualify
for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix, when the race was staged at the
Zolder track.
	   Hakkinen damaged his McLaren-Mercedes after it spun off a
slippery track and slammed sideways into the protective tires at
about 230 kph (143 mph).
	   ``I hit a wet section and spun off,'' he said.
	   Hakkinen returned in his repaired car to challenge Schumacher,
getting within 0.011 of a second over the 6.968-kilometer
(4.329-mile) circuit.
	   Schumacher bounced his Ferrari off the curbstones on the final
chicane. He finished with a time of 1 minute, 51.895 seconds.
Scotland's David Coulthard was third in the other McLaren, 0.734
seconds back.
	   ``As I expected, we seem to be quite competitive here,''
Schumacher said.
	   Damon Hill continued along with the improving performance of his
Jordan-Mugen Honda, finishing fourth in 1:53.100.
	   He edged the Williams-Mecachrome teammates Heinz-Harald Frentzen
and Villeneuve, who were fifth and sixth.
	   Schumacher is going for his fourth straight victory in Belgium
and he will need it to keep his momentum going. The German
surprised many by winning the Hungarian Grand Prix and now has
Hakkinen within his reach with only four races to go.
	   Hakkinen has 77 points, only seven more than Schumacher. With
the race in the wooded hills of the Ardennes worth 10 points to the
winner, Schumacher could reclaim the lead Sunday.
	   ``We should be very strong in the race,'' Schumacher said.
	   The German added it would be a fitting present for Ferrari's
600th Formula One race Sunday. The pole position will be decided
during Saturday's qualifying session. Hakkinen is going for his
ninth pole of the season while Schumacher has yet to start first on
the grid this season.
	   The pole position is hardly the decisive factor in the Belgian
Grand Prix, where the wide curves and long straightaways leave
plenty of opportunities for passing.
	   The right choice of tires and the ability to adapt to the fickle
weather are considered more important.
	   Schumacher has proved repeatedly he is a master at that. On
Friday again, some 40,000 German fans roared their appreciation.
	   Schumacher's home town of Kempen is only 100 kilometers (65
miles) across the border in Germany and Spa-Francorchamps has
become his third home track, together with Hockenheim and the
Nurburgring.
	   Apart from being nearly his home, Spa-Francorchamps is also his
lucky circuit.
	   Schumacher made his Formula One debut at Spa in 1991 and started
seventh on the grid. A year later, he won his first Formula One
race at Spa and in 1995 he came from 16th on the grid to win. He
hasn't lost in Belgium since.

Italian striker arrives in Rome to sign contract with Lazio
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Vieri scored five goals in World Cup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian striker Christian Vieri arrived in Rome
Friday, a trip that is expected to see him sign the richest
contract in Italy's soccer history.
	   The 25-year-old forward is expected to move from Spain's
Atletico Madrid to Lazio of Rome for a dlrs 30 million transfer
fee.
	   The player would get dlrs 3 million a year for five years,
according to reports published in Italy.
	   The value of the deal is higher than last year's record dlrs 28
million transfer of Brazilian star Ronaldo from Barcelona to Inter
Milan.
	   Vieri, who scored five goals in five games with Italy at France
98, refused to comment on his transfer plans on his arrival at
Rome's international airport.
	   Lazio officials said they could not immediately comment on
Vieri's contract details.
	   Vieri is leaving Atletico after a single season in which he led
the Spanish league in scoring.
	   The young striker, who has never played with the same club for
more than one season, joined Atletico Madrid from Juventus of Turin
for dlrs 19 million.
	   According to some published reports Vieri decided to leave the
Spanish club after relations with Atletico's newly appointed
Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi grew tense.
	   Sacchi, a former coach of AC Milan and of the Italian national
team, dismissed the reports in an interview with Milan's daily
Corriere della Sera.
	   ``Vieri told me he was homesick and wanted to return to Italy
... He put us in a blind alley,'' Sacchi was quoted as saying on
Friday.
	   At Lazio, Vieri will team with newly signed Chilean striker
Marcelo Salas under Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson.

Mountaineer Albert Eggler dies at 85
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Albert Eggler, who headed the first
team to climb the 8,516-meter (28,103-foot) Lhotse Peak, the
world's fourth highest, has died in a climbing accident, newspapers
reported Friday. He was 85.
	   Obituary notices published in the Bern daily Der Bund said
Eggler died Tuesday in the Bernese Oberland mountains. He was
fatally injured when he fell down a steep slope on the 1,400-meter
(4,593-foot) Simmenfluh mountain.
	   An obituary notice from the Swiss Alpine Club said Eggler, a
lawyer, was involved in climbing for more than 50 years.
	   In 1956, he led a Swiss expedition to the Himalayas that was the
first to conquer Lhotse on the Nepal-China border. Days later, it
became one of the first three to climb the world's highest peak,
the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) Mount Everest.
	   The team was accompanied by 24 sherpas. Nearly 300 porters
carried the expedition's equipment to the base camp.
	   Last year, at age 84, Eggler climbed the 4,099-meter
(13,448-foot) Moench in the Swiss Alps. He was planning to leave on
a trekking tour of Nepal in September.
	   A funeral service will be held next Tuesday at the Nydegg church
in the Swiss capital, Bern. Details of survivors were not
available.

Report: Russia may replace ambassador to United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may replace its ambassador to the United
States, as officials believe that Yuli Vorontsov has served too
long in the post, a parliamentary leader said Friday.
	   ``Yuli Vorontsov is still working as the ambassador, but he has
been working there for a rather long time already,'' the head of
parliament's international affairs committee and former ambassador
to the United States, Vladimir Lukin, told the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Foreign Ministry refused to confirm or deny the report.
	   Vorontsov, 68, was appointed ambassador in July 1994 to replace
Lukin, who had been elected to parliament some eight months before.
	   Lukin refused to name any candidates for replacing Vorontsov.
	   Vorontsov has served as an ambassador to France and India as
well as Afghanistan, where he oversaw the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from the central Asian nation in 1988-89.
	   He was appointed Soviet representative to the United Nations in
1990, and became the Russian ambassador after the Soviet Union
collapsed a year later.

Down in the polls, aging German radicals strain for power
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bouncy rhythms from a saxophone group and hundreds
of colored balloons launched Germany's opposition Greens into the
final weeks of their election campaign, but the environmentalist
party's quest for power is hardly carefree.
	   While the talk in Germany is about political change _ the
Greens' own language _ they worry they may miss the boat once again
because they're a touch too radical.
	   As red wine and beer flowed at Thursday night's rally in a
trendy Berlin neighborhood, the top candidates mobilized voters
against the Greens' big fear: being shut out of government by the
two main parties.
	   Founded in 1980 as a band of radical ecologists, pacifists and
feminists, the Greens have inched toward the political center over
the years. Yet they've been weakened by a refusal to deny their
tie-dyed roots even in an election year that gives them their best
shot yet at entering government.
	   Some Green proposals _ a long-term tripling of gasoline prices,
scrapping NATO and posting speed limits on the autobahn _ have
scared off mainstream voters and sent the party plummeting in
opinion polls.
	   After 12 percent support at the start of the year, latest polls
give it 6 percent of the vote on Sept. 27 _ less than the 7.3
percent the Greens won in the last national election four years
ago.
	   ``It's going to be tight. But we've never been so close,'' party
co-leader Juergen Trittin, flanked by the Greens' sunflower symbol.
	   Few politicians are as graphic as the Greens in their desire to
dump Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whom Trittin skewered as ``the fattest
lame duck in political history.'' The young crowd in an eastern
Berlin beer hall loved it.
	   But it's not that simple.
	   Front-runner Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has
increasingly talked up Kohl's Christian Democrats as a possible
governing partner should he be elected chancellor. That strategy,
designed to increase Schroeder's appeal to middle class voters,
ignores the Greens as an aspiring junior partner.
	   In reply, they're not sparing him when they attack the big
parties as resistant to major changes in the economy and domestic
policies, such as an increasingly tough line on immigration.
	   ``I want Gerhard Schroeder to become chancellor, but not as a
younger Helmut Kohl,'' shouted Joschka Fischer, the Greens' leader
in parliament and their best-known candidate. ``We say a lot of
things have to change fundamentally in this country.''
	   Fischer, a streetfighter during his 1970s radical days who now
wants to be foreign minister, is the party's leading moderate. He
said the Greens had shot often themselves in the foot this year.
	   ``We have made mistakes, no question,'' he said.
	   But on the campaign trial, he defends ideas that most Germans
mistrust, including higher levies on fossil fuels as part of a
wider tax reform and quick steps to scrap nuclear energy.
	   Such talk irks not only conservatives who doubt the Greens'
ability to govern. Schroeder, a pro-business pragmatist, also says
he won't stand for moves that hurt the auto industry.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens do agree on major goals _
fighting unemployment, overhauling the welfare state _ and they are
jointly running four German states, including the nation's most
populous, North Rhine-Westphalia.
	   It's been a sometimes stormy marriage. Last fall, the Greens
nearly walked out because of a coal strip mine the Social Democrats
support.
	   In Bonn, the seat of government, the same alliance in the city
council has carved bicycle paths out of the road that runs by
Kohl's chancellery, slowing traffic.
	   The Greens' campaign launch fit the maverick picture, featuring
a lottery with a green bike as the main prize, music from a gay
men's a cappella group and a saxophone trio playing the theme from
the Monty Python television series.
	   Their voters wouldn't have it any other way.
	   ``If anyone, it's the Greens who stand for the kind of
unconventional ideas we need,'' said supporter Kai Kertscher, 34, a
Berlin photographer.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If there is an image of Wimbledon that lingers
in Pete Sampras' mind, symbolizing the twin sides of a
championship, it is the sad, slumping figure of Goran Ivanisevic
holding the pitifully small runner-up trophy in his large hands,
his eyes simultaneously wild and vanquished, his voice screaming in
silence.
	   ``He was very, very distraught. I felt bad for him,'' Sampras
said after watching a videotape of their five-set final last month.
	   It wasn't the first time Sampras left a victim devastated, and
most likely it won't be the last. Sampras may not be a cinch to
claim a fifth title at the U.S. Open, which starts Monday, and
balance his trophy case with the five big ones from Wimbledon, but
who else is a more likely candidate to win this year?
	   Sampras' aggressive style, often obscured by his cool demeanor,
bared its teeth at Wimbledon after a yearlong lull. He gnawed and
clawed and snapped his way to the five-set victory over Ivanisevic,
and set himself up to take another bite out of history at the Open.
	   Roy Emerson's record 12 Grand Slam titles is there for the
matching if Sampras can win seven straight matches once more at the
ever-expanding, ever-more-beautiful U.S. National Tennis Center.
There's no pressure on Sampras, just turned 27, to tie Emerson
right away, but he'd just as soon get this long-anticipated record
out of the way, if only to stop talking about it.
	   Sampras is, in a word, motivated. To tie Emerson and eventually
pass him. To toss aside the challenge of Marcelo Rios for the No. 1
spot. To repel the resurgent Andre Agassi. To dethrone the
defending champion, Patrick Rafter. To destroy again, if necessary,
Ivanisevic.
	   ``When you're playing well and you're winning tournaments, guys
fear you,'' Sampras said. ``You've kind of built an aura about you.
You intimidate guys. ...
	   ``I feel very motivated. I'm to the point where my two main
goals are to be No. 1 and to do well in the majors. ... I still
enjoy it. I still love to compete.''
	   Sampras stayed busy after Wimbledon with three straight
hard-court tournaments, playing erratically, losing early at New
Haven, Connecticut, after reaching the final in Cincinnati and the
quarterfinals at the Canadian Open. He didn't intimidate, but he
did enough to regain the No. 1 ranking just in time to be
top-seeded at the Open.
	   ``I'm in pretty good match shape,'' Sampras said. ``Let's go out
and play.''
	   Agassi is in pretty good shape, too. Which is a whole lot
different from a year ago, when he came in a bit overweight and
soft, and lost in the fourth round after skipping the three
previous Grand Slam events while on an extended honeymoon with
actress Brooke Shields.
	   These days, Agassi is a lean, mean, ball-return machine again,
tracking down everything from the baseline, punching back shots the
way he used to. The U.S. Open winner in 1994, and twice a
runner-up, the No. 8 Agassi looms as a possible quarterfinal
opponent for Sampras.
	   Agassi has won two of their three meetings this year and has
primed himself for another title run by playing consistently strong
since his second-round ouster from Wimbledon. He won hard-court
tournaments at Washington and Los Angeles, reached the final at
Indianapolis, the semis at the Canadian Open, and lost early only
at Cincinnati.
	   If Agassi isn't threat enough to Sampras, Australia's Rafter may
be. Rafter's world changed when he won the Open last year, but
after a stretch of patchy tennis, he may be up for the challenge of
defending his title. For one thing, he won't be weighed down, as
Sampras was at 20 when he came back to defend his first Open title,
by the sense of carrying an unbearable weight.
	   ``I don't think I will ever say it's a burden because it is
something I always wanted to happen,'' said Rafter, seeded No. 3
this year and in Sampras' half of the draw. ``At times it's been
tough dealing with a lot of extra things on the side other than
tennis. That has been very tough. But a burden I would never say
because it is something it has been a big dream of mine to win.''
	   Sampras, Agassi and Rafter are among perhaps eight men who could
capture the Open without too much of a surprise. Among the women,
the number jumps to about a dozen.
	   Start with defending champion Martina Hingis of Switzerland, but
consider how spotty and, at times, indifferent her game has been
this year since winning the first major in Australia. Remember the
surge Venus Williams put on to get to the final last year, and the
way she's matured this year.
	   Consider the tear Lindsay Davenport has been on this summer as
she keeps melting away weight and mounting up victories. Think
about indefatigable Arantxa Sanchez Vicario winning the French
Open, and Jana Novotna striking another blow for the older set by
capturing Wimbledon at last. Look at the threats posed by the likes
of Nathalie Tauziat, Natasha Zvereva, Conchita Martinez and, most
obviously, Monica Seles, pounding away, free of pain and worry,
showing flashes of her once-invincible groundstrokes.
	   And, finally, don't forget the budding brilliance of Serena
Williams and Anna Kournikova, nor Steffi Graf, returning after a
year on the sidelines, her fragile knees and back and ankles
holding up so far.
	   A five-time U.S. Open champion who sat out last year after knee
surgery, Graf is seeded No. 8 this time, the middle of the pack but
as dangerous as ever.
	   ``I'm absolutely fine; there are no problems,'' Graf said.
``I've got the shots and I've got the strength. I just need the
confidence.''

Ukraine protests Moscow mayor's statements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Foreign Ministry summoned the
Russian ambassador on Friday to protest recent statements by Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, which it called a intrusion into the nation's
internal affairs.
	   Luzhkov ``yet again has made statements containing unfriendly
attacks on Ukraine,'' deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Chaly told
Russian ambassador Yuri Dubinin, according to a ministry statement.
	   ``Some statements by Yuri Luzhkov can be assessed as an
intrusion into Ukraine's internal affairs and disrespect for its
sovereignty,'' it added.
	   Luzhkov long has enraged Ukraine by his fight against what he
calls discrimination against Ukraine's ethnic Russians, especially
those living on the Crimean peninsula and in its key port city of
Sevastopol.
	   The popular and influential Luzhkov, who often plays to
nationalist sentiment, made the remarks Wednesday while opening a
school for Russian children in Sevastopol.
	   Luzhkov accused Ukrainian authorities of forced
``Ukrainization'' of the city and its educational system and of
attempts to force the Ukrainian language on ethnic Russian
residents.
	   He also told Russian servicemen in the city to continue to hope
that Sevastopol some day shall return to Russia.
	   ``All the conditions for normal life of the people, regardless
of their citizenship and language, have been created in
Sevastopol,'' the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Sevastopol, a former Soviet naval base, became part of
then-Soviet Ukraine in the 1950s. Arguments about its future have
spoiled relations between Russia and Ukraine since the Soviet
collapse.
	   Alongside a 1997 friendship treaty, Russia and Ukraine have
agreed to let Russia use Sevastopol as the base for its portion of
the former Soviet Black Sea fleet. The documents remain to be
ratified by the two countries' parliaments.

Ambush leades to fighting between warring clans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least three militiamen were killed
and three others wounded when fighting erupted between the forces
of two warring factions, fighters said Friday.
	   Militiamen loyal to factional leader Hussein Mohammed Aidid said
the fighting broke out after gunmen ambushed their convoy of four
armed vehicles and 50 armed men returning to the capital, Mogadishu
from the town of Huddor, 300 kilometers (190 miles) to the
northwest.
	   The attack, believed to have been carried out by fighters of the
Rahanwein Resistance Army which has been fighting Aidid's men for
control of the central Somali town of Baidoa, occurred outside the
town of Bur Hakaba, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Mogadishu.
	   Baidoa is about halfway along the road between Mogadishu and
Huddor, and Bur Hakaba is 75 kilometers (50 miles) east of Baidoa.
	   The RRA lost Baidoa to Aidid's troops in late 1995 and fighting
erupted in February and again June when they tried unsuccessfully
to regain control.
	   Last December, Aidid and 23 faction leaders agreed to hold a
national reconciliation conference in Baidoa. The RRA and others
said they would not attend unless Aidid withdrew his militia, which
he has not done.
	   The conference was repeatedly rescheduled until it was postponed
indefinitely.
	   In Friday's fighting, the convoy was attacked when one of the
vehicles, armed with a heavy machine gun, ran out of gas. Aidid's
supporters said his repulsed the attack, kiling several RRA forces.
They denied unconfirmed reports that the RRA siezed one of their
armed vehicles.
	   Aidid's militiamen, who returned to Mogadishu Friday with only
two of the vehicles, said three of their men were killed in the
fighting. Sources close to Aidid, reached by VHF radio, said four
Aidid fighters were killed.
	   Somalia has had no central government since clan-based faction
leaders combined to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January
1991, then turned on each other as the country disintegrated into
fiefdoms protected by private militias.

Germany, France to take `active role' in helping Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Waigel saying reforms condition of 2nd IMF
payment; additional quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ After days of insisting Russia must solve
its financial crisis itself, Germany changed tack Friday, saying it
would take an ``active role'' with France in offering support to
Moscow.
	   But Finance Minister Theo Waigel stressed direct German aid to
Russia was ``not open to discussion,'' and said ``clear signals''
were still needed from Moscow that they would ``implement reforms
forcefully.''
	   The somewhat more aggressive tone came as the Frankfurt stock
exchange, like others around Europe, continued to slide and
Germany's biggest bank indicated Russia's financial meltdown was
starting to hurt its bottom line.
	   Those reforms are essential before the International Monetary
Fund can release the dlrs 4.3 billion scheduled to be paid to
Russia on Sept. 15, he said.
	   Speaking at his party's convention in Munich, Waigel reiterated
the German government's concern about developments in Russia.
	   But while he and other officials were saying this week that
Russia must help itself out of the mess by pushing through
structural reforms, Friday's talk was more aggressive.
	   ``Germany must in this situation take an active role within the
framework of international cooperation,'' Waigel said.
	   He said he and French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
have agreed to jointly ``turn to the new Russian prime minister,
(Viktor) Chernomyrdin, to offer our support for the reform
process.''
	   He said he and his French counterpart also have agreed to
jointly ``appeal for structural reforms and the implementation of
the (International Monetary Fund) program to restore the confidence
of the financial markets and create the foundations for growth'' in
Russia.
	   In addition, Germany, Britain, France and Italy are drafting a
letter to send to Russia in the next few days regarding the crisis,
he said.
	   In a brief statement, Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG,
said ``most'' of its dlrs 290 million in short-term Russian
Treasury bonds were in the form of GKOs.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday, giving investors two not-very-attractive
options for trading them in at maturity. Analysts say foreign banks
can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   The Deutsche Bank spokesman also said the bank ``will raise its
risk provisions for Russia,'' without specifying by how much.
	   German commercial banks are Russia's biggest private lenders,
with about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans at the end of 1997. Unlike
the bonds, almost 90 percent of them are guaranteed by the German
government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   Deutsche Bank said earlier this week it had set aside 60 cents
on the dollar to cover its unsecured loans to Russia, which total
1.35 billion marks (dlrs 750 million).

Bosnian Serb pleads innocent to rape indictment

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Defiant before a U.N. tribunal
prosecuting sexual assault as a war crime for the first time, a
Bosnian Serb pleaded innocent Friday to expanded charges that he
raped and let his troops rape Muslim women.
	   Rape reportedly was used throughout the Bosnian war to terrorize
and traumatize civilians as part of so-called ``ethnic cleansing''
campaigns _ purges aimed at driving entire ethnic groups out of
regions.
	   Dragoljub Kunarac, 38, looked calm and composed as he entered
innocent pleas to 21 war crimes and crimes against humanity charges
at a brief hearing before a single Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
judge.
	   He originally faced just four charges, but his indictment was
broadened after investigators uncovered new evidence. He faces a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Prosecutors claim that Kunarac led a gang of 10-15 Serbs who
systematically raped and tortured at least 10 Muslim women. The
alleged attacks occurred in the eastern Bosnian town of Foca
between April 1992 and February 1993 after the Serb takeover of the
region.
	   Female civilians were imprisoned in houses across Foca and
repeatedly raped by Kunarac's gang.
	   One woman, identified in court papers only as ``FWS-191'' was
held by Kunarac for six months. The woman was treated ``as the
personal property of Dragoljub Kunarac'' and repeatedly raped,
prosecutors claim.
	   Another woman _ seven months' pregnant at the time _ was held
for at least a week by Kunarac and his men. That victim, identified
as FWS-101, was repeatedly raped, beaten and forced to clean their
quarters, according to Kunarac's indictment.
	   Kunarac is charged with personally raping seven women and
letting his subordinates rape, sodomize and assault others. Some
were also robbed.
	   A trial date was not immediately at Friday's hearing, which was
called so that Kunarac could enter pleas to his new indictment,
broadened after investigators uncovered new evidence.
	   Kunarac surrendered to the U.N. court March 4, saying he wanted
to tell the truth about what happened in Foca.
	   At his original arraignment in March, a confused-looking Kunarac
pleaded guilty to rape, but judges refused to accept it and entered
an innocent plea on his behalf, saying he had been poorly advised
by his lawyers.
	   On Friday he looked confident, smiling with his attorney,
Slavisa Prodanovic, before the hearing and bluntly answering ``not
guilty'' in Serbo Croat as each charge was read to him.
	   The original indictment, which named seven other rape suspects
still at large in Bosnia, was the first and only issued by tribunal
prosecutors dealing exclusively with rape as a war crime.
	   Established in 1993, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
indicted 60 suspects and has 25 in custody in The Hague. Its
most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, are still free.

Czech government to check objectivity of RFE broadcast to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech government plans to
evaluate the objectivity of a U.S.-run radio station that will
broadcast to Iran, the foreign minister announced Friday.
	   Just two days after the government agreed to allow Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to Iran, it decided to monitor
the programming.
	   ``The criterion will be whether the broadcast is balanced,
objective, and not tending to be ... hostile toward the Iranian
government,'' the news agency CTK quoted Foreign Minister Jan Kavan
as saying.
	   Late Wednesday, the Social Democratic government agreed to allow
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to Iran, but not to
Iraq as originally planned.
	   Broadcasting to Iran is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
	   Spokesman Libor Roucek said the government would consider
whether to approve broadcasts to Iraq only if the U.S. government
makes an official request.
	   At the end of this year, the broadcast to Iran will be reviewed,
Roucek said. The ``government will evaluate all the consequences of
this broadcast, including security and economic risks.''
	   Kavan dismissed worries that the government's decision may
derail both broadcasts. ``We didn't halt anything,'' he said.
	   No one from the station could be reached for comment.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmitting from Munich,
Germany, in 1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War.
	   The station moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995, following
communism's collapse.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's plan to create new
services that will be beamed into Iran and Iraq.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, the new
leftist government of Milos Zeman has had second thoughts, fearing
the broadcast may make Prague the target of terrorist attacks.
	   Kavan said the Iraqi government already has protested the
planned broadcast.
	   ``We heed very carefully protests of the Iranian government, and
now also of the Iraqi government.''

Norway's oil fund grows to nearly dlrs 17 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's state petroleum fund, the money the
country is putting aside to cushion against the eventual decline in
oil revenues, grew to 135.8 billion kroner (dlrs 16.97 billion) in
the second quarter of the year, up from the first quarter's 120.5
billion kroner.
	   The state central bank said Friday that increase reflected both
a 2.1-percent return on investments and 11.9 billion kroner in
surplus revenues added to the fund by the government in June.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil exporter, sets aside some
of its oil revenues in expectation of its oil reserves running
dry.. t established the fund
	   This year, parliament allowed the Central Bank of Norway to
expand oil fund investments into stocks instead of placing them
exclusively in safe but lower yield government bonds. Some 30 to 50
percent of the fund has been invested in stocks.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The number of ethnic Albanians
from the rebellious Serbian province of Kosovo arriving in north
Bohemia rose ten-fold over the last two weeks, the news agency CTK
reported Friday.
	   It quoted Frantisek Hamerle, a police officer from Usti nad
Labem, 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Prague, as saying that
the number in the region increased to 1,000 from about 100 in
mid-August.
	   Hamerle said that so far the refugees have had enough money and
live in cheep hotels and hostels. Only 57 of them so far have
accepted accommodation in a refugee camp near the north Bohemian
town of Teplice.
	   Most of the Albanians apparently arrived via Slovakia.
	   According to the Foreign Ministry in Prague, Yugoslav nationals
need a visa to enter the Czech Republic. But when they are caught
inside the country they cannot be sent back because their lives
there could be in jeopardy.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya: duchess said.
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Egypt has sent two planeloads of food and
medicine to help needy southern Sudanese but heavy rain has been
hampering distribution, the World Food Program said Friday.
	   The shipments, valued at dlrs 400,000, consisted of lentils,
beans, vegetable oil, powdered milk and medical supplies. One plane
went to Nairobi and the other to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum,
the agency said.
	   Since January, the agency has delivered a total of 44,200 tons
of food for 2.5 million people in rebel- and government-held areas
of south Sudan, using airdrops, airlift, road and barge transport.
But rain has been flooding airstrips and roads, disrupting
deliveries.
	   A 15-year civil war between government troops and southern
rebels has resulted in widespread famine and population
displacement.

Dow slips, Europe also falters in comeback bid after Asian selloff

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials slipped Friday morning after
Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge and steep losses in Asia.
	   The Dow, at one point up as much as 78.53, gave up its gains and
was down 40.68 at 8,125.31 at midmorning.
	   European stocks, which had been rebounding after opening sharply
lower, were faltering late in the session. In Asia, some key
indexes plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   Its drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third biggest point
drop ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997
and the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop,
while the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the
record 22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   The drop Thursday left the Dow down 1,171 points from its July
17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 12.6 percent.
	   It was the first time since last October's selloff, which was
also induced by fears that foreign economic troubles would hurt
American companies, that the Dow has finished a day more than 10
percent below its previous high, a loss commonly referred to as a
``market correction.'' A sustained drop of 20 percent marks a bear
market.
	   European markets opened with a tumble, but attempted a comeback
with a powerful rebound in the afternoon before also retreating.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was off by 115.1 points, or 2.1 percent, at 5,253.4 with a half
hour left to trade after plunging 4.8 percent early in the day.

Bomb-wrecked businesses face long haul of reconstruction

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Wreaths and a prayer for Kenya's economy
marked a brief memorial service Friday for the 11 dead and more
than 1,000 injured from Kenya's Cooperative Bank.
	   The 22-story bank building, adjacent to the U.S. Embassy and a
now-demolished office building, was left unusable by the bomb
attack three weeks ago that killed 247 people and wounded more than
5,400 others.
	   With most of the dead buried, the bank held a memorial service
in front of the rubble, with twelve participants given the honor of
laying wreaths to pay tribute to the victims, who were in bank
offices at the time of the blast.
	   The ceremony was meant to rally support for rebuilding as well,
said the bank's managing director, Erastus Mureithi.
	   With the blast, 30 years of bank work ``fell down within a
second,'' said Mureithi, his loudspeakered voice intermittently
drowned out by the din of construction.
	   ``Until now, the major preoccupation of the bank was to put
ourselves back on our feet,'' he said, calling on listeners ``to
regain our strength from here.''
	   Cooperative Bank estimates it will cost more than 2 billion
shillings (dlrs 3.3 million) just to temporarily relocate the
bank's many branches and facilities and to rebuild its
headquarters, the Cooperative Bank House building.
	   The bomb blast wrecked five buildings and countless vehicles
closest to the explosion, and shattered windows as far as ten
blocks away. Now, all around the blast site, construction workers
are pounding in new beams and posts, repairing walls and ceilings,
replacing awnings.
	   Several businesses are back at work without windows, while
dozens of new storefronts line sidewalks still littered with small
pieces of rubble and glass.
	   Although there has been no detailed tally of total damages from
the blast, some estimates go as high as 30 billion shillings (dlrs
500 million). But some consider that figure too high.
	   Mureithi said the bank would move into several new buildings
over the weekend and begin the long rebuilding. He urged
shareholders to stick with the bank as it slowly makes its way
back.
	   ``We shall pick up the pieces ... and rebuild to even bigger
heights,'' he said.

Blazevic recalls recovered Boksic for Sept. 5 qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Alen Boksic, who missed the World Cup
because of knee surgery, was recalled Friday to the Croatian
national team for the country's Sept. 5 European Championship
qualifier against Ireland.
	   But seven members of the World Cup bronze-medal winning side
were excluded from the roster by coach Miro Blazevic, including
striker Robert Prosinecki.
	   Robert Prosinecki, one of Croatia's top strikers, was left out,
presumably because he and Blazevic have not been at loggerheads for
years.
	   In a recent interview, Prosinecki stated categorically he would
not play for the national team as long as Blazevic is in charge.
	   Blazevic recently agreed to a new four-year term as Croatia's
coach.
	   Also among the missing was goalkeeper Drazen Ladic, widely
praised for his World Cup performance but asked not to be called.
	   ``He said The World Cup in France was the top of his carrier and
I do not want to force him,'' Blazevic told the Jutarnji list
daily.
	   Goran Vlaovic and Slaven Bilic have minor injuries and were not
named. Midfielder Robert Jarni, who recently signed for Real
Madrid, and Igor Tudor, who now plays for Juventus, will join the
squad.
	   ___ &QC;

	   Goalkeepers: Marijan Mrmic (Besiktas), Zeljko Pavlovic (LASK).
	   Defenders: Igor Stimac (Derby County); Zvonimir Soldo

Villeneuve has mighty crash at his favorite curve

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ One of the most infamous
curves in Formula One shocked one its most famous fans Friday.
Luckily, reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve was able to
walk away from his crash at the Belgian Grand Prix.
	   The Canadian daredevil lost control of his Williams-Mecachrome
on the famed Eau-Rouge corner at some 290 kph (180 mph) and crashed
backward into a protective tire barrier.
	   Amid flying debris and tires, his car was thrown up in the air,
but as soon as it settled, Villeneuve jumped out and race stewards
immediately led him away.
	   It hadn't changed his feisty character.
	   ``This was my best crash in Formula One,'' he said. ``I think I
was over 290 at the apex of Eau Rouge,'' he said afterwards. ``I'm
OK but at the time I thought `Oh, this one is going to hurt'.''
	   The only apparent damage was a bruised knee. He was taken away
for a mandatory exam at a hospital but appeared to be fine.
	   His father, Gilles, was killed in an accident at the 1982
Belgian Grand Prix when it was raced at Zolder. Jacques has almost
been an ardent advocate of keeping an element of risk and danger in
the sport.
	   He could not have come to a better place.
	   Spa-Francorchamps' Eau Rouge has kicked up a storm of
controversy over the years.
	   Five years ago, Alex Zanardi was almost killed on Eau Rouge when
his car crashed at top speed. In 1985, Germany's Formula One
hopeful Stefan Bellof died after he crashed on the same curve.
	   After the death of Ayrton Senna, the corner was redesigned and
slowed for safety purposes but for the past several years it has
been restored to its former glory.
	   On Friday, Villeneuve turned wide on the Source hairpin and
quickly moved up to sixth gear as the Williams-Mecachrome gathered
speed on the downslope past the grandstands.
	   Then he pushed uphill again into a slow corner with only the
majestic pines and the low, threatening clouds in his field of
vision over the rise of the hill.
	   Many Formula One drivers have said being blindsided on the fast
curve is the biggest thrill of their driving career.
	   For Villeneuve, it almost ended his career.
	   ``I lost it,'' he said.
	   His car started swerving sideways. He tried to brake but it was
too late. His car skidded over the sandpit, losing almost no
momentum.
	   For Villeneuve's colleagues, it showed the value of the new
safety standards, including new protection for neck and head, and
the strength of the carbon-fiber cockpits.
	   ``Villeneuve's accident was a big one and it proved that safety
standards have improved a great deal,'' said Michael Schumacher.

Council condemns attacks on UN, detention of Iranians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council considered a draft
resolution Friday condemning attacks on U.N. personnel in
Afghanistan and the detention of Iranian diplomats in a northern
city.
	   The draft also expressed ``grave concern at the continued Afghan
conflict which has recently sharply escalated due to the Taliban
forces' offensive in the northern parts of the country.''
	   The council deplored the continuous foreign involvement in the
conflict despite ``repeated pleas by the Security Council,'' the
draft said.
	   Neighboring Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the ruling Taliban, while Iran is suspected of
backing the minority northern-based opposition.
	   Over the past four years, the Taliban religious militia has
captured most of the country, including the capital, Kabul. Under
its strict interpretation of Islam, girls are barred from school,
most women are confined to their homes, and music, movies and
television are banned.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry has said the Taliban advances posed
a threat to the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, and Russia
was ready to fortify their borders.
	   Russia, a permanent council member, fears the entrenchment of a
radical Islamic state in Afghanistan could bring an influx of
refugees and weapons into Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban of detaining 47 Iranians since it
captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The resolution condemned the capture of the Iranian diplomats
and demanded that ``all Afghan factions and, in particular the
Taliban, do everything possible to assure safe and dignified
passage out of Afghanistan.''
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.
	   The draft also condemns the attacks on U.N. personnel and called
on the Taliban to investigate ``these heinous crimes.''
	   Earlier this month in Afghanistan, the bodies of two kidnapped
Afghan nationals working for the United Nations were found near the
eastern city of Jalalabad. An Italian military observer with the
U.N. force was shot dead last week after U.S. missile strikes on
suspected terrorist camps in the country.
	   The draft said it deplored ``measures taken by the Taliban which
seriously impede the activities of the United Nations humanitarian
agencies and international humanitarian organizations throughout
the country, and in particular, in Kabul.''
	   Last month, about 200 international staffers from 38 aid
organizations pulled out of Kabul rather than obey a Taliban order
to move their residences into an abandoned dormitory.
	   The draft urged ``all Afghan factions, in particular the
Taliban, to facilitate the work of the international humanitarian
organizations and ensure unimpeded access and adequate conditions
for the delivery of aid.''

Norway's oil fund grows to nearly dlrs 17 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's state petroleum fund, the money the
country is putting aside to cushion against the eventual decline in
oil revenues, grew to 135.8 billion kroner (dlrs 16.97 billion) in
the second quarter of the year, up from the first quarter's 120.5
billion kroner.
	   The state central bank said Friday the increase reflected both a
2.1-percent return on investments and 11.9 billion kroner in
surplus revenues added to the fund by the government in June.
	   This year, parliament allowed the Central Bank of Norway to
expand oil fund investments into stocks instead of placing them
exclusively in safe but lower yield government bonds. Some 30 to 50
percent of the fund has been invested in stocks.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, is the world's
second-largest oil exporter.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After 13 days and seven matches in the tennis
cauldron known as the U.S. Open, who will embrace the women's
singles trophy on Super Saturday?
	   Asked that question, American Lindsay Davenport cradled her face
in her hand, thoughtfully paused, and announced: ``Eight players
could win it and it would not be an upset.''
	   Never has the U.S. Open been so open.
	   A year ago, two teen-agers battled for the women's title at the
U.S. Open, with Switzerland's Martina Hingis dominating American
Venus Williams, a surprising finalist. But the ``Year of the
Teens'' has turned into a showcase for all ages.
	   ``The surprises this year have been coming from the older
players: Nathalie Tauziat, Conchita Martinez,'' said Davenport, who
is ranked No. 2 by the WTA Tour. ``Everything's been out of sync.''
	   Hingis is still No. 1, and Williams has proved that last
September's performance was not a fluke. Her titles include the
crown at the Lipton, a tournament that's just a shade below Grand
Slam status.
	   Serena Williams, Venus' younger sister, has powered her way up
the rankings with victories over several top players; Russia's Anna
Kournikova, at 17, is dangerous, although she's coming off an
injury; and 19-year-old Patty Schnyder of Switzerland has won five
tournaments in 1998.
	   But it was 26-year-old Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain who
captured the French Open, the third of her career, and 29-year-old
Czech Jana Novotna who won Wimbledon.
	   The losing finalists in the year's first three Grand Slam
tournaments also have made more than a couple of circuits around
the WTA Tour: Martinez, 26, at the Australian Open; Yugoslav-born
American Monica Seles, 24, at the French Open; and Frenchwoman
Tauziat, 30, at Wimbledon.
	   In all, eight players who have won Grand Slam tournaments will
be in the 128-player field that begins play Monday, and most are
given a chance to win another trophy at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Hingis may be the defending champ, but she surprisingly isn't
riding the longest winning streak at the National Tennis Center
going into this year's edition. That honor belongs to Germany's
Steffi Graf, who hasn't lost at Flushing Meadows since the 1994
final, when she fell to Sanchez Vicario.
	   Graf has won her last 14 U.S. Open matches and 27 of the last
28, yet she is looking for her first victory on the new stadium
court, which debuted last year.
	   Hingis is riding a seven-game winning streak at the National
Tennis Center, but, unlike a year ago, she hasn't dominated women's
tennis in 1998. She captured her second straight Australian Open
title in January, her fourth Grand Slam tournament crown in five
tournaments, but has not won a tournament since the Italian Open in
early May.
	   Since then, she has lost to Kournikova, Seles, Novotna, France's
Mary Pierce and Davenport. Earlier in the year, Venus Williams also
beat Hingis.
	   ``The competition around her has gotten better,'' Davenport
said. ``Venus is much better. And (Hingis) probably lost a little
intensity.''
	   Seles has two U.S. Open titles on her resume, but the last came
six years ago before a stabbing forced her drop out of tennis at
the height of her career for nearly three years. Still, she reached
the U.S. Open final in 1995 and 1996, and was in the French Open
title match this year.
	   Davenport is still seeking her first major crown, although she
did win the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics.
	   The 1.89-meter (6-foot-2 1-2) right-hander from Newport Beach,
California, dropped 11 1-2 kilos (25 pounds) and improved her
mobility. She is coming off a successful three-tournament swing and
has pulled close to Hingis in the rankings.
	   ``My serve has improved a lot,'' Davenport said. ``My confidence
is very high. The strength in my legs definitely helped my serve.
Last year I thought I was in good shape. This year I feel even
stronger.''
	   And that means she's a strong contender for the U.S. Open crown.
	   ``If you look at the resumes, every player is kind of measured
by the Grand Slams and if they have ever won a Grand Slam,'' she
said. ``My expectations going in is to win it. I have as good a
shot as anyone.''

Yazdi: Clinton should be tried for missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The head of Iran's judiciary, Mohammad
Yazdi, said Friday that U.S. President Clinton should be brought to
trial for ordering missile strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The hard-line cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, issued the call
during a sermon at Friday prayers at Tehran University in the
Iranian capital.
	   Yazdi described the missile strikes Aug. 20 as ``state
terrorism,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said in a
report monitored in Cairo.
	   Of Clinton, Yazdi said, ``he has acted wrongly and must be
tried,'' the London-headquartered BBC quoted him as saying.
	   ``The world must try him,'' Yazdi was quoted as saying. ``Their
(the Americans') despicable acts need to be put on trial.''
	   He said the U.N. Security Council or the International Court at
The Hague, the Netherlands, would be appropriate trial venues.
	   Both IRNA and the BBC said that the crowd chanted ``Death to
America'' during his remarks.
	   Clinton ordered missile strikes on camps in Afghanistan run by
Islamic militant Osama bin Laden after accusing him of involvement
in the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed more than 250 people.
	   A factory in Sudan also was hit by U.S. missiles. The Americans
said the factory was producing precursors for the deadly VX nerve
gas; the Sudanese say it made pharmaceuticals.
	   Yazdi called the strike on the Sudan factory ``a despicable
act'' because it deprived a poor country of much-needed medicine.
	   ``This bullying and use of force and the attitude of you (the
United States) being the only ones in the world are, in my view,
past their time and are mistaken,'' Yazdi was quoted by the BBC as
saying.
	   He supported the announcement Wednesday by Sudan's attorney
general, Ali al-Zaki, that Sudan is bringing a criminal lawsuit
against the United States for the missile strike and would try
Clinton in absentia, IRNA said.
	   Yazdi is among the staunchest supporters of Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Endangered bats get their own night across Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By KAREN CARSTENS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Europe will be going a little batty this weekend.
	   Bat lovers in 14 countries, including a descendant of Count
Dracula, are promoting the benign side of the nocturnal creature
with festivals and exhibits aimed at improving bats' blood-sucking
image.
	   ``Phrases such as `bats in the belfry' and `blind as a bat'
really give a false impression,'' said bat enthusiast Eric
Blencowe, executive secretary of the Bonn-based Eurobats bat
conservation group.
	   ``Bats are neither mad nor blind.''
	   The second annual European Bat night Saturday is organized by
Bonn-based Eurobats as well as national and local organizations in
each country, all of which are signatories to a 1994 international
agreement on bat conservation.
	   The agreement seeks to coordinate research and conservation
efforts to help the endangered mammals, some of which migrate
across Europe. Bats in Europe have suffered a substantial decline
this century, mainly due to loss of roosts when trees are cut down
or buildings renovated.
	   Organizers also hope the night will help ease people's fears of
bats, real and imagined, fueled by blood-sucking Dracula stories
and concerns that the transmit rabies.
	   Advocates say the 31 species of bats in Europe only eat insects,
which people should actually be grateful for.
	   ``People and bats can happily co-exist across the continent,''
said Julia Hamner of Britain's Bat Conservation Trust.
	   Her group is sponsoring a Bat Discovery Evening in London,
allowing visitors to ``enter the secret ultrasonic world of bats
using bat detectors.''
	   The detectors, usually operated by researchers, turns the
inaudible sounds bats make to help themselves navigate into squeaks
people can hear. They'll be used in other countries, too.
	   ``We'll be watching bats at dusk emerging from their day
roosting sites and listening to the sounds they make as they feed
and they hunt,'' said Kate McAney of the Vincent Wildlife Trust in
Ireland. ``We're in a sense eavesdropping on the bats.''
	   In Bulgaria, there is a bat exhibit at the National Museum of
Natural history and a whole ``bat day'' planned in the town of
Burgas. In Latvia, people will visit bat roosts and catch real
bats.
	   But the biggest bat party will be held in Berlin's Spandau
Citadel, a centuries-old stone fortress that really does have bats
in its belfry _ about 10,000.
	   Count Dracula's descendant, Ottomar Rudolphe Vlad Dracula Prince
Kretzulesco, will even leave his wooded castle outside of Berlin to
autograph ``bat adoption certificates'' at the Citadel.
	   ``I'm very excited about bat night,'' said Kretzulesco. ``They
have such a sensitive radar system and are true flight acrobats ...
I've had some here in my castle and it's amazing.''

British Petroleum strikes natural gas in Norwegian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ British Petroleum has made what appears to
be a major natural gas find in the Ormen Lange exploration block in
the Norwegian Sea, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate announced
Friday.
	   BP Development of Norway AS, a division of the British oil
giant, made the strike in a well designated 6305/7-1. The well is
about 120 kilometers (75 miles) off the western Norway port of
Kristiansund in an offshore province called the Moere Basin.
	   ``The well confirms the Petroleum Directorate's assumption that
deepwater areas of the Moere Basin contain large natural gas
reserves and that the area is attractive for future exploration,''
said a directorate news release.
	   Experts estimate that the reservoirs could contain 200-400
billion cubic meters (7-14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas), the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported. That would make the field about
one-third the size of Norway's giant Troll Field.
	   BP and the directorate both said more wells have to be drilled
before the full extent of the find can be determined.
	   The well was drilled to a total depth of 3,351 meters (11,058
feet) by the Ocean Alliance offshore rig, which was operating in
857 meters (2,828 feet) of water.
	   BP, with a 45 percent stake, was exploring the field on behalf
of its partners in the block, the Norwegian state oil company
Statoil, with 30 percent, and AS Norske Shell, with 25 percent.

Germany, France to take `active role' in helping Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with G7 ministers letter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ After days of insisting Russia must solve
its financial crisis itself, Germany changed tack Friday, saying it
would take an ``active role'' with France in offering support to
Moscow.
	   But Finance Minister Theo Waigel stressed direct German aid to
Russia was ``not open to discussion,'' and said ``clear signals''
were still needed from Moscow that they would ``implement reforms
forcefully.''
	   The somewhat more aggressive tone came as the Frankfurt stock
exchange, like others around Europe, continued to slide and
Germany's biggest bank indicated Russia's financial meltdown was
starting to hurt its bottom line.
	   Those reforms are essential before the International Monetary
Fund can release the dlrs 4.3 billion scheduled to be paid to
Russia on Sept. 15, he said.
	   Speaking at his party's convention in Munich, Waigel reiterated
the German government's concern about developments in Russia.
	   But while he and other officials were saying this week that
Russia must help itself out of the mess by pushing through
structural reforms, Friday's talk was more aggressive.
	   ``Germany must in this situation take an active role within the
framework of international cooperation,'' Waigel said.
	   He said he and French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
have agreed to jointly ``turn to the new Russian prime minister,
(Viktor) Chernomyrdin, to offer our support for the reform
process.''
	   He said he and his French counterpart also have agreed to
jointly ``appeal for structural reforms and the implementation of
the (International Monetary Fund) program to restore the confidence
of the financial markets and create the foundations for growth'' in
Russia.
	   The French Foreign Ministry said a letter sent by G7 ministers
to Russia on Friday ``insists on the importance of the Russian
authorities implementing structural reforms so that the economy can
achieve growth again. ...
	   ``It particularly emphasizes the urgent need for fiscal reform
so that the fiscal system is fairer, tax collection improves, as
well as the need to clean up the financial system,'' according to
the statement issued in Paris.
	   In a brief statement, Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG,
said ``most'' of its dlrs 290 million in short-term Russian
Treasury bonds were in the form of GKOs.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday, giving investors two not-very-attractive
options for trading them in at maturity. Analysts say foreign banks
can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   The Deutsche Bank spokesman also said the bank ``will raise its
risk provisions for Russia,'' without specifying by how much.
	   German commercial banks are Russia's biggest private lenders,
with about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans at the end of 1997. Unlike
the bonds, almost 90 percent of them are guaranteed by the German
government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   Deutsche Bank said earlier this week it had set aside 60 cents
on the dollar to cover its unsecured loans to Russia, which total
1.35 billion marks (dlrs 750 million).

Women set to officiate men's first-division league games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For the past week, Sandra Hunt and Nancy Lay
have been hailed in newspapers from Seattle to Miami as
``historic'' and ``pioneers.''
	   Some of the coaches and players who will be the first to have
them as the first female referees in Major League Soccer are a bit
more guarded in what they say _ if they're saying anything at all.
	   ``Our team had nothing say that could be printed outside of
Penthouse Forum,'' one MLS club media director who asked not to be
identified said referring to the sex-oriented magazine.
	   Hunt and Lay will debut in the middle of the field on Saturday:
Lay will referee the New York-New Jersey at Dallas match, with Hunt
overseeing the Kansas City at Chicago game.
	   It's not their first exposure to MLS clubs. Hunt refereed the
Columbus Crew's 3-1 victory over the Miami Fusion in the U.S. Open
Cup quarterfinals on July 22, while Lay did the same for the
second-division Nashville Metros' 3-1 win over Kansas in a
third-round U.S. Open Cup match on July 8.
	   They've worked the MLS sidelines as linesmen, or in the
FIFA-mandated term _ assistant referees, all season, and they've
officiated games for the last two years in the A-League,
essentially the United States' second division.
	   ``Well, they (men) yell at me just like they yell at any other
referee,'' said Lay, an elementary school physical education
teacher from Plantation, Florida.
	   But just how much, and for what reasons, have raised some
concerns among those most affected _ players and coaches.
	   The overwhelming amount of comments have been positive or
noncommittal.
	   ``It is good for the federation, and good for soccer in this
country,'' said the Fire's Polish midfielder Peter Nowak. ``Many
girls play soccer. It is good for their future.''
	   But with the MLS playoffs only a month away, some have
questioned the timing.
	   ``I really have no problem with it, it's a great step for the
league,'' Dallas coach Dave Dir said. ``Unfortunately, my concerns
are that these are big games and this is no time to be
experimenting.''
	   Privately, players and coaches who have been exposed to Hunt and
Lay in game situations have expressed reservations.
	   Women have refereed men's games in the second and third
divisions in Switzerland, Norway, Italy and Sweden. But this is the
first time that FIFA is aware of that women will be in charge of a
men's first-division league game.
	   Canada's Sonia Denoncourt refereed a Sao Paulo state league
championship game in Brazil between Palmeiras and Sao Jose last
year.
	   But considering that the refereeing in MLS has been harshly
criticized the past two seasons, a complaint that has dramatically
subsided this year, some have questioned the decision while others
have suggested it is being done for publicity purposes.
	   ``If we were going to do it for publicity, we would have done it
early in the season,'' MLS vice president of game operations Joe
Machnik said. ``This is not a publicity stunt. Why would we expose
ourselves?
	   ``I didn't expect this much publicity. I didn't realize people
paid that much attention to our referee assignments.''
	   The plans to have a woman referee an MLS match have been brewing
since before the start of the season, when the U.S. Soccer
Federation, in charge of developing and assigning the referees to
games, proposed it.
	   ``The U.S. Soccer Federation probably had an ulterior motive
because the Women's World Cup is coming next year and they'd
probably would like to have one or two ready to be able to referee
that,'' Machnik said.
	   FIFA will select the referees for next summer's World Cup in the
United States, but the USSF has only one woman listed as a FIFA
on-field official, assistant referee Susan Cicchinelli.
	   Herb Silva, the USSF referee department's manager of pro league
assignment and assessment, says the 1999 Women's World Cup is part
of the thinking, but also a normal part of the progression of
referees.
	   ``When we used them at this year's MLS pre-season camp at
Orlando, quality was not an issue,'' Silva said. ``At any point,
had performance not justified their assignments, it wouldn't have
happened.''

Non-Aligned summit, Cold-War era dinosaur, still lumbering along

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Berlin Wall has crumbled.
The Iron Curtain has been ripped away. The Warsaw Pact has not only
dissolved, its former Communist members are joining NATO.
	   So as the Non-Aligned Movement _ created during the Cold War by
developing countries to fend off domination by Washington or Moscow
_ is about to hold its 12th summit, the questions many people are
asking are: Why does the organization still exist? Or why doesn't
it at least change its name?
	   ``Who are they not aligned with anyway?'' asked a caller, Burt
from Cape Town, during a radio talk show on Friday.
	   Often not even with each other.
	   A glance at the list of heads of state and other dignitaries
expected to attend the summit, which opens Saturday in South
Africa's balmy coastal city of Durban, underscores the fractious
nature of the movement which comprises 113 member states and half
the world's population.
	   Representing Congo is President Laurent Kabila. The list also
includes Congo Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha. Only problem is,
Karaha defected this month to rebels calling for Kabila's head and
will surely be a no-show.
	   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos, whose troops are fighting alongside Kabila's,
say they are coming to Durban, as do the leaders of Uganda and
Rwanda, who support the Congolese rebels.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz also planned to attend. The two countries,
which have fought three wars, last May rattled the world by testing
nuclear weapons.
	   It is precisely such a guest list that makes Non-Aligned
Movement summits so worthwhile, because heads of state _ 52 have
confirmed their attendance _ have a chance to thrash out their
problems.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan plans to go and, on the
sidelines, discuss the Congo war and the faltering peace process in
Angola with a variety of leaders.
	   There are expectations that the Indian and Pakistani delegations
will meet to defuse tensions between their two countries.
	   When the summit ends Thursday, there will probably be a
declaration which _ like the one at the last summit three years ago
_ will call for a greater voice for poor countries in the U.N.
Security Council, for relief of overwhelming foreign debt and for
improved trade relationships with the West. All the goals are
important, and difficult to attain.
	   It will be the behind-the-scenes bilateral meetings where events
of real substance are likely to occur.
	   ``The action will be in the corridors, not in the meeting
itself,'' says Prof. Frederick Starr of Johns Hopkins University's
School of Advanced International Studies.
	   Although Starr sees the value of so many leaders getting
together, he is one among many who wonders why the Non-Aligned
Movement still exists.
	   ``In the life of any organization, there reaches a point where
(its members) should declare victory and retire,'' Starr said from
his office in Washington.
	   To be sure, old beefs remain. Diplomat Princeton Lyman _ the
first U.S. official to attend a Non-Aligned Movement summit _ will
get an earful of complaints about Washington's behavior. He is
coming as an observer.
	   Fidel Castro will doubtless denounce the American trade embargo
against Cuba.
	   And Sudan President Omar el-Bashir plans to make an issue of the
Aug. 20 U.S. missile attack on what Washington said was a chemical
weapons plant in Khartoum. Sudan insists it was a pharmaceutical
factory.
	   The summit officially opens on Saturday with lower-level
meetings, but really gets going Wednesday, when heads of state
meet.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After 13 days and seven matches in the tennis
cauldron known as the U.S. Open, who will embrace the women's
singles trophy on Super Saturday?
	   Asked that question, American Lindsay Davenport cradled her face
in her hand, thoughtfully paused, and announced: ``Eight players
could win it and it would not be an upset.''
	   Never has the U.S. Open been so open.
	   A year ago, two teen-agers battled for the women's title at the
U.S. Open, with Switzerland's Martina Hingis dominating American
Venus Williams, a surprising finalist. But the ``Year of the
Teens'' has turned into a showcase for all ages.
	   ``The surprises this year have been coming from the older
players: Nathalie Tauziat, Conchita Martinez,'' said Davenport, who
is ranked No. 2 by the WTA Tour. ``Everything's been out of sync.''
	   Hingis is still No. 1, and Williams has proved that last
September's performance was not a fluke. Her titles include the
crown at the Lipton, a tournament that's just a shade below Grand
Slam status.
	   Serena Williams, Venus' younger sister, has powered her way up
the rankings with victories over several top players; Russia's Anna
Kournikova, at 17, is dangerous, although she's coming off an
injury; and 19-year-old Patty Schnyder of Switzerland has won five
tournaments in 1998.
	   But it was 26-year-old Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain who
captured the French Open, the third of her career, and 29-year-old
Czech Jana Novotna who won Wimbledon.
	   The losing finalists in the year's first three Grand Slam
tournaments also have made more than a couple of circuits around
the WTA Tour: Martinez, 26, at the Australian Open; Yugoslav-born
American Monica Seles, 24, at the French Open; and Frenchwoman
Tauziat, 30, at Wimbledon.
	   In all, eight players who have won Grand Slam tournaments will
be in the 128-player field that begins play Monday, and most are
given a chance to win another trophy at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Hingis may be the defending champ, but she surprisingly isn't
riding the longest winning streak at the National Tennis Center
going into this year's edition. That honor belongs to Germany's
Steffi Graf, who hasn't lost at Flushing Meadows since the 1994
final, when she fell to Sanchez Vicario.
	   Graf has won her last 14 U.S. Open matches and 27 of the last
28, yet she is looking for her first victory on the new stadium
court, which debuted last year.
	   Hingis is riding a seven-game winning streak at the National
Tennis Center, but, unlike a year ago, she hasn't dominated women's
tennis in 1998. She captured her second straight Australian Open
title in January, her fourth Grand Slam tournament crown in five
tournaments, but has not won a tournament since the Italian Open in
early May.
	   Since then, she has lost to Kournikova, Seles, Novotna, France's
Mary Pierce and Davenport. Earlier in the year, Venus Williams also
beat Hingis.
	   ``The competition around her has gotten better,'' Davenport
said. ``Venus is much better. And (Hingis) probably lost a little
intensity.''
	   Seles has two U.S. Open titles on her resume, but the last came
six years ago before a stabbing forced her drop out of tennis at
the height of her career for nearly three years. Still, she reached
the U.S. Open final in 1995 and 1996, and was in the French Open
title match this year.
	   Davenport is still seeking her first major crown, although she
did win the gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics.
	   The 1.89-meter (6-foot-2 1-2) right-hander from Newport Beach,
California, dropped 11 1-2 kilos (25 pounds) and improved her
mobility. She is coming off a successful three-tournament swing and
has pulled close to Hingis in the rankings.
	   ``My serve has improved a lot,'' Davenport said. ``My confidence
is very high. The strength in my legs definitely helped my serve.
Last year I thought I was in good shape. This year I feel even
stronger.''
	   And that means she's a strong contender for the U.S. Open crown.
	   ``If you look at the resumes, every player is kind of measured
by the Grand Slams and if they have ever won a Grand Slam,'' she
said. ``My expectations going in is to win it. I have as good a
shot as anyone.''

For third time, Russian reformer gets the ax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 7-9 with Chubais comments. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ He is often called the architect of Russian
privatization, but Anatoly Chubais has earned another title:
three-time loser.
	   Chubais, one of Russia's leading advocates of market capitalism,
was fired Friday from his latest job, special presidential envoy to
international financial organizations.
	   It was the third time he had been fired by President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   In January 1996, Yeltsin fired the unpopular Chubais as deputy
prime minister. He brought him back into government a few months
later to run his presidential re-election campaign.
	   Yeltsin fired Chubais again last March, then hired him in June
as his envoy to the International Monetary Fund and other
organizations. In that job, Chubais negotiated dlrs 17 billion in
new international loans in a futile attempt to bail out Russian
financial markets.
	   Yeltsin gave no reason for the latest firing, but it was widely
expected in light of the wholesale sacking of the reform-oriented
government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and the devaluation
of the ruble.
	   Chubais, meanwhile, said he always expected his latest
government gig to be temporary, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``I have many times said publicly that I would like to return
full-time to my duties as chairman of Russia's UES (national
electric utility) as soon as the president's specific orders have
been carried out,'' Chubais was quoted as saying.
	   And now, with the dlrs 17 billion in loans negotiated, Chubais
said his task has been accomplished, Interfax reported.
	   Among the other casualties of the government's dismissal was
former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, another leading
reformer who was being touted as a future presidential candidate
less than a year ago.
	   Nemtsov's current job prospects look considerably bleaker,
although he can take heart from Chubais, for whom the revolving
door of government seems to keep on spinning.

In probe of Naples' cardinal, justice system itself under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The loan-shark probe of a Catholic cardinal had
Italy's justice system itself under scrutiny Friday, criticized by
church and government leaders alike after reportedly tapping the
cardinal's calls on church business.
	   After a rare formal complaint from the Vatican, Vice Premier
Walter Veltroni suggested the case of Naples Cardinal Michele
Giordano was part of a broader problem within the nation's justice
system.
	   ``The government cannot feel called to account for a single case
in the justice system,'' Veltroni said. ``But it can be on the
general state of justice.''
	   The case of the popular Naples cardinal has given new ammunition
to enemies of Italy's prosecutors, who toppled hundreds of the
nation's movers and shakers in the ``Clean Hands'' investigations
of the early 1990s.
	   For months, the government has struggled to deal with growing
complaints _ often, from those convicted _ that the prosecutors
have grown overbearing and abusive of power.
	   Veltroni backed a special session of Parliament on justice,
saying that was the best way to look for reforms that would respect
the autonomy of investigators and the rights of citizens.
	   On Saturday, prosecutors sent dozens of police on a
document-hunt in Giordano's church offices.
	   Giordano's brother was arrested Aug. 20 in a massive
loan-sharking scheme. Prosecutors are now investigating whether
money Giordano gave his brother was used in the loan schemes.
	   Thursday, the Vatican summoned Italy's ambassador to outline its
position on the case.
	   While the Vatican said nothing publicly about what was said,
news reports Friday said Vatican Foreign Minister Monsignor Jean
Louis Tauran complained that investigators had violated
long-standing church-state accords.
	   Among the reported Vatican complaints: Investigators had made an
unnecessary spectacle of the search, had failed to inform the
cardinal's superiors beforehand, and had tapped phone conversations
dealing with confidential religious matters and church business.
	   The intercepted calls reportedly included conversations on
nominations for bishops.
	   Giordano, known for his denunciations of usury, has denied
wrongdoing. He says he gave blank checks on his personal funds to
his brother, who was having financial problems.

	   LONDON (AP) _ England's John Crawley hit his third century _ a
career-best 153 not out _ and shared a record 10th wicket stand
with Angus Fraser to put the one-off test beyond Sri Lanka on the
second day at the Oval Friday.
	   England, after being sent into bat, was 435 for nine at tea,
batting for 157 overs in 633 minutes.
	   Crawley, who had replaced an injured Nasser Hussain, took the
opportunity to put his name in the short list for the Ashes tour,
as he anchored a stubborn England resistance against the off spin
of Muttiah Muralitharan.
	   Muralitharan did short work on the England lower order to claim
six wickets before taking some stick during the last wickets stand
that is worth 79 runs in just under an hour.
	   Muralitharan's 15th five-wicket haul in his 42nd test has been
completely overshadowed by two centuries, first by Graeme Hick
(107) and Crawley.
	   The spinner, who had 6-105 when he had Darren Gough caught
behind, conceded 53 runs in the next eight overs as Crawley and
then Fraser, 25 not out, used the long handle.
	   With England scoring its runs at a sedate pace on a sluggish
Oval pitch, Crawley and Fraser hit nine fours and two sixes between
them as they posted a new record for the 10th wicket against Sri
Lanka by any country.
	   The previous record _ 65 runs _ was shared between the Pakistani
pair of Moin Khan and Aamir Nazir at Sialkot, Pakistan in the
1995/96 series.
	   Crawley, 26, has batted for 13 minutes over five hours for his
second century at the Oval. He scored his maiden 106 against
Pakistan here in 1996.
	   He has hit 19 fours and a six off left-arm spinner Sanath
Jayasuriya.
	   England lost three wickets in the post lunch session to
Muralitharan, who switched ends after a five-over break. He had
bowled 16 overs either side of lunch to take 1-39 in his first
spell of the day.
	   England, resuming the day on 228 for four, lost Hick in the
fourth over of the morning, when the experienced medium paceman
Pramodaya Wickramasinghe had the first day's hero caught behind.
	   But Crawley and Ben Hollioake (14) set the order of the day with
a 47-run sixth wicket stand in over 20 overs, before Muralitharan
struck for the first time on the second day.
	   Muralitharan has claimed 6-148 in 59 overs and Wickramasinghe,
2-81 in 30 overs.

Government forces kill more ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb troops killed three members of
an ethnic Albanian family and two others wounded while fleeing
their village in the restive Kosovo province, an Albanian source
said Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center claimed
Serb forces shelled three villages Friday in the vicinity of
Komorane, a crossroad village just 20 kilometers (13 miles) west of
Pristina, the capital of the southern province.
	   The recent battlefield reports were clear signs that the Serbian
offensive against separatist rebels _ and often against their
families _ is not over. Rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army are
fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, whose autonomy was
abolished by then Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1989.
	   Bodies of two ethnic Albanians gunned down four days ago
remained on the road into the villages off Komorane. The fighting
has prevented anyone from approaching them.
	   The center said numerous houses had been burned down in Suva
Reka, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. All roads
leading into the town were sealed by police.
	   Eleven villages north of Suva Reka were completely destroyed,
the center claimed. Its detailed reports could not be independently
verified.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Ramadan Berisha, 60, an
unidentified woman and a child of his family were gunned down
Thursday while fleeing the fighting in their village of Ladrovic
near Malisevoc, 45 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina,
which had come under Serbian fire.
	   The center also reported two elderly refugees and a baby _ only
a few weeks old _ died Thursday of exhaustion in the area of
Malisevo, where civilians fled a total of eight villages in the
latest fighting.
	   Two more ethnic Albanians died Thursday in another Malisevo area
village, Pagarusa. Both had been wounded in the latest fighting.
	   The police killed Thursday two KLA members in Suva Reka, the
center said. They were identified as Naim Berisha, 30, and Xhelal
Kuqi, 30.
	   Police buried four unidentified ethnic Albanians on the
outskirts of Suva Reka on the same day. According to the state-run
Tanjug news agency, police confirmed that two ``terrorists'' were
killed when militants ambushed police in Suva Reka Thursday.
	   The two Kosovo Liberation Army members were said to have been
armed with automatic rifles and had bulletproof vests.
	   But Adem Demaci, a KLA representative, admitted earlier this
week that his rebel force cannot hope for a military victory,
suggesting it would be willing to start talks if government forces
pull out.

Russian uncertainty keeps regional markets reeling

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-7, 9 with closing prices, analyst comments &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Central banks in Romania and Hungary
intervened Friday to prop up their plummeting currencies while
share prices tumbled anew in central Europe due to uncertainty
about Russia's economic crisis.
	   While most former Soviet satellites have cut their economic
dependency on Russia, the possibility of a total collapse there has
foreign investors nervously abandoning their stakes in the region.
	   Despite the panicky reaction, analysts continued to insist the
stronger central European economies could benefit after the initial
battering.
	   ``In the short-term, it's a very volatile market but in the long
run I think Poland will weather this crisis and might come out as a
net winner,'' said Bjork Hupfeld, treasurer at Westdeutsche
Landesbank.
	   Polish shares dropped to their lowest levels in two years, down
9.5 percent in morning trading to 11,767.2 _ the third-largest fall
in the exchange's seven-year history.
	   ``This is lunacy,'' said Jacek Dzierwa, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney in London, who complained investors were following a
``herd mentality'' without properly assessing Poland's ``strong
fundamental situation.''
	   ``We are going to reach the point where common sense is going to
return,'' he said, with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
likely to attract investments that return to the region.
	   The zloty currency fell to its weakest point this year, dipping
below the midpoint of its trading band against five Western
currencies to 3.825 to the U.S. dollar. It closed Thursday at
3.795.
	   In neighboring Hungary, the National Bank intervened for the
second time this week to prevent the forint currency from plunging
too far. Two separate infusions Friday morning followed the
suspension of trading on some shares after the stock exchange
opened 12.4 percent lower than Thursday's closing position.
	   But the exchange recovered some of that loss by the end of day,
closing at 5,167 for a 5.5 percent drop on the day.
	   Romania's Central Bank also stepped in to stabilize the leu,
infusing an estimated dlrs 20 million as the currency slumped as
far as 8.945 to the dollar after closing Thursday at 8.900 to
8.930.
	   Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech Republic's largest savings bank, was
hit hardest by falling share prices there. The bank, believed to
have large investments in Russia, saw its shares fall another 9.35
Friday after trade was suspended Thursday when the price fell more
than 20 percent.
	   Czech traders described selling as heavy and without precedent,
targeting the most popular shares such as CEZ, the country's
largest electricity utility.
	   Russia's financial meltdown has seen the Moscow stock market
virtually evaporate, the ruble plunge so badly that the Central
Bank halted its trade, and the government restructure much of its
debt in a package that would pay some foreign banks as little as 17
cents to the dollar for their investments.
	   While analysts believe investors eventually will realize central
European economies are distinct from Russia and worthy of continued
confidence, they concede further deterioration in Russia would
likely cause more investors to flee the region altogether.

Bjorn leads BMW while Montgomerie misses cut again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Denmark's Thomas Bjorn took a
three-stroke lead at the halfway mark of the BMW International Open
on Friday, while Colin Montgomerie's slump deepened as his missed
his third cut in five tournaments.
	   Bjorn, who led by a stroke after the first round, took advantage
of a sunny windless day to string together six birdies against one
bogey in his round of 5-under-par 67 at the dlrs 1.39 million
event.
	   The Dane finished his two rounds at 13-under 131, while
Germany's Sven Struever was at 134. Bernhard Langer moved to third
with 135, firing a 67 in his bid to win the only title that's
eluded him on German soil.
	   Montgomerie, who topped the European rankings a record fifth
straight year in 1997, struggled with his putting as he finished
with a 3-over-par 75 and 147 for the two rounds.
	   Montgomerie teed off knowing he could miss his second straight
cut after last week's European Open following his opening round 72.
	   But he ran into trouble early with double bogies on the short
fourth and sixth holes. On the front nine he was 4-over-par.
	   ``I had 41 putts today _ and that says it all,'' said the
disappointed Montgomerie, who said he confidence has been shaken by
his recent outings.
	   Montgomerie, the first man worldwide to top dlrs 3 million in
earnings in a single season, has only made two cuts _ finishing
16th and 44th _ in his last five outings.
	   The lone bogey for Bjorn, seeking his third title this year,
came when he needed three putts from inside 10 meters (30 feet) at
the par-4 third hole.
	   ``I didn't play as consistently as yesterday, but all-in-all I
can be satisfied with my round,'' said Bjorn.
	   The 35-year-old Montgomerie started his year in his usual style
with six straight Top 10 finishes and a title at the Volvo PGA
championships. His problems began when he missed the cut at Loch
Lomond in mid-July.

British Petroleum strikes natural gas in Norwegian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ British Petroleum has made what appears to
be a major natural gas find in the Ormen Lange exploration block in
the Norwegian Sea, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate announced
Friday.
	   BP Development of Norway AS, a division of the British oil
giant, made the strike at a well about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
off the western Norwegian port of Kristiansund in an offshore area
called the Moere Basin.
	   ``The well confirms the Petroleum Directorate's assumption that
deepwater areas of the Moere Basin contain large natural gas
reserves and that the area is attractive for future exploration,''
said a directorate news release.
	   Experts estimate that the reservoirs could contain 200-400
billion cubic meters (7-14 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas, the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported. That would make the field about
one-third the size of Norway's giant Troll Field.
	   BP and the directorate both said more wells have to be drilled
before the full extent of the find can be determined.
	   The well was drilled to a total depth of 3,351 meters (11,058
feet) by the Ocean Alliance offshore rig, which was operating in
857 meters (2,828 feet) of water.
	   BP, with a 45 percent stake, was exploring the field on behalf
of its partners in the block, the Norwegian state oil company
Statoil, with 30 percent, and AS Norske Shell, with 25 percent.

London shares plunge in global selloff

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices finished sharply lower at the London Stock
Exchange on Friday, after a recovery from a huge early sell-off
fizzled late in the session.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed with a
loss of 119.1 points, or 2.2 percent, at 5,249.4.
	   The so-called ``footsie'' had been as much as 4.8 percent lower
in the morning, but regained nearly all of that ground ahead of
Friday's opening on Wall Street. London shares, like others around
the globe, were caught in panicky selloffs sparked by Russia's
economic crisis and Thursday's big drop by the Dow Jones industrial
average.
	   The Dow gained some ground early Friday, but it soon moved into
negative territory and London shares retreated again.
	   Preliminary volume came to 868.2 million shares, compared with
838.4 million in Thursday's session.

Gullit suggests no major changes at Newcastle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ The usually flamboyant Ruud Gullit
suggested a careful, go-slow approach Friday in his first full day
as Newcastle's manager.
	   The 35-year-old Dutchman, who replaced Kenny Dalglish in a shock
move Thursday at one of England's biggest clubs, said he will watch
from the grandstand Sunday when the Magpies host Liverpool at St.
James' Park.
	   Gullit, the former Chelsea manager, confessed he's in no
position yet to manage a team that has eked out two draws in its
first two matches.
	   ``It would be difficult for me on Sunday to be on the bench for
my first match,'' he said. ``I want to see what the players'
talents are and what their movements are like.''
	   Gullit indicated there would be no spectacular makeover or
wholesale influx of new foreign players at Newcastle, which was the
hallmark of his 21 months in charge at Chelsea.
	   ``At Chelsea I brought youngsters into the team and I'd like to
do that also at Newcastle,'' he said. ``Maybe you have to take it
one step at a time, and I'd like to do that with this club. After
that, I think there'll be a very good future for this club.''
	   Speculation in the wake of his hiring quickly centered on the
future of several players signed in the off-season by Dalglish _
French World Cup player Stephane Guivarc'h and German Dietmar
Hamann _ and Newcastle's star England striker Alan Shearer.
	   ``The biggest disadvantage I have is I didn't have the
pre-season with them,'' Gullit said. ``So I have to get to know the
boys, how they play and also make a team out of it, then we can see
how good we can play.''
	   Gullit sympathized with Dalglish, who was ousted after 19 months
in the job.
	   ``That is a part of football that I don't like, but you just
have to accept it,'' said Gullit, who is reportedly being paid 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) a year, the top manager's salary
in the Premier League.
	   ``As a player, one day you could be here, one day you could be
there,'' added the former AC Milan star.
	   Gullit refuted suggestions that he was moving to a European
backwater, a small city compared to the more glamorous London where
Chelsea plays.
	   ``If you want to be nasty you can say that,'' he said. ``But
people forget I played in Genoa, when I lived in a small town,
while I also lived in Eindhoven, which was also a small town, and
Rotterdam.''
	   Gullit also denied he had been approached by Tottenham to
replace embattled Swiss coach Christian Gross.
	   ``Tottenham never approached me and all the speculation linking
me with them was a smokescreen,'' he said.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A shadowy portrait of an elderly
man wearing a turban has been confirmed as the work of Rembrandt
and will go on show publicly for the first time at an Amsterdam art
fair.
	   The privately owned painting has been the subject of speculation
since it was first discovered in 1917. An Amsterdam-based research
group has finally confirmed that it is by the Dutch master and not
one of his followers, art fair spokeswoman Cornelie Langhout said
Friday.
	   Langhout said the painting is worth ``millions of dollars'' now
that it has been identified as a Rembrandt. ``But it is not for
sale,'' she added.
	   The 27-by-20-centimeter (11-by-8-inch) oil-on-oak panel
painting, ``Old Man with Turban,'' is signed with the monogram RHL,
used by the young Rembrandt around 1627.
	   The monogram was applied to the painting while it was still wet,
meaning it is almost without doubt by the artist who executed the
work.
	   Art historian Ernst van de Wetering, a member of the Rembrandt
Research Project, led the investigation that settled the question
of who painted the work.
	   ``It is a very skillful painting,'' Van de Wetering told the
Dutch daily Trouw. ``With clever and complicated use of light ... A
magnificent painting.''
	   The Rembrandt Research Project, set up to distinguish real
Rembrandts from works by his students and followers, also analyzed
the wood in the oak panel, the way the paint was applied and
compared the composition with other known works by the Leiden-born
master.
	   The project's team of art historians say many works attributed
to Rembrandt may not be his, since teachers, pupils and imitators
worked in a virtually identical style, using the same materials.
	   Rembrandt van Rijn was born in 1606 in the university city of
Leiden, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Amsterdam. Though a
popular painter and etcher in his lifetime, he died in poverty in
1669 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Amsterdam.
	   The painting will be on show at the Pan Art and Antique Fair in
Amsterdam's RAI congress center from Oct. 11-18.

	   MOSCOW: not run. ''
	   It was the first time Yeltsin had addressed the nation during
the current political and economic crisis and came after days of
feverish speculation that he would resign.
	   Looking calm and relaxed, Yeltsin said he had no intention of
giving up power and was doing everything he could to fix the
economy and restore stability.
	   Yeltsin conducted a series of high-level meetings Friday in an
attempt to show he was still in control in the Kremlin as his aides
and political allies insisted that the president would stay in
office. The president had not been seen in public since Tuesday,
stoking rumors that he was considering stepping down or had been
incapacitated.

Yazdi: Clinton should be tried for missile strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The head of Iran's judiciary, Mohammad
Yazdi, said Friday that U.S. President Clinton should be brought to
trial for ordering missile strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   The hard-line cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, issued the call
during a sermon at Friday prayers at Tehran University in the
Iranian capital.
	   Yazdi described the missile strikes Aug. 20 as ``state
terrorism,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said in a
report monitored in Cairo.
	   Of Clinton, Yazdi said, ``he has acted wrongly and must be
tried,'' the London-headquartered BBC quoted him as saying.
	   ``The world must try him,'' Yazdi was quoted as saying. ``Their
(the Americans') despicable acts need to be put on trial.''
	   He said the U.N. Security Council or the International Court at
The Hague, the Netherlands, would be appropriate trial venues.
	   Both IRNA and the BBC said that the crowd chanted ``Death to
America'' during his remarks.
	   Clinton ordered missile strikes on camps in Afghanistan run by
Islamic militant Osama bin Laden after accusing him of involvement
in the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed more than 250 people.
	   A factory in Sudan also was hit by U.S. missiles. The Americans
said the factory was producing precursors for the deadly VX nerve
gas; the Sudanese say it made pharmaceuticals.
	   Yazdi called the strike on the Sudan factory ``a despicable
act'' because it deprived a poor country of much-needed medicine.
	   ``This bullying and use of force and the attitude of you (the
United States) being the only ones in the world are, in my view,
past their time and are mistaken,'' Yazdi was quoted by the BBC as
saying.
	   He supported the announcement Wednesday by Sudan's attorney
general, Ali al-Zaki, that Sudan is bringing a criminal lawsuit
against the United States for the missile strike and would try
Clinton in absentia, IRNA said.
	   Yazdi is among the staunchest supporters of Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

	   MOSCOW: incapacitated.
	   Throughout the day, Yeltsin's opponents and supporters
horse-traded over terms of a rescue package designed to end the
crisis by curbing some of Russia's free-market reforms.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin accepted a package of
Soviet-era economic measures, which parliamentary leaders proposed
as a condition for confirming his appointment. The leaders called a
special session of the State Duma for Monday to consider the
confirmation.
	   ``We must forget ambitions, we must stabilize the situation and
ease tension that reached a critical point,'' Chernomyrdin told
reporters.
	   But the Kremlin took a tougher line on a proposed power-sharing
agreement that would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet
appointments and government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   In an apparent concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin also fired
prominent reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter
for the third time. Chubais was the government's chief negotiator
with international lenders, obtaining a dlrs 22.6 billion emergency
bailout package that failed to stem the financial crisis. Both men
are hated by the opposition for being the chief proponents of
reform.
	   Russians, who have weathered one government crisis after another
in recent years, were taking the latest one in stride, too.
Although there were lines outside some banks, there was no sign of
food-hoarding or social unease.

	   MOSCOW: social unease.
	   Yeltsin's press service also reiterated Friday that the summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as
scheduled next week. Yeltsin discussed summit plans Friday with
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
	   Parliament's proposals would give lawmakers more say over
Cabinet appointments and government policies. It would also offer
certain guarantees _ such as immunity from prosecution _ if a
president steps down. This provision has fueled speculation that
Yeltsin's resignation was imminent.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced leader
to replace the youthful former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Kiriyenko warned on Friday that Russia is yet to hit the bottom
and a full-blown chaos can't be ruled out. ``I don't want to talk
about it because words have an unpleasant tendency to come true,''
he said ``For Russia it (chaos) would be of an extreme type.''
	   Chernomyrdin's return has failed to calm the markets, which
continue to deteriorate.
	   _ All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday, on
orders from the Central Bank, effectively freezing the market
through the weekend. The Central Bank lowered the official rate
Friday to 7.905, or 12.7 cents, while the street rate remained
below 10 rubles to the dollar.
	   _ The crisis has created a severe shortage of dollars both for
banks and citizens. Banks, which must keep a certain percentage of
their reserves in dollars, are hoarding them, and Russians who want
to buy or withdraw them for safekeeping have been largely out of
luck.
	   _ Russian stocks rebounded Friday from their dramatic fall
earlier in the week, but traders cautioned that the move was
exaggerated by the fact that volume has fallen to a trickle. The
Russian Trading System, Russia's largest stock exchange, was up 5.7
percent at 66.77 points compared to Thursday's close of 63.2
points. Overall volume was less than dlrs 2.2 million, and
participants said the overall mood remained grim.

Panama weighs future of its president, and the canal

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ With memories of dictatorship still fresh,
Panamanians decide this weekend whether to change their
constitution to give President Ernesto Perez Balladares a shot at
re-election.
	   Supporters argue that re-election would assure crucial stability
at one of the most important events of Panama's history: the Dec.
31, 1999, handover of the Panama Canal and U.S. military land.
	   Critics charge it would undermine democracy in a region where
many countries banned re-election to prevent the dictatorships that
plagued them in the past.
	   Panama's constitution now restricts the president to one
five-year term, with re-election possible only if he sits out two
terms.
	   The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, barely three months before the country receives the
canal and prize real estate being turned over by the U.S. military.
	   Perez Balladares' Democratic Revolutionary Party argues there is
a need for political stability during the exchange. The opposition
says it is little more than a power grab.
	   ``The word stability scares me,'' says Roberto Eisenmann, a
prominent Panamanian businessman and government critic. ``It's the
good old word that was used to defend dictatorship. ... And there's
nothing more unstable than perpetual governments.''
	   Just nine years ago, U.S. forces invaded Panama to oust Gen.
Manuel Noriega and end 21 years of military rule.
	   Guillermo Endara _ presumed winner of the May 1989 elections
annulled by Noriega _ took office. After his five-year term, he
handed power to his elected successor, Perez Balladares _ a
sharp-dressed millionaire and free-market economist who was active
in Noriega's political party, known as the PRD.
	   Perez Balladares, called ``Toro'' or ``Bull'' for his burly
frame, opened Panama's markets, privatized the telephone system and
other industries and modernized highways, schools and hospitals.
	   ``Why shouldn't the people have the right to decide whether we
want him or not for five more years?'' says Mario Rognoni, a
businessman and former PRD legislator.
	   Rogoni claimed that opposition parties object to re-election
because they can't take credit for the president's success. ``To
them, a threat to democracy is anything that doesn't put them in
power.''
	   Opponents argue it's time for Toro to leave the ring.
	   More than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below
the poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.
Unemployment is at nearly 12 percent. Industry and agriculture
workers have been left behind by Perez Balladares' emphasis on the
service sector.
	   ``Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor,'' Esther
Garcia said Thursday as thousands of anti-re-election marchers
passed her lottery ticket stand in the capital's center.
	   ``We want liberty: that we can vote for whom we want, not for
whom they force on us,'' she said. ``He's finished. Now go.''
	   Supporters of the president have plastered telephone polls,
trees and buses with their blue ``Si'' posters. Cars with ``Si''
flags fill parking lots outside government buildings.
	   A dlrs 5 million donation by the business community helped fund
the campaign. U.S. Democratic advisor James Carville was hired to
help.
	   Carville's initial strategy to focus on constitutional reform
while ignoring Perez Balladares was too abstract, Rognoni said.
	   But opponents say switching the focus to Perez Balladares has
hurt the PRD, making the proposed reform look like an attempt to
satisfy one man and his friends.
	   The administration has been accused of crowding the Panama Canal
Authority _ which will oversee the waterway _ with cronies and of
improperly allowing two Cabinet members to move into houses vacated
by U.S. officials.
	   Perez Balladares' supporters call the allegations unfounded.
They say referendum opponents themselves are jockeying for deals
bound to come out of the canal exchange, such as commercial
developments.
	   Eisenmann says referendum opponents simply want to keep the
canal above politics.
	   Peru and Argentina recently agreed to let their presidents stand
for re-election. Critics of the idea here say that Panama's system
of political checks and balances is not strong enough to prevent
autocrats from keeping power.
	   The debate would be different if Perez Balladares were asking
the question for a future administration, Eisenmann says.
	   ``That's a philosophical issue. Should we have re-election or
shouldn't we?'' he said. ``But if you say, `No let's change the
constitution to favor a sitting president' _ that's just immoral.''

Europe warns Russia: No more IMF money without reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-Germany-Russia &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ European leaders warned Russia on Friday that it
wouldn't get a second infusion of billions from the International
Monetary Fund unless it follows through on passing major structural
reforms.
	   The dlrs 22 billion Russia in IMF aid Russia just got failed to
prevent this month's financial meltdown. A second installment of
about dlrs 4.3 billion was be paid on Sept. 15.
	   But German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Munich that
``further IMF help can only happen when the reform measures have
been implemented.''
	   Germany, Britain, France and Italy pressed the point in a joint
letter sent Friday to acting Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
	   It stressed the need for Russia to push ahead with tax
collection and budgetary reforms outlined by the IMF if it wants to
regain international support and the confidence of foreign
investors.
	   A statement issued by the French Foreign Ministry in Paris said
the letter ``particularly emphasizes the urgent need for fiscal
reform'' to improve tax collection and ``clean up'' corruption in
the financial system.
	   The somewhat more aggressive tone came as the stock exchanges
around Europe continued to slide and Germany's biggest bank
indicated Russia's financial meltdown was starting to hurt its
bottom line.
	   While Waigel and other officials were saying this week that
Russia must get itself out of the mess, Friday's talk was more
aggressive.
	   ``Germany must in this situation take an active role within the
framework of international cooperation,'' Waigel said at his
party's convention in Munich.
	   But he stressed direct German aid to Russia was ``not open to
discussion,'' and said ``clear signals'' were still needed from
Moscow that they would ``implement reforms forcefully.''
	   He said he and French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
have agreed to jointly turn to Chernomyrdin ``to offer our support
for the reform process.''
	   Meanwhile, Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, said in a
brief statement that ``most'' of its dlrs 290 million in short-term
Russian Treasury bonds were in the form of GKOs _ money that likely
has been lost.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday. Analysts say that essentially means foreign
banks can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   Switzerland's Credit Suisse, which reportedly holds the most
GKOs, announced Wednesday that Russia was mostly to blame for
cutting its first-half net profit by more than a third, to dlrs 500
million.
	   Deutsche Bank also said the bank ``will raise its risk
provisions for Russia,'' without specifying by how much.
	   German commercial banks are Russia's biggest private lenders,
with about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans at the end of 1997. Unlike
the bonds, almost 90 percent of them are guaranteed by the German
government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   Deutsche Bank said earlier this week it had set aside 60 cents
on the dollar to cover its unsecured loans to Russia, which total
1.35 billion marks (dlrs 750 million).
	   The financial crises in Russia and Asia was having some effects
on the currencies of the 11 nations that will launch a single
European currency in January.
	   For the first time in months, a euro-zone central bank was seen
openly intervening to support its currency. Traders in Madrid said
the Bank of Spain was selling German marks.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials was extending its losses
Friday after Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from
Thursday's 357-point plunge and markets skidded in Asia and Europe.
	   The Dow, at one point up as much as 78.53, gave up its gains and
was down 96.96 at 8,069.96 by early afternoon. At its low point of
the morning, the Dow was down 154.47 and threatening to fall below
8,000 for the first time since Jan. 30. Trading was heavy
	   European stocks, which had been rebounding after opening sharply
lower, faltered late in the session. In Asia, some key indexes
plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   The Dow's drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third-biggest
point loss ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27,
1997 and the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage
drop, while the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close
to the record 22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   With the drop Friday, the Dow now is down 1,268 points from its
July 17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 13.6 percent. The
average of 30 big-name stocks, which had been up 18.1 percent for
the year at its peak, now is just 2 percent above where it ended
1997.
	   Thursday's slide marked the first time since last October that
the Dow has finished a day more than 10 percent below its previous
high, a loss commonly referred to as a ``market correction.'' A
sustained drop of 20 percent marks a bear market.
	   The Dow's renewed retreat Friday cut short a midafternoon
attempt at a recovery on big European markets. The damage was not
nearly as bad as it had been early in the morning, however, when
key European indexes were off by around 5 percent.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished
with a loss of 2.2 percent, at 5,249.4. In Frankfurt, Germany, the
electronic Xetra DAX index was off by about 1.7 percent, at
4,925.80, by the end of trading, although officials said it might
take several hours to compute an exact final value after a hectic
session. In Paris, the CAC 40 index lost 1 percent, closing at
3,708.97.
	   ``There is a little bit of panic, but it is not Armageddon,''
said Ian Amstad, an economist at Bankers Trust in London.
	   In Moscow, Russia's largest stock exchange closed up 5.6
percent, which represented a gain of less than 4 points at its
depressed levels. Trading was light.
	   Big Asian markets never saw any chance of recovery.
	   Tokyo blue chips dove to a 12-year low, Hong Kong's key index
fell 1.2 percent despite heavy buying by the government.
	   The panicky selling was set off by Russia's economic troubles.
The Russian government struggled Friday to find a way out of its
mess, while opposition leaders were clamoring for the removal of
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``An awful lot of uncertainties are still out there,'' said
George Hodgson, a European stock strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare
Govett in London.
	   But Hodgson said investors may have been overlooking some
positive factors: Global economic troubles could make lower
interest rates more likely, and some share prices may have plunged
to levels where they had become a bargain.
	   ``It doesn't look particularly good, but I don't think we are
too far away from the bottom in most European share markets,'' said
Gareth Evans, European equities strategist at Nikko Europe.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa used his regularly
scheduled news conference Friday to urge investors to remain calm.
``The most important and basic thing is to not panic,'' he said.
	   But as trading began Friday, Tokyo stocks plunged again, and by
the end of the day they had fallen to their lowest level in 12
years.
	   Japan's Nikkei stock index closed at 13,915.63 points, down
498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, from Thursday. It was the Nikkei's
lowest level since March 1986.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index closed down 93.23 points, or
1.2 percent lower, at 7,829.74. Volume reached an all-time high of
dlrs 10.1 billion, and traders estimated that government buying
accounted for more than 80 percent of the activity.
	   The government announced in the afternoon that Hong Kong has
fallen into recession, with its once-booming economy shrinking by 5
percent in the second quarter. Hong Kong officials said the economy
is expected to shrink by 4 percent this fiscal year.
	   The Russian turmoil has added to a year's worth of worries over
Asia's financial crisis. As many countries, including Japan, have
edged toward or fallen into recession, profits at a wide range of
European and U.S. companies have suffered.
	   ``I think that something terrible is happening, and my job is
going to be affected,'' said Toshio Tadokoro, a 56-year-old travel
agent, as he stared up at a big screen that showed the plunging
Nikkei stock prices in Tokyo's main railway station.

New Italian coach names roster for match against Wales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's newly-appointed coach Dino Zoff on Friday
named five stellar forwards, including World Cup striker Christian
Vieri and the imnaginative duo of Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del
Piero, in the roster for the European qualifying match against
Wales.
	   The Sept. 5 match at Liverpool will mark Zoff's debut on Italy's
bench as substitute of Cesare Maldini who was fired following the
elimination of the ``Azzurri'' (Blue Team) in the quarterfinals at
France '98.
	   Fourteen players out of 22 called by Zoff were in Maldini's
roster at the World Cup.
	   Saying he had no time for making experiments, but still
surprising soccer experts, Zoff dropped from his list Inter Milan
goalie Gianluca Pagliuca and AC Milan veteran defender Alessandro
Costacurta and called newcomers Jonathan Bachini and Giuliano
Giannichedda of Udinese and defender Michele Serena of Atletico
Madrid.
	   Chelsea's midfielders Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Di Matteo were
immediately ignored by Zoff, a national team past goalie and a
former coach of Juventus and Lazio.
	   Rejoining the Italian squad following a long absence were Real
Madrid's defender Christian Panucci and Inter's sweeper Salvatore
Fresi.
	   Pagliuca, Italy's No.1 goalkeeper in the World Cup, was left
home to make room for Juventus Angelo Peruzzi, who could no go to
France as a result of a pulled muscle.
	   AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini, Italy's captain and the son of
the past coach, was not called as he's nursing a strain suffered in
an exhibition match a few days ago.
	   The list of forwards included Filippo Inzaghi, a teammate of Del
Piero at Juventus and one of Italy's highest scoring
centerforwards, and Enrico Chiesa of Parma.
	   The upcoming Wales-Italy match is a first-leg of the five-team
Group One, which qualifies the group winner for the 2000 finals of
the European Championships.
	   Other teams in Group One are Denmark, Switzerland and Belarus.
	   Italy's roster (clubs in parentheses):
	   Goalies - Angelo Peruzzi (Juventus); Gianluigi Buffon (Parma).
	   Defenders - Fabio Cannavaro (Parma); Salvatore Fresi (Inter);
Mark Iuliano and Gianluca Pessotto (Juventus); Paolo Negro (Lazio);
Christian Panucci (Real Madrid); Michele Serena (Atletico Madrid);
Moreno Torricelli (Fiorentina).
	   Midfielders - Demetrio Albertini (AC Milan); Dino Baggio
(Parma); Jonathan Bachini and Giuliano Giannichedda (Udinese);
Luigi Di Biagio and Eusebio Di Francesco (Roma); Diego Fuser
(Parma).
	   Forwards - Roberto Baggio (Inter); Enrico Chiesa (Parma);
Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi (Juventus); Christian
Vieri (Atletico Madrid).

 &UR; Probe into Planet Hollwood bombing suffers setback &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Friday began hunting
anew for the bombers of the Planet Hollywood restaurant, saying
they would release a South African Muslim who had been detained
because of lack of evidence.
	   After more than 24 hours of interrogation, police said they
failed to turn up anything to link the man to the blast on Tuesday
evening that killed one person and injured 27 others.
	   ``Our investigations have been completed on the allegations that
were made and we have decided to release him,'' said police
spokesman Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg.
	   Two women arrested with the man at Cape Town's airport on
Thursday were released earlier Friday after charges that they had
incorrect travel documents for their flight to Egypt were dropped.
There have been no other arrests.
	   All three, who been arrested after an anonymous tip-off, are
members of a Muslim-dominated vigilante group, People Against
Gangsterism and Drugs, which police suspect is behind a wave of
bombings against drug dealers in the city's sprawling slums.
	   American FBI agents are assisting in the investigation into the
bombing, which South African officials have linked to last week's
U.S. missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan
	   Police, meanwhile, were bracing for a demonstration against
those attacks planned for Saturday by a small anti-American,
anti-Israeli group, Moslems Against Global Oppression.
	   The group planned to march past the U.S. consulate to protest
the American cruise missile attacks against terrorist targets in
Sudan and Afghanistan.
	   Sterrenberg said police would be ready.
	   ``I don't want to give details, but we will put out sufficient
numbers to
	   deal with the protest,'' he said.
	   American consular officials said their office was always closed
on weekends and that they would leave any special security measures
to local police.
	   About 80 PAGAD supporters protested Thursday night outside the
Cape Town home of Justice Minister Dullah Omar. Shouting slogans
accusing the police of
	   carrying out a witch-hunt against Muslims, the protesters later
peacefully dispersed.
	   The only claim of responsibility for the bombing has come from a
caller to a radio station who said he represented Muslims Against
Global Oppression. The group later denied being behind the attack.
	   On Friday, the organization held a prayer meeting for victims of
the blast.

Spanish Flu research team takes samples from 80-year-old mass

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Experts recovered tissue samples from six
corpses buried in an Arctic cemetery 80 years ago that could help
identify one of the deadliest viruses ever known, the team's leader
said Friday.
	   However, the bodies were badly decomposed, a major setback for
the four-nation team.
	   If the bodies, all young coal minors who died in the epidemic,
had been buried in the permafrost of Norway's remove Svalbard
Archipelago, the frozen tissue would have provided preserved
samples. Instead, the coffins were found under just 30 centimeters
(12 inches) of soil, far above the permafrost and no longer in
tact.
	   The 1918-19 Spanish Flu, as it was called, killed to 20-40
million people worldwide, and scientists are still not sure what
virus caused the epidemic.
	   Team leader Kirsty Duncan, a 31-year-old medical geographer from
Canada, said finding any tissue samples was a triumph that could
help build a genetic profile of the virus. That would let
scientists develop vaccines and test medicines.
	   ``We were thrilled,'' she said by telephone from Longyearbyen,
the main town on Svalbard Islands, just 950 kilometers (600 miles)
from the North Pole. ``One of the pathologists told me there is
enough material to keep them busy for years.''
	   However, earlier in the week, Tom Bergan, a Norwegian physician
on the team, expressed doubts that much information could be
obtained from the remains, which were mostly bone. The team had
hoped for lung samples.
	   Even though the graves were marked with each miner's name, the
team continued digging after the first coffins were found in search
of a second layer of bodies in the permafrost.
	   However, on Friday _ 10 days after the exhumation began _ Duncan
said the first remains found now appear to be those of the 18- to
29-year-old miners.
	   ``These were all healthy young men, which increases the
likelihood that these were the miners,'' said Duncan. She said a
newspaper scrap dated 1917 was found in one coffin, confirming the
time frame.
	   Duncan, a professor at the universities of Windsor and Toronto,
said the team late Thursday finished taking samples from six of the
seven bodies. One coffin was left untouched, because his relatives
opposed the exhumation.
	   The team from Canada, Britain, the United States and Norway
planned to complete digging into the permafrost over the next few
days, and then restore the graves.
	   The Spanish Flu was first reported at what is now Ft. Riley,
Kansas, in late 1917 or early 1918. It spread to Europe with
American troops sent to fight in World War I and became a global
epidemic. Victims suffered sudden fever, chills, headache, muscle
pain, pneumonia and rapid death.

	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ They're the streetcars named desirable _
again.
	   While tourists and residents alike ooh and ahh over the city's
famous cable cars, the clickety-clack of a rival has proven popular
on the streets of San Francisco.
	   Vintage trolleys _ once close to extinction _ are a
transportation workhorse slowly making a comeback here and around
the United States.
	   Electric trolleys were introduced in the late 1800s and signaled
a new mobility for working-class people formerly confined to their
neighborhoods. By 1917, there were nearly 45,000 miles (72,000
kilometers) of tracks across the United States.
	   San Francisco's 17 cars were designed in the 1930s at the
request of presidents of electric car companies in the United
States and Canada who wanted standardized, improved, streamlined
street cars.
	   That's what they got _ cars that were among the sturdiest and
most reliable transit vehicles ever made.
	   Then, with the advent of gasoline-powered buses and underground
subways, most North American cities gradually dropped trolleys.
They still operate in Boston, Newark, New Jersey and Toronto.
	   But only in New Orleans and San Francisco are the trolleys _
usually called streetcars by city natives _ a major transportation
force.
	   ``There's a real tradition of rail transit here,'' said Dave
Pharr, a trolley car fan. ``Almost everybody who was born and
raised here rode to school or rode to work on a street car or a
cable car and maybe still does.''
	   For San Francisco, embracing vintage trolleys has also proven to
be smart public policy. The city recently imported nine street cars
from Italy for about dlrs 32,000 each; a new car costs more than
dlrs 2 million.
	   Fans hope the classic trolleys become as popular with tourists
as the cable cars, the Golden Gate Bridge and the city's fog.

	    &UR; __
	   9. Dave Pharr believes that

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's military, short of
officers and soldiers to fight separatist Tamil Tiger guerrillas,
commissioned a new officer training college Friday with British
help.
	   The Army Command and Staff College will have a British officer
on its staff to advise on the 10-month training course, the
military said.
	   The new college in Colombo will train 27 officers at any one
time. It was started because the military's practice of sending
officers abroad for training did not meet its requirements. Most
were sent to Britain, the United States, India and Pakistan.
	   Britain has often sold weapons to the Sri Lankan military, and
former members of Britain's elite Special Air Service commandos
have been involved in training officers.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the 14-year-old war
between government troops and Tamil separatists. The rebels say
they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who
dominate the government and military.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police Friday retrieved bones
of 10 Serb civilians, two of them children, whom officials said
were executed by Albanian rebels in a mountaintop stronghold
overrun by government forces.
	   Meanwhile, an Albanian source said government troops killed
three members of a Kosovo Albanian family and wounded two others
Thursday as they fled fighting southwest of this provincial
capital.
	   The reports underscored the brutality of a conflict which
American and European diplomacy has been powerless to stop.
	   The conflict escalated last February when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a campaign against the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence of the majority
Albanian province. Both sides have accused the other of kidnapping
and killing civilians.
	   On Friday, the Serbian Media Center said police on Thursday
overran a KLA stronghold in Klecka, a mountain village near the
main road crossing the province, about 75 kilometers (50 miles)
southwest of Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   Serb authorities took reporters Friday to Klecka. There they
watched as police and civilian volunteers, wearing plastic gloves,
picked through bones of five men, three women and two children
killed a month ago. Serb officials said the KLA killed them.
	   A young man in handcuffs told reporters through an interpreter
that he ``shot a fat guy'' but gave no explanation why the captives
were slain.
	   U.S. diplomats have been trying to set up face-to-face talks
between the Albanians and the Serb-run government to determine the
future of the province. The Americans and Europeans want Milosevic
to restore the autonomy he withdrew in 1989.
	   But the KLA and most Albanians want full independence for
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Despite numerous international calls for a cease-fire, fighting
continues. The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center claimed Serb
forces shelled three villages Friday near Komorane, a crossroad
village 20 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Bodies of two ethnic Albanians gunned down four days ago
remained lying on the road leading into these villages off
Komorane. The fighting has prevented anyone from approaching them.
	   The center said numerous houses had been burned down in Suva
Reka, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. All roads
leading into the town were sealed by police.
	   Eleven villages north of Suva Reka were completely destroyed,
the center claimed. Its detailed reports could not be independently
verified.
	   The Albanian center said Ramadan Berisha, 60, an unidentified
woman and a child of his family were gunned down Thursday while
fleeing the fighting in their village of Ladrovic near Malisevoc,
45 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The center also reported two elderly refugees and a baby _ only
a few weeks old _ died Thursday of exhaustion in the area of
Malisevo, where civilians fled a total of eight villages in the
latest fighting.

Libya says UN resolution threatens a Lockerbie settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASPER MORTIMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ By threatening new strictures against Libya,
the U.N. Security Council resolution on the Lockerbie suspects
could jeopardize their standing trial in the Netherlands, the Libya
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   In a long statement read on Libya state television, the ministry
urged talks ``as soon as possible'' on bringing the men to trial
but raised a number of criticisms of the Security Council
resolution on bringing the men to justice.
	   It repeated Libya's acceptance of a trial in the Netherlands but
complained of the ``conditions and threats'' that accompanied the
resolution adopted Thursday night.
	   The council voted unanimously to suspend sanctions against Libya
once it turns over two men charged with the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   The resolution warned Libya that the council would ``consider
additional measures if the two accused have not arrived or appeared
for trial promptly.''
	   Council diplomats did not say what the additional measures might
entail, but previously U.S. lawmakers have proposed an oil embargo
on Libya. The current sanctions ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   In a broadcast monitored in Cairo, Libyan television quoted the
Foreign Ministry as saying: ``The threat of tightening the
sanctions and applying more pressure to Libya ... is nothing more
than a scheme to abort this solution and to find an excuse to
escalate the sanctions on Libya and its people.''
	   The ministry also objected to the resolution's offer to suspend
the embargo only when the suspects are handed over.
	   It said the sanctions ``should be lifted as soon as an agreement
is signed between Libya and the countries concerned on the
arrangements and guarantees for the suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands.''
	   The ministry statement noted Libya ``considers itself not
obligated'' to negotiations between the United States, Britain and
the Netherlands which formed the basis of the British-American
offer for a trial in a third country. Britain and the United States
have said this was a non-negotiable offer.
	   But the Libyan statement said it has the right to demand any
explanations about ``the security and safety of its citizens,''
meaning the two suspects.
	   In an interview Thursday on CNN, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
also said he was suspicious that the United States and Britain, the
prime movers behind the Lockerbie resolutions, would play
``tricks'' as soon as the accused were handed over.
	   The ministry also criticized the council's call for Libya to
renounce terrorism as required in the resolutions that established
the sanctions in 1992.
	   The request was ``unjustified ... because it ignores Libya's
condemnation of terrorism,'' the ministry said.
	   The ministry said nothing stood in the way of lifting sanctions
in the past except turning over the two suspects, adding this was
not done only because of ``the United States' and the United
Kingdom's procrastination.''
	   Until this latest offer, Washington and London had insisted any
trial be held in the United States or Britain.
	   Libya said it was ``surprised'' by the resolution's calling on
Libya to cooperate with the French investigation into the bombing
of UTA Flight 772, which exploded over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989,
killing all 170 passengers and crew.
	   ``This cooperation was granted in 1996 and the French
(investigating) judge declared this in a letter to the Security
Council's members on Nov. 6, 1997,'' the ministry said.

Kurdish party members charged for waving banner of outlawed group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Prosecutors have charged four members of
the Kurdish People's Democracy Party with aiding a terrorist group,
Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported Friday.
	   The four were charged for waving a banner of the outlawed
Kurdish rebel group PKK during a party congress earlier this month.
They could face up to 7 1/2 years in prison.
	   The PKK, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast, is
considered a terrorist organization by Turkish authorities.
	   Turkey frequently comes under criticism for its human rights
record, especially over its treatment of Kurds and Kurdish
political groups.
	   In June, an appeals court upheld a 22-year sentence for another
People's Democracy member, who was convicted of treason for
lowering a Turkish flag and replacing it with a PKK banner.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin vehemently denied
Friday that he would resign and promised to serve out the rest of

Iran seeks Pakistan's help to get diplomats freed from Taliban
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Iran warned Friday of a
``humanitarian disaster'' in Afghanistan if 11 of its diplomats
allegedly kidnapped by Afghanistan's Taliban army were not released
quickly.
	   While Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsin Aminzadeh stopped
short of threatening military action, he told reporters that Tehran
was looking at all its options.
	   He also told reporters at a news conference that some of the
options open to Iran could result in the loss of lives of Afghans
living in areas of northern Afghanistan newly captured by the
Taliban and where the diplomats are believed to be held.
	   ``Our government is seriously concerned about the safety of
diplomats and other Iranians in Taliban's custody. If it (this
crisis) does not end quickly, it could result in some humanitarian
disaster in Afghanistan,'' he said.
	   The Taliban militia denies that its fighters arrested Iranian
diplomats when they captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif
earlier this month. However the Taliban said they arrested several
Iranian truck drivers they said were supplying weapons to its
opponents.
	   ``There is no doubt that our diplomats were in the consulate
when the Taliban entered its premises. . . Iranian government
reserves the right to take any step for the safety of its people,''
he said.
	   He said at present direct contacts with the Taliban would be
futile because of their stand that diplomats were not in their
custody. There would be other opportunities to talk when this
crisis is over, he said.
	   The Taliban has accused Iran of supporting a northern- based
opposition, led by former president Burhanuddin Rabbani and his
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood.
	   The opposition also represents Afghanistan's minority Shiite
Muslims and most Iranians also are Shiite Muslims. Most Afghans,
however, belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Aminzadeh said there were more than 78 Iranians captured by
Taliban including truck drivers, who brought humanitarian relief
goods, traders and technicians working with the consulate.
	   The Taliban, which rules most of Afghanistan including the
capital Kabul, in a recent string of victories threw out the
opposition northern alliance from a number of key towns and
districts.
	   Aminzadeh, who earlier met Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and key foreign ministry officials, said the purpose of his visit
was to discuss Afghanistan and seek Pakistan's help in getting its
nationals released.
	   Pakistan is one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban
government and is accused of supplying arms and ammunition to the
religious militia.
	   ``We requested Pakistan to help with their release because it is
closest to the Taliban than any other institution or country,''
said Aminzadeh.
	   A statement by Pakistan government said Sharif expressed deep
concern about the ``missing Iranian personnel'' and assured the
visiting envoy that Islamabad would continue to extend its fullest
cooperation to locate them.
	   Aminzadeh said Sharif promised to help. But he said Iran was
also trying to seek the diplomats' release through international
organizations.
	   Aminzadeh said Iran's cultural and political relations with both
Pakistan and Afghanistan spans decades.

Right-wing conspiracy alleged in deportation of Bengali-speaking
</HEADLINE>
Muslims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A Hindu right-wing government in one of
India's largest states is forcefully deporting Indian Muslims by
declaring them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, a human rights
group said Friday.
	   ``They (Bengali-speaking Muslims) are the main victims of a
larger right-wing communal conspiracy ...,'' the Committee for
Protection of Democratic Rights and Ekta (Unity) said in a report
released Friday.
	   Tens of thousands of poor Bangladeshis sneak across the densely
forested border between the two nations each year looking for jobs
in India.
	   The Hindu nationalist alliance of the Shiv Sena and the
Bharatiya Janata Party that governs the western state of
Maharashtra says nearly 42,000 migrants from Bangladesh live and
work in Bombay.
	   The Maharashtra government and police have said the deportations
were part of the state's policy to evict illegal migrants unable to
prove their citizenship.
	   Irfan Engineer, a lawyer with Ekta, said those people arrested
were not given time to prove their identities and places of birth.
	   ``The police have become emboldened with the Sena-BJP government
in charge. They challenge every document...even Indian passports
are rejected as fake,'' said Engineer.
	   While the report acknowledged the presence of illegal
Bangladeshi immigrants in Bombay, it said a larger number of Indian
Muslims were being deported than actual Bangladeshi immigrants.
	   ``The police have the frame of mind that a Bengali-speaking
Muslim is a Bangladeshi. A Muslim has to prove that he is Indian, a
Hindu does not by the fact of his name,'' Engineer said.

UEFA finalizes bid to head off threat of breakaway Super League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner in
grafs 6-10
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ As directors of Europe's biggest clubs swirled
around Monte Carlo's famous casino after the Champions League draw,
UEFA was finalizing plans Friday to dissuade them from making the
gamble of their soccer lives: joining the proposed breakaway Super
League.
	   UEFA's governing Executive Committee will meet here Saturday,
and is expected to make changes to its main club competitions to
avert an unprecedented split in European soccer.
	   With big clubs in negotiations with Milan-based media rights
company Media Partners about forming a breakaway league, UEFA has
never faced such a threat to its pan-European governance since its
formation in 1954.
	   In its attempts to keep top clubs in line, UEFA has used the
stick, the carrot and the carrot-shaped stick.
	   ``There are mixed signals coming from UEFA,'' said David Brooks,
chief soccer analyst at securities house Nomura International, in
London. ``On the one hand it seems that it wants nothing to do with
Media Partners, but at other times its tone is much more
conciliatory.''
	   UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner sharply criticized Media
Partners after Thursday's draw, claiming that the company ``seem to
have discovered new laws within the football market.''
	   In seeking to win over the media, ``false facts about UEFA and
its partners have deliberately been spread,'' he said.
	   Aigner insisted that competitions should continue to be played
under the auspices of UEFA.
	   Media Partners, he said, puts economics ahead of sporting
principles and brings a philosophy that is established in the
United States but is not necessarily appropriate to Europe.
	   ``More matches on television does not necessarily mean more
attention,'' he said.

Europe warns Russia: No more IMF money without reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl comments; tightens &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ European leaders warned Russia on Friday that it
wouldn't get a second infusion of billions from the International
Monetary Fund unless it follows through on passing major structural
reforms.
	   But with Russia's monetary crisis showing no signs of easing,
Europe also began to show signs of willingness to get involved,
although without promising financial aid.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he's participating in
intensive diplomatic talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, French
President Jacques Chirac, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   In an interview to appear in Saturday's edition of the Berliner
Zeitung newspaper, Kohl stressed it's in Germany's and Europe's
best interests that ``our most powerful neighbor in the East
doesn't slip into a hopeless situation.''
	   Russia has already received dlrs 22 billion Russia in IMF aid,
and a second installment of about dlrs 4.3 billion was be paid on
Sept. 15.
	   But German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said ``further IMF help
can only happen when the reform measures have been implemented.''
	   Germany, Britain, France and Italy pressed the point in a joint
letter sent Friday to Chernomyrdin.
	   It stressed the need for Russia to push ahead with tax
collection and budgetary reforms outlined by the IMF and ``clean
up'' corruption if it wants to regain international support and the
confidence of foreign investors.
	   The more aggressive tone came as the stock exchanges around
Europe continued to slide and Germany's biggest bank indicated
Russia's financial meltdown would hurt its bottom line.
	   While European officials were insisting this week that Russia
must get itself out of the mess, Friday's talk was more activist.
	   ``Germany must in this situation take an active role within the
framework of international cooperation,'' Waigel said at his
party's convention in Munich.
	   But he stressed direct German aid to Russia was ``not open to
discussion,'' and said ``clear signals'' were still needed from
Moscow that they would ``implement reforms forcefully.''
	   Meanwhile, Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, said in a
brief statement that ``most'' of its dlrs 290 million in short-term
Russian Treasury bonds were in the form of GKOs _ money that likely
has been lost.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday. Analysts say that essentially means foreign
banks can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   Switzerland's Credit Suisse, which reportedly holds the most
GKOs of any foreign bank, announced Wednesday that Russia was
mostly to blame for cutting its first-half net profit by more than
a third, to dlrs 500 million.
	   Deutsche Bank also said the bank ``will raise its risk
provisions for Russia,'' without specifying by how much.
	   German commercial banks are Russia's biggest private lenders,
with about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans at the end of 1997. Unlike
the bonds, almost 90 percent of those credits are guaranteed by the
German government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   Deutsche Bank said earlier this week it had set aside 60 cents
on the dollar to cover its unsecured loans to Russia, which total
1.35 billion marks (dlrs 750 million).
	   The financial crises in Russia and Asia were having some effects
on the currencies of the 11 nations that will launch a single
European currency in January.
	   For the first time in months, a euro-zone central bank was seen
openly intervening to support its currency. Traders in Madrid said
the Bank of Spain was selling German marks.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin vehemently denied
Friday that he would resign and promised to serve out the rest of
his term as president _ until new elections in 2000.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to

New Italian coach names roster for match against Wales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ New Italian national team coach Dino Zoff selected
five big-name forwards Friday for the Azzurri's first European
qualifying match against Wales, including World Cup striker
Christian Vieri, Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero.
	   The Sept. 5 match at Liverpool will mark Zoff's debut on Italy's
bench since replacing Cesare Maldini, who was fired following the
quarterfinal elimination at France 98.
	   Fourteen players of the 22 players called by Zoff were among
Maldini's roster at the World Cup.
	   Saying he had no time for experiments, but still surprising
soccer experts, Zoff dropped Inter Milan goalkeeper Gianluca
Pagliuca and veteran AC Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta. Those
getting their first call were Jonathan Bachini and Giuliano
Giannichedda of Udinese and defender Michele Serena of Atletico
Madrid.
	   Chelsea's midfielders Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Di Matteo were
immediately ignored by Zoff, a former national team goalkeeper and
a former coach of Juventus and Lazio.
	   Rejoining the Italian squad following a long absence were Real
Madrid defender Christian Panucci and Inter sweeper Salvatore
Fresi.
	   Pagliuca, Italy's starting goalkeeper an the World Cup, was left
home to make room for Juventus' Angelo Peruzzi, who stayed home
from France as because of injury.
	   AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini, Italy's captain and the son of
the former coach, was not called due to a strain suffered in an
exhibition match a few days ago.
	   The list of forwards included Filippo Inzaghi, a teammate of Del
Piero at Juventus and one of Italy's highest scoring
centerforwards, and Enrico Chiesa of Parma.
	   The upcoming Wales-Italy match is a first match of the five-team
Group One, which qualifies the its winner for the 2000 finals in
Belgium and the Netherlands.
	   Other teams in Group One are Denmark, Switzerland and Belarus.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Roster &QC; 
	   Goalkeepers: Angelo Peruzzi (Juventus); Gianluigi Buffon
(Parma).
	   Defenders - Fabio Cannavaro (Parma); Salvatore Fresi (Inter);
Mark Iuliano and Gianluca Pessotto (Juventus); Paolo Negro (Lazio);
Christian Panucci (Real Madrid); Michele Serena (Atletico Madrid);
Moreno Torricelli (Fiorentina).
	   Midfielders: Demetrio Albertini (AC Milan); Dino Baggio (Parma);
Jonathan Bachini and Giuliano Giannichedda (Udinese); Luigi Di
Biagio and Eusebio Di Francesco (Roma); Diego Fuser (Parma).
	   Forwards: Roberto Baggio (Inter); Enrico Chiesa (Parma);

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu took over the
command of the Turkish armed forces on Friday, vowing to intensify
the military's fight against radical Islam.
	   ``The Turkish Armed Forces should be more powerful and vigilant
than ever against problems such as radical Islam,'' he said at the
ceremony in which he replaced Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi as the
chief of general staff.
	   ``It is our first duty, as a nation, to be vigilant against
those who want to bring Sharia (Islamic laws) and darken the future
of our country,'' Kivrikoglu, 64, said.
	   The army plays a powerful role in this predominantly Muslim
society and has staged coups three times since 1960.
	   ``It is the apple of our eye,'' said President Demirel, calling
the military the ``cement binding Turkish unity.''
	   Demirel awarded the departing chief of staff, Karadayi, the
country's top medal for ``preserving the unity and welfare of the
Turkish Republic.''
	   Under Karadayi, the military forced Islamic Premier Necmettin
Erbakan into resigning last year. His party was later banned for
anti-secular activities.

Korean-American pastor released by North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from daughter in Torrance, California,
Lee's hometown  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Korean-American pastor held on spy
charges in North Korea since May was released Friday at the request
of the U.S. government, North Korea's media said.
	   Lee Kwang-dok, 73, a Christian minister from Lomita, a suburb of
Los Angeles, was expelled from North Korea after he paid an
unspecified fine, the North's Korean Central News Agency said.
	   Lee was arrested May 27, a week after he entered North Korea to
visit relatives. He was charged with spying for South Korea while
posing as a businessman promoting a joint venture project, the
report said.
	   ``He was caught red-handed while committing such crimes as
alluring citizens of the DPRK (North Korea) into South Korea,
spying on the actual conditions of the DPRK and distributing
anti-DPRK propaganda materials,'' the agency said.
	   Instead of trying him in court, the North Korean government
decided to expel him at the request of Washington, the agency
report said.
	   There was no immediate South Korean comment on Lee's release.
	   The Korean Central News Agency did not say how much Lee was
fined, but South Korean news reports, quoting Lee's family in Los
Angeles, earlier said it was more than dlrs 100,000.
	   His daughter, Jenny Lee of the suburb of Torrance, said Friday
that in negotiations the payment was reduced to expenses incurred
by the North Koreans in holding him, but she declined to give the
amount.
	   ``We're thrilled, and we are tired,'' she said of family members
in the Los Angeles area waiting since Monday to hear that he had
crossed into China.
	   ``There were three attempts to cross, and some problems with
paperwork. With help from the U.S. State Department, and the
Chinese and North Koreans, he finally called us last night to say
he was in China,'' Jenny Lee said.
	   ``A Swedish diplomat who visited him reported (recently) that he
was well treated, getting three excellent meals a day at a resort
hotel, with regular exercise. He sounded really healthy when we
finally talked to him last night.''
	   Lee's release reportedly was arranged at a high-level meeting
between U.S. and North Korean representatives in New York last
week. The United States and North Korea have no diplomatic
relations but the two countries have unofficial channels of
government contact.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They are technically still at war,
having never signed a peace treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean War.

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - France's Felicia Ballanger won her
fourth consecutive women's individual sprint title Friday at the
World Cycling Championship defeating Australia's Michelle Ferris.
	   Ballanger won the best-of three final in two races in a repeat
of the 1997 final and the 1996 Olympic final.
	   Canada's Tanya Dubnicoff won the bronze over American Jennie
Reed.
	   It was Ballanger's seventh world title since 1995. She has also
won three straight 500-meter time trials and looks for another on
Saturday where she is heavily favored.

London shares plunge in global selloff

 &UR; EDs: LEADS with closing values &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices finished sharply lower at the London Stock
Exchange on Friday, after a recovery from a huge early sell-off
fizzled late in the session.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed with a
loss of 119.1 points, or 2.2 percent, at 5,249.4.
	   The so-called ``footsie'' had been as much as 4.8 percent lower
in the morning, but regained nearly all of that ground ahead of
Friday's opening on Wall Street. London shares, like others around
the globe, were caught in panicky selloffs sparked by Russia's
economic crisis and Thursday's big drop by the Dow Jones industrial
average.
	   The Dow gained some ground early Friday, but it soon moved into
negative territory and London shares retreated again.
	   Preliminary volume came to 868.2 million shares, compared with
838.4 million in Thursday's session.

Libya says UN resolution threatens a Lockerbie settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES Libya's version of the delay graf 16 &QL; 
 &UR; By JASPER MORTIMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ By threatening new strictures against Libya,
the U.N. Security Council resolution on the Lockerbie suspects
could jeopardize their standing trial in the Netherlands, the Libya
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   In a long statement read on Libya state television, the ministry
urged talks ``as soon as possible'' on bringing the men to trial
but raised a number of criticisms of the Security Council
resolution on bringing the men to justice.
	   It repeated Libya's acceptance of a trial in the Netherlands but
complained of the ``conditions and threats'' that accompanied the
resolution adopted Thursday night.
	   The council voted unanimously to suspend sanctions against Libya
once it turns over two men charged with the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   The resolution warned Libya that the council would ``consider
additional measures if the two accused have not arrived or appeared
for trial promptly.''
	   Council diplomats did not say what the additional measures might
entail, but previously U.S. lawmakers have proposed an oil embargo
on Libya. The current sanctions ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   In a broadcast monitored in Cairo, Libyan television quoted the
Foreign Ministry as saying: ``The threat of tightening the
sanctions and applying more pressure to Libya ... is nothing more
than a scheme to abort this solution and to find an excuse to
escalate the sanctions on Libya and its people.''
	   The ministry also objected to the resolution's offer to suspend
the embargo only when the suspects are handed over.
	   It said the sanctions ``should be lifted as soon as an agreement
is signed between Libya and the countries concerned on the
arrangements and guarantees for the suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands.''
	   The ministry statement noted Libya ``considers itself not
obligated'' to negotiations between the United States, Britain and
the Netherlands which formed the basis of the British-American
offer for a trial in a third country. Britain and the United States
have said this was a non-negotiable offer.
	   But the Libyan statement said it has the right to demand any
explanations about ``the security and safety of its citizens,''
meaning the two suspects.
	   In an interview Thursday on CNN, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
also said he was suspicious that the United States and Britain, the
prime movers behind the Lockerbie resolutions, would play
``tricks'' as soon as the accused were handed over.
	   The ministry also criticized the council's call for Libya to
renounce terrorism as required in the resolutions that established
the sanctions in 1992.
	   The request was ``unjustified ... because it ignores Libya's
condemnation of terrorism,'' the ministry said.
	   The ministry said nothing stood in the way of lifting sanctions
in the past except agreement on a venue for the trial, adding this
did not happen only because of ``the United States' and the United
Kingdom's procrastination.''

Europe warns Russia: No more IMF money without reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional Kohl comment; trims &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ European leaders warned Russia on Friday that it
wouldn't get a second infusion of billions from the International
Monetary Fund unless it follows through on passing major structural
reforms.
	   ``We can only help when we know that there's a very clear
program with a promising objective,'' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said in a newspaper interview.
	   Kohl said he's participating in intensive diplomatic talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his acting prime minister,
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   In an interview to appear in Saturday's edition of the Berliner
Zeitung, Kohl stressed it's in Germany's and Europe's best
interests that ``our most powerful neighbor in the East doesn't
slip into a hopeless situation.''
	   But there were no promises of a financial bailout.
	   Russia has already received dlrs 22 billion Russia in IMF aid,
and a second installment of about dlrs 4.3 billion was to be paid
on Sept. 15.
	   But German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said ``further IMF help
can only happen when the reform measures have been implemented.''
He also stressed direct German aid to Russia was ``not open to
discussion.''
	   Germany, Britain, France and Italy pressed the need for reforms
in a joint letter sent Friday to Chernomyrdin.
	   It stressed the need for Russia to push ahead with tax
collection and budgetary reforms outlined by the IMF and ``clean
up'' corruption if it wants to regain international support and the
confidence of foreign investors.
	   The more aggressive tone came as the stock exchanges around
Europe continued to slide and Germany's biggest bank indicated
Russia's financial meltdown would hurt its bottom line.
	   Deutsche Bank AG said in a brief statement that ``most'' of its
dlrs 290 million in short-term Russian Treasury bonds were in the
form of GKOs _ money that likely has been lost.
	   Moscow announced a dlrs 40 billion restructuring program for
those bonds Tuesday. Analysts say that essentially means foreign
banks can expect as little as 17 cents on the dollar for their
investment.
	   Switzerland's Credit Suisse, which reportedly holds the most
GKOs of any foreign bank, announced Wednesday that Russia was
mostly to blame for cutting its first-half net profit by more than
a third, to dlrs 500 million.
	   Deutsche Bank also said the bank ``will raise its risk
provisions for Russia,'' without specifying by how much.
	   German commercial banks are Russia's biggest private lenders,
with about dlrs 30.5 billion in loans at the end of 1997. Unlike
the bonds, almost 90 percent of those credits are guaranteed by the
German government's Hermes export-credit program.
	   Deutsche Bank said earlier this week it had set aside 60 cents
on the dollar to cover its unsecured loans to Russia, which total
1.35 billion marks (dlrs 750 million).
	   The financial crises in Russia and Asia were having some effects
on the currencies of the 11 nations that will launch a single
European currency in January.
	   For the first time in months, a euro-zone central bank was seen
openly intervening to support its currency. Traders in Madrid said
the Bank of Spain was selling German marks.

Poland looking to lease U.S. jet fighters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland hinted heavily Friday it will lease
or buy about a dozen U.S. fighter planes to bring its air force up
to NATO standards.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Romuald Szeremietiew stopped short of
saying a decision had been made, but he pointed out that leasing
would cost less in the short run and that the U.S. lease offer was
the most concrete.
	   The decision depends on ``what is needed and what we can
afford,'' Szeremietiew told a news conference after meeting with a
U.S. delegation of government and military officials.
	   He called leasing the planes a temporary measure to boost
Poland's combat-readiness, as required for its integration into the
NATO alliance in April.
	   Leasing was more likely because it was cheaper, he said, but
buying might make more economic sense in the long run.
	   Szeremietiew said there were several offers to lease planes, but
the U.S. proposal was the most solid. He said a decision was
expected soon.
	   Poland was interested in 10-15 planes, said Szeremietiew, who
refused to provide any figures for how much it could spend.
	   A tender process open to all bidders, according to Polish law,
would open if the government decides to buy the planes, he said.
	   Poland and two other former Soviet satellites _ Hungary and the
Czech Republic _ will join NATO next year to form a new eastern
front for the Western military alliance.
	   Along with strengthening its air force and other reforms for
joining NATO, Poland must improve English-language training for the
its military and upgrade communications equipment in order to
further military contact with other NATO forces.
	   Szeremietiew announced Friday that Poland would borrow dlrs 100
million from the United States to purchase new communications
equipment.

Publisher says new newspaper will be out soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The publisher of Puerto Rico's
second-largest newspaper, El Vocero, said Friday a new newspaper
originally planned to debut last year will now be on newstands
within weeks.
	   Gaspar Roca, president of Caribbean International News Inc., the
owner of El Vocero, also announced that Luis Davila Colon, the
editor of the yet-to-emerge El Mundo, is stepping down and will be
replaced by journalist and lawyer Carlos M. Morales.
	   Davila, who has worked for 16 months organizing El Mundo and
helping with a redesign of El Vocero, said he will continue to
contribute to the newspapers as a consultant and columnist.
	   Last year, all three daily newspapers in San Juan announced
plans to produce second editions.
	   El Nuevo Dia, the largest newspaper on the island, launched a
five-day daily called Primera Hora, which offers shorter stories
and more color and graphics. The only English-language daily, The
San Juan Star, began a Spanish-language version.

	   LORDSTOWN, Ohio (AP) _ A tentative labor agreement has been
reached at an automotive parts plant here, averting a strike that
could have interrupted production of seats used in two General
Motors Corp. car lines.
	   Hours before a strike deadline, Lear Corp. and the union
representing 320 workers reached a tentative three-year agreement.
The Lear plant in Lordstown makes seats for Chevrolet Cavaliers and
Pontiac Sunfires.
	   Details of the three-year deal, reached Thursday night, were not
immediately released. The key issue in the talks was pay. A
ratification vote was scheduled for Sunday.
	   A walkout could have quickly affected an adjacent General Motors
assembly plant, which doesn't store many parts. The assembly plant
employs more than 6,000 workers.
	   United Auto Workers Local 1112 Vice President Darwin Cooper said
the agreement provides a raise above the roughly dlrs 10 an hour
workers now earn at Lear.

Tired of running from war, Serbs leave for America
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VELIKA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The women sit red-eyed and
silent, while the men toast each other with pungent home-brew. The
guns have started up again _ time for yet another goodbye for a
family on the run from war since 1995.
	   But this time, the man with the pinched cheeks and his teary
wife hardly heed the crack of rifleshots in the nearby forest as
they try to cope with a far greater concern.
	   ``What's life like in America?' asks Dusan Milosevljevic, brows
furrowed in trepidation as the hours tick down toward the start of
a trip that will take him first to New York on Wednesday, then to
Tampa, Florida.
	   The final destination is north of Tampa to New Port Richey,
where lines of strip malls and fast-food joints front one of the
busiest highways on the Gulf Coast. A life free of war to be sure,
but also far, far different from the dusty Kosovo village where he
now lives, or anything else he's ever known.
	   Given his preference, Milosevljevic wouldn't even be in Kosovo,
let alone on his way to small-town America.
	   The Serb electrician was born in Pakrac, Croatia, a town where
neighbors got along, no matter what their nationality. He married a
local girl. They had their first of two sons. Life was predictable.
	   Then came 1991 and Croatia's Serbs rebelled _ bloodshed, ethnic
hatreds, the end of coexistence, the start of semi-captivity in a
Serb enclave, with hostile Croats nearby. Four years later came
Croatian retribution.
	   Within days of the Croat counterattack in May 1995, the Serb
pseudo-state was destroyed and the Milosevljevics were fleeing on
the back of a truck, sharing the fate of tens of thousands of other
Serbs. Nomadic existence followed. Temporary stays in the Serb part
of Bosnia. Months in a refugee camp near Smederevo, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Belgrade.
	   Desperate for a life, the Milosevljevics shrugged off
Serb-Albanian tensions in Kosovo when offered a free home there in
January 1966. They moved into a roadside settlement southwest of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, modest condos built specifically for
Serb refugees from Croatia.
	   ``When we got here, we breathed freely,'' said Vukica
Milosevljevic, stroking son Goran's head. ``My husband found work.
My kids went to school. We were not close to the Albanians in the
next village. But at least we weren't fighting.
	   ``Then came the first shots this year, and we knew we wouldn't
stay.''
	   Neighbors crowd the weedy patch of dust serving as someone's
front yard to say goodbye on the Milosevljevics' last day in Kosovo
before a trip to relatives elsewhere in Serbia and then the final
flight.
	   Some of the neighbors plan to stay. But most say they'll go to
America, Australia, anywhere that will take them. Twelve families
already have left this year, and dozens more are awaiting visas.
	   U.N. figures document an increase in departures of refugees from
Croatia who are now in Yugoslavia, most of them Serbs who fled the
Croatian army onslaught. A total of 1,069 were resettled in the
first seven months of this year, already slightly more than in all
of 1997.
	   Veton Orana, who works in Pristina for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, says visa applications from Serb
refugees from Croatia are being processed first.
	   ``They're afraid. They don't want to face another war,'' Orana
says. ``They say everything that is happening here is a replay of
what they've already fled from.''
	   Back in Velika Reka, the Milosevljevics invoke the fate of two
families who left for Florida last year. One works as a chef, the
other a waiter, and their letters are reassuring.
	   ``They make a good living _ and no one asks them if they're
Serb, Albanians or anything else,'' says the man about to change
lives.
	   Asked about his feelings during his last hours here, he shrugs:
``Happy, sad, frightened. All I want is peace.''
	   Ten-year-old Goran is less anxious.
	   ``I want to become American,'' he says. ``In Florida, there is
always sunshine. And no war.''

Sri Lanka reply boldly to England's slow batting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya hammered a rapid
half century to put to disgrace England's obdurate first innings
batting in the one-off test at the Oval Friday.
	   In reply to England's 445 all out in over 10 and a half hours,
Sri Lanka, scored 79 for one in 91 minutes at stumps on the second
day with Jayasuriya contributing 59 of them off 71 balls.
	   Sri Lanka raced the 50 off 70 balls, before medium paceman
Dominic Cork trapped opener Marvan Atapattu (15) leg before wicket
with the total on 53.
	   Jayasuriya, an explosive batsman, better know for his hurricane
hitting in one-day cricket, smashed nine boundaries as he raced to
his 15th half century off just 58 balls.
	   No.3 Mahela Jayawardene, who came in at Atapattu's fall scored
four in 34 minutes.
	   Sri Lanka's first task in hand will be to score 246 runs to
avoid the ignominy of following on.
	   England, built its innings around two centuries _ Graeme Hick's
107 and a career-best 153 not out by John Crawley, after being sent
in by the Sri Lankans.
	   Crawley, followed Hick's first day example with a tenacious
innings, his third test century in his 26th appearance for England.
	   Playing his first test of the summer since being dropped after
the winter tour of the West Indies early this year, Crawley, took
the opportunity to give the selectors a timely reminder before the
forthcoming Ashes tour of Australia.
	   Crawley's second day batting upstaged an outstanding spell of
off spin bowling by Muttiah Muralitharan, who claimed 7-155 in a
marathon 59.3 overs.
	   Having taken 6-105, he took some stick during a record 10th
wicket stand between Crawley and Angus Fraser, before bowling the
England No.11 to end the frustrating innings.
	   His effort Friday took his year's tally to 59 wickets in eight
matches, only behind South Africa's Allan Donald, who has 66
wickets.
	   Crawley, who had replaced an injured Nasser Hussain, took the
opportunity to put his name in the short list for the Ashes tour,
as he anchored a stubborn England resistance against the off spin
of Muttiah Muralitharan.
	   Muralitharan did a short work on the England lower order to
claim six wickets before taking some stick during the last wickets
stand that is worth 79 runs in just under an hour.
	   Muralitharan's 15th five-wicket haul in his 42nd test kept a
tight rein on the England innings.
	   The stand between Crawley and Fraser (32) _ 89 runs in 59
minutes _ eclipsed the previous 65-run stand between the Pakistani
pair of Moin Khan and Aamir Nazir at Sialkot, Pakistan in the
1995/96 series.
	   Crawley, 26, batted for 18 minutes over five hours hitting 19
boundaries and an enormous six off Jayasuriya.
	   He featured in partnerships of 47 with Ben Hollioake and 56
alongside Cork (6), but reserved the best for last with Fraser as
his unlikely partner.
	   Crawley was joined by Fraser at 356 for nine and by the time
they finished, England had posted its highest total against Sri
Lanka in six tests.
	   England resuming the day on 228 for four, lost Hick in the
fourth over of the morning, when the experienced medium paceman
Pramodaya Wickramasinghe had the first day's hero caught behind.
	   But Crawley and Hollioake (14) set the order of the day with a
47-run sixth wicket stand in over 20 overs, before Muralitharan
struck for the first time on the second day.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Erwin
Arrieta says that he sees world oil prices remaining low, but
gradually rising over the next three to five years.
	   In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires after arriving in
Mexico City late Thursday , Arrieta said that recent agreements
among petroleum producing nations to lower oil output had also
reduced volatility in oil prices.
	   Arrieta was to meet Friday with Mexican Energy Minister Luis
Tellez and other government officials.
	   ``My estimate is that we are faced with a market in a band of
low prices, rising gradually for three to five years,'' Arrieta
said.
	   Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia reached the agreements on oil
output in March and June in an attempt to reduce global supply in
the face of falling world oil prices.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World Champion Marion Jones led from
start to finish in her 100-meters showdown with French star
Christine Arron.
	   Jones ran 10.80 seconds to put Arron firmly in second place in
the Van Damme Memorial Grand Prix event.
	   Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones dominance of the
100 meters after she ran a blistering 10.73 to win the European
Championship last week.
	   But the American dominated Friday's race, holding off a mid-race
challenge from Arron and extending her lead in the final meters.
	   There was more than pride in stake. The win keeps Jones in the
running for a share of the in the dlrs 1 million Golden League
prize.
	   Bryan Bronson also stayed in contention for a slice of the big
prize with a 48.25 second win in the 400-meters hurdles, although
the American had a scare as he eased up in the final stretch and
was almost caught by Russia's Ruslan Mashenko.
	   The million dollar prize will be shared by athletes who win
their events in seven selected Grand Prix meets to be concluded
next week in Berlin and Moscow.
	   In the women's 100 meters hurdles, Nigeria's Glory Alozie
continued a fine season with a win in 12.44 that equaled her own
African record.
	   Later Friday, Kenyan Paul Tergat in the 10,000 meters and his
countryman Daniel Komen in the 5,000 meters will seek to reclaim
the world records they set in the Brussels meet last year.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola will also attempt to break the world
record in the rarely run 1,000 meters.

Libya says UN resolution threatens a Lockerbie settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASPER MORTIMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ By threatening new strictures against Libya,
the U.N. Security Council resolution on the Lockerbie suspects
could jeopardize their standing trial in the Netherlands, Libya's
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   The council voted unanimously to suspend sanctions against Libya
once it turns over two men charged with the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   But it also warned Libya that it would ``consider additional
measures if the two accused have not arrived or appeared for trial
promptly.''
	   In a long statement read Friday on Libyan state television, the
ministry urged talks ``as soon as possible'' on trying the men but
raised a number of criticisms of the U.N. resolution on bringing
the men to justice.
	   In a broadcast monitored in Cairo, Libyan television quoted the
Foreign Ministry as saying: ``The threat of tightening the
sanctions and applying more pressure to Libya ... is nothing more
than a scheme to abort this solution and to find an excuse to
escalate the sanctions on Libya and its people.''
	   Council diplomats did not say what the additional measures might
entail, but previously U.S. lawmakers have proposed an oil embargo
on Libya. The current sanctions ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   It repeated Libya's acceptance of a trial in the Netherlands but
complained of the ``conditions and threats'' that accompanied the
Thursday resolution.
	   The ministry also objected to the resolution's offer to suspend
the embargo only when the suspects are handed over.
	   It said the sanctions ``should be lifted as soon as an agreement
is signed between Libya and the countries concerned on the
arrangements and guarantees for the suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands.''
	   In a Thursday interview with the U.S. television network CNN,
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also said he was suspicious that the
United States and Britain, the prime movers behind the Lockerbie
resolutions, would play ``tricks'' as soon as the accused were
handed over.
	   The ministry said nothing stood in the way of lifting sanctions
in the past except agreement on a venue for the trial, adding this
did not happen only because of ``the United States' and the United
Kingdom's procrastination.''
	   Until this latest offer, Washington and London had insisted any
trial be held in the United States or Britain.
	   The ministry also criticized the council's call for Libya to
renounce terrorism as required in the resolutions that established
the sanctions in 1992.
	   The request was ``unjustified ... because it ignores Libya's
condemnation of terrorism,'' the ministry said.
	   Libya said it was ``surprised'' by the resolution's calling on
Libya to cooperate with the French investigation into the bombing
of UTA Flight 772, which exploded over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989,
killing all 170 passengers and crew.
	   ``This cooperation was granted in 1996 and the French
(investigating) judge declared this in a letter to the Security
Council's members on Nov. 6, 1997,'' the ministry said.

Bjorn leads BMW while Montgomerie misses cut again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, other leaders, tightens up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Denmark's Thomas Bjorn Friday grabbed a
three-stroke lead at the BMW International Open's halfway mark
while slumping Colin Montgomerie missed his third cut in five
tournaments.
	   Bjorn fired a 5-under-par 67 on a sunny windless day at the dlrs
1.39 million event, collecting six birdies against a bogey. He
finished at 13-under 131 after an opening day 64.
	   Germany's Sven Struever followed at 134 after a 71, while
Bernhard Langer moved to third at 135 by firing a 67 as he kept his
hopes alive of winning the only title to elude him on German soil.
	   Montgomerie, coming off a record fifth straight year atop the
European rankings, struggled with his putting as he missed the cut
by five strokes with a 3-over-par 75 and 147 total.
	   The Scotsman's bid to survive into the third round, after an
early exit at last week's European Open, ran into trouble early. He
opened with a bogey, then was hit by double bogies on the sixth
hole and short fourth.
	   ``I had 41 putts today _ and that says it all,'' said the
disappointed Montgomerie.
	   Montgomerie, the first player to top dlrs 3 million in earnings
worldwide in a single season, is in one of his worst career slumps.
He finished 16th and 44th in the only two cuts he's survived during
his last five outings.
	   The lone bogey of Bjorn, a 25-year-old enjoying his best year,
came when three-putted from inside 10 meters (30 feet) at the par-4
third hole.
	   ``I didn't play as consistently as yesterday, but all-in-all I
can be satisfied with my round,'' said Bjorn.
	   Montgomerie, 35, started his year in his usual style with six
straight Top 10 finishes and a title at the Volvo PGA Championship.
His problems began when he missed the cut at Loch Lomond in
mid-July.
	   Spain's Jose-Maria Olazabal shot the day's best round of 6-under
66, finishing five back at 136, along with Germany's Thomas
Goegele.
	   With Langer, Struever and Goegele, three Germans were among the
top four places.
	   ``Wow, I don't think that's ever happened. That's good for the
tournament,'' said Langer, who celebrated his 41st birthday
Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Volleys of gunfire and artillery rounds
tore through eastern Kinshasa on Friday, triggering an exodus of
people in search of safety.
	   From the airport, the boom of mortar and artillery shells
landing could be heard about 7 kilometers (4 miles) away, toward
the city.
	   In downtown Kinshasa, thousands of other people cheered and
shouted, believing Congo's civil war was over _ a false rumor that
exploded into crackling celebratory gunfire.
	   ``Vigilance against the enemy continues,'' Justice Minister
Mwenze Kongolo said. ``This war is not over.''
	   About 17 kilometers (10 miles) away in the eastern suburb of
Kingasani, explosions rocked a crowded neighborhood after soldiers
opened fire on a helicopter buzzing overhead, witnesses said.
	   Several people on the ground were killed and many more were
wounded, a Health Ministry official said.
	   Early reports were contradictory, with some witnesses saying a
rebel helicopter had been shot down and crashed. Others said rebel
rockets fired at the helicopter had gone astray and exploded on the
ground.
	   ``The body of the helicopter was still burning on the ground,''
said Bernard Makenga a Congolese journalist who said he saw the
helicopter crash. ``People were crying and screaming.''
	   It was not clear how many people were killed, though Makenga
said he saw many bodies. The conflicting reports could not be
immediately reconciled, but dozens of people confirmed the
overflight and explosions.
	   Ready to seize on a glimmer of hope that Congo's conflict was
over, central Kinshasa erupted into celebration when rumors spread
about the war's end.
	   Gunfire rattled between buildings as soldiers fired into the
air. Just one day earlier, angry soldiers had roamed Kinshasa's
streets, hunting down rebel suspects and brutally killing them.
	   The discarded bodies of 18 men, some charred and disfigured,
could be seen on city streets and back alleys.
	   Rebels from a coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disenchanted members of Kabila's army in recent days slipped into
the capital and tried to take the airport.
	   While the situation in that fighting remains unclear, the
government and allied Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops
firmly controlled the airport Friday. The government says more than
1,000 prisoners have been captured.
	   Journalists were flown to the airport Friday, where nine
captives paraded out. All but one said they were from Rwanda.
	   Kabila maintains Rwanda and Uganda are behind the more than
three-week-old rebellion, but both countries deny that.
	   The government, meanwhile, urged soldiers who had joined the
rebels to return.
	   ``We launch a patriotic appeal to you Congolese soldiers
involved in this Rwandan adventure against our country to drop your
arms immediately,'' said Joseph Kabila, the president's son and new
chief of the military.
	   Speaking on state-controlled radio, he called on the public not
to attack Congolese soldiers trying to surrender. He said nothing
of ethnic Tutsi rebel fighters.
	   The insurgents had scored repeated military successes early in
the rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern Congo and
launching an airlift across the country to drive toward Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of foreign troops in recent days has
apparently turned the tide in the southwest.
	   A respected Zimbabwean business newspaper reported Friday that
some 2,000 Zimbabwean troop reinforcements have been airlifted to
Congo, bringing the total Zimbabwean force to 2,800.
	   Along with the armored cars, vehicles and attack helicopters
that Zimbabwe has shipped, the costs of their involvement was
estimated by the Zimbabwe Independent at more than dlrs 100,000 a
day _ a huge figure in a country enduring economic turmoil.
	   Rwanda and Uganda turned on Kabila _ whom they helped to oust
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko just a little over a
year ago _ because of his inability to stem cross-border rebel
attacks.
	   Contradicting earlier Ugandan contentions that it was not
involved in the Congolese war, an Ugandan presidential defense
adviser reportedly said Ugandan forces are being attacked by
Congolese, Zimbabwean and Angolan forces.
	   Maj.-Gen Salim Saleh told New Vision newspaper that the fighting
would continue in Congo if Kabila continues to oppose peace
proposals spearheaded by South Africa.
	   Mediation efforts by the Southern African Development Community
have been put on hold until a Non-Aligned Movement summit starts in
South Africa on Saturday, South African officials said.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World champion Marion Jones led from
the start to win her 100-meter showdown with French star Christine
Arron on Friday, crossing the line in 10.80 seconds at the Van
Damme Memorial Grand Prix.
	   Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones' dominance in the
100 after she ran a 10.73 to win the European Championship title
last week.
	   But the American dominated Friday's race, holding off a
challenge from Arron at about 50 meters and extending her lead
approaching the finish.
	   There was more than pride in stake. The victory keeps Jones in
the running for a share of the in the dlrs 1 million Golden League
prize.
	   Bryan Bronson also stayed in contention for a slice of the big
prize with a 48.25-second victory in the 400-meter hurdles,
although the American had a scare as he eased up in the final
stretch and was almost caught by Russia's Ruslan Mashenko.
	   The million-dollar prize will be shared by athletes who win
their events in all seven selected Grand Prix meets to be concluded
next week in Berlin and Moscow.
	   In the women's 100-meter hurdles, Nigeria's Glory Alozie
continued a fine season with a victory in 12.44 that equaled her
own African record.
	   Later Friday, Kenyan Paul Tergat in the 10,000 meters and his
countryman Daniel Komen in the 5,000 meters were to try to reclaim
the world records they set in the Brussels meet last year.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola also was to attempt to break the world
record in the rarely run 1,000 meters.

Yeltsin says he will not step down, Kremlin takes tough line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin vehemently denied Friday that he
will resign as the government rallied support to show the president
was still in charge and would not bow to opposition demands to step
down or share power.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my Constitutional
term,'' he said in an interview on national television. ``In 2000
there will be an election for a new president and I will not run.''
	   Yeltsin's emphatic denial came after days of feverish
speculation that the president was about to resign or be ousted. He
had not been seen in public since Tuesday, prompting reports that
he had already stepped down.
	   The presidential administration appeared to be regaining
confidence Friday after several days of disarray brought on by an
economic crisis that has seen the Russian currency plummet and
stock markets collapse.
	   Presidential aides took the political offensive, saying Yeltsin
would not surrender or dilute his authority in a power-sharing
agreement with the hard-line opposition.
	   Russians, who have weathered one crisis after another in recent
years, were taking the latest one in stride, too. Short lines
formed outside some banks as people tried to change rubles for
dollars, but there was no sign of panic.
	   All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday.
Russian stocks actually rose by 5.7 percent, but trading was very
light and dealers warned that the rise did not signal a market
recovery.
	   Looking calm and speaking easily, Yeltsin said on national
television that he was working to restore stability and he believed
things could be fixed. He acknowledged the crisis, especially the
devaluation of the ruble, would mean more hard times for his people
after years of privation.
	   ``It would be naive to say that we'll take some steps and people
won't suffer,'' he said. ``However as president, I must say that
we'll take every measure to ensure that people don't lose their
savings. I cannot promise that prices won't go up, but as president
I am obligated to do everything to keep it to a minimum.''
	   Earlier, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin negotiated
with the Communist-dominated Duma, the lower chamber of Parliament,
seeking support for his confirmation, which is to be debated
Monday.
	   Chernomyrdin agreed in the talks to Soviet-style measures to
boost state control of the economy as part of efforts to stabilize
the economy, according to some Russian news reports. Measures
included price and currency controls and printing money to reflate
the economy, they said.
	   ``The overriding goal is to stop the fall of the ruble, not to
allow the destruction of the economy and reduce the damage
sustained by every Russian,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   But the Kremlin appeared to back away from political compromise,
taking a tough line against a separate power-sharing agreement that
would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet appointments and
government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Friday that the talks
on the agreement were stalled. He indicated that parliament's lower
house, the State Duma would not approve Chernomyrdin and proposed
alternative candidates for prime minister, including Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov, upper house speaker Yegor Stroyev and Yuri Maslyukov,
a former senior Soviet official.
	   Luzhkov and Stroyev are not Communists and Zyuganov's proposal
indicated the opposition may be looking for a compromise.
	   Reacting swiftly, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with Stroyev and
Luzhkov, who later said they would not be candidates. ``All of us
have our own ambitions, but when national interests are on the
agenda we will work together and consolidate our efforts,'' said
Luzhkov, already a top presidential prospect for the 2000
elections.
	   Under the Constitution, the Duma must approve the prime
minister. If it rejects a candidate three times, Yeltsin can
dissolve the Duma and call parliamentary elections.
	   Communists and their allies have twice blocked Yeltsin's
nomination of then acting prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko in April
before approving him on the third vote. Yeltsin can nominate
another candidate or re-submit Chernomyrdin's name if the Duma
votes against him.
	   A Duma vote against Chernomyrdin would delay efforts to halt the
economic slide and increase political tension. A battle between
Yeltsin and the Duma over confirming a prime minister could last
weeks, leaving the government and the country in limbo.
	   The financial crisis began in early summer as tremors from
Asia's economic turmoil reached Moscow and a decline in oil prices
_ Russia's top export _ derailed a vital economic reforms and sent
the economy crashing.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move on Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced leader
to replace the youthful Kiriyenko and contain the crisis.
	   In a concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin fired prominent
reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter for the
third time. Both men are hated by the opposition for being the
chief proponents of reform.
	   Yeltsin's press service reiterated that the summit with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as scheduled next
week.
	   In another bid to show the government was not losing its grip,
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, a Yeltsin loyalist who commands
the police, said authorities would make every effort to stop unfair
price increases.
	   ``The situation is under control,'' he said.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, a top future candidate for
president, said there still was a chance of widespread unrest ``in
a worst case scenario.'' He called for radical measures, such as
tax reform and land sales, to restore economic stability and get
reforms going again.

Italian stocks rebound from opening slump, but end lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian stocks rebounded from an initial
slump of 6.2 percent but still ended lower Friday, reflecting
investor fears about Russia's growing economic and political
turmoil.
	   The Mibtel index of the Milan stock market, Italy's largest,
ended at 21,430, a 2.59 percent loss from the previous day.
	   Stock prices had plummeted 4.4 percent on Thursday.
	   Milan analysts warned investors about selloffs.
	   ``We have been advising our clients against selling now,
otherwise, the current financial storm may sweep them away. But
many have ignored our suggestion,'' said Massimo Sala, a stock
dealer with a major Italian bank.
	   In Rome, Premier Romano Prodi's office responded to the Russian
crisis with a statement noting the ``strong standing'' of Italy and
other European countries that are joining in a common currency. The
euro is set to debut in January.
	   Prodi emphasized the need for ``a strong coordination on an
international scale for overcoming the moment of tension on the
financial markets and for guaranteeing in the best way the prospect
of growth.''
	   Meanwhile, the Italian Foreign Exchange Office reported Italy's
balance of payments in July swung to a deficit of 6.8 trillion lire
(dlrs 3.7 billion) from a surplus of 12.1 trillion lire (dlrs 6.7
billion) a year earlier.

Le Pen vows to hold onto reins of far-right National Front
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULON, France (AP) _ A defiant Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the
far-right National Front, gave a rare public thrashing Friday to
his ambitious number two man, and vowed to lead the party at least
through presidential elections in 2002.
	   ``There is only one `number one' in the National Front,'' the
fiery Le Pen told party faithful gathering in this south eastern
French town for a five-day conference.
	   Le Pen, 69, was clearly angry at his deputy, Bruno Megret, who
earlier in the week publicly contested Le Pen's plan to make his
wife a candidate for 1999 European Parliament elections if current
legal troubles make Le Pen himself ineligible.
	   Megret had told French media that he should be the party's
candidate, if Le Pen is banned from running.
	   In his speech Friday, Le Pen never once named Megret, but
pointedly referred to his actions.
	   ``You've been able to see right here how the slightest
discussion, the slightest dispute is interpreted to our
detriment,'' Le Pen said.
	   ``If God keeps me alive, I will be a candidate for presidential
elections in 2002,'' he added.
	   Megret was present during the speech, but made no comment. The
two met on Thursday, the conference's opening day, and witnesses
described their encounter as icy.
	   Earlier this year, a court convicted Le Pen of physically
attacking a Socialist candidate and imposed a sentence that could
force him from office.
	   The ruling stripped Le Pen of his civic rights for two years,
which means he would be forced to resign his two elected posts and
even lose the right to vote. Le Pen has appealed the ruling.
	   The Front blames immigration for high urban crime and
double-digit unemployment. It has maintained about 15 percent
support nationwide, but in some regions garnered a third of the
vote in March, becoming a kingmaker in regional governments.
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern
France.

Vietnam releasing thousands of prisoners in general amnesty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam announced its most high-profile
amnesty for prison inmates Wednesday, prompting human-rights groups
to celebrate the release of at least two top dissidents and wonder
who else was on the lengthy list.
	   An unspecified number of foreigners, who include Americans, are
among the 5,219 prisoners who are being freed before Wednesday's
National Day.
	   The only confirmed names on the list are writer Doan Viet Hoat
and physician Nguyen Dan Que, whose cases were cited in a July 16
resolution by the European Parliament _ sharply criticized by
Vietnam _ that said their convictions should be quashed
immediately.
	   Amnesty International claims both men have suffered serious
illnesses in recent years and Hoat has been held in solitary
confinement with guards refusing to talk with him.
	   Vietnam denies it holds anyone for political or religious
beliefs, only those who have broken the law.
	   Human-rights groups counter that a number of people are jailed
for violating the all-encompassing national security law or the
strict regulation of religious activities.
	   A U.S. Embassy statement welcomed the amnesty, and said Hoat and
Que have been ``accepted for resettlement in the United States.''
But the embassy said it could not divulge who else was being
released, citing American privacy laws.
	   The embassy has been working with Vietnam on releasing prisoners
held for political or religious crimes and was pleased with the
outcome, an embassy official said on condition of anonymity.
	   Demelza Stubbings, Vietnam researcher for Amnesty International,
said the human-rights group hopes this could be ``a turning point
for human rights in Vietnam.''
	   ``Based on past experience, we didn't expect to see such
high-profile dissidents released,'' she said. ``I can't remember
two at once before. What we're anxious to know is who else is on
the list.''
	   Revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh started periodic amnesties in
1945. They became annual events in 1975-90, but only two, in 1993
and 1995, have been held since then. This was the biggest by far of
the recent releases.
	   It was unclear why so many prisoners were released at once,
including high-profile dissidents, who normally are freed quietly
one at a time and allowed to leave the country. Another group will
be considered after National Day.
	   ``The amnesty manifests the policy of forgiveness and
humanitarianism of the state, and is aimed at encouraging inmates
to engage in good conduct,'' Nguyen Canh Dinh, chairman of the
president's office, told reporters.
	   The country has made recent moves to improved strained ties with
the Vatican. The U.N. special rapporteur on religious intolerance
has been given permission to visit in October.
	   There also have been signs of pragmatism amidst the fallout of
the Asian financial crisis, which has slowed rapid growth that had
been built on cheap labor. That competitive advantage has largely
disappeared.
	   Vietnam faces another round of talks with the United States next
month on a trade pact that is considered a precursor to membership
in the World Trade Organization.
	   Hoat was serving a 15-year sentence for publishing pro-democracy
newsletters. He was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the World
Association of Newspapers earlier this year for his commitment to a
free press.
	   ``We are delighted and gratified,'' the association's director
Timothy Balding said in a statement. ``This is evidence that
governments that are hostile to freedom of expression can by
influenced by international opinion.''
	   Hoat was first arrested in 1976 when he was a professor of
literature for calling for greater civil liberties and spent 12
years in detention camps without trial.
	   He was arrested again in 1990 and held for 28 months without
charge, then sentenced to 20 years _ later reduced to 15 _ for
publishing ``anti-communist'' articles in a small underground
magazine, Freedom Forum.
	   Que, the only member of Amnesty International in Vietnam, was
sentenced in 1991 to 20 years for ``counterrevolutionary
activities.'' He earlier served 10 years after criticizing national
health policy.
	   To qualify for the amnesty, Dinh said inmates must have served
at least a third of their sentences, or 12 years in the case of a
life sentence.

Excerpts from interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Excerpts from remarks by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin broadcast Friday evening on Russian state television and
translated by The Associated Press.
	   Concerning rumors of his resignation: ``Considering my
personality, I think it is impossible. Impossible.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my Constitutional term.
In 2000 there will be an election for a new president and I will
not run.''
	   On the economic crisis: ``First of all, I believe that we must
now concentrate on fulfilling the program that has been drawn up in
the stabilization period. And secondly, solve the personnel
question. These are the two main, key issues. We solve them, we
solve the problem.
	   ``Of course, it would be naive to say now that we will take
measures and so on, and that people won't suffer. However, as
president I must say that we will do everything to ensure that
people don't lose their savings.
	   ``I cannot say that prices will not rise, but as president I'm
obligated to do everything to keep it to a minimum. To a minimum.''
	   ``Everybody knows that I am an optimist by nature. That is
certainly the truth. Otherwise one would have no interest in
living. But now, I believe what I'm saying. I believe that it can
be done. Otherwise, I would also have no interest in living.''
	   Concerning speculation that Viktor Chernomyrdin was fired last
March because he had accumulated too much power:
	   ``There are two mistakes in your question. The first mistake is
(saying) that he had some sort of higher political powers. Or, that
he did not have them, but decided to grab them, and has suffered at
my hand. Well, I want to say that he did not even use the powers
that he had. He did not use them. There has not been a single time
when I would have reproached him: Why are you taking more power?
And to suggest now that he has been given too much power _ it's not
right. He has now been given as much power as any ordinary prime
minister in any developed country.''

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu took over command
of Turkey's armed forces on Friday, vowing to intensify the
military's fight against radical Islam.
	   ``The Turkish Armed Forces should be more powerful and vigilant
than ever against problems such as radical Islam,'' he said at the
ceremony in which he replaced Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi as the
chief of general staff.
	   ``It is our first duty, as a nation, to be vigilant against
those who want to bring Sharia (Islamic laws) and darken the future
of our country,'' Kivrikoglu said.
	   The army plays a powerful role in this predominantly Muslim
society and has staged coups three times since 1960.
	   ``It is the apple of our eye,'' said President Suleyman Demirel,
calling the military the ``cement binding Turkish unity.''
	   Demirel awarded the departing chief of staff, Karadayi, the
country's top medal for ``preserving the unity and welfare of the
Turkish Republic.''
	   Under Karadayi, the military forced Islamic Premier Necmettin
Erbakan into resigning last year. Erbakan\s party was later banned
for anti-secular activities.
	   Kivrikoglu, 64, who led Turkey's land forces over the last year,
takes command of NATO's second-largest army.
	   He led the alliance's land forces in southeastern Europe in the
mid-1990s, after serving as a major general at NATO's headquarters
in Belgium.

Top ranking U.S. official pleads for Kosovo's future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a strongly worded appeal, a top
U.S. official said Friday the next six weeks will determine whether
the displaced people of Kosovo have a viable future.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting Belgrade officials, Julia V.
Taft, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, described her Thursday
visit to the embattled province as ``one of the most
heart-wrenching experiences in 25 years of work in humanitarian
relief.''
	   ``We have a catastrophe that is looming and we only have, as a
world humanitarian community, six weeks to help the government of
Serbia to respond to this crisis,'' Taft said.
	   With the cold that comes early in the southern Serbian province,
Taft feared that many of the estimated 200,000 displaced Kosovo
Albanians may not survive.
	   Taft announced in Pristina Thursday that the U.S. had already
invested 11 million dollars over the past two months in relief and
said she would prepare a request to the U.S. president for more
investment to help divert the imminent disaster.
	   Pointing out her portfolio is humanitarian, Taft said the
outcome of Kosovo's present humanitarian crisis _ which she judged
a definite 9 on a 1 to 10 scale _ will affect the result of the
polical one.
	   ``We don't need any more killings and destruction,'' Taft said
in response to whether she would recommend NATO air strikes if
peace efforts fail.
	   Serbian authorities in Pristina unveiled a new concept for
targeted assistance to 11 points within Kosovo, places where people
could come down from the mountains, she said.
	   She said those places were not yet safe, but assurances have
been made by the government through leaflets and publications.
	   Taft said it was ``absolutely critical that (Belgrade)
government considers this an emegency and wave restrictions... for
relief workers, getting commodities in and providing for a reduced
military presence.''
	   ``It is the responsibility of the people within Kosovo and
Serbia to try find conditions for confidence-building measures,''
she said, adding the international community stands ready to help
financially and technically.
	   Taft appealed for the diplomatic observer mission in Kosovo to
be expanded, as well as the international relief community, and for
the government to lift the inforamal embargo on stapler goods.
	   ``Guerrilla action take its root from people who are displaced
and have no food,'' Taft said and stressed a ``better alternative
needs to be provided... so they don't fall victims to people who
purport to be leaders.''

Record set at Spanish pit-spitting competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CIEZA, Spain (AP) _ An office worker spat an olive pit more than
21 meters (69 feet) on Friday in a record-breaking gust of lung
power.
	   Mariano Martinez Bejar, 32, emerged victorious from 10 finalists
who had been weeded down from an original field of 94 contestants
in the 4th annual olive-pit spitting contest in this town in
southeastern Spain.
	   Jaws dropped when Martinez let loose with a pulmonary blast that
smashed the previous record of 15 meters (50 feet).
	   ``You don't see someone with lungs like that every day,'' said
Manolo Egia, another finalist.
	   The competition is a promotional event sponsored by local olive
growers.

Juror who had affair with defendant released on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A woman convicted of
obstructing justice for having an affair with a defendant while
serving on the jury that acquitted him was to be released from jail
Friday pending an appeal.
	   Gillian Guess, to be released four days into her 18-month
sentence, did not pose the risk of flight or of reoffending, said
Chief Justice Allan McEachern of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal.
	   Prosecutors had argued that the administration of justice would
be brought into disrepute if she was released from custody, but
McEachern said under existing guidelines he had no choice.
	   ``The court has little leeway to do anything but release someone
who has filed an appeal where there is no risk a further offence
will be committed or the accused will flee,'' he said.
	   In sentencing Guess on Monday, Justice Raymond Paris of the
British Columbia Supreme Court said she tampered with the justice
system through her ``self-indulgent sexual adventure'' while on the
jury.
	   ``A jury trial is a fundamental institution of a democratic
society,'' Paris said. ``There could hardly be a more serious
matter to come before the courts.''
	   Guess was convicted in June of obstruction of justice for having
an affair with Peter Gill, one of six men charged in two gang-style
slayings.
	   She was arrested in May 1996 after an investigation that
confirmed she was having a sexual relationship with Gill during his
1995 trial.
	   Prosecutors solicited testimony from other jurors that Guess had
consistently argued in support of Gill. He and the other defendants
were acquitted.

Council condemns attacks on UN, detention of Iranians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Pakistani diplomat. TRIMS.
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council considered a draft
resolution Friday condemning attacks on U.N. personnel in
Afghanistan and the detention of Iranian diplomats in a northern
city.
	   The Russian-sponsored draft also expressed ``grave concern at
the continued Afghan conflict which has recently sharply escalated
due to the Taliban forces' offensive in the northern parts of the
country.''
	   The resolution deplored the continuous foreign involvement in
the conflict despite ``repeated pleas by the Security Council.''
	   Neighboring Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the ruling Taliban, while Iran is suspected of
backing the minority northern-based opposition.
	   Before the formal vote, Muhammad Najm Akbar, the deputy
Pakistani ambassador, denied Pakistan was involved in Afghanistan.
He concluded his speech by asking the international community ``to
accord formal recognition'' to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban wants Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations,
currently held by former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of
an alliance fighting the Taliban.
	   Over the past four years, the Taliban has captured most of the
country, including Kabul. Under its strict Islamic interpretation,
girls are barred from school, most women are confined to their
homes, and music, movies and television are banned.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry has said Taliban advances posed a
threat to the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Russia, a
permanent council member, fears the entrenchment of a radical
Islamic state in Afghanistan could bring an influx of refugees and
weapons into Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban of detaining 47 Iranians since it
captured the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The resolution condemned the capture of the Iranian diplomats
and demanded that ``all Afghan factions and, in particular the
Taliban, do everything possible to assure safe and dignified
passage out of Afghanistan.''
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.
	   The draft also condemns the attacks on U.N. personnel and called
on the Taliban to investigate ``these heinous crimes.''
	   Earlier this month, the bodies of two kidnapped Afghan nationals
working for the United Nations were found near the eastern city of
Jalalabad. An Italian military observer with the U.N. force was
shot dead last week after the U.S. missile strike.
	   The draft said it deplored ``measures taken by the Taliban which
seriously impede the activities of the United Nations humanitarian
agencies and international humanitarian organizations throughout
the country, and in particular, in Kabul.''
	   Last month, about 200 international staffers from 38 aid
organizations pulled out of Kabul rather than obey a Taliban order
to move their residences into an abandoned dormitory.
	   The draft urged ``all Afghan factions, in particular the
Taliban, to facilitate the work of the international humanitarian
organizations and ensure unimpeded access and adequate conditions
for the delivery of aid.''
	   Recent Taliban victories have cut off land route for opposition
supplies, and the Taliban surround the last remaining opposition
strongholds.
	   Russian and Iranian news agencies reported fierce fighting
Wednesday, saying the opposition gained ground in far northeastern
Takhar province.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Friday began hunting
anew for the bombers of the Planet Hollywood restaurant after
questioning and releasing a South African Muslim for lack of
evidence.
	   After more than 24 hours of interrogation, police said they
failed to turn up anything to link the man to the blast on Tuesday
evening that killed one person and injured 27 others.
	   ``Our investigations have been completed on the allegations that
were made and we have decided to release him,'' said police
spokesman Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg, who later
confirmed the man had been freed.

Belize elects new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MANOLO ROMERO &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELIZE CITY, Belize (AP) _ Former Foreign Minister Said Musa was
sworn in Friday as prime minister of Belize after his Peoples
United Party returned to power with a landslide victory.
	   The the centrist-social democratic PUP won 26 of 29 seats in
Belize's parliament in Thursday's elections. Outgoing Prime
Minister Manuel Esquivel of the conservative United Democratic
Party also lost his seat in parliament.
	   Issues in the election included the country's ailing economy, a
15 percent unemployment rate, high crime and allegations the
government had given Cabinet ministers too much power.
	   Many voters also were disillusioned by Esquivel's failure to
fulfill promises of the 1993 campaign, which included free land and
expanded free education.
	   This year, Musa also promised a ``massive countrywide housing
program'' in the Caribbean country south of Mexico and east of
Guatemala.
	   Musa, a British-educated attorney, had been foreign minister,
attorney general and minister of education in previous PUP
administrations led by George Price.
	   During the campaign, he promised to reduce the size of
government and revive the economy by attracting more investment.
	   Belize gained independence from Britain in 1981 and most British
troops withdrew shortly after Esquivel's party was elected in 1993,
causing a loss of about dlrs 20 million a year _ a large sum for a
country of just 225,000 people.
	   Esquivel, originally a teacher, served as prime minister from
1984 to 1989 and again from 1993.

Privatization plans criticized by Western officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Economic corruption is a key
concern of Bosnian voters ahead of September elections, and
international officials are calling on Muslim and Croat authorities
to clean up their act.
	   ``Voters are seriously concerned about fraud and corruption and
other related areas, believing, as we do, that this seriously
undermines any progress towards democracy,'' said Simon Haselock,
spokesman for Carlos Westendorp, the top international official in
Bosnia.
	   Privatization of state-owned industries is one area that has
come under the scrutiny of international officials ahead of Sept.
12-13 general elections.
	   They are calling on authorities in the Bosnian Muslim and Croat
half of the country to revise the privatization process.
	   The federation's privatization plan was generally approved by
international officials. But the details have made them take a
second look.
	   ``We do have serious concerns about how the authorities in the
federation have handled this,'' Haselock said.
	   The plan calls for vouchers to be issued to residents, which
then can be exchanged for shares in state-owned companies.
	   They were to be divvied out to three categories of people: all
pre-war residents, based on their investments before the war; to
compensate those whose foreign currency accounts were frozen during
the war; and to compensate soldiers who weren't paid for their war
service.
	   Federation officials estimate unpaid Bosnian and Croat soldiers
are owed 9 billion marks (dlrs 5 billion).
	   Haselock called the figure ``totally unrealistic.''
	   The total value of property available for privatization is only
15 billion marks (dlrs 8 billion).
	   Haselock said the decision to compensate Bosnian and Croat
soldiers to the tune of 9 billion marks ``is politically
motivated.''
	   ``Getting compensation for soldiers obviously helps to win
votes,'' and is blocking the whole privatization process, he said.
	   Westendorp urged authorities in July to review the issue, but
received no response, Haselock said. This could prompt Westendorp
to block certain categories of residents from receiving vouchers.

Jones beats Arron in sprint showdown

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World Champion Marion Jones restated
her dominance of the 100 meters Friday with a start-to-finish win
over her French rival Christine Arron.
	   Jones ran 10.80 seconds to put Arron firmly in second place in
the Van Damme Memorial Grand Prix event.
	   Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones' dominance of the
100 meters after she ran a blistering 10.73 to win the European
Championship last week.
	   But the American dominated Friday's race, holding off a mid-race
spurt by the flame-haired Frenchwoman and extending her lead in the
final meters.
	   ``I've ran against three times this year and I've beaten her
three times,'' Jones told reporters after the race. ``Today I gave
my answer who is the fasted woman in the world.''
	   Jones blamed the chilly evening for the relatively slow time,
well below her season's best of 10.71.
	   There was more than pride in stake. The win keeps Jones in the
running for a share of the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot
with just next week's events in Berlin and Moscow left to win.
	   Ethiopia's Haile Gebrsassie ran a season's best time of 7
minutes 25.11 seconds in the 3,000 meters to demolish the
opposition and stay in the contention for the big prize.
	   Bryan Bronson also stayed in the running with a 48.25 second win
in the 400-meters hurdles, although the American had a scare as he
eased up in the final stretch and was almost caught by Russia's
Ruslan Mashenko.
	   The million dollar prize will be shared by athletes who win
their events in seven selected Grand Prix events.
	   Jones and Bronson played down speculation that U.S. athletes may
pull out of the Moscow event because of the economic crisis in
Russia, or withdraw from next month's world cup in South Africa
after the bomb attack on an American restaurant in Cape Town.
	   ``I'm happy to go. I'm an athlete and I'm going to compete,''
Jones said.
	   Later Friday, Kenyan Paul Tergat in the 10,000 meters and his
countryman Daniel Komen in the 5,000 meters will seek to reclaim
the world records they set in last year's Brussels event.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola will also attempt to break the world
record in the rarely run 1,000 meters.

Ukraine's central bank chief confident despite Russian troubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh hryvna rate, government offering foreign
investors new long-term bonds, ADDS fresh statistics on government
debt. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will try to seek stability in its
economy despite the financial crisis in neighboring Russia, the
central bank chief said Friday.
	   Although the national currency, the hryvna, has been falling
rapidly in the past two weeks along with the Russian ruble, it will
not slide significantly further, National Bank chief Viktor
Yushchenko predicted.
	   ``There are no reasons for a sharp devaluation of the hryvna and
its rate is under control,'' Yushchenko told a news conference.
	   The hryvna, which stood at 2.14 to the U.S. dollar two weeks
ago, has been falling steadily since the Russian government sharply
devalued the ruble. On Friday, the hryvna sank to 2.25, reaching
the upper limit of a currency fluctuation corridor of 1.8 to 2.25.
	   The National Bank restricted dollar transactions at the
country's main currency exchange and limited the number of banks
allowed to purchase dollars.
	   Also on Friday, the government said it would offer foreign
investors holding Ukrainian treasury bills to exchange them for
long-term bonds with a dollar yield.
	   The move followed an earlier announcement by the Cabinet that it
would allow domestic banks to exchange their short-term government
bonds for longer-term paper.
	   However, despite Ukraine's serious economic problems, Yushchenko
insisted the country's financial turmoil was a psychological
spillover from neighboring Russia,
	   Russia remains Ukraine's largest trading partner, accounting for
33 percent of its foreign trade. But only 8.6 percent of that trade
in the first half of 1998 was in rubles, while 70 percent was in
dollars, Yushchenko said.
	   In addition, Ukrainian banks held only 18 percent of their
foreign accounts in rubles.
	   ``The crisis in Russia could not trigger a financial crisis in
Ukraine through economic factors,'' Yushchenko said. ``But we have
the psychology of investors to deal with, and we need to maintain
their trust in Ukraine.''
	   Yushchenko said the confusion in the country's financial market
was bound to stop soon, given the plans of the International
Monetary Fund to consider approval of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to
Ukraine.
	   He said the IMF was to set the date for its board meeting on
Ukraine Friday.
	   Approval of the loan would allow the National Bank to nearly
double its current reserves of dlrs 950 million by the end of the
year.
	   ``We remain firmly committed to timely payment of our foreign
debt, and we do not plan any other actions,'' Yushchenko said.

Draft resolution suspends sanctions review, condemns Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council would suspend regular
reviews of sanctions against Iraq for halting cooperation with U.N.
arms inspectors, according to a draft resolution circulating
Friday.
	   The British draft, obtained by The Associated Press, also would
condemn Baghdad for the Aug. 5 decision ``which constitutes a clear
and flagrant violation'' of previous resolutions and a February
agreement granting inspectors access to suspected weapons sites.
	   If adopted, the resolution would represent the toughest action
yet by the council on Baghdad's decision, which has paralyzed
inspections and limited the less-intrusive monitoring of previously
searched sites.
	   China has indicated it opposed suspending the reviews, which
would give Iraq no chance of having sanctions relief until it
complies.
	   Some council members have also questioned whether the move,
essentially symbolic since the next review isn't until October,
would actually improve inspectors' chances for resuming their
searches.

UNITED NATIONS: their searches.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused earlier this month to
certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   To date, the council has called Baghdad's decision ``totally
unacceptable'' and has urged inspectors try to go about their work.
On Wednesday, one American inspector, Scott Ritter, resigned in
frustration over what he said was the council's inaction.
	   Baghdad has said it won't resume cooperation with the United
Nations unless the council makes quick moves towards easing
sanctions and reconfiguring the U.N. Special Commission, which
carries out inspections.
	   According to U.N. resolutions, inspectors cannot conduct
searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   Baghdad claims it has destroyed all its banned weapons and has
accused the United States of manipulating the inspections to
maintain sanctions.

Belarus president urges closer union between Russia, Belarus and
</HEADLINE>
Ukraine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
said Friday that Belarus and Ukraine can help Russia overcome its
crisis if the three former Soviet republics draw closer together.
	   ``Close integration of the three Slavic nations would be a
powerful factor in stabilizing the situation not only in Russia,
but also in Belarus and Ukraine,'' Lukashenko was quoted as saying
by the Interfax news agency.
	   The hard-line Belarusian president was speaking two days after
he met with Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma and Russian Acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in a Crimean resort to discuss
the ongoing financial crisis.
	   Lukashenko, who is known to favor the idea of a close union
between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, said the current situation
``objectively compels'' the presidents of the three countries to
``make steps towards each other''.
	   He did not elaborate on what kind of integration could resolve
the crisis.
	   Belarus and Ukraine have suffered most heavily among other
former Soviet republics from the recent sharp fall of the Russian
ruble and turmoil in the country's financial markets.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency and Belarusian ruble are continuing to
decline in response to the Russian ruble's fall.

Juventus plays Lazio for first major trophy of the season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Two weeks before the Serie A season starts,
Juventus and Lazio are getting an early start to the Italian soccer
season.
	   The Italian Cup already is in full swing with the lower division
clubs. But the first taste of the first division comes Saturday
night, when the holder of the ``scudetto'' _ Juventus _ takes on
the reigning Italian Cup champ _ Lazio _ in the Italian Super Cup.
	   ``It's a pre-season match, and both teams are not in peak
condition,'' Juventus' coach Marcello Lippi said. ``However it's
going to be a hard-fought game. We shoot for victory, to have a
good start in the new season.''
	   With the league season not set to begin until Sept. 13, both
sides are getting an early taste of competitive play.
	   Lazio, which earlier this week negotiated a record transfer for
Italian striker Christian Vieri from Atletico Madrid, will be
without key defenders Alessandro Nesta and Paolo Negro.
	   However it will have plenty of offensive power with newly signed
Chilean striker Marcelo Salas and Croatian forward Alen Boksic.
	   Salas, who scored four goals for Chile in the World Cup, said he
had some problems in getting used to Lazio's play.
	   ``However I have been improving my conditioning and
understanding of my the teammates in recent exhibitions, and I'm
ready to win my first trophy with Lazio,'' the Chilean forward
said.
	   Italian stars Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi lead
Juventus' attack with French World Cup champions Zinedine Zidane
and Didier Deschamps together in midfield.
	   Inzaghi displayed his scoring skills on Tuesday, scoring twice
in Juventus' 2-1 victory over AC Milan in a prestigious exhibition
at San Siro.
	   Croat Igor Tudor replaces injured Uruguayan Paolo Montero on
Juventus' defense.
	   Del Piero, Italy's big disappointment at France 98, said his
main goal was to win the next European Champions Cup and thus
avenging the loss to Real Madrid in May's final.
	   ``A victory in the Italian SuperCup would be a good omen for the
upcoming European commitments,'' Del Piero said.
	   La Juve begins its Champions League matches against Turkey's
Galatasaray on Sept. 16.
	   Lazio, a losing finalist to Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup this
year, debuts in the European Cup Winners Cup in a first-leg match
against Lausanne the next day.

	   Lucy Tyler-Sharman of Australia took the individual pursuit for
women.
	   Ukraine captured the men's team pursuit title.
	   Ballanger won her seventh title since 1995 in beating Michelle
Ferris of Australia in the final for the second consecutivee year
	   Ballanger had a scarey moment in the first race of the
best-of-three final. Entering the final lap she looked twice over
her right shoulder to search for Ferris, who wasn't there. Ferris
had dipped inside to take the lead.
	   Ballanger had to battle to edge Ferris by less than 2
centimeters (1 inch) at the finish.
	   The second heat was easier for Ballanger. Although Ferris led
entering the final lap, Ballanger unleashed her power on the
backstretch and won convincingly.
	   Ballanger has a good chance for another gold medal.
	   The 500-meter race is Saturday and Ballanger is a heavy favorite
in that, not having been beaten since 1995.
	   Ballanger's sprint win was the fourth gold medal for France over
the first three days.
	   Its victory streak had to end though in the women's individual
pursuit. It didn't have any entries.
	   The French Federation judged that an aging Jeannie Longo -- with
more than a dozen world titles but approaching 40 -- was not of
world class shape despite that fact that she won the French title
last month.
	   Also Marion Clignet, who holds the world record and won the 1996
world title and Olympic silver medal, has been ill and also out of
shape.
	   So that left the victory to Tyler-Sharman, who won the final in
3:35.255 by more than two seconds.
	   ``After eight laps I knew I had it,'' Tyler-Sharman said.
	   She beat Netherland's Leontien Van Moorsel in the final here.
	   The Dutch rider was making a comeback after winning the road
championship twice and the pursuit title back in 1990
	   Third place went to Judith Arndt of Germany, the 1997 champion
over Yvonne McGregor of Britain.
	   Tyler-Sharman is one of the members of the Australian team that
is in conflict with Australian coach George Walsh and his methods.
That made Tyler-Sharman and two others to leave the team's training
camps to practice apart from the main group.
	   Tyler-Sharman avoided any discussions on that subject.
	   ``I can't talk about that. Otherwise I would be out of the
Commonwealth Games,'' Tyler-Sharman said. ``I've come this far and
I am not going to give up a chance to race there.''
	   The Commonwealth Games are next month.
	   She felt more than satisfied in the victory.
	   ``Absolutely,'' she said. ``We're always under a lot of
pressure.''
	   ``This is going to go a long way to make me a more confident
rider. That's been my biggest problem, even when I was in stellar,
world-beating form.''
	   She was expected to do well in the 1996 Olympics but lost in the
semifinals.
	   Ukraine won the final in the team pursuit.
	   Italy took third when France forfeited the third place race.
	   Germany defeated France in the semifinals. France, had the
fastest time in the quarterfinals on Thursday but couldn't repeat
its performance.
	   It lost out when its third rider dropped slightly behind his two
other teammates at the finish after making a furious comeback.
Another rider was further back, exhausted.
	   In the team pursuit, the third man across the line is the time
that counts.
	   France tried to make a substitution for the final but made its
appeal too late, according to the jury and France subsequently had
to forfeit its chance for a bronze medal.
	   In Friday's qualifying Florian Rousseau continued on track for
another title in the individual sprint event. He had won the title
the last two years and was favored to seeking his third consecutive
victory in the event.
	   He made the semifinals along with another Frenchman, Laurent
Gane, German Jens Fiedler and American Marty Nothstein.
	   France won the first three events of the championship.
	   Philippe Ermenault won the individual pursuit title on Wednesday
beating teammate Francis Moreau.
	   Arnaud Tournant set a sea level best in capturing the kilometer
time trial and joined Rousseau and Vincent Le Quellec for the
Olympic sprint team title the next day.
	   The track championships last until Sunday. The road
championships -- where France won three titles last year -- will be
in the Netherlands in October.

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ The Missionaries of Charity order have
begun identifying miracles attributed to Mother Teresa that will
help the Vatican begin the process of canonization, the first step
towards declaring her a saint, a nun at her charity said Friday.
	   ``We have received a number of miracle documents and we are
processing these for submission before the Pope for verification,''
said the nun who did not wish to be identified.
	   One of these miracles reportedly happened in the United States,
the nun said. A French woman broke several ribs in a car accident,
but her injuries miraculously healed when she wore a Mother Teresa
medallion around her neck.
	   The Archbishop of Calcutta, Father Henry D'Souza said this
miracle would be documented and sent to the Pope. The case for
canonization can be initiated by the bishop in the diocese where
the candidate died, which is Calcutta.
	   The Roman Catholic Church requires that two miracles attributed
to the candidate, in this case, Mother Teresa, be confirmed by the
Vatican before canonization. Ordinarily, the miracles can come
after the candidate's death, such as curing an ill believer or
answering a supplicant's prayers.

Draft resolution suspends sanctions review, condemns Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. ADDS details from draft and RECASTS lede,
background. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain on Friday began circulating a
draft resolution that would suspend regular reviews of sanctions
against Iraq for halting cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   According to the draft, the Security Council also would condemn
Baghdad for the Aug. 5 decision ``which constitutes a clear and
flagrant violation'' of previous resolutions and a February
agreement granting inspectors access to suspected weapons sites.
	   If adopted, the resolution would represent the toughest action
yet by the council on Baghdad's decision, which has paralyzed
inspections and limited the less-intrusive monitoring of previously
searched sites.
	   China, a permanent council member with veto power, has indicated
it opposed suspending the reviews, which would give Iraq no chance
of having sanctions relief until it complies.
	   Some council members have also questioned whether the move,
essentially symbolic since the next review is not until October,
would improve inspectors' chances for resuming their searches.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused earlier this month to
certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   To date, the council has called Baghdad's decision ``totally
unacceptable'' and has urged inspectors try to go about their work.
On Wednesday, one American inspector, Scott Ritter, resigned in
frustration over what he said was the council's inaction.
	   The draft would suspend further reviews of sanctions until after
the chief inspectors report ``that Iraq has fully resumed the
cooperation necessary for them to perform the full range of their
activities mandated under the relevant resolutions of the
council.''
	   Baghdad has said it won't resume cooperation with the United
Nations unless the council makes quick moves towards easing
sanctions and reconfiguring the U.N. Special Commission, which
carries out inspections.
	   Baghdad claims it has destroyed all its banned weapons and has
accused the United States of manipulating the inspections to
maintain sanctions. Iraq says the commission is dominated by
Britain and the United States, which traditionally take the hardest
line on Iraq in the council.
	   According to U.N. resolutions, inspectors cannot conduct
searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   Last year, the council suspended sanctions reviews after Baghdad
refused to allow inspectors access to presidential palaces.

Former British spy meets with judge probing Diana crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former British spy Richard Tomlinson at his own
request met Friday with the judge investigating the crash that
killed Princess Diana almost a year ago.
	   Tomlinson, who recently spent six months in jail for trying to
sell his memoirs in breach of Britain's Official Secrets Act, left
the Palais de Justice without speaking to reporters.
	   But sources close to the investigation, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tomlinson claimed that driver Henri Paul, who also
died in the Aug. 31 crash along with Diana's partner, Dodi Fayed,
worked for British intelligence.
	   Tomlinson also claimed that one of the bodyguards working for
Diana and Fayed the day of the crash _ either Trevor Rees-Jones or
Kes Wingfield _ was also a contact for British intelligence, the
sources said.
	   The hearing with Judge Herve Stephan lasted about two hours. No
further details were immediately available.
	   Tomlinson was arrested in Paris earlier this month at the
request of the British government after being freed from jail, but
was later released.
	   He sent a letter to Stephan requesting an interview.
	   Tomlinson has been an outspoken critic of his former employers,
accusing the security services of being inefficient and
unaccountable.
	   Speculation that Britain's MI6 intelligence agency was involved
in the Paris crash has been quashed by French investigators who say
they have found no evidence to support claims that the pair were
victims of an assassination conspiracy.
	   In a rare statement, investigators said Tuesday that the
investigation would end in October.

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - France's Felicia Ballanger captured her
fourth consecutive women's sprint title at the World Cycling
Championships Friday but the French victory streak was stopped.
	   After winning the first four events of the competition, France
finally lost one when Lucy Tyler-Sharman of Australia took the
individual pursuit for women.
	   Ukraine captured the men's team pursuit title.
	   Ballanger won her seventh title since 1995 in beating Michelle
Ferris of Australia in the final for the second consecutive year.
	   ``It still is nice to win each title as it was in the
beginning,'' Ballanger said. ``But this one was before the French
crowd.''
	   She had won previously in Colombia, England and Australia.
	   Ballanger had a scarey moment in the first race of the
best-of-three final. Entering the final lap she looked twice over
her right shoulder to search for Ferris, who wasn't there. Ferris
had dipped inside to take the lead.
	   ``I was afraid. I could have lost there but I figured I could
come back and then got my confidence back,'' Ballanger said.
	   Ballanger had to battle to edge Ferris by less than 2
centimeters (1 inch) at the finish.
	   The second heat was easier for Ballanger. Although Ferris led
entering the final lap, Ballanger unleashed her power on the
backstretch and won convincingly.
	   Ballanger has a good chance for another gold medal.
	   The 500-meter race is Saturday and Ballanger is a heavy favorite

the first three days.

	   Also Marion Clignet, who holds the world record and won the 1996

Record set at Spanish pit-spitting competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CIEZA, Spain (AP) _ An office worker spat an olive pit more than
21 meters (69 feet) on Friday in a record-breaking gust of lung
power.
	   Mariano Martinez Bejar, 32, emerged victorious from 10 finalists
who had been weeded down from an original field of 94 contestants
in the 4th annual olive-pit spitting contest in this town in
southeastern Spain.
	   Jaws dropped when Martinez let loose with a pulmonary blast that
smashed the previous record of 15 meters (50 feet).
	   ``You don't see someone with lungs like that every day,'' said
Manolo Egia, another finalist.
	   The competition is a promotional event sponsored by local olive
growers.

Russia looks beyond Yeltsin _ and sees more trouble ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After Boris Yeltsin, what's next?
	   It might still be premature to talk about Russia after Yeltsin,
the first post-Soviet president and a man who has survived two coup
attempts and years of extreme unpopularity.
	   But many people here believe that the collapse of the Russian
economy may have done what communists couldn't _ finished Yeltsin
politically. Even if he doesn't resign soon, the Yeltsin era may
well be over.
	   So what does the future hold?
	   Not much good. That is the consensus of a wide range of people,
from the politically savvy to the average person on the street.
Granted, Russians often take a gloomy view of things. But this
time, a great deal of evidence supports their pessimism.
	   ``We have just entered the zone of severe financial crisis,''
ousted Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in an interview
published Friday. ``If somebody thinks that we can get over it in a
day, month or half a year, that is an illusion.''
	   Almost no one expects Russia to stuff the genie of democracy and
capitalism back in a Soviet bottle _ at least not all the way.
While many Russians speak nostalgically about the economic
stability of the Soviet years, it is hard to find anyone who would
give up the personal and political freedoms they have won.
	   Economically, though, there seems little doubt the country is
heading at least a few steps back _ and maybe more.
	   ``I think there could be a very serious retrenchment,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, a political analyst at the Heritage Foundation in
Moscow.
	   Decisions taking shape now in the Russian parliament and in the
embryonic government of acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
suggest that Russians can look forward to rampant inflation and a
drastic slowdown in foreign investment, with the jobs and consumer
goods it brings.
	   Some industries that were privatized under Yeltsin may well be
re-nationalized. Even if they aren't, they are almost certain to
face stricter state control.
	   Already, banks have begun joining together in pools that will
receive government assistance _ and control.
	   Bankers interviewed by the financial newspaper Kommersant agreed
that the government is likely to restrict the use of hard currency
_ primarily meaning U.S. dollars _ in another step back toward a
Soviet economy.
	   Asked for his advice, one of the bankers, Dmitri Yakovlev of
Rossiski Credit Bank, said: ``I would advise ordinary citizens to
rush to still-open shops and buy everything they need.''
	   The political future is hazier, with worse-case scenarios
encompassing mass riots and civil war.
	   One former presidential advisor, Sergei Karaganov, wrote in
Kommersant that if Yeltsin doesn't resign, he will almost certainly
be overthrown ``and perhaps there will be no place to hold an
election _ the country will no longer exist.''
	   That would seem to be an extreme view. Other people are
operating under the assumption that Yeltsin will resign, setting
off a bitter _ but nonviolent _ struggle for the presidency that is
likely to lead Russia to a more authoritarian, less market-oriented
government.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, if a president resigns or dies
the prime minister becomes acting president for three months and
calls new elections.
	   Chernomyrdin has said he intends to run for president in the
next election, although most people think he would stand little
chance of winning.
	   The strongest candidates are likely to be Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, whom Yeltsin beat in 1996; Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, a nationalist who believes in stronger state control of
the economy; and retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, the governor of the
Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, whose views are murkier but assumed
to be similar to Luzhkov's.
	   Sergei Markov, a political analyst with the independent
Institute of Political Studies, said Yeltsin's decision to
effectively default on foreign investments would give the new
government little choice but to retrench and assert more control
over the economy.
	   ``Any government will have to move to the left pretty far,''
Markov said. ``The question is how far.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian civilians told U.N. aid
workers Friday that 17 people were killed in fierce fighting near
the former stronghold of Kosovo guerrillas. U.N. workers saw eight
bodies, including a 4-month-old child.
	   Residents of the village of Senik, near the former rebel
stronghold of Malisevo, told staffers of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees that 16 people were killed in shelling Thursday,
according to UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo.
	   Del Mundo said UNHCR workers saw eight bodies, including an
infant killed by shrapnel and a 4-year-old boy whose head was torn
off.
	   A 75-year-old villager was killed by a sniper in Guncat, 10
kilometers (six miles) east of Malisevo, del Mundo said. About
10,000 refugees from 35 villages were crowded into the village,
which normally has about 1,500 inhabitants. All were lacking food
and other necessities, he said.
	   About 265,000 people have been made homeless by the months of
fighting between the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army and an
alliance of Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops. Kosovo, whose
population is 90 percent Albanian, is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Separately, an Albanian source said government troops killed
three members of a Kosovo Albanian family and wounded two others
Thursday as they fled fighting southwest of the provincial capital.
	   Elsewhere, Serb police retrieved bones of 10 Serb civilians, two
of them children, whom officials said were executed by the KLA in
the rebel's former mountaintop stronghold of Klecka, which was
overrun Thursday by government forces.
	   The reports underscored the brutality of a conflict which
American and European diplomacy has been powerless to stop.
	   Serb authorities took an Associated Press Television crew Friday
to Klecka, where police and civilian volunteers, wearing plastic
gloves, picked through bones of five men, three women and two
children whom officials said were executed by the KLA a month ago.
	   A young man in handcuffs told interlocutors that he ``shot a fat
guy'' but gave no explanation why the captives were slain.
	   Both sides have accused the other of kidnapping and murdering
civilians during the conflict, which escalated last February when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a campaign against
the KLA, which is fighting for independence of the majority
Albanian province.
	   U.S. diplomats have been trying to set up face-to-face talks
between the Albanians and the Serb-run government to determine the
future of the province. The Americans and Europeans want Milosevic
to restore the autonomy he withdrew in 1989.
	   In Belgrade, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, Julia Taft,
warned of a humanitarian catastrophe unless the fight ceases and
refugees return to their homes within the next six weeks.
	   After that, Taft said, the advent of winter will bring suffering
and death to tens of thousands of people. Taft said she would ask
President Clinton for emergency aid to prevent a disaster.
	   Taft said it was ``absolutely critical that (Yugoslav)
government considers this an emegency and wave restrictions... for
relief workers, getting commodities in and providing for a reduced
military presence.''

U.N. to send disaster team to flood-devastated China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A United Nations disaster team will arrive
in China soon to assist in alleviating record summer flooding that
has killed over 3,000 people, a spokesman for the secretary-general
said Friday.
	   The Chinese government requested the assistance, spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
	   The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is
sending a team to make on-site visits in some of the worst-affected
provinces and to assist in the ``mobilization of resources from the
international community,'' he said.
	   The government says disastrous floods have killed 3,004 people
and left millions homeless in the worst flooding in decades on the
Yangtze River and in northeast China. It has caused economic losses
of more than dlrs 20.2 billion in China.
	   Dissidents and legislators alike are blaming the severity of
China's floods on misguided government policies that promote
high-speed growth at the expense of the environment.
	   One of the culprits they cite is clear-cutting, which has
reduced forest cover in the Yangtze basin by half in four decades,
causing an surge in soil erosion. Silty runoff raises river beds
and causes flooding.

Libya says UN resolution threatens a Lockerbie settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS British reaction graf 14-15; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By JASPER MORTIMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ By threatening new strictures against Libya,
the U.N. Security Council resolution on the Lockerbie suspects
could jeopardize their standing trial in the Netherlands, the Libya
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   In a long statement read on Libya state television, the ministry
urged talks ``as soon as possible'' on bringing the men to trial
but raised a number of criticisms of the Security Council
resolution on bringing the men to justice.
	   It repeated Libya's acceptance of a trial in the Netherlands but
complained of the ``conditions and threats'' that accompanied the
resolution adopted Thursday night.
	   The council voted unanimously to suspend sanctions against Libya
once it turns over two men charged with the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   The resolution warned Libya that the council would ``consider
additional measures if the two accused have not arrived or appeared
for trial promptly.''
	   Council diplomats did not say what the additional measures might
entail, but previously U.S. lawmakers have proposed an oil embargo
on Libya. The current sanctions ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   In a broadcast monitored in Cairo, Libyan television quoted the
Foreign Ministry as saying: ``The threat of tightening the
sanctions and applying more pressure to Libya ... is nothing more
than a scheme to abort this solution and to find an excuse to
escalate the sanctions on Libya and its people.''
	   The ministry also objected to the resolution's offer to suspend
the embargo only when the suspects are handed over.
	   It said the sanctions ``should be lifted as soon as an agreement
is signed between Libya and the countries concerned on the
arrangements and guarantees for the suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands.''
	   The ministry statement noted Libya ``considers itself not
obligated'' to negotiations between the United States, Britain and
the Netherlands which formed the basis of the British-American
offer for a trial in a third country. Britain and the United States
have said this was a non-negotiable offer.
	   But the Libyan statement said it has the right to demand any
explanations about ``the security and safety of its citizens,''
meaning the two suspects.
	   In an interview Thursday on CNN, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
also said he was suspicious that the United States and Britain, the
prime movers behind the Lockerbie resolutions, would play
``tricks'' as soon as the accused were handed over.
	   In London on Friday, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain
would be happy to clarify any points that Libya might raise, but
that the offer was ``totally non-negotiable.''
	   ``There are comprehensive safeguards and assurances of a safe
trial,'' the spokesman said, speaking on terms of customary
anonymity.
	   The Libyan ministry also criticized the council's call for
Tripoli to renounce terrorism as required in the resolutions that
established the sanctions in 1992.
	   The request was ``unjustified ... because it ignores Libya's
condemnation of terrorism,'' the ministry said.
	   The ministry said nothing stood in the way of lifting sanctions
in the past except agreement on a venue for the trial, adding this
did not happen only because of ``the United States' and the United
Kingdom's procrastination.''
	   Until this latest offer, Washington and London had insisted any
trial be held in the United States or Britain.
	   Libya said it was ``surprised'' by the resolution's calling on
Libya to cooperate with the French investigation into the bombing
of UTA Flight 772, which exploded over Niger on Sept. 19, 1989,
killing all 170 passengers and crew.
	   ``This cooperation was granted in 1996 and the French
(investigating) judge declared this in a letter to the Security
Council's members on Nov. 6, 1997,'' the ministry said.

Jones beats Arron in sprint showdown

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World Champion Marion Jones restated
her dominance of the 100 meters Friday with a start-to-finish win
over her French rival Christine Arron.
	   Jones ran 10.80 seconds to put Arron firmly in second place in
the Van Damme Memorial Grand Prix event.
	   Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones' dominance of the
100 meters after she ran a blistering 10.73 to win the European
Championship last week.
	   But the American dominated Friday's race, holding off a mid-race
spurt by the flame-haired Frenchwoman and extending her lead in the
final meters.
	   ``I've ran against three times this year and I've beaten her
three times,'' Jones told reporters after the race. ``Today I gave
my answer who is the fasted woman in the world.''
	   Jones blamed the chilly evening for the relatively slow time,
well below her season's best of 10.71.
	   There was more than pride in stake. The win keeps Jones in the
running for a share of the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot
with just next week's events in Berlin and Moscow left to win.
	   Ethiopia's Haile Gebrsassie ran a season's best time of 7
minutes 25.11 seconds in the 3,000 meters to demolish the
opposition and stay in the contention for the big prize.
	   Bryan Bronson also stayed in the running with a 48.25 second win
in the 400-meters hurdles, although the American had a scare as he
eased up in the final stretch and was almost caught by Russia's
Ruslan Mashenko.
	   The million dollar prize will be shared by athletes who win
their events in seven selected Grand Prix events.
	   Jones and Bronson played down speculation that U.S. athletes may
pull out of the Moscow event because of the economic crisis in
Russia, or withdraw from next month's world cup in South Africa
after the bomb attack on an American restaurant in Cape Town.
	   ``I'm happy to go. I'm an athlete and I'm going to compete,''
Jones said.
	   Later Friday, Kenyan Paul Tergat in the 10,000 meters and his
countryman Daniel Komen in the 5,000 meters will seek to reclaim
the world records they set in last year's Brussels event.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola will also attempt to break the world
record in the rarely run 1,000 meters.

Androstenedione has been on ATP Tour list of banned substances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with New York Times comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The ATP Tour on Friday denied a published report
that androstenedione had been added to its list of banned
substances as recently as Thursday, saying players already were
forbidden from using it.
	   ``Drugs of this nature come under the heading of related
substances,'' said Graeme Agars, ATP Tour vice president of
communications. ``As far as the ATP Tour antidoping program is
concerned, any substance which raises level of testosterone is
banned and has been banned.''
	   The New York Times reported Friday that the men's tennis
organization had banned the testosterone-producing dietary
supplement on Thursday.
	   ``Contrary to published reports, the ATP Tour did not ban the
substance effective yesterday, and that was because it was already
covered under our anti-doping program,'' the tour said in a
statement. ``The inference that players who took the substance
before that date were not subject to the antidoping regulations is
also incorrect.''
	   The Times had quoted Bill Norris, the ATP Tour's on-site medical
trainer at a tournament in Commack, New York, as saying that
players will officially be notified of the ban on Monday, the start
of the U.S. Open.
	   Times sports editor Neil Amdur said Friday the newspaper was
satisfied it had quoted Norris accurately.
	   Agars said he did not know if androstenedione would be mentioned
during the regularly scheduled player's meeting at next week's U.S.
Open, but said it ``would discuss this substance or any other
substance with any player at any time should they inquire.''
	   The use of androstenedione has been at the center of a debate
since last week, when slugger Mark McGwire admitted to The
Associated Press that he takes the supplement.
	   Major league baseball allows the use of androstenedione, but it
is banned by the NFL, NCAA, the International Olympic Committee and
high school athletic associations. Baseball said this week it would
look into the use of androstenedione and other dietary supplements.

Libya says UN resolution threatens a Lockerbie settlement
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ By threatening new strictures against Libya,
the U.N. Security Council resolution on the Lockerbie suspects
could jeopardize their standing trial in the Netherlands, the Libya
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   In a long statement read on Libya state television, the ministry
urged talks ``as soon as possible'' on bringing the men to trial
but raised a number of criticisms of the Security Council
resolution on bringing the men to justice.
	   It repeated Libya's acceptance of a trial in the Netherlands but
complained of the ``conditions and threats'' that accompanied the
resolution adopted Thursday night.
	   The council voted unanimously to suspend sanctions against Libya
once it turns over two men charged with the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   The resolution warned Libya that the council would ``consider
additional measures if the two accused have not arrived or appeared
for trial promptly.''
	   Council diplomats did not say what the additional measures might
entail, but previously U.S. lawmakers have proposed an oil embargo
on Libya. The current sanctions ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   In a broadcast monitored in Cairo, Libyan television quoted the
Foreign Ministry as saying: ``The threat of tightening the
sanctions and applying more pressure to Libya ... is nothing more
than a scheme to abort this solution and to find an excuse to
escalate the sanctions on Libya and its people.''
	   The ministry also objected to the resolution's offer to suspend
the embargo only when the suspects are handed over.
	   It said the sanctions ``should be lifted as soon as an agreement
is signed between Libya and the countries concerned on the
arrangements and guarantees for the suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands.''
	   The ministry statement noted Libya ``considers itself not
obligated'' to negotiations between the United States, Britain and
the Netherlands which formed the basis of the British-American
offer for a trial in a third country. Britain and the United States
have said this was a non-negotiable offer.
	   But the Libyan statement said it has the right to demand any
explanations about ``the security and safety of its citizens,''
meaning the two suspects.
	   In an interview Thursday on CNN, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
also said he was suspicious that the United States and Britain, the
prime movers behind the Lockerbie resolutions, would play
``tricks'' as soon as the accused were handed over.
	   In London on Friday, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain
would be happy to clarify any points that Libya might raise, but
that the offer was ``totally non-negotiable.''
	   ``There are comprehensive safeguards and assurances of a safe
trial,'' the spokesman said, speaking on terms of customary
anonymity.
	   The Libyan ministry also criticized the council's call for
Tripoli to renounce terrorism as required in the resolutions that
established the sanctions in 1992.
	   The request was ``unjustified ... because it ignores Libya's
condemnation of terrorism,'' the ministry said.
	   The ministry said nothing stood in the way of lifting sanctions
in the past except agreement on a venue for the trial, adding this
did not happen only because of ``the United States' and the United
Kingdom's procrastination.''
	   Until this latest offer, Washington and London had insisted any
trial be held in the United States or Britain.
	   Libya also said it was ``surprised'' by the resolution's calling
on Libya to cooperate with the French investigation into the
bombing of UTA Flight 772, which exploded over Niger on Sept. 19,
1989, killing all 170 passengers and crew.
	   ``This cooperation was granted in 1996 and the French
(investigating) judge declared this in a letter to the Security
Council's members on Nov. 6, 1997,'' the ministry said.

Kurdish rebel leader renews call for cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish guerrilla leader on Friday
renewed his call for a cease-fire between his rebel forces and
government troops in Turkey's southeast, London-based Kurdish Med
TV said.
	   Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, told Med
TV in a telephone interview that the autonomy-seeking rebels would
implement the cease-fire on Tuesday.
	   After Tuesday, his forces would refrain from attacks on Turkish
troops, but would defend themselves if attacked, he said.
	   Similar calls for a truce by Ocalan, including the latest in
April, have been ignored by Turkey, which says it will not
negotiate with an organization it regards as terrorist. Military
officials were not available for comment on the offer from the
group, which is known by the initials PKK.
	   The Turkish army regularly carries out offensives against PKK
bases in Turkey and in northern Iraq.
	   The appeal came as Turkish authorities claim to have almost
defeated the rebels. Most of the rebel fighters are said to have
retreated across the border into Iraq.
	   Turkey does not grant Kurds cultural rights and bans Kurdish in
broadcasting and education.
	   The conflict has killed about 37,000 people since 1984.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials extended its losses Friday
after Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge and markets skidded in Asia and Europe.
	   Minutes before the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow
industrial average was down 130.79 at 8,035.20. The blue-chip
barometer was up as much as 78.53 points in early trading before
retreating at midmorning and sliding more than 154 points.
	   Broad-market indicators also fell after a brief rise in early
trading.
	   European stocks, which had been rebounding after opening sharply
lower, faltered late in the session. In Asia, some key indexes
plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   Its drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third-biggest point
loss ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997
and the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop,
while the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the
record 22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   With Friday's drop, the Dow now is down more than 1,200 points
from its July 17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of about 13
percent. The average of 30 big-name stocks, which had been up 18.1
percent for the year at its peak, now is just 2.4 percent above
where it ended 1997.

Williams wants it all this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nothing less than winning the U.S. Open will
satisfy Venus Williams this year.
	   ``My goal this year is definitely to win the tournament. I think
there is no other options available,'' the fifth-seeded Williams
said of the year's fourth and final Grand Slam tournament that
begins Monday at the National Tennis Center.
	   Last year in her Open debut, Williams smashed her own
expectations by slamming her way to the final before losing to
Martina Hingis.
	   ``I'm not sure what I thought coming into the Open (last year).
I think my goal was the quarterfinals and then be serious after
that. I did better,'' the 18-year-old said Friday at the unveiling
of a new line of Reebok tennis clothes she will wear at the Open.
	   A year of seasoning on the Corel WTA Tour, including her first
career singles titles at Oklahoma City and the Lipton
International, has convinced Williams to raise her sights.
	   ``I think I am a much better player,'' said Williams, a
quarterfinalist at the year's first three Grand Slams tournaments _
the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon.
	   '' I'm a smarter player. I make better decisions on the court. I
think I know how to get myself out of tough situations, when to get
a first serve in, how to play a shot, find somebody's weakness.
	   ``I think my chances are much better,'' said Williams, who opens
against Elena Wagner of Germany.
	   A bout of tendinitis in her left knee that prompted her to
withdraw from the Canadian Open last week and had forced her to
retire in the third set of her match against Mary Pierce at San
Diego earlier in the month has not tempered Williams' budding
optimism.
	   ``This past week I have been playing much more and I am feeling
really good,'' said Williams, who nevertheless walked with a limp
and did not rule out wearing a bandage next week.
	   ``I just really need to take good care of myself and not play
too much, not have any hard matches. Just get through real easy.
Maybe I should ask my opponents to go easy on me a little bit,''
she said.
	   Despite setting such a lofty goal, she says that her U.S. Open
results won't make or break her season.
	   ``I think I have had a good year overall,'' said Williams, who
also reached the final at the Italian Open and at Stanford, Calif.
``I could have done much better by winning everything that I
played, but it's too late now, that's in the past. I think I would
still have had a good year no matter how I did here.''

Minor earthquake jars Puerto Rico

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A minor earthquake of magnitude 4.4
rattled Puerto Rico Friday morning, followed by an aftershock, but
no damage was reported, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic
Network.
	   The tremors follow a 12-month period that included 520 incidents
of seismic activity in Puerto Rico, making it an above-average
period for the island, according to the university-based network.
	   Friday morning's earthquake at 7:15 was centered just offshore
of the north coast town of Manati. An aftershock at 8:08 a.m.
measured 3.9 in intensity and was centered near Mona Island, which
lies between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, to the west.
	   Residents in various parts of the island reported feeling Friday
morning's quakes.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A journalist from St. Petersburg has been beaten
to death in an attack that his editor said was connected to a
series of critical articles about the city's banking system, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Anatoly Levin-Utkin, deputy editor of three-week-old
Yuridichesky Petersburg Segodnya newspaper, was attacked at his
apartment building over the weekend and later died in hospital, the
daily Moscow Times reported.
	   The newspaper's editor, Alexei Domnin said the attackers took
the journalist's briefcase that contained documents related to the
banking stories, the Moscow Times reported.
	   ``We have come to the conclusion that the murder of Anatoly is
related to his professional activities,'' Domnin was quoted as
saying.
	   Domnin also said that representatives of State Customs Committee
and Bank Rossiisky Credit _ both organizations that were criticized
in the articles _ had approached him with demands to reveal sources
for the stories.

Track stars urge cancellation of Moscow final over economic crisis

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ International track stars on Friday
demanded next week's final of the Grand Prix season be moved from
Moscow because of the economic turmoil gripping Russia.
	   ``We feel that its an insult to go to Moscow and leave with
million dollar prizes,'' said U.S. sprint star Jon Drummond.
	   ``I feel our safety is also a factor,'' he added after winning
the 200 meters at the Van Damme Memorial event in Brussels.
	   Drummond said he would be present a petition signed by about 50
of the world's top athletes calling for the Grand Prix final
scheduled for Sept. 5 to moved to ``a more serene venue.''
	   Track stars signing the petition included Morocco's 1,500-meter
star Hicham El Guerrouj; Kenya's 3,000-meter world record holder
Daniel Komen and World 200-meter and 400-meter champion Michael
Johnson, Drummond said.
	   ``It's not what the sport is about. With the situation the way
it is at present it could be dangerous.'' said Johnson.
	   ``I don't think there's anyone in Russia right now who wants to
watch an athletics meet.''
	   Drummond said the athletes were not planning a mass boycott of
the Moscow event, but would decided individually whether to compete
if it goes ahead. He said would not be going as did world 100-meter
champion Maurice Greene.
	   ``I'm not going to the final in Moscow because I'm afraid,''
Greene said.
	   However, U.S. sprint star Marion Jones and Ireland's 1,500-meter
runner Sonia O'Sullivan said they intended to compete in Moscow if
the event went ahead.
	   Jones is one of four athletes still in contention for the dlrs 1
million Golden League Jackpot prize up for grabs in Moscow.
	   ``I've no control over what's going on in Moscow. I'm an
athlete, I'm going to compete,'' Jones told reporters. ``A lot of
athletes have expressed concern. I'm not concerned.''
	   Drummond said the athletes' worries had come to a head a meeting
in Brussels. He said many American track stars were also worried
about competing in next month's World Cup in Johannesburg, South
Africa, following the recent bombing of an American restaurant in
Cape Town.
	   ``The majority of people feel the same about Johannesburg as
they do about Russia,'' Drummond told reporters.
	   But Maria Mutola, the middle-distance runner from Mozambique,
sought to reassure her fellow athletes about competing in South
Africa.
	   ``I disagree about Johannesburg ... there's no problem at all
concerning safety of athletes,'' she said after winning the the
1,000 meters in Brussels.
	   Jones said she would not change her plans to run for the United
States in Johannesburg. ``I'm very exited about that. It will be
the first time I'm going to Africa.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials extended its losses Friday
after Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge and markets skidded in Asia and Europe.
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow industrial
average was down 114.31 at 8,051.68. The blue-chip barometer was up
as much as 78.53 points in early trading before retreating at
midmorning and sliding more than 154 points.
	   Broad-market indicators also fell after a brief rise in early
trading.
	   European stocks, which had been rebounding after opening sharply
lower, faltered late in the session. In Asia, some key indexes
plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   Its drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third-biggest point
loss ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997
and the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop,
while the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the
record 22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   With Friday's drop, the Dow now is down 1,286.29 points from its
July 17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 13.8 percent.

Chelsea defeats Real Madrid 1-0 with late strike
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Substitute Gustavo Poyet fired a late winner to
give Chelsea a 1-0 victory over Real Madrid in the UEFA Supercup
Final Friday.
	   The English club's goal came in the 82nd minute, when Gianfranco
Zola found space inside the penalty area and stroked the ball back
to Poyet, who shot low into the corner of the net from 15 meters
(yards).
	   In front of 10,000 spectators in Monaco, Real Madrid and Chelsea
- which met in the 1971 Cup Winners' Cup final but were both making
their first appearance in a Supercup final - produced few
goalscoring chances in a largely lifeless match.
	   Powerful Real centerback Fernando Hierro came closest to scoring
in the first half.
	   In the 33rd minute, his 30 meter (yard) right-foot free kick
struck the inside of the left hand post before being gratefully
cleared by the Chelsea rearguard.
	   Five minutes later, the Spanish team came close again, when
Yugoslav striker Predrag Mijatovic beat the offside trap wide on
the left, skipped past Chelsea goalkeeper Ed de Goey but fired over
the bar from a narrow angle.
	   European Champions League winner Real Madrid, playing under
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink for the first time, was on top in the
first half, but tired in the second.
	   Frank Leboeuf nearly scored early in the second period when his
long-range shot struck a post.
	   Lineups:
	   Real Madrid: Bodo Illgner, Christian Panucci, Roberto Carlos,
Fernando Hierro, Manuel Sanchis, Fernando Redondo, Raul, Predrag
Mijatovic (Robert Jarni, 74th), Clarence Seedorf, Savio, Christian
Karembeu (Fernando Morientes, 58th).
	   Substitutes (not used): Pedro Conteras, Ivan Campo, Guti, Jaime,
Fernando Sanz.
	   Chelsea: Ed de Goey, Celestine Babayaro, Frank Le Boeuf, Marcel
Desailly, Pierluigi Casiraghi (Tore Andre Flo, 90th), Dennis Wise,
Graeme le Saux, Michael Duberry, Roberto Di Matteo (Gustavo Poyet,
63rd), Albert Ferrer, Gianfranco Zola.
	   Substitutes (not used): Kevin Hitchcock, Brian Laudrup, Bernard
Lambourde, Eddie Newton, Jody Morris.

Juror who had affair with defendant released on bail

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A woman convicted of
obstructing justice for having an affair with a defendant while
serving on the jury that acquitted him was released from jail
Friday pending an appeal.
	   Gillian Guess, released four days into her 18-month sentence,
did not pose the risk of flight or of reoffending, said Chief
Justice Allan McEachern of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.
	   Prosecutors had argued that the administration of justice would
be brought into disrepute if she was released from custody, but
McEachern said under existing guidelines he had no choice.
	   ``The court has little leeway to do anything but release someone
who has filed an appeal where there is no risk a further offence
will be committed or the accused will flee,'' he said.
	   In sentencing 43-year-old Guess on Monday, Justice Raymond Paris
of the British Columbia Supreme Court said she tampered with the
justice system through her ``self-indulgent sexual adventure''
while on the jury.
	   He said her ``narcissistic and self-absorbed personality'' led
her into an affair with Peter Gill, the defendant 10 years her
junior.
	   ``A jury trial is a fundamental institution of a democratic
society,'' Paris said. ``There could hardly be a more serious
matter to come before the courts.''
	   Gill was one of six men charged in two gang-style slayings.
	   She was arrested in May 1996 after an investigation that
confirmed she was having a sexual relationship with Gill during his
1995 trial.
	   Prosecutors solicited testimony from other jurors that Guess had
consistently argued in support of Gill. He and the other defendants
were acquitted.
	   Guess's lawyer, Peter Ritchie, told reporters he hopes his
outspoken client will reduce a profile kept high by candid chats
with reporters and an Internet web page.
	   ``I would like to tell all of you people to stay away from
her,'' he told a crowd of reporters who met him outside the court.
	   A family friend said Guess spent her time in prison reading the
bible.
	   ``There was nothing there. It was just her and the bunk and her
thoughts,'' Mary Sepers said.

Barcelona sign Argentine midfielder Pellegrino

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP)_ Barcelona FC signed Argentine midfielder
Mauricio Pellegrino on Friday for one season, with an option to
keep him for two more.
	   The team said it agreed to pay Pellegrino's team, Velez
Sarsfield, dlrs 2 million for this season, with a clause calling
for an additional dlrs 4 million payment if it decides to keep him
for two additional seasons.
	   Pellegrino, who did not play for Argentina's World Cup team,
arrived in Spain earlier Friday for a medical checkup as
negotiations for his signing were underway.
	   Pelligrino's signing, in place of the failed acquisition of
Frank De Boer came just ahead of Friday night's deadline to sign
players for Spanish league games. But it was too late for Barcelona
coach Louis Van Gaal to include him in European matches.
	   Pellegrino, 26, has played for Velez Sarsfield since 1991.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council uanimously adopted a
resolution Friday condemning attacks on U.N. personnel in
Afghanistan and the detention of Iranian diplomats.
	   The Russian-initiated resolution passed 15-0. It expressed
``grave concern at the continued Afghan conflict'' and deplored
foreign involvement in the fighting despite the council's repeated
pleas.
	   Before voting, many governments noted Afghanistan had become an
``exporter of drugs and terrorism'' and urged combatants toward a
``political settlement.''
	   Neighboring Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the ruling Taliban, who are suspected of operating
terrorists camps in Afghanistan. Iran is believed to be backing the
minority northern-based opposition.
	   Before the vote, Muhammad Najm Akbar, the deputy Pakistani
ambassador, denied Pakistan's involvement and asked the
international community ``to accord formal recognition'' to the
Taliban.
	   The Taliban wants Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations,
currently held by former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of
the alliance fighting the Taliban.
	   Since 1994, the Taliban has captured most of Afghanistan,
including the capital, Kabul. Under its strict Islamic
interpretation, girls are barred from school, most women are
confined to their homes, and music, movies and television are
banned.
	   Russia, a permanent council member, fears the entrenchment of a
radical Islamic state could bring an influx of refugees and weapons
into Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban of detaining 47 Iranians since Aug.
8. The resolution condemned the action and demanded ``safe and
dignified passage out of Afghanistan'' for the Iranian diplomats.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the matter, but admits
to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its opponents. Iran
has warned of unspecified consequences unless the Iranians are
freed.
	   The resolution also condemned the attacks on U.N. personnel and
called on the Taliban to investigate ``these heinous crimes.''
	   Earlier this month, the bodies of two kidnapped U.N. workers,
Afghan nationals, were found near the eastern city of Jalalabad.
Last week, an Italian military observer with the U.N. force was
shot dead.
	   The resolution said it deplored ``measures taken by the Taliban
which seriously impede the activities of the United Nations
humanitarian agencies and international humanitarian
organizations.''
	   Last month, about 200 international staffers from 38 aid
organizations pulled out of Kabul rather than obey a Taliban order
to move their residences into an abandoned dormitory.
	   The resolution urged ``all Afghan factions, in particular the
Taliban, to facilitate the work of the international humanitarian
organizations.''
	   Recent Taliban victories in the north have cut off land route
for opposition supplies. Russian and Iranian news agencies reported
fierce fighting Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World Champion Marion Jones restated
her dominance of the 100 meters Friday with a start-to-finish win
over her French rival Christine Arron.
	   Jones ran 10.80 seconds to put Arron firmly in second place in
the Van Damme Memorial Grand Prix event. Arron finished in 10.95.
	   Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones' dominance of the
100 meters after she ran a blistering 10.73 to win the European
Championship last week.
	   But the American controled Friday's race, holding off a mid-race
spurt by the flame-haired Frenchwoman and extending her lead in the
final meters.
	   ``I've ran against three times this year and I've beaten her
three times,'' Jones told reporters after the race. ``Today I gave
my answer who is the fasted woman in the world.''
	   Jones blamed the chilly evening for the relatively slow time,
well below her season's best of 10.71. The cold also thwarted
efforts by a trio of African runners to break world records in the
5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and womens' 1,000 meters on the
normally fast Brussels track.
	   However all four athletes still in the running for a share of
the dlrs 1 million Golden League Jackpot won their events to stay
in contention for the big prize.
	   Apart from Jones, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie ran a season's
best time of 7 minutes, 25.09 seconds to demolish the opposition in
the 3,000 meters and Mococco's Hicham El Guerrouj won the 1,500 in
3 minutes, 29.68 seconds.
	   Bryan Bronson stayed in the running with a 48.25 second win in
the 400-meters hurdles, although the American had a scare as he
eased up in the final stretch and was almost caught by Russia's
Ruslan Mashenko.
	   Their victories were overshadowed however, by the athletes
concern that the final of the track Grand Prix season scheduled for
Sept. 5 in Moscow should be moved away from the Russian capital
because of the economic turmoil gripping the country.
	   ``We feel that its an insult to go to Moscow and leave with
million dollar prizes,'' said U.S. sprint star Jon Drummond after
winning the 200 meters. ``I feel our safety is also a factor.''
	   Drummond said he would not go to Moscow, but Jones disagreed.
``I'm happy to go. I'm an athlete and I'm going to compete,'' she
told reporters.
	   Kenyan Paul Tergat finished the 10,000 meters in 26 minutes,
46.44 seconds, well short of Gebrselassie's world record. Fellow
Kenyan Daniel Komen fared even worse in his bit to regain the 5,000
record, losing in the final stretch to Ethiopia's Assefa Mezgebu in
another slow time.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola won the 1,000 meters but failed in her
bid to set a new world mark in the rarely run distance.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials extended its losses Friday
after Wall Street faltered in a bid to bounce back from Thursday's
357-point plunge and markets skidded in Asia and Europe.
	   The Dow, up as much as 78.53 in the opening minutes of trading,
gave up its gains and finished down 114.31 at 8,051.68. At its low
point in the morning, the Dow was down 154.47 at 8,011.52. Trading
was heavy but well below Thursday's frantic pace.
	   Broad-market indicators also fell after a brief rise in early
trading.
	   European stocks, which had been rebounding after opening sharply
lower, faltered late in the session. In Asia, some key indexes
plummeted to levels last seen more than 10 years ago.
	   Investors remained nervous about Russia's growing economic and
political turmoil and about whether the economic crisis that began
more than a year ago in Asia will spread to Latin America.
	   Thursday's weakness on Wall Street, including a 4.2 percent
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, added to the negative
sentiment.
	   Its drop Thursday of 357.36 points was the third-biggest point
loss ever, trailing only the 554.26-point plunge of Oct. 27, 1997
and the 508-point collapse on Oct. 19, 1987. The percentage drop,
while the biggest since last October's swoon, was not close to the
record 22.6 percent of the ``Black Monday'' crash of 1987.
	   With Friday's drop, the Dow now is down 1,286 points from its
July 17 record high of 9,337.97, a drop of 13.8 percent. The
average of 30 big-name stocks, which had been up 18.1 percent for
the year at its peak, now is just 1.8 percent above where it ended
1997.

Barcelona sign Argentine midfielder Pellegrino

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP)_ Barcelona FC signed Argentine midfielder
Mauricio Pellegrino on Friday for one season, with an option to
keep him for two more.
	   The team said it agreed to pay Pellegrino's team, Velez
Sarsfield, dlrs 2 million for this season, with a clause calling
for an additional dlrs 4 million payment if it decides to keep him
for two additional seasons.
	   Pellegrino, who did not play for Argentina's World Cup team,
arrived in Spain earlier Friday for a medical checkup as
negotiations for his signing were underway.
	   Pelligrino's signing, in place of the failed acquisition of
Frank De Boer came just ahead of Friday night's deadline to sign
players for Spanish league games. But it was too late for Barcelona
coach Louis Van Gaal to include him in European matches.
	   Pellegrino, 26, has played for Velez Sarsfield since 1991.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council unanimously adopted a
resolution Friday condemning attacks on U.N. personnel in
Afghanistan and the detention of Iranian diplomats.
	   The Russian-initiated resolution passed 15-0. It expressed
``grave concern at the continued Afghan conflict'' and deplored
foreign involvement in the fighting despite the council's repeated
pleas.
	   Before voting, many governments noted Afghanistan had become an
``exporter of drugs and terrorism'' and urged combatants toward a
``political settlement.''
	   Neighboring Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and
other support to the ruling Taliban, who are suspected of operating
terrorists camps in Afghanistan. Iran is believed to be backing the
minority northern-based opposition.
	   Before the vote, Muhammad Najm Akbar, the deputy Pakistani
ambassador, denied Pakistan's involvement and asked the
international community ``to accord formal recognition'' to the
Taliban.
	   The Taliban wants Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations,
currently held by former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of
the alliance fighting the Taliban.
	   Since 1994, the Taliban has captured most of Afghanistan,
including the capital, Kabul. Under its strict Islamic
interpretation, girls are barred from school, most women are
confined to their homes, and music, movies and television are
banned.
	   Russia, a permanent council member, fears the entrenchment of a
radical Islamic state could bring an influx of refugees and weapons
into Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban of detaining 47 Iranians since Aug.
8. The resolution condemned the action and demanded ``safe and
dignified passage out of Afghanistan'' for all Iranian nationals.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about missing Iranian
diplomats, but admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of
arming its opponents. Iran has warned of unspecified consequences
unless the Iranians are freed.

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ FC Barcelona signed Dutch forward
Patrick Kluivert on Friday in a dlrs 14 million transfer from AC
Milan one day before the Spanish league starts.
	   The deal was reached just before a Friday midnight deadline to
sign players before league play starts on Saturday.
	   Barcelona director Joan Gaspart met for six hours with Milan's
vice president Adriano Galliani and general manager Ariedo Braida
before concluding the deal, under which Kluivert signed a four-year
contract.
	   AC Milan had already has rejected offers from English clubs
Arsenal and Manchester United to transfer the 22-year-old Kluivert.
	   At Barcelona he will once again be under coach Louis Van Gaal,
who helped him rise to international stardom while at Ajax of
Amsterdam. He will not be able to play in any European Champions
League games until the new year, however.
	   Kluivert joined Milan last year but had a disappointing first
season with the Italian club.

Libya says UN resolution threatens a Lockerbie settlement

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS fresh quotes from Gadhafi and edits to conform grafs

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ By threatening new strictures against Libya,
the U.N. Security Council resolution on the Lockerbie suspects
could jeopardize their standing trial in the Netherlands, the Libya
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
	   In a long statement read on Libya state television, the ministry
urged talks ``as soon as possible'' on bringing the men to trial
but raised a number of criticisms of the Security Council
resolution on bringing the men to justice.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi reiterated the call for talks with
the United States and Britain in a live interview with Qatari
television later Friday.
	   ``We have accepted the trial in a third country and now they
(U.S. and Britain) should enter negotiations,'' Gadhafi told
Al-Jazeera television channel.
	   The Libyan demand flies in the face of the U.S. and British
governments who have said their offer of a trial in the Netherlands
is non-negotiable. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
the proposal was a matter of ``take or leave it.''
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to suspend
sanctions against Libya once it turns over two men charged with the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   The resolution warned Libya that the council would ``consider
additional measures if the two accused have not arrived or appeared
for trial promptly.''
	   Council diplomats did not say what the additional measures might
entail, but previously U.S. lawmakers have proposed an oil embargo
on Libya. The current sanctions ban air travel to and from the
country, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit
sales of oil equipment.
	   In a broadcast monitored in Cairo, Libyan television quoted the
Foreign Ministry as saying: ``The threat of tightening the
sanctions and applying more pressure to Libya ... is nothing more
than a scheme to abort this solution and to find an excuse to
escalate the sanctions on Libya and its people.''
	   The ministry also objected to the resolution's offer to suspend
the embargo only when the suspects are handed over.
	   It said the sanctions ``should be lifted as soon as an agreement
is signed between Libya and the countries concerned on the
arrangements and guarantees for the suspects to stand trial in the
Netherlands.''
	   Gadhafi developed the point in his interview, saying the
sanctions ``should be lifted and not suspended.'' The U.S.-British
plan envisages the abolition of the sanctions only at the end of
the trial.
	   In what appeared to be an admission of a violation of sanctions,
Gadhafi said a Libyan plane had flown to Sudan on Friday. He said
the flight was not ``provocative'' but humanitarian as the plane
was carrying medicine to make up for the stocks destroyed in last
week's U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum.
	   Asked what would happen if the court in the Netherlands called
for Libyan officials to testify, Gadhafi said: ``these are things
that should be discussed ... there must be negotiations.''
	   ``There must be international guarantees,'' Gadhafi said,
referring to the security and treatment of the Libyan suspects in
the Netherlands.
	   In London on Friday, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain
would be happy to clarify any points that Libya might raise, but
that the offer was ``totally non-negotiable.''
	   ``There are comprehensive safeguards and assurances of a safe
trial,'' the spokesman said, speaking on terms of customary
anonymity.

Ajax handed three points by out-of-position keeper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam seized its second
victory of the new season Friday, downing Roda JC Kerkrade 2-0 with
a little help from Roda's Australian goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac.
	   After a messy first half Ajax winger Peter Hoekstra broke the
deadlock on 56 minutes after Kalac rushed out to claim a corner but
misjudged his jump and was left groping helplessly for the ball.
	   Roda created some chances but wasted them with wild shooting and
Tijani Babangida decided the game in Ajax's favor with just seven
minutes left on the clock.
	   The tiny Nigerian winger had recovered all his pace after a
recent injury layoff, and his acceleration near the righthand
corner of the penalty area left Roda defenders standing.
	   Babangida's dipping near-post drive caught Kalac again out of
position and he could only parry the ball into his own net.
	   Champion Ajax now heads the Dutch premiership with six points
from two games but all the other sides play their second matches
Saturday and Sunday.

Ajax handed three points by out-of-position keeper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam seized its second
victory of the new season Friday, downing Roda JC Kerkrade 2-0 with
a little help from Roda's Australian goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac.
	   After a messy first half Ajax winger Peter Hoekstra broke the
deadlock on 56 minutes after Kalac rushed out to claim a corner but
misjudged his jump and was left groping helplessly for the ball.
	   Roda created some chances but wasted them with wild shooting and
Tijani Babangida decided the game in Ajax's favor with just seven
minutes left on the clock.
	   The tiny Nigerian winger had recovered all his pace after a
recent injury layoff, and his acceleration near the righthand
corner of the penalty area left Roda defenders standing.
	   Babangida's dipping near-post drive caught Kalac again out of
position and he could only parry the ball into his own net.
	   Champion Ajax now heads the Dutch premiership with six points
from two games but all the other sides play their second matches
Saturday and Sunday.

Mexican stocks end higher on Yeltsin remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican stocks staged a solid rebound and
closed sharply higher Friday, buoyed by remarks by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The market's key IPC index closed up 98.43 points, or 3.2
percent, at 3,154.14 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at
5,229.35.
	   Volume was 1.01 billion pesos on 119.5 million shares traded,
compared with Thursday's volume of 106.9 million shares worth 1.03
billion.
	   In early trading, Mexican stock prices broke through the
psychological support mark of 3000 points, reaching a low of
2,964.65 points.
	   But stocks bounced back after Yeltsin pledged to remain in
office until his term expires in 2000. He said it was necessary for
Russia to fulfill its stabilization program and minimize price
rises after the ruble's recent 34 percent devaluation.
	   Analysts have raised fears the Russia's economic weakness will
spread to Latin America.

Chelsea defeats Real Madrid 1-0 with late strike EDS: ADDS quotes
</HEADLINE>
from Chelsea coach Vialli
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Substitute Gustavo Poyet fired a late winner to
give Chelsea a 1-0 victory over Real Madrid in the UEFA Supercup
Final Friday.
	   The English club's goal came in the 82nd minute, when Gianfranco
Zola found space inside the penalty area and stroked the ball back
to Poyet, who shot low into the corner of the net from 15 meters
(yards).
	   In front of 10,000 spectators in Monaco, Real Madrid and Chelsea
- which met in the 1971 Cup Winners' Cup final but were both making
their first appearance in a Supercup final - produced few
goalscoring chances in a largely lifeless match.
	   ''We were a little afraid of Real Madrid in the first half
because they have so many great players,'' said Chelsea's Italian
coach Gianluca Vialli.
	   ''We did not play at our best, but physically Real Madrid were
still behind us because the Spanish season hasn't started yet,'' he
said.
	   ''At Chelsea we are trying to move forward each year and this
win is another step.''

Daly thanks playing partners for support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Before John Daly teed off in the
second round of the Greater Vancouver Open on Friday, he thanked
Corey Pavin and David Frost for their support after he burst into
tears and began shaking during the opening round.
	   ``It was definitely a tough day,'' Daly said Friday in a
interview with TSN. ``But what Corey and David did for helping me
through it, ... I just can't thank them enough.''
	   Daly, who is struggling through a difficult year with his play
and an ongoing battle with alcoholism, began shaking terribly at
the 15th hole Thursday. Looking distraught and haggard, he crossed
his arms on his chest and walked around the green, tears coming
down his face.
	   Both Pavin and Frost comforted Daly, who put on a second jacket
to ward off a chill even though temperatures were in the mid-80s.
	   Daly finished with a 3-over-par 74 on Thursday but declined to
speak with reporters. There were reports he would withdraw from the
tournament.
	   Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA and 1995 British Open, looked
collected when talking about the incident before Friday's round. He
said a similar bout of shakes caused him to walk off the course at
the 1997 U.S Open.
	   ``I knew more what to do this time than there,'' he said. ``It's
part of the program.
	   ``I've called everybody I know pretty much and they said `You're
right where you're supposed to be. We know you're sober.'
	   ``The first two years are very difficult in this program. It's
the hardest part. The shakes are going to come and go and some are
going to last longer than others.''
	   Daly, 32, said he's overwhelmed from the support he's received
from other professionals on the PGA Tour.
	   ``All the players on the tour have showed me so much respect and
it means an awful lot,'' he said. ``No matter what happens we're
all just one when it comes to life.
	   ``I've learned so much from these guys.''
	   After a decent start, Daly's year has gone downhill. In his last
four tournaments, he has missed the cut three times and been
disqualified after completing three rounds at the St. Jude Classic.
	   Earlier this month, he threatened not to play another PGA Tour
event this year and refused to talk to reporters at the 36-hole
Fred Meyer exhibition event in Portland, Ore. last weekend.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi offered Friday
to send a lawyer to defend U.S. President Bill Clinton in the case
arising from his relationship with a former White House intern.
	   In an interview with the Qatari television channel Al-Jazeera,
Gadhafi spoke of world leaders past and present and confirmed
reports of a British-sponsored attempt to assassinate him in 1996.
	   Gadhafi said the scandal of Clinton's involvement with Monica
Lewinsky was instigated by the American Jewish lobby which, he
added, was behind all the president's actions.
	   ``Even this Monica (case), was organized by Jews. It is a Jewish
and Zionist conspiracy,'' Gadhafi said in an interview with Qatar's
	   ``I have no bad intentions towards (Clinton), and I was willing
to send him a lawyer to defend him.''
	   ``He is a victim. Even the strikes against Sudan, Afghanistan
and Baghdad are the work of Zionism,'' Gadhafi said, referring to
U.S. cruise missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan last week and
previously against Iraq.
	   Gadhafi blasted former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who ordered
an air attack on Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the bombing of a
Berlin discotheque in which two U.S. servicemen were killed. Libya
said 37 people, including an adopted daughter of Gadhafi, were
killed in the attack.
	   ``Clinton is not Reagan, who was ridiculous, an idiot,
aggressive and behaved like a cowboy. When I used to tell people he
is crazy, they used to say no. Now it has become clear because he
is suffering from (Alzheimer's disease),'' Gadhafi said.
	   The Libyan leader revealed a soft spot for British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, whom he described as ``the young man ruling
Britain now (who) is not like (former Prime Minister Margaret)
Thatcher, who was full of spite. He is a man with whom we have no
problem.''
	   Gadhafi confirmed recent allegations of a plot to kill him.
	   A former British agent, David Shayler, told British media this
month that Britain's Secret Intelligence Service channeled about
dlrs 160,000 to an Islamic group to kill Gadhafi by planting a bomb
under a road. The BBC reported that the attempt was carried out in
February 1996 and killed several people. The British government
denied any role in the affair.
	   Gadhafi compared the attempt and the 1986 bombing to the blowing
up of a U.S. airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 that left
270 people dead.
	   ``How can we talk about Lockerbie and forget the massacre of
1986, and how do we talk about Lockerbie and forget the
assassination attempt that the British intelligence organized,'' he
said.
	   He warned that Libya would pursue the perpetrators of the 1986
and 1996 attacks in the same way that the United States and Britain
had pursued the two suspects in the Lockerbie case.

Garcia topples Kuchar at U.S. Amateur, marches toward rare double
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia
toppled defending champion Matt Kuchar 2 and 1 Friday in the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur, keeping on course for a rare
trans-Atlantic double in amateur golf.
	   ``If I was to lose, that was the way I wanted to go out,''
Kuchar said after a dramatic match-play duel at Oak Hill sprinkled
with seven hole-winning birdies.
	   ``I ran into El Nino, I guess,'' the 20-year-old said with a
deprecating smile, referring to Garcia's nickname. With both
expected to turn pro next year, he added, ``hopefully we can
re-live this at a Ryder Cup.''
	   Garcia, 18, who won the British Amateur in June, will take on
Tom McKnight, 44, a one-time pro, in Saturday's semifinal. Hank
Kuehne, a recovering alcoholic who survived a scary car crash in
1995, meets Bill Lunde in the other semifinal.
	   Just four golfers have won the British and U.S. Amateur titles
in the same year _ Harold Hilton in 1911, Robert T. Jones Jr. in
1930, W. Lawson Little Jr. in both 1934 and 1935, and Robert B.
Dickson in 1967.
	   ``I'm just thinking, `Keep playing well and try to make the
final and try to win it,''' Garcia said. ``I'm not thinking about
the double. If I win, I will think that.''
	   Garcia drew first blood on the second hole, sinking a putt for
the first of four birdies to go 1-up.
	   Kuchar fluffed his chip on the par-5 4th, then drew a roar from
the thousands of spectators circling the green by holing out from a
green-side bunker to level the match. He went ahead for the first
and only time on the seventh, slotting home a 25-footer (7 1/2
meters) for his second of three birdies.
	   On the par-4 12th, Kuchar hooked his drive badly, caught a tree
branch with his approach shot and landed in deep rough. Unable to
make the green with his chip shot, he conceded the hole.
	   Garcia almost reached the green with a 300-yard (275-meter)
drive on the narrow par-4 14th, chipped to 5 feet (1.5 meters) and
regained the lead. But Kuchar surged right back again with a birdie
on the par-3 15th.
	   The 16th hole proved decisive. After a wayward drive, Garcia hit
a high wedge over trees and sank an 8-footer. Kuchar then missed
from 7 feet.
	   On the 17th, Kuchar landed in a bunker behind the green, then
hit his ball 12 feet (3.6 meters) past. After Garcia barely missed
a 25-foot (7.5-meter) putt for birdie, Kuchar's final putt drifted
left. He was already applauding his opponent as it slipped by.
	   The last foreign-born player to reach the U.S. Amateur
semifinals was Manny Zerman of South Africa in 1991. He was beaten
in the final by Mitch Voges of Simi Valley, California.

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Qualifier Sebastien Grosjean of
France upset top-seeded Jonas Bjorkman 7-6 (9-7), 6-1 Friday to
advance to the semifinals of the MFS Pro Tennis Championship at the
Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Bjorkman had appeared headed to win the first set but
double-faulted in the tiebreaker at set point. Grosjean, whose best
previous showing had been a fourth-round appearance at Wimbledon,
then rallied to win the tiebreaker and a convincing second-set
victory.
	   Bjorkman, of Sweden, was frustrated with his defeat.
	   ``I think if you pressure him, you can defeat him,'' Bjorkman
said. ``I made too many mistakes. That was the difference today. I
lost it more than he won it.''
	   In another quarterfinal Friday, Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands
beat countryman and defending champion Sjeng Schalken 0-6, 6-4,
6-3.
	   Haarhuis fought off three break points in the second set and
came back to win it by breaking Schalken in the seventh game.
	   ``I started moving better,'' Haarhuis said. ``When he was
playing so well, I just tried to stay in it.''
	   Haarhuis and Schalken held serve and were tied 3-3 in the third
set.
	   Haarhuis then changed tactics, employing a serve and volley
game. He broke Schalken in the seventh game and went on to register
10 consecutive points, winning the final three games.
	   ``The momentum definitely turned in the third set,'' Haarhuis
said. ``In the last three games of the match, he mentally wasn't
there anymore.''

	   CONCORD, Massachusetts (AP) _ Bobby Stroble rolled in a 30-foot
(9-meter) birdie putt on the 18th hole to complete a course
record-tying 64 and take a one-shot lead in the BankBoston Senior
PGA Tour Classic on Friday.
	   Stroble's 8-under-par round over the Nashawtuc Country Club
course provided a one-stroke lead over Frank Conner. George Archer
shot a 66.
	   Finishing at 5-under 67 were John Inman, Ed Dougherty, Gibby
Gilbert, Douglas L. Geiberger, and Walter Hall shot 67s.
	   Stroble's round tied the course record set by Bruce Crampton in
1986 and tied twice each by Dale Douglass and Chi Chi Rodriguez as
well as by Kermit Zarley and Tommy Aaron.
	   Friday's round was an adventure for Stroble, who hit just 12
greens yet needed only 23 putts, thanks to a new putter.
	   ``This is a course that I've played well,'' he said. ``A few
holes don't set up well for me, but otherwise I like the course.''
	   Stroble, who was 4-under at the turn, birdied Nos. 10, 12 and 14
to get to 7-under before taking the outright lead on 18. He saved
pars out of bunkers on 11 and 16.
	   Conner, one of just two people to have played in the U.S. Open
in golf and tennis, had his putter working on the front nine,
shooting a 5-under 31.
	   ``I didn't putt as well on the back nine,'' said Conner, who
birdied 10 and 18.
	   Archer, who completed a comeback from hip replacement surgery by
winning the First of America Classic two weeks ago in Michigan,
came back from a bogey at No. 17 with a birdie at No. 18 for a 66.
	   ``I'm driving the ball OK, but it's still hard for me to hit the
long irons,'' Archer said. ``I'm lucky to be playing so I don't
complain.''

Duval, Woods, Parry tied for lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ David Duval shot a ``boring'' 4-under-par 66,
Tiger Woods made a run at taming ``The Monster'' and Craig Parry
inched closer to his first U.S. win while sharing the lead through
Friday's second round of the NEC World Series of Golf.
	   The three stand at 5-under 135 midway through the elite
winners-only tournament, which pays dlrs 405,000 to the winner.
That would go a long way toward moving Duval, second on the tour in
earnings, or Woods, who is third, to the top spot.
	   At one time or another five players had at least a share of the
lead. Duval had the lead to himself as he teed off on the final
hole, thanks to a bogey by Woods who was unable to get up and down
out of a bunker at the 14th.
	   But then Woods chipped in for a birdie at 15 at almost the same
time Parry was rolling in a birdie putt at 14 and there was again a
threesome atop the leaderboard.
	   First-round leader Phil Mickelson, hooking his drives into
trouble four times, had a 71 and was two shots back.
	   The pack at 1-under 139 included leading money-winner and PGA
champion Vijay Singh, British Open and Masters winner Mark O'Meara,
Justin Leonard, Scott Hoch and Loren Roberts.
	   ``If there was ever a boring four under, that was it,'' Duval
said after a four-birdie, no-bogey day. His 66 matched O'Meara for
lowest second-round score.
	   Woods opened with two of his five birdies but his most
sensational holes came when he saved par. At the par-4 9th, he hit
his drive left and had to hit a 60-degree sand wedge through a gap
in the trees half the size of a coffee table. He did, rolling the
ball on the front of the green and then two-putting for par.
	   At the 16th _ Firestone Country Club's famed 625-yard
(569-meter) signature hole known as ``The Monster'' _ Woods hit a
350-yard (319-meter) drive, then pulled out a 3-wood while the
gallery massed along the ropes urged him to go for the green in
two. He flew the ball 285 yards (259 meters), clearing a greenside
trap and landing in heavy rough off the back left corner of the
green. From there he chipped 15 feet (4.5 meters) past and
two-putted for another par.
	   Parry has played PGA Tour events since 1992 but has yet to win
on U.S. soil.
	   Starting the round a shot behind Mickelson, he found himself
leading after dropping an 18-footer for birdie at No. 15.
	   But at the 17th, he found trouble right of the green with his
6-iron second shot and was unable to get up and down to save par,
falling back into the tie at the top.
	   Before play started, U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen was
disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard after taking too
long to hit his second putt on the 17th hole in the opening round.
Janzen waited for more than 20 seconds _ twice the time permitted
by Rule 16-2 of the Rules of Golf _ with the ball falling into the
cup just as he walked up to tap it in. After finishing a 78 that
left him 43rd in the 44-player field, he marked his card for a
birdie 3 instead of taking a self-imposed penalty shot for a par.
	   ``Strange things happen on the course sometimes and this was one
of them,'' Janzen said before leaving the course.
	   Janzen still got to collect the dlrs 18,475 in unofficial
earnings for finishing last.

defeated Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 6-4, 2-6, 6-1, and Paul Haarhuis
of the Netherlands beat countryman and defending champion Sjeng
Schalken 0-6, 6-4, 6-3.
	   Chang, who was broken twice in the second set, easily won the
third set as Pozzi seemed to wear down at the end of the match.
	   Pozzi broke Chang in the second game of the first set before
Chang rallied.
	   ``The first set was when I had my chances,'' Pozzi said. ``I
played well in the second set. He's very good, but if I had won
that first set, the match would have been mine.''
	   Pozzi won the second set with breaks in the fifth and seventh
games, dominating the set with a strong baseline game that kept
Chang off-balance.
	   Chang, however, resumed control in the final set. He broke Pozzi
in the second game and went to a 4-1 lead. He again broke Pozzi in
the sixth game and served out for the match.
	   Haarhuis fought off three break points in the second set and
came back to win it by breaking Schalken in the seventh game.
	   ``I started moving better,'' Haarhuis said. ``When he was
playing so well, I just tried to stay in it.''
	   Haarhuis and Schalken held serve and were tied 3-3 in the third
set.
	   Haarhuis then changed tactics, employing a serve and volley
game. He broke Schalken in the seventh game and went on to register
10 consecutive points, winning the final three games.
	   ``The momentum definitely turned in the third set,'' Haarhuis
said. ``In the last three games of the match, he mentally wasn't
there anymore.''

Undefeated Jones heads USA Team

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Marion Jones, undefeated in 28 consecutive
finals in five different events over the past six months, heads the
USA Track and Field team announced Friday for next month's World
Cup in South Africa.
	   The positions on the team were determined at the USATF national
championships held in June. USATF is taking a 43-member team to the
competition, scheduled for Sept. 11-13 in Johannesburg. It will be
the first time ever that the sport's national governing body is
sending a track and field team to South Africa.
	   Jones will compete in the 100 and 200 meters, the long jump and
the 400-meter relay and could earn dlrs 160,000 by winning all four
events. More important, it will be another step on the road the
22-year-old wants to travel to become the first track and field
athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics at Sydney in two
years.
	   The U.S. team will be competing against seven others in the
finals-only competition. The other teams are Africa, The Americas,
Asia, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), Europe and the two
national teams from the recent European Championships. In men's
competition, the winners were Germany and Great Britain. The
women's champions were Germany and Russia.
	   Jones will be seeking to extend a streak that has included 14
victories at 100 meters, five in the 200 and eight in the long
jump. They've come in five states, 12 countries and on four
different continents and in June she became the first women's
triple winner in the 100, 200 and long jump at the USA
Championships since 1948.
	   The men's team includes John Godina, who at the national
championships recorded the first sweep of the shot and discus since
1955, when Hall of Famer Parry O'Brien did it for the first time
since 1925.
	   Godina, a silver medalist in the shot at the 1996 Olympics, is a
two-time USA Track and Field discus champion and the 1998 world
leader in the shot and discus.
	   The only defending World Cup champion to represent the United
States in individual competition will be Mark Everett in the 800.
	   Other key performers on the men's team include Charles Austin in
the high jump, Jeff Hartwig in the pole vault and Bob Kennedy, the
American record-holder in the 3,000 at 7:30.84.
	   The women's team includes Kim Batten, the holder of the world
record in the 400 hurdles; American record-holder Jearl Miles-Clark
in the 800; and veteran American distance star Suzy Hamilton in the
1,500.
	   The U.S. men's team will be seeking to win the World Cup for the
fourth time, while the women have never finished higher than
fourth. Africa is the defending men's champion and Europe is the
defending women's champion.
	   Retired Princeton coach Larry Ellis was selected as head coach
of the men's team and his assistants include 1996 Olympian Willie
Davenport. Former Stanford coach Brooks Johnson will lead the
women's team. Ellis and Johnson were also the head coaches at the
Atlanta Olympics in 1996.

Poll shows one in four Britons ``less positive'' about royal family
</HEADLINE>
12 months after Diana

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Almost exactly a year after the death of Princess
Diana, more than one in four Britons feel less positive about their
royal family than they did 12 months ago, a newspaper poll
published Saturday reported.
	   The NOP poll published in The Express, a middle market national
tabloid newspaper, reported that 25.8 percent of the 1,200 adults
questioned said their opinion of the royal family had fallen in the
past 12 months, although a slightly larger number, 28.2 percent,
said that their feelings towards the royals had improved.
	   The newspaper said that 42.9 percent of people questioned said
their opinion had remained unchanged since Diana's death in a Paris
car crash on Aug. 31.
	   The newspaper, which did not report a date when the telephone
poll was taken, also said that 65.1 percent of Britons wanted the
anniversary of Princess Diana's death remembered.
	   The Express did not give a margin of error for its poll, but
polls of similar size have a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
	   On Wednesday, a poll for The Times newspaper reported that the
popularity of Prince Charles has soared in the year since Princess
Diana died.
	   The poll gave Princess Diana's former husband a 63 percent
approval rating, up from 42 percent before Diana's death, while
Queen Elizabeth II had a 73 percent approval rating. The poll of
994 adults was conducted by the research group MORI.

Track stars urge cancellation of Moscow final over economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ International track stars on Friday
demanded next week's final of the Grand Prix season be moved from
Moscow because of the economic turmoil gripping Russia.
	   ``We feel that its an insult to go to Moscow and leave with
million dollar prizes,'' said U.S. sprint star Jon Drummond.
	   ``I feel our safety is also a factor,'' he added after winning
the 200 meters at the Van Damme Memorial event in Brussels.
	   Drummond said he would be present a petition signed by about 50
of the world's top athletes calling for the Grand Prix final
scheduled for Sept. 5 to moved to ``a more serene venue.''
	   Track stars signing the petition included Morocco's 1,500-meter
star Hicham El Guerrouj; Kenya's 3,000-meter world record holder
Daniel Komen and World 200-meter and 400-meter champion Michael
Johnson, Drummond said.
	   ``It's not what the sport is about. With the situation the way
it is at present it could be dangerous.'' said Johnson.
	   ``I don't think there's anyone in Russia right now who wants to
watch an athletics meet.''
	   Drummond said the athletes were not planning a mass boycott of
the Moscow event, but would decided individually whether to compete
if it goes ahead. He said would not be going as did world 100-meter
champion Maurice Greene.
	   ``I'm not going to the final in Moscow because I'm afraid,''
Greene said.
	   However, U.S. sprint star Marion Jones and Ireland's 1,500-meter
runner Sonia O'Sullivan said they intended to compete in Moscow if
the event went ahead.
	   Jones is one of four athletes still in contention for the dlrs 1
million Golden League Jackpot prize up for grabs in Moscow.
	   ``I've no control over what's going on in Moscow. I'm an
athlete, I'm going to compete,'' Jones told reporters. ``A lot of
athletes have expressed concern. I'm not concerned.''
	   Drummond said the athletes' worries had come to a head a meeting
in Brussels. He said many American track stars were also worried
about competing in next month's World Cup in Johannesburg, South
Africa, following the recent bombing of an American restaurant in
Cape Town.
	   ``The majority of people feel the same about Johannesburg as
they do about Russia,'' Drummond told reporters.
	   But Maria Mutola, the middle-distance runner from Mozambique,
sought to reassure her fellow athletes about competing in South
Africa.
	   ``I disagree about Johannesburg ... there's no problem at all
concerning safety of athletes,'' she said after winning the the
1,000 meters in Brussels.
	   Jones said she would not change her plans to run for the United
States in Johannesburg. ``I'm very exited about that. It will be
the first time I'm going to Africa.''

Taylor misses attempt at comeback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AARHUS, Denmark (AP) _ Meldrick Taylor missed an attempt at a
comeback Friday when Hasan Al of Denmark outpointed the former
featherweight champion in a non-title welterweight bout.
	   The judges gave a 3-0 win to Al, a 26-year Dane who started the
10-round fight aggressively by repeatedly pounding Taylor whom he
easily cornered.
	   Taylor, 31, who has been struggling for a comeback since his
1990 defeat to Julio Cesar Chavez, woke up in the fifth round as
the physically strong Dane slowed down.
	   In the last rounds, Al regained his confidence and gave Taylor
several right uppercuts and deep punches.
	   Before the Friday night bout in this northern Denmark town, the
31-year-old Taylor of Philadelphia had promised Danish media it
would be his ``rebirth.''
	   He hadn't fought since Nov. 26, 1996, when he dropped a 10-round
split decision to Darren Maciunski. Taylor won a gold medal as a
featherweight at the 1984 Olympics and went on to win the IBF
junior welterweight and WBA welterweight belts.
	   Taylor now holds a record of 35-6-1. A former European
welterweight champion, Al is undefeated in 13 bouts.

Novotna advances to final

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Reigning Wimbledon champion Jana
Novotna overcame some early mistakes to beat unseeded Julie
Halard-Decugis of France 6-4, 6-4 Friday and advance to the finals
of the Pilot Pen International.
	   Novotna, the No. 2 seed, plays the winner of the semifinal
between Steffi Graf and top seed and defending champion Lindsay
Davenport, who was playing with a strained right wrist.
	   Halard-Decugis, who missed all of last year with wrist, knee and
shoulder injuries, had not beaten Novotna in their previous five
matches but quickly had the 29-year-old down a break in the first
set for a 3-0 lead. Her strong baseline play and crosscourt winners
kept Novotna off the net.
	   ``My game plan was to come in much more, but unfortunately I
couldn't do that,'' Novotna said.
	   Instead, she countered with pin-point passes and deep-angled
winners to move the rangy Halard-Decugis around the court.
	   ``I just needed to be more consistent, move her around a little
bit and let her work for her shots,'' Novotna said.
	   Novotna battled back from 0-30 in their final game, hitting two
straight sideline winners. Halard-Decugis forced a deuce with a
blistering crosscourt shot. Novotna regained the next point with a
deft drop shot and won on her next serve when Halard-Decugis'
return was long.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A leading Mexican novelist who heads an
international writers organization said Friday that he has been
receiving anonymous death threats, and asked the government to
investigate them more thoroughly.
	   Homero Aridjis, president of the London-based PEN International,
told a news conference that he and family members had received
about a dozen telephone threats since Nov. 27, 1997, and law
enforcement authorities had failed to trace them.
	   He said the state intelligence service had no leads on the
calls, which were all made in different voices and continued even
when he toured America and Canada.
	   ``This is affecting me, my writing, my thinking, my freedom of
expression and my human rights,'' said Aridjis. ``I don't see why a
human being like me should continue to stand for all this.''
	   Aridjis played for reporters one of the messages left on his
answering machine: ``Dog ... I'm looking for you, dog. Today soon
you will die like a dog. I have you within my sights.''
	   He said he could not speculate who might be behind these
threats, but he said the calls were made by ``professionals of
intimidation.''
	   PEN International and several other writers organizations have
sent President Ernesto Zedillo letters expressing concern about
Aridjis' safety and asking the government to investigate.
	   The PEN letter was signed by writers including Edward Albee,
Anthony Appiah, Arthur Miller, Nadine Gordimer, Jamaica Kincaid,
Susan Sontag and Mario Vargas Llosa.
	   The PEN letter said Aridjis was most recently threatened a few
days ago, and that the threats occurred after public appearances
and press interviews regarding human rights.
	   Aridjis, 58, is a well-known poet, novelist, newspaper columnist
and environmental activist. He is also a former Mexican ambassador
to Switzerland and the Netherlands.
	   Over the years, he has made enemies by campaigning to have the
government enact environmental laws protecting monarch butterflies
and sea turtles, which faced extinction in Mexico.
	   His latest campaign has been to prevent the development of a
giant salt works by a Japanese company and the Mexican government
at San Ignacio Lagoon, an area off the Baja California peninsula
where gray whales give birth.

Angels acquire Jefferies from Phillies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The Anaheim Angels, who failed to make a
significant deal at the trade deadline four weeks ago, acquired
outfielder Gregg Jefferies from the Philadelphia Phillies for a
player to be named Friday.
	   Jefferies, hit .295 with eight homers and 48 RBIs in 124 games
for the Phillies.
	   In addition, the Angels activated right-hander Ken Hill, who
started Friday night's game against the Red Sox.
	   The American League West-leading Angels entered Friday's action
with a 2{-game lead over the Texas Rangers.
	   Hill, 8-5 with a 5.15 ERA, was making his first big-league
appearance since undergoing surgery June 15 to remove bone chips
and shave down bone spurs in his pitching elbow.
	   A further move will be made when Jefferies joins the Angels,
which he's expected to do before Saturday's game.
	   A switch hitter, Jefferies, 31, has a lifetime batting average
of .292 with 1,488 hits including 278 doubles, 27 triples and 117
homers.
	   Jefferies joined the Phillies in 1995. Before that, he played
with the New York Mets from 1987-91, the Kansas City Royals in
1992, and the St. Louis Cardinals in 1993-94.

Fairly strong earthquake rattles Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake shook Tokyo and its
surrounding areas Saturday morning, but there were no immediate
reports of injuries or serious damage.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4 was centered in
the Tokyo Bay about 70 kilometers (40 miles) deep underground, the
Central Meteorological Agency said.
	   The earthquake, which rattled shelves and windows for several
seconds, struck at 8:46 a.m. (2346 GMT Friday), it said.
	   The agency said there were no dangers of tsunami, or undersea
waves set off by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   The quake shook Tokyo and nearby prefectures (state), including
Chiba, Tochigi, Kanagawa and Saitama, the agency said.
	   Japanese media reports said bullet trains in areas near Tokyo
temporarily stopped running as a precaution but restarted in less
than a half-hour.
	   Temblors of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage, if it
strikes a residential area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Russian crisis casts shadow over final to IAAF season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia's financial and economic crisis
is casting a shadow over sports with international track stars
saying they want next week's final of the Grand Prix season moved
from Moscow.
	   ``We feel that its an insult to go to Moscow and leave with
million dollar prizes,'' American sprint star Jon Drummond said
Friday after winning the 200 meters at the Van Damme Memorial Grand
Prix event here. ``I feel our safety is also a factor.''
	   Drummond planned to sent a petition, signed by about 50 top
athletes, urging the IAAF to move the Sept. 5 Moscow meet to ``a
more serene venue.''
	   Those who will sign the petition, he said, include Morocco's
1,500-meter star Hicham El Guerrouj; Kenya's 3,000-meter world
record holder Daniel Komen and World 200-meter and 400-meter
champion Michael Johnson.
	   ``With the situation (in Russia) the way it is at present it
could be dangerous.'' Johnson told reporters. ``I don't think
there's anyone in Russia right now who wants to watch an athletics
meet.''
	   No world records were shattered at the Brussels event that was
held in unseasonably chilly weather in front of 47,000 spectators
at the King Baudouon Stadium.
	   World Champion Marion Jones dominated the 100 meters beating
French rival Christine Arron with a time of 10.80. Arron clocked in
at 10.95 seconds. Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones'
dominance after running a blistering 10.73 to win the European
Championship last week.
	   Jones was not impressed by that. ``I've ran against her three
times this year and I've beaten her three times,'' she said after
the Brussels race.
	   Jones blamed the chilly evening for coming in well under her
season's best of 10.71. The cold also thwarted a trio of African
runners to break world records in the 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters
and womens' 1,000 meters.
	   Jones said she had no plans to endorse the move-the-Moscow-venue
petition, telling reporters, ``I'm happy to go. I'm an athlete and
I'm going to compete.''
	   At Brussels, four athletes who are on target for a share of the
dlrs 1 million Golden League Jackpot won their events staying in
contention for the big prize.
	   Apart from Jones, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie ran a season's
best time of 7 minutes, 25.09 seconds to win the 3,000 meters and
Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj won the 1,500 in 3 minutes, 29.68
seconds.
	   Bryan Bronson stayed in the running by winning the 400-meter
hurdles in 48.25 seconds.
	   Kenyan Paul Tergat finished the 10,000 meters in 26 minutes,
46.44 seconds, well short of Gebrselassie's world record. Fellow
Kenyan Daniel Komen fared even worse in his bit to regain the 5,000
record, losing in the final stretch to Ethiopia's Assefa Mezgebu in
another slow time.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola won the 1,000 meters but failed in her
bid to set a new world mark in the rarely run distance.

	   The demonstration by about 100 people did not affect trading and
there was no violence.
	   The protesters urged passers-by to vote in a nationwide
referendum Sunday sponsored by the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party on a dlrs 65 billion bank bailout proposed by President
Ernesto Zedillo.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar accused Peru's government of being authoritarian on Friday
after Congress blocked a referendum on a possible third election
bid by President Alberto Fujimori.
	   The decision by the Fujimori-controlled Congress Thursday night
ended hopes for an opposition-organized referendum call and paved
the way for Fujimori to run again in 2000. He has not officially
said if he will run.
	   Referendum organizers had collected 1.4 million signatures of
people requesting the referendum. Polls showed most Peruvians
oppose Fujimori being allowed to run for a third consecutive term
in office.
	   ``This is a dark day for the republic. The autocracy has taken
off its final mask and stands naked before Peru and the world,''
said Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian, to RadioProgramas radio station.
``The intellectual author of it all is Fujimori.''
	   Fujimori was visiting family members in the United States when
the vote was taken.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Venezuela's energy and mines minister says he
sees world oil prices remaining low in the near future, but
gradually rising over the next three to five years.
	   In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires after arriving in
Mexico City late Thursday, Erwin Arrieta said recent agreements
among petroleum producing nations to lower oil output had also
reduced price volatility.
	   Arrieta was to meet Friday with Mexican Energy Minister Luis
Tellez and other government officials.
	   ``My estimate is that we are faced with a market in a band of
low prices, rising gradually for three to five years,'' Arrieta
said.
	   Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia reached the output agreements
in March and June in an attempt to reduce global supply in the face
of falling world oil prices.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Forty children die every day in
Venezuela from preventable diseases such as measles, diarrhea and
meningitis, according to a UNICEF report.
	   Despite the fact that Venezuela is rich in natural resources and
has more oil reserves than any country outside the Middle East, the
report presented this week in Caracas blamed poverty for much of
the problem.
	   Eight of every 10 Venezuelan children live in poverty, it said.
	   Plummeting international oil prices are wreaking havoc on
Venezuela's economy, forcing the government to cut social programs
and possibly further endangering children's health.
	   Children's mortality rates have declined only slightly in recent
years, from 21.6 per 1,000 in 1992 to 21.0 in 1997, the report
said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a senior U.S. official appealed
for action to save thousands of refugees, Serbs and Albanians are
accusing each other of brutality against civilians caught up in the
savagery of Kosovo's ethnic conflict.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees quoted Albanian
civilians Friday saying 17 people were killed in fierce fighting in
the village of Senik near the former Albanian rebel stronghold of
Malisevo.
	   UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo said U.N. staffers saw eight
bodies, including an infant and a 4-year-old boy who had been
decapitated during shelling.
	   But the brutality was not limited to one side in the conflict,
in which the Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence
for the Serb-ruled province.
	   On Friday, Serb police retrieved bones of 10 Serb civilians, two
of them children, whom officials said were executed by the KLA in
the mountain village of Klecka, which was overrun Thursday by
government forces.
	   Serb authorities took an Associated Press Television crew to the
village, southwest of Pristina. There, police and civilian
volunteers picked through bones of five men, three women and two
children whom officials said were executed by the KLA a month ago.
	   A young man in handcuffs told police that the rebels had
executed the civilians. The youth himself admitted having shot ``a
fat man.''
	   Del Mundo said UNHCR workers saw eight bodies, including an
infant killed by shrapnel and a 4-year-old boy whose head was torn
off. Such accounts underscored the brutality of a conflict which
American and European diplomacy has been powerless to stop.
	   About 265,000 people are believed to have fled the fighting,
which erupted in February when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a campaign to destroy the KLA.
	   Kosovo, whose population is 90 percent Albanian, is a province
of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. diplomats have been trying to set up face-to-face talks
between the Albanians and the Serb-run government to determine the
future of the province. The Americans and Europeans want Milosevic
to restore the autonomy he withdrew in 1989.
	   In Belgrade, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, Julia Taft,
warned of a humanitarian catastrophe unless the fight ceases and
refugees return to their homes within the next six weeks.
	   After that, Taft said, the advent of winter will bring suffering
and death to tens of thousands of people. Taft said she would ask
President Clinton for emergency aid to prevent a disaster.
	   Taft said it was ``absolutely critical that (Yugoslav)
government considers this an emergency and wave restrictions... for
relief workers, getting commodities in and providing for a reduced
military presence.''

Yeltsin says he will not step down, Kremlin takes tough line

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin gathered all his strength at the end
of a tense week to deliver a strong and unequivocal message: I will
not resign.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my Constitutional
term,'' he said in an interview on national television. ``In 2000
there will be an election for a new president and I will not run.''
	   Yeltsin's emphatic denial came after days of feverish
speculation that the president was about to resign or be ousted as
his country plunged into a seemingly bottomless economic decline.
He had not been seen in public since Tuesday, prompting reports
that he had already stepped down.
	   But the president rallied back Friday. He held a series of
meetings designed to demonstrate his control and went on television
to squash talk of stepping down. His aides insisted he would not
bow to opposition demands to share power.
	   Russians, who have weathered one crisis after another in recent
years, were taking the latest one in stride, too. Short lines
formed outside some banks as people tried to change rubles for
dollars, but there was little sign of panic.
	   All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday.
Russian stocks actually rose by 5.7 percent, but trading was very
light and dealers warned that the rise did not signal a market
recovery.
	   Looking calm and speaking easily, Yeltsin said on national
television that he was working to restore stability and he believed
things could be fixed. He acknowledged the crisis, especially the
devaluation of the ruble, would mean more hard times for his people
after years of privation.
	   ``It would be naive to say that we'll take some steps and people
won't suffer,'' he said. ``However as president, I must say that
we'll take every measure to ensure that people don't lose their
savings. I cannot promise that prices won't go up, but as president
I am obligated to do everything to keep it to a minimum.''
	   Earlier, acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin negotiated
with the Communist-dominated Duma, the lower chamber of parliament,
seeking support for his confirmation, which is scheduled for debate
Monday.
	   Chernomyrdin agreed in the talks to Soviet-style measures to
boost state control of the economy as part of efforts to stabilize
the economy, according to some Russian news reports. Measures
included price and currency controls and printing money to reflate
the economy, they said.
	   But the Kremlin appeared to back away from political compromise,
taking a tough line against a separate power-sharing agreement that
would give lawmakers more say over Cabinet appointments and
government policy and curb Yeltsin's powers.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said talks on the political
agreement were stalled. And he took the audacious move of calling
in what he said were likely alternate candidates to Chernomyrdin
for the premiership: Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, upper house speaker
Yegor Stroyev and Yuri Maslyukov, a former senior Soviet official.
	   Reacting swiftly, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with Stroyev and
Luzhkov, who later said they would not be candidates.
	   ``All of us have our own ambitions, but when national interests
are on the agenda we will work together and consolidate our
efforts,'' said Luzhkov, already a top presidential prospect for
the 2000 elections.
	   Under the Constitution, the Duma must approve the prime
minister. If it rejects a candidate three times, Yeltsin can
dissolve the Duma and call parliamentary elections _ an option
Yeltsin said Friday he had no plans to take.
	   The financial crisis began in early summer as tremors from
Asia's economic turmoil reached Moscow and a decline in oil prices
_ Russia's top export _ derailed vital reforms and sent the economy
crashing.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced
leader to replace the youthful Kiriyenko and contain the crisis.
	   In a concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin fired prominent
reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter for the
third time. Both men are hated by the opposition for being the
chief proponents of reform.
	   Yeltsin's press service reiterated that the summit with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Moscow would go ahead as scheduled next
week.

Milosevic ignores the West, turns tough on Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ True to his policies of defiance,
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has once again ignored Western
demands and turned tough on Kosovo, risking further bloodshed and a
humanitarian disaster.
	   The Serb strongman, whose nationalism ignited wars in the
Balkans in the early 1990s, rose to power by abolishing the
autonomy enjoyed in the former Yugoslavia by Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the volatile Serbian
province.
	   Now, he seems bent crushing their armed rebellion _ regardless
of international appeals for a cease-fire and negotiated
settlement.
	   Since Milosevic's crackdown against Kosovo Liberation Army began
in late February, the United States and its Western allies have
switched from appeals for peace to threats with military
intervention in their efforts to halt the Kosovo violence.
	   Despite a clear possibility of a major Balkan bloodbath,
international threats, ranging from ban on Yugoslav flights in and
out of Europe to a NATO show of force in neighboring Albania,
remained just threats.
	   On the diplomatic front, Western efforts to arrange talks
between Milosevic's government and ethnic Albanian pacifist leaders
have failed to produce direct negotiations, mostly because of
ethnic Albanian failure to form a united front.
	   Using the situation to his advantage, Milosevic struck back.
	   In the past several weeks, his police and soldiers have launched
a sweeping offensive against the rebels, uprooting them from most
of their strongholds in Kosovo and sending them deeper into its
rugged hills and forests.
	   The offensive also sent thousands of civilians fleeing, their
houses destroyed in the fighting, hundreds of villages emptied.
International aid agencies estimate about 265,000 people have been
displaced and warn of a catastrophe if they don't return home
before winter.
	   Shaken militarily, the Albanian rebels named a political
representative, Adem Demaci, who has signaled their readiness to
open talks with Milosevic, once he ends the military offensive.
	   But Milosevic refuses to negotiate with ``terrorists.'' In a
statement issued after talks with a U.S. official earlier this
week, Milosevic declared the fight against the militants
``necessary.''
	   A top official in the Serbian government said earlier this month
that Serbia is in ``no hurry'' to negotiate.
	   Meanwhile, his government stalls issuing of visas for
international aid workers. Security forces are accused of targeting
ethnic Albanian aid convoys, burning houses. Hundreds of ethnic
Albanians await trials for alleged terrorist activities.
	   Milosevic's toughness over Kosovo is certain to radicalize the
situation even further, making the possibility of a peaceful
settlement seem almost out of reach, despite constant U.S.
diplomatic efforts.
	   But the Yugoslav president is known not to make concessions
unless he is forced to. A senior Western official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, has called talks with Milosevic ``tough and
difficult,'' and said the Serb strongman has no intention of
backing down.
	   Milan Milosevic, an analyst for the independent weekly Vreme,
believes Milosevic is trying to achieve a good starting point for
future negotiations.
	   ``He is a tough negotiator and if he has a chance he will try to
bargain a price,'' said Milan Milosevic.

	   MALINDI, Kenya (AP) _ Relatives knew Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, a key
suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombing in Kenya, as a deeply
religious, simple fish merchant.
	   Odeh's brother-in-law, Salim Nassor Salim, said he remembered
only one instance in which Odeh veered from his self-contained,
sober demeanor. Salim recalled Odeh grabbing a lit cigarette from
Salim's mouth, clawing Salim's mouth as he did.
	   ``This is not something to be done by a person with a good
mind,'' Salim said of Odeh, who argued that smoking was an insult
to the Prophet Mohammed.
	   As Salim, 35, spoke at the family home in the Indian Ocean town
of Malindi, he recalled his deep unease even after Odeh apologized.
That was more than a year ago, and the two haven't talked since.
	   Odeh was sent to the United States on Thursday _ the second
suspect sent from Kenya to stand trial in the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   ``We were all surprised, shocked,'' Salim said.
	   The bombing of the U.S. Embassy on a busy Nairobi street on Aug.
7 killed 247 people and injured more than 5,400 others. A nearly
simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam killed 11
people.
	   A criminal complaint in U.S. District Court in Manhattan said
Odeh, 33, told FBI agents that the bombings were carried out by an
international terrorist group headed by Islamic militant Osama bin
Laden.
	   Odeh told the FBI he did not participate in the bombings but he
accepted responsibility for them as part of the group he had joined
in 1992, when he pledged to obey the orders of bin Laden, according
to the complaint.
	   Odeh's wife of four years, Nassim Nassor Salim, appeared dazed
on Friday, a day after being released from a week's detention for
questioning by Kenyan police and FBI agents.
	   ``I can say nothing,'' said Nassim, 22, her belly swollen by
pregnancy. The couple's second child is due later this year.
	   Interviewed at the home of her brother in Mombasa, 75 miles (120
kilometers) south of Malindi, she expressed anger that she was not
allowed to see her husband before he was sent to America. She said
she learned of his departure from a newspaper.
	   The house's owner, Omar Nassor Salim, an accountant at the
National Museum of Kenya in Mombasa, remained in police detention
Friday.
	   Nassim refused to discuss the allegations against her husband.
Instead, she stooped to a rug to pray.
	   Until his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the day of the
bombing, relatives said they had no suspicion Odeh was involved in
any extremist groups.
	   They never heard him mention bin Laden.
	   ``He was very kind, very honest and very religious,'' said
Farida Ahmed, Nassim's aunt. The family said Odeh prayed five times
a day, considered television and videos sinful, and read only the
Koran and other religious literature.
	   Asked whether his brother-in-law could have been involved in the
bombing plot, Salim said Odeh's boat often went to ports notorious
for smuggling drugs and weapons.
	   ``It could have been possible,'' he conceded. Odeh, he said,
``kept very much secret.''

Panama weighs future of its president, the canal

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ With memories of dictatorship still fresh,
Panamanians decide this weekend whether to change the constitution
to give their president a shot at re-election.
	   Supporters argue that another term for President Ernesto Perez
Balladares would maintain stability during one of the most
important events in Panama's history: the Dec. 31, 1999, handover
of the Panama Canal and U.S. military land.
	   Critics say it would undermine democracy in a region where many
countries banned re-election to prevent presidents from abusing the
power of their office.
	   Panama's constitution restricts the president to one five-year
term, and re-election is only possible if a leader sits out for two
terms.
	   The next president will be elected in May and take office in
September, three months before the U.S. government turns over the
canal and U.S. military bases.
	   ``The word `stability' scares me,'' says Roberto Eisenmann, a
prominent Panamanian businessman and government critic. ``It's the
good old word that was used to defend dictatorship. ... And there's
nothing more unstable than perpetual governments.''
	   Nine years ago, U.S. forces invaded Panama to oust Gen. Manuel
Noriega, ending 21 years of military rule. Guillermo Endara,
presumed winner of the May 1989 elections annulled by Noriega, took
office. Five years later, he was replaced by Perez Balladares, a
sharp-dressed millionaire and free-market economist who was active
in Noriega's Democratic Revolutionary Party.
	   Perez Balladares, nicknamed ``Bull'' for his burly frame, opened
Panama's markets, privatized the telephone system and other
industries and modernized highways, schools and hospitals.
	   ``Why shouldn't the people have the right to decide whether we
want him or not for five more years?'' says Mario Rognoni, a
businessman and former PRD legislator.
	   A dlrs 5 million donation by the business community helped fund
the pro-Perez Balladares campaign, and U.S. Democratic Party
adviser James Carville was hired to help.
	   Rognoni said opposition parties object to re-election because
they can't take credit for the president's success. ``To them, a
threat to democracy is anything that doesn't put them in power,''
he said.
	   Opponents argue it's time for the Bull to leave the ring.
	   More than 40 percent of Panama's 2.6 million people live below
the poverty level of dlrs 228 a month for a family of five.
Unemployment is at nearly 12 percent. Industry and agriculture
workers have been left behind by Perez Balladares' emphasis on the
service sector.
	   ``Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor,'' Esther
Garcia said Thursday as thousands of anti-re-election marchers
passed her lottery ticket stand in the capital's center.
	   Perez Balladares' administration has been accused of crowding
the Panama Canal Authority, which will oversee the waterway, with
cronies and of improperly allowing two Cabinet members to move into
houses vacated by U.S. officials.
	   The president's supporters say the allegations are unfounded.
	   The debate over re-election would be different if Perez
Balladares were asking the question for a future administration,
Eisenmann says.
	   ``That's a philosophical issue. Should we have re-election or
shouldn't we?'' he said. ``But if you say, `No let's change the
constitution to favor a sitting president' _ that's just immoral.''

Tasmanian voters decide whether to sell off state's hydro-electric
</HEADLINE>
system
 &UR; Eds: Will be led later in day with poll returns. Voting began at
2200 GMT Friday, ends at 0800 GMT Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Tasmanian voters on Saturday faced the
choice of keeping the state's biggest asset, its hydro-electric
system, in government hands or selling it off to private bidders.
	   The opposition Labor Party has pledged to keep the power system;
conservative state Premier Tony Rundle has vowed to sell it to
reduce the economically depressed island state's debt.
	   The conservatives have held power in Tasmania for 16 years, but
polls suggest the island's 322,000 voters will oust them and
install Labor leader Jim Bacon as premier.
	   But a hung Parliament is also possible, which would force a
runoff election later, if the Greens and other minor parties win
the balance of power. Both major parties have vowed not to form a
coalition with minor parties.
	   Rundle called the early election after his minority government
failed to win Green support for privatizing the Hydro-Electric
Corp.
	   The future of the Hydro, which Rundle would privatize so
Tasmania could pay off its 3.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 18.56 billion) debt and which Bacon would keep because he
argues its income stream would soon outweigh the benefits of sale,
is the overriding issue.
	   All analysts believe Labor will win more seats in the 25-member
House of Assembly than any other party.
	   Rundle, 59, and Bacon, 48, give Tasmanians huge contrasts in
substance and style.
	   Premier since the 1996 election and treasurer in the preceding
government of Ray Groom, Rundle is an aggressive former journalist,
real estate agent and port administrator.
	   His vision is for a Tasmania, debt-free and with Australia's
lowest business taxes, reclaiming growth and jobs as new investment
pours in.
	   Bacon is a former union leader whose early work for the Builders
Laborers' Federation in Victoria state on the mainland has made him
the target of a conservative ``union thugs'' smear campaign.
	   He replies that he's always done his best for whoever he's
representing, and he aims to represent all Tasmania.
	   Moreover, his factional and divisive union days are far behind
him _ the best evidence being his 187-27 majority when he was
elected secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council in
1989.
	   Bacon is the more measured performer and superficially he looks
less like an old union brawler than the premier.
	   As he would keep the Hydro, he hasn't the money to promise that
Rundle has. He talks of many small solutions, helped by increased
government intervention.

Cuban playground off limits to most Americans

<TEXT>
	   VARADERO, Cuba (AP) _ This is probably the finest beach in the
world that Americans are not supposed to visit.
	   White sands like sugar give way gradually to a gentle, clear sea
as warm and comforting as a Jacuzzi. All along the 12-mile
(20-kilometer) isthmus, towering palms sway in the light breeze.
Sailboats dot the horizon.
	   Although Varadero is sprinkled with vacation homes of American
millionaires of years past, a U.S. embargo has made it _ and the
rest of communist Cuba _ off limits to American tourists since the
early 1960s.
	   The steadily multiplying luxury hotels are populated mostly by
Italians, Spanish, French and Mexicans. And, despite the embargo,
more and more Americans.
	   Although spending money in Cuba is illegal for most U.S.
citizens, many are flying to Canada, Mexico or the Bahamas and
transferring to planes to Cuba, hopeful that U.S. immigration
authorities won't notice the small, generic stamp Cuban authorities
sometimes mark on American passports.
	   They say the risk is worth it. Two hours east of Havana,
Varadero is a world-class resort, with elegant restaurants, lively
discos and activities from snorkeling to skydiving, dolphin shows
to nature walks.
	   Of course, the main attraction is the beach. Although the coast
is lined with resort hotels, tractors clean the sand every morning
and the water remains pristine.
	   For those wanting isolation, miles (kilometers) of deserted
beaches _ dotted only by patches of seaweed _ line Varadero's
nature reserve at the tip of the isthmus. The reserve also offers
walks through the low forest and along the salty lagoons.
	   There are also lots of water activities, although like many
other things in Varadero they don't come cheap. Most hotels rent
sailboats or catamarans for dlrs 15 an hour, while Jet Skis are
available at the Hotel Internacional for dlrs 5 _ per minute!
	   Some go snorkeling or scuba-diving, but there isn't much to see
except a sandy sea floor.
	   The only 18-hole golf course in Cuba is here, offering a
spectacular view of the ocean stretches around the old Dupont
Mansion, a vacation home built by the U.S. chemical magnate in
1930. Nine holes cost golfers dlrs 40; 18 holes, dlrs 60. Many take
advantage of a twilight special: dlrs 15 course fees for play from
5:30-8 p.m.
	   A welcome change from the aquariums in theme parks around the
world, the dolphin center is located in a natural lagoon, and the
seven dolphins there perform three times daily for a dlrs 5 entry
fee. Those wanting to get closer can swim with the dolphins; dlrs
35 gets you 15 minutes.
	   The hotels themselves offer plenty of activities as well. Most
have gorgeous swimming pools where tourists play pick-up games of
water volleyball or dance at poolside. Waiters serve tropical
drinks on the beaches, where lawn chairs rent for dlrs 2 a day.
	   The hotels are pricey. A double during high-season _ late
December to mid-April and late July through August _ in the resort
hotels runs between dlrs 100 and dlrs 150 a night. But travel
agencies, especially in low season, offer air-and-hotel discounts,
and several hotels offer all-inclusive packages that are good
deals.
	   Most tourists are content to stay in their hotels, and they
won't find much lacking. But those who take time to explore in town
will be rewarded.
	   The town is located on the western end of the isthmus, while the
luxury hotels stretch eastward toward the tip. The cheaper hotels
are in town, and there is a decent beach, although it doesn't
compare to the hotel beaches farther out.
	   The star attraction in town is Josone Park, 18 acres (7
hectares) of manicured gardens surrounding an artificial lake.
Couples stroll along the pathways at twilight among ducks, peacocks
and iguanas, and dine at the several romantic restaurants,
serenaded by musical trios.
	   Although Varadero probably has more new housing than anywhere
else in Cuba, it also is preserving its old. The area has a number
of slightly disintegrating architectural treasures from the 1940s
and '50s, when Varadero was a playground for rich Americans.
	   Under restoration is a sandstone mansion overlooking the water
reputedly once owned by Chicago gangster Al Capone. Although closed
until December, the estate houses a restaurant called ``La Casa de
Al,'' or ``Al's House.''
	   The Dupont Mansion also houses an exquisite restaurant in a
breathtaking setting. Waiters wear tuxedos, and reservations are
recommended in high season. Entrees range from dlrs 15 to dlrs 45.
	   For nightlife, Varadero is much like many resorts worldwide. The
discos are so geared toward foreign tourists that none play more
than one or two Cuban songs all night.
	   The rage this summer is ``La Rumba,'' a new, self-contained
disco next to the Bella Costa hotel. It's a decent deal; dlrs 10
gets you in and the drinks are free. Unless you're drop-dead
gorgeous, get there before midnight: The doorman keeps a big crowd
sweltering outside.
	   Also try the ``Havana Club'' in town. Or just across a bridge on
the mainland, visit the local hangout, ``La Patana,'' a
disco-on-a-barge that is cheaper and more crowded than the spots
catering to tourists.
	   In all of these clubs, expect to see many older male tourists
dancing the night away with Cuban women half or even a third their
age.

Avignon Festival: A chaotic smorgasbord of theater and dance
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AVIGNON, France (AP) _ To see ``Hamlet'' in Lithuanian, you can
always go to Vilnius. For Brazilian martial arts, Sao Paolo's good.
Flamenco dancing? Anywhere in Spain.
	   But what if you want to see them all in one day?
	   You could easily have done that this summer in Avignon, a
graceful city in Provence that becomes an enjoyably chaotic
smorgasbord of theater and dance for three weeks each year during
Festival d'Avignon.
	   Then again, you can just sit at one of Avignon's cafes all day
long _ and still witness a lot of theater.
	   Sipping a drink in the plaza outside the sprawling, 14th-century
Palais des Papes (Pope's Palace) you'll see a string of performers
ply their wares: a troupe in medieval garb performing a skit, young
men juggling flaming torches, a solitary flutist competing for
space and sound waves with a guitarist doing covers of Eric
Clapton.
	   If you don't wander over to them, the performers will likely
come to you. And by the time you drain the last drops of that
drink, your small table will be covered with leaflets, proffered by
actors only too happy to tell you what you'll be missing if you
don't catch their show.
	   Wander the cobble-stoned streets, and you'll likely bump into a
man on stilts or a group of Taiwanese singers in ancient dress.
	   The variety is dazzling, and also dangerous; quality-wise, you
never quite know what you're getting in Avignon. And many find that
the most appealing part.
	   Avignon is actually two festivals: the ``In'' and the ``Off.''
The first is the official one, in existence since the 1940s, with
carefully selected offerings.
	   The ``Off,'' on the other hand, excludes no one _ all you need
to do is find a venue and plan a show. These offerings, while
spotty, are often the most exciting.
	   Take, for example, a recent Monday. At 5 p.m., a crowd waited
outside a tiny theater on the winding Rue Sainte Catherine to see
the Claudio Basilio troupe of Brazil perform ``capoeira,'' a
combination of martial arts and dance, accompanied by chants and
native instruments.
	   The dancers were an unqualified hit. A few days later you could
see them out in front of the palace, teaching their unique craft to
a few onlookers.
	   At 7:15, you could wander to another neighborhood and catch a
spirited flamenco show by Spain's Luis de la Carrasca group.
	   The two shows were both part of the ``Off'' festival, and the
price was right: dlrs 13 to dlrs 15 (80 francs to 90 francs).
	   By contrast, you're making a bit more of an investment if you
buy tickets for performances on the official schedule, which go for
about twice that price. The names are bigger, the productions
fancier, but there's still a wide range in quality.
	   This year, one theme was Asian culture. But the schedule is
always heavy on the classical stuff: One hit this year was a
production of Le Cid, by Corneille. And Shakespeare is always
present, in various incarnations.
	   For instance, this season you could see the bard's
seldom-produced ``The Life and Death of King John,'' in Avignon's
grandest setting of all: the Courtyard of Honor in the Pope's
Palace.
	   Performed in French and in 20th-century costume, the show's
staging and lighting were quite impressive _ huge metal lighting
structures suddenly moving and becoming tanks, ships and other war
machines.
	   But the play, which began at 10 p.m., ran more than three hours
without intermission _ a bit tough on the powers of concentration.
Especially one evening, when real thunder sounded in the distance,
lightning crackled, and a big, nervous laugh erupted when a
character spoke of ``weathering this storm.''
	   Another Shakespearean attraction was ``Hamlet,'' performed by
Lithuanian actors in their native language (with French subtitles)
in the elegant Municipal Theater.
	   Again, the staging was fresh and creative. But the extensive use
of watery mist and huge blocks of ice became tiresome _ and one
wondered how long it would take before the actors caught cold.
	   The festival takes place each year from mid-July to early
August. Non-French speakers will have trouble with the theatrical
offerings, but can find plenty of dance, music and circus to
entertain them.
	   Or you can simply wander the streets, drink in the atmosphere,
and then retire to one of Avignon's many excellent restaurants to
sample the Provencal cuisine. Don't forget the wine.

	    &UR; If You Go...
	   GETTING THERE: Avignon, in Provence, is an easy 3 1-2 -hour ride
from Paris on the TGV, France's high-speed train. A full-fare,
round-trip adult ticket from the capital costs about dlrs 140 (840
francs). There are also lots of train connections from other French
cities.
	   INFORMATION: All tourist questions can be directed to Avignon's
tourism office. From the United States, dial 011-33-4-9082-6511;
from France, 04-9082-6511.
	   FESTIVAL: The festival runs for three weeks, from mid-July
through the first week in August. For information about tickets and
to get a program, call the festival office, 011-33-4-9027-6650 from
the United States, 04-9027-6650 from France. Tickets can be bought
by phone or at FNAC stores throughout France.
	   HOTELS: There are many hotels in Avignon, in all price ranges.
During the festival, they fill up fast, and it's best to book
ahead. An ideal place to stay is near the cafe-lined Place de
l'Horloge, the central square of Avignon. Warning: Try to get a
room on a garden or side street. It can be noisy at night. And
spend the few extra dollars for an air-conditioned room; summer in
Provence can be stifling.
	   RESTAURANTS: There is an abundance of excellent restaurants in
Avignon, and some good, cheap cafes, too. Young people should head
straight to the Rue des Teinturiers, where the hip _ and others who
don't need to get a good night's sleep _ hang out until all hours.

Time is the theme of exhibit in Avignon

<TEXT>
	   AVIGNON, France (AP) _ Ever since time began, man has sought to
measure it. Time.
	   That's the simple premise of a small but lavish exhibit on the
glories of clockmaking, set within the grand, medieval walls of the
14th-century Palais des Papes (Pope's Palace) in Avignon.
	   The medieval stage is fitting because ``Treasures of
Clockmaking'' starts with the Middle Ages when the measuring of
time, long used to pace religious life, became a secular
preoccupation.
	   The quest manifested itself in sundials, weight-driven clocks
and hourglasses, all on display here.
	   But the glory period really began with the Renaissance, when
artisans all over Europe competed for more lavish creations for
their upper-class clients, for whom money seems to have been no
object.
	   Also in the Renaissance came the invention of the portable
clock, the precursor of the wristwatch.
	   Although the exhibit features some staggeringly ornate clocks,
it is really the watches that fascinate, because of their delicacy
and precision, and the dazzling jewels used.
	   You thought a Rolex was fancy? Check out a 17th-century
heart-shaped concoction in silver, delicate enamel and brass,
encased in a gold-trimmed rock-crystal shell _ also heart-shaped.
	   Watches come in all shapes here. There's one shaped like a
seashell, one like a tulip and an impossibly complex one called ``a
star with ten branches,'' made of gold and enamel and studded all
over with diamonds.
	   There's a watch of gold leaf and brass shaped like a book,
opening up with hinges to reveal the timepiece. And one of the most
bizarre pieces, also from the 17th century, is a carved silver and
brass skull from Switzerland entitled, ``Watch in form of dead
man's head.''
	   As in all medieval and Renaissance art, there are strong
religious themes in the exhibit, which spans through the 1600s.
Many of the best clocks and watches are in the shape of crosses.
	   But there are some surprisingly risque entries, too, such as the
enamel pieces from French clockmakers in the 1600s that show women
in mildly sexual poses. Something for everyone.
	   The exhibit, which began in May, coincided with this year's
annual Avignon arts festival. But it lasts until September 27, so
even though the theatrical troupes have packed up their wares,
there's still reason to make a detour to Avignon.

	   IF YOU GO ...
	   GETTING THERE: Page, Arizona. serves as the main gateway to Lake
Powell, especially for those coming from Las Vegas, Nevada. Take
I-15 north into Utah past St. George to Exit 16. Then take Highway
9, which cuts through Zion National Park to Mt. Carmel Junction.
Follow Highway 89 south to Kanab, turn left at the traffic light to
get to Page. You can't miss the lake. Proceed to Wahweap Marina.
	   If coming from Grand Junction, Colorado, the easiest access to
the lake is via Bullfrog, Utah, on the east side. Take I-70 west to
the Hanksville exit, following Highway 24 south to Hanksville. Go
east to Highway 95 south, then take Highway 276 to Bullfrog.
	   ACCOMMODATIONS: Houseboating is by far the most popular way to
experience the lake, so much so that rentals through the National
Park Service-appointed concessionaire, ARAMARK, are booked up to a
year and a half in advance. Those wanting to go sooner should call
in case of cancellations, 800-528-6154. Rates vary from dlrs 851
for three days on the smallest vessel to dlrs 4,224 for a seven-day
trip on the biggest boat. Prices are lower and availability higher
October through April.
	   ARAMARK also rents powerboats, water skis, kneeboard and
personal watercraft.
	   The company runs hotels, family trailers, tent and RV campsites
at Wahweap, Bullfrog, Halls Crossing and Hite marinas. Hotels and
motels also abound in Page.
	   On the lake, camping is free.
	   FEES: Entrance to the marinas costs dlrs 5 per car, dlrs 10 for
each water vessel for up to seven days. Parking is available.
	   WHEN TO GO: Summer is the high season with temperatures
typically in the low 90s. But autumn, with its warm days and cool
nights, is also popular. Temperatures range in the low 80s in early
fall and in the low 70s in November. Expect the mid-40s in winter,
low 60s in early spring and low 80s in late spring.
	   ACTIVITIES: Recreation includes boating, Jet Skiing, water
skiing, kayaking, canoeing, river rafting or scuba diving (Twin
Finn Divers, 520-645-3114). One- to seven-hour boat tours,
especially to Rainbow Bridge National Monument, a river-carved
sandstone arch. Trips can be arranged through ARAMARK.
	   Fishing for striped, large- and smallmouth bass is also good.

	   IF YOU GO ...
	   TRAVEL: Varadero is located 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of
Havana (and 150 miles (240 kilometers) south of Key West). Flights
reach Varadero's airport from across the Caribbean, Latin America
and Europe. Hotels also offer comfortable tour buses for the
two-hour ride from Havana's airport.
	   CLIMATE: It's hot in Varadero year-round, and frequent dips in
the ocean or pool are a must. Expect showers and even heavy rains
from August to November. Highs are in the upper 80s year-round.
	   LODGING: A string of luxury resorts runs eastward along the
isthmus, with cheaper hotels in town on the western side. The
resorts run dlrs 100- dlrs 150 for a basic double in high season _
late December to mid-April and late July through August _ slightly
less the rest of the year. But package deals bring much better
prices that vary wildly from month to month. All-inclusive resorts
also offer budget packages. Check with a travel agent (outside of
the United States) for the best deals.
	   Hotels in the town itself are cheaper. Doubles in high season
run about dlrs 50, but the beaches aren't as good and the rooms are
austere. Some locals also rent out their homes for dlrs 15- dlrs 20
a day. But for hassle-free travel, book a hotel room. Immigration
authorities demand a hotel reservation to let you into the country.
	   GETTING AROUND: Rental cars in Cuba are expensive, ranging from
dlrs 75 to dlrs 125 a day for an economy model, plus insurance and
gas. A better bet in Varadero is a taxi, which will get you almost
everywhere on the isthmus for dlrs 3- dlrs 10. There is also free
bus service between some hotels.
	   CURRENCY: Despite the U.S. economic embargo, the American
greenback is the only currency in town. Cuban pesos (currently
about 21 to the dollar) are no good in stores, although sometimes
you'll get change in ``convertible'' pesos, which can be used
anywhere dollars can.
	   THE PEOPLE: Police have cracked down on locals who strike up
conversations with tourists and ask for money. Many still will
approach you to chat (especially if you appear to be an American)
but they will always be watching for trouble out of the corner of
their eye. In hotels and restaurants, service is wildly uneven.
While many staff members are courteous and helpful, others can be
surly.
	   RESTAURANTS: From the elegant Dupont Mansion to a thatched-roof
hole-in-the-wall, you'll find delicious seafood at almost any
Varadero restaurant. Lobster runs dlrs 10- dlrs 45, depending on
the restaurant, and is almost always delicious. Stay away from the
``typical'' Cuban food, which tends to be based on tasteless, dry
pork. Snack bars around town also serve hamburgers, pizzas and
other fast food at reasonable prices.
	   INFORMATION: Many Canadian and European sites are available on
the Internet offering packages to Varadero hotels, and hotels
themselves have Web sites. Just do a search for ``Varadero.''

<TEXT>
	   CHAGFORD, England (AP) _ As the sky blushes a deep purple, the
Teign River can be heard gurgling across the Gidleigh Park Hotel's
45 acres (18 hectares) of green hills. Enticing smells from the
hotel's award-winning restaurant begin to waft through the
bedrooms.
	   The Tudor-style, black-and-white manor-house hotel sits on the
edge of Dartmoor National Park, an area of southwest England that
is home to more black-faced sheep, tiny Dartmoor ponies and lazy
dairy cows than people.
	   Isolated farmhouses ringed by low stone fences speckle the bleak
landscape of the moors.
	   The hotel's expatriate American owners, Paul and Kay Henderson,
are two of the many hoteliers across England who have turned old
manor houses into luxurious inns, providing their guests with
personal service, five-course meals and beautiful surroundings _
but at a cost of several hundred pounds (dollars) a night.
	   Despite the desolation and often inclement weather, Dartmoor's
vast expanses of wild purple heather and rounded hills topped by
granite outcrops _ known as tors _ lure many of Gidleigh Park's
guests onto the moors for all-day hikes.
	   Equipped with compasses, maps and backpacks filled with cheese,
fruit and cookies provided by the hotel, they wade through
knee-high grass and wet bogs.
	   In the evening, guests return ``home'' to a warm welcome, a
crackling fire and an eclectic selection of books _ the edges
lovingly worn down by guests and the Hendersons.
	   Paul Henderson says he works to create a casual, relaxed
atmosphere, greeting guests as they return from their moor
excursions and as they savor croissants and tea at breakfast.
	   ``We say we should know who all the clients in the hotel are,''
says Henderson, originally from Virginia. ``You have to constantly
say to yourself 'What would I think about Gidleigh Park if I were
staying here?''' His wife grew up in Indiana, where the couple met
at Purdue University.
	   As much a part of Gidleigh Park Hotel as the Hendersons
themselves is John Chard who, for a fee, ferries guests from
village to village in his Peugeot, stopping at small, stone
churches and thatched cottages. He deftly maneuvers through the
narrow roads lined with stone walls and hedgerows so high the
roadway is akin to a small canyon.
	   A master story-teller possessed with a keen wit, Chard charms
visitors with legends of Dartmoor: the hairy hand that grabs the
steering wheel from drivers, and the tor that inspired A. Conan
Doyle to write ``The Hound of the Baskervilles.''
	   Gidleigh Park and its surroundings often take on the eerie
grayness of the Sherlock Holmes tale, driving manor house guests
indoors to read and eat.
	   Although the bedrooms and bathrooms may lack some of the
features of a newer hotel _ there are also no faxes or modem
connections _ they are spacious and elegantly furnished with
English prints and mahogany antiques.
	   But if the rooms don't rival those of the world's chic hotels,
the quality of Gidleigh Park's French cuisine competes with the
best.
	   What began as meals inspired by Julia Child and cooked by Mrs.
Henderson has now evolved into an award-winning operation headed by
Michael Caines, a local-born chef who trained with French masters
Raymond Blanc, Joel Robuchon and Bernard Loiseau.
	   The restaurant is one of five named Relais Gourmand _ a mark of
culinary distinction _ in the 1999 Relais et Chateaux guide, and
received the maximum rating from AA Guide 1998. The wine list has
won a Grand Award from the Wine Spectator every year since 1984.
	   Dinner, included in the price of the room, is a parade of
delicacies, beginning with cocktails and creative bite-sized
appetizers _ called amuse-bouche, or tickle-your-mouth _ in the
drawing room.
	   On a typical night, dishes might include pan-fried wild salmon
with asparagus and a dill and caviar butter sauce, a light lobster
jelly with sour cream, caviar and herbs, or roast local lamb with a
brochette of kidney and saddle, with fondant potato and roast
garlic.
	   A tray of French, British and Irish cheeses and a large
selection of desserts follow.
	   Gidleigh Park's Tudor trappings were originally erected in 1929
by an Australian shipping magnate on the site of a 16th-century
manor house. It was turned into a hotel in 1977 by the Hendersons,
who were eager to leave the crowds and noise of London behind.
	   Gidleigh Park has 15 rooms _ 14 in the main house and one in a
cottage a short walk away. Henderson says the hotel attracts its
share of pop stars, politicians and authors, and adds that it is
best to book at least a month in advance during the summer and for
the December holidays.
	   Room charges _ which include dinner, morning tea or coffee in
the room, a British or continental breakfast, service and Value
Added Tax _ range from 340 pounds (dlrs 560) to 430 pounds (dlrs
705) daily for double occupancy and 225 (dlrs 370) to 380 pounds
(dlrs 625) for single occupancy.
	   The hotel offers discounts for two-night stays from December to
February.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IF YOU GO: The drive from London to Gidleigh Park takes four
hours. Guests can take the train from London's Paddington station
to Exeter, a town about a 40-minute drive from the hotel, or fly
into the Exeter airport. Rental cars are available in Exeter, or
the hotel will arrange to have a taxi pick you up, at your expense.
	   The hotel's phone number is 44-1647-432-367, and the fax is
44-1647-432-574.

<TEXT>
	   PAGE, Arizona (AP) _ For the past several years my family had
been trying to get me to join them on their annual houseboat
vacation on Lake Powell.
	   They boasted of clean aquamarine waters and spectacular red-rock
canyons in the Utah and Arizona deserts _ all enjoyed from the deck
of their deluxe time-share floating home.
	   I saw myself being trapped in 100 F-plus (38 C-plus) heat in a
boxy boat with a sweaty and cranky family. But after years of
testimonials and refrigerator pinups of tanned and happy relatives,
I caved.
	   The first day was spent cruising the Las Vegas Costco, a huge
membership store like Sam's Club, and balancing the grease and
sugar dietary needs of my teen-age brothers and all their friends
against those of the rest of the group of 18.
	   We filled six shopping carts.
	   The second day was spent loading the groceries, driving it,
unloading it into the houseboat waiting our arrival at Wahweap
Marina.
	   ``It gets better. It really does,'' my mother insisted, tears
flowing down her cheeks from near heat exhaustion.
	   Eventually we boarded the air-conditioned, well-appointed vessel
and left for West Canyon, where we beached it for the night. Then
we all jumped into the warm water and soon after I was handed a
margarita and a plate of barbecued chicken and ribs. A spray of
stars came out, and I began to believe I could get through the
night.
	   Named for Maj. John Wesley Powell, a civil war veteran who
chronicled his explorations of the Colorado River in 1869, the
266-square-mile (689-square-kilometer) ``lake'' was created in 1963
when the Colorado was dammed.
	   The result was the Glen Canyon Dam National Recreation Area and
a boating mecca and landscape so awe-inspiring you wonder if it was
the work of Disney Imagineers.
	   Rust and copper-colored sandstone shapes jut out of emerald
waters. In the next canyon, a different depth delivers a shade of
brilliant blue.
	   Wrinkled rocks and voluptuous slopes share ridges with sheer
cliffs and towers resembling medieval fortresses and gothic
cathedral spires.
	   That could change, though, if a proposal sponsored by
environmental groups to drain the lake and restore the passes and
reverse the flow of water that through controlled releases took 17
years to fill.
	   Locals and guidebooks tout the lake's 3,700-foot (1,128-meter)
elevation for its lower temperatures. But to me, it was still hot.
And we spent the better part of many afternoons watching movies
ensconced in air-conditioning or tethered to the boat in rafts
reading best sellers.
	   But the late afternoon brought cooler air and light that bathed
the horizontally striped walls in astounding hues.
	   Calling the body of water a lake is a misnomer. It's really a
flooded river that produced some 90 branches, twigs and splinters _
which call to anyone sitting atop a Jet Ski to be explored and, of
course, to be raced through at ridiculously high speeds.
	   It was precisely this macho rush and my romantic notion that I
was a modern-day explorer navigating my water horse through shaded
inlets and private canyons that got me into trouble.
	   You see, unlike the other kind of horse which knows its way
home, on this one I got lost.
	   At first glance, I marveled at the walls marbled with fudge
swirls of vanilla, milk chocolate and caramel. Charcoal-colored
blazes, evoking the soot of Dickens' industrial London, marked
others.
	   But when it's almost dark and you're on the reserve tank of gas,
it's uncanny how they all look alike.
	   And all of a sudden, you're thinking you might be sleeping on
one of these rocks with hundreds of darting lizards.
	   So you hail the nice people at houseboat C-29 who send out a
radio call for your family.
	   But only your brother and his friends respond from the
speedboat, thinking you're one of the girls at Dangling Rope Marina
they've been trying to court all week.
	   I've never been so happy to hear someone's voice even if he was
so disappointed to hear mine.
	   But I was rescued, and my family canceled the missing persons
report with the National Park Service.
	   The agency has cited safety, noise and the environment as
reasons why it currently is considering a proposal to ban personal
watercraft from all national parks. People like me are another.
	   At night, we'd dock the houseboat on any of the 1,960 miles
(3,154 kilometers) of shoreline, home to mountain lions, rabbits,
coyotes, mice, eagles, desert bighorn sheep, foxes and the
occasional roaming cow.
	   Then we'd light huge bonfires that turned the hills a deep
cinnamon. And when we got too hot, we'd wade at the shore,
squishing the sediment between our toes while bats fluttered above.
	   When the old folks went to bed, my brothers and I would float
though the canyons in our rafts, drinking warm beer and trading
revisionist stories of our childhood.
	   The full morning sun on the glassy water drove us back into the
belly of the boat.

Orlando targeting four cities not producing enough tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Orlando tourism officials say they
aren't seeing as many visitors from four particular cities as they
should and they hope to turn that around.
	   So residents of Baltimore, Dallas, Minneapolis and Washington
will be barraged with newspaper and magazine ads, radio spots and
junk mail touting the Central Florida area.
	   ``Our research shows these are underperforming cities,'' said
Jose Estorino, a marketing official of the Orlando/Orange County
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
	   With Walt Disney world as the major draw, the Orlando area was
host to 37 million visitors last year, including 3.5 million
foreign tourists, and this year expects about 40 million.
	   The biggest source of visitors to Orlando are the cities of New
York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta; Philadelphia, and
Chicago.
	   Hotel occupancy in Central Florida dropped last year, to 78.7
percent from 80.1 percent the previous year. The average daily rate
for a room, however, jumped to dlrs 81 last year from dlrs 73 the
previous year.
	   The cause of the dip in the occupancy rate could be because of
an increase in the number of hotel rooms in Orlando, bureau
officials said. Orlando currently has about 88,000 hotel rooms.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Constellation is back afloat and getting a facelift
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ After a year and a half of work, the 1854
warship U.S.S. Constellation is back afloat and ready for the next
phase of restoration.
	   The once rot-ravaged ship has been sitting in the Fort McHenry
Shipyard dry dock as crews replaced more than half of the original
wooden ribs and hull in an attempt to save her from a watery grave.
	   Although nearly everything visible from outside the ship will be
new, nearly everything inside will be original.
	   Workers next will construct new gun and spar decks, masts and
rigging.
	   The dlrs 9 million project should be complete by next summer.
The ship will then return to the Inner Harbor as an educational
exhibit and tourist attraction.
	   The Virginia-built sloop-of-war never saw battle, but served in
anti-slavery squadrons off West Africa. Between 1861 and 1863, the
Constellation captured three slave ships and liberated 800 slaves.
	   After steamships debuted, the Constellation served as a training
ship at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and was a Navy relief ship
as late as World War II.
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; Maine's appeal to leaf-peepers getting big response
	   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) _ A new advertising campaign to lure autumn
leaf-peepers to Maine instead of other foliage-rich states such as
neighboring Vermont and New Hampshire is drawing 1,000 inquiries a
day, officials say.
	   The dlrs 350,000 campaign began last week on Boston-area
broadcast stations and cable television systems. The ads feature a
toll-free number to request travel information.
	   ``The response has been unbelievable,'' Gov. Angus King said.
	   State officials had projected that the five-week venture would
produce a total of 7,500 inquiries. Getting 3,000 calls from Monday
through Wednesday shows that the campaign is working well, said
Dann Lewis, who runs the Office of Tourism.
	   The 30-second and 60-second commercials ask viewers: ``What
makes Maine so spectacular in the fall?'' As the narrator talks
about Maine, the ads show shots of fall foliage, lobsters, biking,
kayaking, hiking, golfing and other attractions.

Pepper takes first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (AP) _ A resurgent Dottie Pepper birdied
four of the first five holes en route to a 9-under-par 63 that gave
her a two-stroke lead over Vickie Odegard after the first round of
the dlrs 700,000 State Farm Rail Classic.
	   Pepper, the LPGA's top money winner in 1992 but winless since
1996, needed to save par from a greenside bunker on No. 18 to tie
her career-low round.
	   Pepper was one shot off Laura Davies' tournament record at the
6,403-yard (5,826-meter) Rail Golf Club course. Though she matched
a score she shot in the opening round of the Star Bank Classic
three weeks ago, Pepper said her closing 6-footer (1.8-meter) was
anything but automatic.
	   ``I still had butterflies standing over that last putt,'' she
said. ``I knew it meant a lot.''
	   Odegard, the 1996 LPGA qualifying school medalist, hit 17 greens
in regulation but got off to a slow start with her putter in the
rain-delayed opening round before warming up to shoot a 5-under 31
on the back nine, including birdies on Nos. 15, 17 and 18.
	   ``This will really come down to who's putting well,'' Odegard
said. ``I was putting well today.''
	   Tied at 66 were Tammie Green, Muffin Spencer-Devlin, Dina
Ammaccapane, Barb Mucha, Penny Hammel and Tracy Hanson. Rookie Se
Ri Pak of South Korea had a 70.
	   With the exception of an occasionally errant driver, Pepper had
no complaints about her game in a season that finds her ninth on
the money list, sixth in Solheim Cup points and second to Pak in
the LPGA Mercury Series bonus pool.
	   ``I only missed two greens,'' she said. ``I'm hitting the ball
great, but I'm just a little out of synch off the tee.''
	   The Rail Classic ends with final U.S. selections for the Solheim
team that will meet Europe in matches Sept. 18-20 at Muirfield
Village G.C. in Dublin, Ohio. The top 10 spots are nearly a lock,
but Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez, Michelle McGann, Rosie Jones and
several others are playing to impress U.S. captain Judy Rankin, who
will make the final two picks on Sunday.
	   By-passed two years ago and bothered by a sore back in recent
weeks, Lopez struggled to a 1-over 73. Jones, who ranks 11th in
points, and McGann, who is 14th, both shot 71s.

Deadly parasite or harmless algae in Sydney water? Experts disagree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous, updates with debate over whether bugs are
merely algae.
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Are the microscopic bugs infesting
Sydney's water harmless algae or dangerous parasites? Experts
disagreed Saturday over whether the emergency is a false alarm.
	   The levels of bugs, called cryptosporidium and giardia, in the
most recent water samples tested were ``as high as you would find
in pure raw sewage, probably higher,'' said Dr. Jerry Ongerth of
the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of New South
Wales.
	   Ongerth said those results are ``not believable at face value.''
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
	   Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people
with weak immune systems, including the very young and the elderly.
	   The Health Department has found 12,000 cryptosporidium cysts per
100 liters of treated water, a level 12 times higher than the worst
outbreak ever recorded in the United States.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, in 1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000
others were sickened.
	   Yet there has been no statistically significant increase in
illness in Sydney, either in the outbreak in late July or the one
announced this week.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Ongerth as saying his own tests
found many algae of different species, ``some of which look very
like giardia and some of which look very like cryptosporidium.''
	   Sydney Water on Saturday rejected Ongerth's analysis.
	   ``We're aware of that claim and we're certainly aware of
incidents in the past with some dispute over algae cells or crypto
cysts,'' Sydney Water spokesman Rod Metcalfe said
	   ``But we're more than confident that they're crypto cysts.''
	   Ongerth had previously worked as an adviser for Sydney Water,
Metcalfe said.
	   The new warnings came as organizers of the 2000 Olympics said
the contamination scare, the second in Sydney in a month,
threatened to ``dent'' the city's international reputation.
	   Almost all of the city's 3.7 million residents have been told to
boil tap water for at least one minute or risk illness from the
parasites.
	   Only boiled water should be used for drinking, cleaning teeth,
gargling, washing foods and making ice, the department said.
Schoolchildren should take bottled water to school.
	   Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy Holloway said the city was
being closely watched overseas, and the problem needed to be fixed
quickly and permanently.
	   ``We are on show. For the water scare to happen once, a month or
so ago, could be dismissed as a quirky aberration, here we are a
highly sophisticated first world country, this is an aberration,''
Holloway said.
	   ``For it to happen twice suggests we have a problem that needs
rapid resolution. Were this to happen periodically between now and
the Games this would dent our image, it would be mad to say
otherwise.''
	   An inquiry, assisted by water experts from the United States, is
underway to determine the source of the outbreak. Authorities have
blamed heavy rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent weeks.

Qualifier stuns top-seeded Bjorkman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pioline's victory. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Qualifier Sebastien Grosjean of
France upset top-seeded Jonas Bjorkman 7-6 (9-7), 6-1 Friday to
advance to the semifinals of the MFS Pro Tennis Championship at the
Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Bjorkman had appeared headed to win the first set but
double-faulted in the tiebreaker at set point. Grosjean, whose best
previous showing had been a fourth-round appearance at Wimbledon,
then rallied to win the tiebreaker and a convincing second-set
victory.
	   Bjorkman, of Sweden, was frustrated with his defeat.
	   ``I think if you pressure him, you can defeat him,'' Bjorkman
said. ``I made too many mistakes. That was the difference today. I
lost it more than he won it.''
	   In other quarterfinals Friday, fourth-seeded Michael Chang
defeated Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 6-4, 2-6, 6-1; Paul Haarhuis of
the Netherlands beat countryman and defending champion Sjeng
Schalken 0-6, 6-4, 6-3; and third-seeded Cedric Pioline of France
defeated Thomas Muster of Austria 7-5, 6-3.
	   Saturday's semifinals will have Grosjean against Chang and
Haarhuis facing Pioline.
	   Chang, who was broken twice in the second set, easily won the
third set as Pozzi seemed to wear down at the end of the match.
	   Pozzi broke Chang in the second game of the first set before
Chang rallied.
	   ``The first set was when I had my chances,'' Pozzi said. ``I
played well in the second set. He's very good, but if I had won
that first set, the match would have been mine.''
	   Pozzi won the second set with breaks in the fifth and seventh
games, dominating the set with a strong baseline game that kept
Chang off-balance.
	   Chang, however, resumed control in the final set. He broke Pozzi
in the second game and went to a 4-1 lead. He again broke Pozzi in
the sixth game and served out for the match.
	   Haarhuis fought off three break points in the second set and
came back to win it by breaking Schalken in the seventh game.
	   ``I started moving better,'' Haarhuis said. ``When he was
playing so well, I just tried to stay in it.''
	   Haarhuis and Schalken held serve and were tied 3-3 in the third
set.
	   Haarhuis then changed tactics, employing a serve and volley
game. He broke Schalken in the seventh game and went on to register
10 consecutive points, winning the final three games.
	   ``The momentum definitely turned in the third set,'' Haarhuis
said. ``In the last three games of the match, he mentally wasn't
there anymore.''
	   Pioline bounced back from an early break in the first set,
breaking back in the eighth game to even the set.
	   The players held serve in the next two games, but Pioline broke
Muster in the 12th game to take the first set. In the second set,
the players were on serve until the eighth game, when Pioline again
broke serve. He then served out the match in the ninth game.
	   ``I felt good. My backhand worked well,'' Pioline said. ``I
tried to volley and come in. I've always had problems with him. I
expected a very close match and I was fortunate it went well.''

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Steffi Graf beat Lindsay Davenport
6-3, 7-6 (8-6) Friday night in the Pilot Pen International,
snapping the defending champion's 13-match winning streak and
advancing to her first final since knee surgery 14 months ago.
	   ``It's been a while,'' Graf said. ``I'm thrilled to be in the
finals.''
	   Her last title came in May 1997 on the clay courts of
Strasbourg. A month later she had surgery on her left knee. All
three of her semifinal appearances this year were against
Davenport, who beat her at Indian Wells and at Stanford.
	   Graf will meet Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna in Satuday's
title match. Novotna advanced with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over unseeded
Julie Halard-Decugis.
	   Davenport nursed a strained right wrist through most of the
match and had to call for a trainer midway through the first set.
Graf, the No. 4 seed, took advantage of the ailing Davenport to win
the first set easily.
	   She built a 5-2 lead in the second set but Davenport began to
loosen up and pin her with powerful groundstrokes and aggressive
serves.
	   ``I just started hitting my shots more and trying not to worry
about it. ... Then all of a sudden I was back in the match,''
Davenport said.
	   Serving at 5-5, Davenport hit a couple of aces and battled
through two deuces to go up 6-5. Graf tied it on her next service,
forcing a tiebreaker that initially appeared to be all Davenport's.
	   The 22-year-old Californian won the first five points and
suddenly Graf was looking ahead to a third set.
	   ``I kind of thought already about going back to the changing
room and changing my shirt for third set. That maybe helped. I
didn't start to worry about the match anymore,'' said Graf, who won
the next five points.
	   She served out for the match and won it when Davenport's return
landed in the net.
	   Halard-Decugis, who missed all of last year with wrist, knee and
shoulder injuries, had not beaten Novotna in their previous five
matches but quickly had the 29-year-old down a break in the first
set for a 3-0 lead. Her strong baseline play and crosscourt winners
kept Novotna off the net.
	   ``My game plan was to come in much more, but unfortunately I
couldn't do that,'' Novotna said.
	   Instead, she countered with pinpoint passes and deep-angled
winners to move the rangy Halard-Decugis around the court.
	   ``I just needed to be more consistent, move her around a little
bit and let her work for her shots,'' Novotna said.
	   Novotna battled back from 0-30 in their final game, hitting two
straight sideline winners. Halard-Decugis forced a deuce with a
blistering crosscourt shot. Novotna regained the next point with a
deft drop shot and won on her next serve when Halard-Decugis'
return was long.

Daly thanks playing partners for support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second-round score and missed cut &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Before John Daly teed off in the
second round of the Greater Vancouver Open on Friday, he thanked
Corey Pavin and David Frost for their support after he burst into
tears and began shaking during the opening round.
	   ``It was definitely a tough day,'' Daly said Friday in a
interview with TSN. ``But what Corey and David did for helping me
through it, ... I just can't thank them enough.''
	   Daly, who is struggling through a difficult year with his play
and an ongoing battle with alcoholism, began shaking terribly at
the 15th hole Thursday. Looking distraught and haggard, he crossed
his arms on his chest and walked around the green, tears coming
down his face.
	   Both Pavin and Frost comforted Daly, who put on a second jacket
to ward off a chill despite the warm temperatures.
	   Daly finished with a 3-over-par 74 on Thursday but declined to
speak with reporters. There were reports he would withdraw from the
tournament, but he played the second round, shot a 70, but failed
to make the cut.
	   Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA and 1995 British Open, looked
collected when talking about the incident before Friday's round. He
said a similar bout of shakes caused him to walk off the course at
the 1997 U.S Open.
	   ``I knew more what to do this time than there,'' he said. ``It's
part of the program.
	   ``I've called everybody I know pretty much and they said `You're
right where you're supposed to be. We know you're sober.'
	   ``The first two years are very difficult in this program. It's
the hardest part. The shakes are going to come and go and some are
going to last longer than others.''
	   Daly, 32, said he's overwhelmed from the support he's received
from other professionals on the PGA Tour.
	   ``All the players on the tour have showed me so much respect and
it means an awful lot,'' he said. ``No matter what happens we're
all just one when it comes to life.
	   ``I've learned so much from these guys.''
	   After a decent start, Daly's year has gone downhill. In his last
four tournaments, he has missed the cut three times and been
disqualified after completing three rounds at the St. Jude Classic.
	   Earlier this month, he threatened not to play another PGA Tour
event this year and refused to talk to reporters at the 36-hole
Fred Meyer exhibition event in Portland, Ore. last weekend.

DiMarco, Chamblee tie for midway lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Short putts aren't always gimmes
but they're sure easier to make than 20-foot (6-meter) ones.
	   ``I just kept knocking it close. It's not like I was making
15-footers (4.5 meters),'' Chris DiMarco, a former Canadian Tour
pro from Orlando, Florida said after shooting a career-best 63
Friday for a share of the 36-hole lead in the Greater Vancouver
Open.
	   DiMarco started with a 2-under back nine and got hotter after
the turn. He birdied Nos 4 and 6 before an eagle-3 set up by a
3-wood pulled him within a stroke of clubhouse leader Brandel
Chamblee.
	   DiMarco, a Nike Tour graduate who is 132nd on the PGA money
list, then birdied the 18th, the toughest hole on the 6,900-yard
Northview Country Club layout, to guarantee his 14th PGA payday
this year.
	   Chamblee and DiMarco were at 11-under-par 131 while first-round
leader Payne Stewart was two shots back.
	   Guy Boros, who won the inaugural Greater Vancouver Open in 1996
but has made only eight cuts in 25 tournaments this year, was
grouped at 134 with Jay Hobby, Harrison Frazar, Lee Porter and
Larry Rinker.
	   A hot putter and a bunker shot yielded eight birdies for
Chamblee, who carded a 64, his best round of the year.
	   ``I putted better than I did yesterday,'' Chamblee, still
looking for his first tour victory, said. ``But I probably hit it
better yesterday than I did today. I just hit it great. I could
have shot 60.''
	   The missed first-round opportunities sent him to the practice
green and the result was an improved touch on the fast putting
surfaces at the par-71 Northview Golf and Country Club in this
Vancouver suburb.
	   Stewart, who had a first-round 64, had a 2-under 69 to remain
well in contention in the dlrs 2 million event that pays dlrs
360,000 to the winner.
	   Long-hitting John Daly teed off with an iron to start the second
round after a bout of the shakes that are part of his battle with
alcoholism brought him to tears on Thursday.
	   He was more in control with a 1-under 70 but his opening-round
74 left him too much to make up Friday and he missed the cut. Daly
has missed four cuts and had a disqualification in his last five
tournaments.
	   Stewart said a decision this week to return to a cross-handed
putting stroke has kept him in contention.

Gadhafi offers Clinton a lawyer to help with intern fallout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to some points. New to others &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton got an offer of
help Friday in handling his domestic problems from an unlikely
source: Moammar Gadhafi.
	   The Libyan leader offered to send a lawyer to help Clinton deal
with the fallout arising from his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``I have no bad intentions towards (Clinton), and I was willing
to send him a lawyer to defend him,'' Gadhafi said in an interview
with the Qatari television channel Al-Jazeera.
	   He said Clinton is a victim of a Jewish and Zionist conspiracy.
	   Gadhafi also criticized former President Ronald Reagan, who
ordered an air attack on Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the
bombing of a Berlin discotheque in which two U.S. servicemen were
killed. Libya said 37 people, including Gadhafi's adopted daughter,
were killed in the attack.
	   ``Clinton is not Reagan, who was ridiculous, an idiot,
aggressive and behaved like a cowboy,'' he said.

Jersey vs. Japan: A Battle of the Easts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Toms River, New Jersey (U.S.
East) manager Mike Gaynor brought his team to the Little League
World Series in 1995 and went 1-2.
	   He says this time around hasn't been much easier.
	   And about that 4-0 record this week, coach?
	   ``I think there's a little more parity this time,'' he insists.
He may have a point.
	   The East champions needed 11 innings to beat Jenison, Michigan
(U.S. Central); defeated Greenville, North Carolina (U.S. South) by
just a couple of runs _ twice _ and dispatched Cypress, California
(U.S. West), on a homer late in the game.
	   The average margin of victory overall in the U.S. pool was 2.5
runs.
	   While he expects a close fight against international champion
Kashima, Japan, in Saturday's final, Gaynor said he expects to win,
although he insists he hasn't even seen his opponent play this
week.
	   ``I've seen 'em play,'' shortstop Todd Frazier said after Toms
River defeated Greenville 5-2 Thursday. ``They're a reasonable
team. I think we have a chance to beat 'em.''
	   Added ace Scott Fisher, who could get the start Saturday
afternoon: ``Japan is a good team. They can hit the ball.''
	   Kashima's star this week has been Tetsuya Furukawa, who is
6-for-14 with two home runs and seven RBIs.
	   On the mound, Furukawa is 2-0 with 19 strikeouts, including 12
in a 3-2 victory in eight innings against Langley, British
Columbia, on Thursday as his team became the first Japanese team in
the final in 22 years.
	   Sayaka Tsushima, the sixth girl to play in a World Series, will
be the first girl to play in a final.
	   She's not a gimmick: She went 3-for-4 in Thursday's win and has
scored three runs this week.
	   Manager Atsushi Ohkawa admits being a little disappointed with
his team's performance: It went 3-1 in getting to the final.
Langley beat the Japanese 10-5 Tuesday by scoring nine runs in the
final two innings.
	   But, he said, ``we feel like we have a lot of power right now.
It's been so long since a Japanese team went to the World Series.''
	   Chofu of Tokyo won it all in 1976 by beating Campbell,
California 10-3.
	   The last team from New Jersey to play in final, Lakewood, won it
the previous year, 4-3 over Belmont Heights, Tampa, Florida.
	   Toms River counters Furukawa with Frazier, who is 5-for-11 with
three home runs and nine RBIs. Brad Frank is batting .600 with five
singles and three RBIs. And Gabe Gardner has two home runs and five
RBIs.
	   Neither manager had named a starting pitcher Friday.

Mexican politicians deny link with kidnapping ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Three politicians from the western state
of Guerrero on Friday denied a prosecutor's accusations that they
were part of a kidnapping ring.
	   The three were named by the attorney general of the neighboring
state of Morelos as suspects in two kidnappings that occurred in
1996. He had asked the Guerrero state legislature to lift their
immunity so they can be prosecuted, but it has refused the request.
	   One of the politicians, state legislator Mario Navarrete, said
at a news conference that he has the same name as a suspected gang
member, but the gang member is supposed to be 25 years old and
light-skinned. Navarrete is 71 and dark-skinned.
	   Navarrete and the other two politicians, Humberto Zapata Anorve
and Andres Manzano Anorve, mayors of Cuajinicuilapa and Ometepec,
all acknowledged knowing the alleged leader of the kidnap ring,
Hector Herrera Guzman, but denied being involved in the
kidnappings.
	   The three said they would not seek leaves of absence, which
would lift their immunity and allow them to face charges.
	   All three are related to Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero, who
said he knows them as honorable and respectable people.

	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Randy Johnson struck out 16 for his third shutout
since joining Houston and the Astros snapped Pittsburgh's nine-game
winning streak Friday night with a 2-0 victory.
	   Johnson (5-1), who allowed seven hits, tied a franchise record
for strikeouts in a game by a left-hander. He had 12 strikeouts in
seven innings at Pittsburgh on Aug. 2 in his first start after
joining the Astros in a July 31 trade with Seattle.
	   Craig Biggio had fielder's choice grounders in the sixth and
eighth innings to account for the game's only runs. Houston had
just four hits.
	   Adrian Brown went 3-for-4 for the Pirates.
	   Francisco Cordova (12-11) took the loss.
 &UR; Reds 10, Marlins 8 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Bret Boone homered for the third time in two
games and drove in four runs as Cincinnati remained perfect against
Florida.
	   The Reds are 7-0 against the Marlins this season, one of three
teams that have not lost to the defending World Series champions.
Florida is 0-25 against Cincinnati, San Francisco and Milwaukee.
	   Scott Sullivan (4-5) allowed two runs over 2 2-3 innings _
including Alex Gonzalez's solo homer _ to get the win after Jason
Bere went only four innings. Gabe White got the last six outs for
his fourth save.
	   Rob Stanifer (1-4) took the loss.

Jones beats Arron in sprint showdown; cold thwarts record attempts

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ World Champion Marion Jones once again
asserted her dominance of the 100 meters with a wire-to-wire win
over her French rival Christine Arron.
	   Jones ran 10.80 seconds to put Arron firmly in second place in
the Van Damme Memorial Grand Prix event. Arron finished in 10.95.
	   Arron had been touted as challenger to Jones' dominance of the
100 meters after she ran a blistering 10.73 to win the European
Championship last week.
	   But the American controled Friday's race, holding off a mid-race
spurt by the flame-haired Frenchwoman and extending her lead in the
final meters.
	   ``I've ran against three times this year and I've beaten her
three times,'' Jones told reporters after the race. ``Today I gave
my answer who is the fasted woman in the world.''
	   Jones blamed the chilly evening for the relatively slow time,
well below her season's best of 10.71. The cold also thwarted
efforts by a trio of African runners to break world records in the
5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and womens' 1,000 meters on the
normally fast Brussels track.
	   However all four athletes still in the running for a share of
the dlrs 1 million Golden League Jackpot won their events to stay
in contention for the big prize.
	   Apart from Jones, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie ran a season's
best time of 7 minutes, 25.09 seconds to demolish the opposition in
the 3,000 meters and Mococco's Hicham El Guerrouj won the 1,500 in
3 minutes, 29.68 seconds.
	   Bryan Bronson stayed in the running with a 48.25 second win in
the 400-meters hurdles, although the American had a scare as he
eased up in the final stretch and was almost caught by Russia's
Ruslan Mashenko.
	   Their victories were overshadowed however, by the athletes
concern that the final of the track Grand Prix season scheduled for
Sept. 5 in Moscow should be moved away from the Russian capital
because of the economic turmoil gripping the country.
	   ``We feel that its an insult to go to Moscow and leave with
million dollar prizes,'' said U.S. sprint star Jon Drummond after
winning the 200 meters. ``I feel our safety is also a factor.''
	   Drummond said he would not go to Moscow, but Jones disagreed.
``I'm happy to go. I'm an athlete and I'm going to compete,'' she
told reporters.
	   Kenyan Paul Tergat finished the 10,000 meters in 26 minutes,
46.44 seconds, well short of Gebrselassie's world record. Fellow
Kenyan Daniel Komen fared even worse in his bit to regain the 5,000
record, losing in the final stretch to Ethiopia's Assefa Mezgebu in
another slow time.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola won the 1,000 meters but failed in her
bid to set a new world mark in the rarely run distance.

Jersey vs. Japan: A Battle of the Easts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Toms River, New Jersey (U.S.
East) manager Mike Gaynor brought his team to the Little League
World Series in 1995 and went 1-2.
	   He says this time around hasn't been much easier.
	   And about that 4-0 record this week, coach?
	   ``I think there's a little more parity this time,'' he insists.
He may have a point.
	   The East champions needed 11 innings to beat Jenison, Michigan
(U.S. Central); defeated Greenville, North Carolina (U.S. South) by
just a couple of runs _ twice _ and dispatched Cypress, California
(U.S. West), on a homer late in the game.
	   The average margin of victory overall in the U.S. pool was 2.5
runs.
	   While he expects a close fight against international champion
Kashima, Japan, in Saturday's final, Gaynor said he expects to win,
although he insists he hasn't even seen his opponent play this
week.
	   ``I've seen 'em play,'' shortstop Todd Frazier said after Toms
River defeated Greenville 5-2 Thursday. ``They're a reasonable
team. I think we have a chance to beat 'em.''
	   Added ace Scott Fisher, who could get the start Saturday
afternoon: ``Japan is a good team. They can hit the ball.''
	   Kashima's star this week has been Tetsuya Furukawa, who is
6-for-14 with two home runs and seven RBIs.
	   On the mound, Furukawa is 2-0 with 19 strikeouts, including 12
in a 3-2 victory in eight innings against Langley, British
Columbia, on Thursday as his team became the first Japanese team in
the final in 22 years.
	   Sayaka Tsushima, the sixth girl to play in a World Series, will
be the first girl to play in a final.
	   She's not a gimmick: She went 3-for-4 in Thursday's win and has
scored three runs this week.
	   Manager Atsushi Ohkawa admits being a little disappointed with
his team's performance: It went 3-1 in getting to the final.
Langley beat the Japanese 10-5 Tuesday by scoring nine runs in the
final two innings.
	   But, he said, ``we feel like we have a lot of power right now.
It's been so long since a Japanese team went to the World Series.''
	   Chofu of Tokyo won it all in 1976 by beating Campbell,
California 10-3.
	   The last team from New Jersey to play in final, Lakewood, won it
the previous year, 4-3 over Belmont Heights, Tampa, Florida.
	   Toms River counters Furukawa with Frazier, who is 5-for-11 with
three home runs and nine RBIs. Brad Frank is batting .600 with five
singles and three RBIs. And Gabe Gardner has two home runs and five
RBIs.
	   Neither manager had named a starting pitcher Friday.

Rangers 6, White Sox 5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Will Clark homered in the 10th inning and was
part of Texas' three-straight homer outburst in the fourth as the
Rangers beat the Chicago White Sox 6-5 in the first game of a
doubleheader Friday.
	   Juan Gonzalez, Clark and Ivan Rodriguez hit consecutive home
runs in the fourth, with Gonzalez raising his major league-leading
RBI total to 135 with his two-run shot. Gonzalez has 38 home runs.
	   Clark's game-winning shot, his 21st homer of the season, came
off Bob Howry (0-3) with two outs in the 10th. Xavier Hernandez
(6-3) pitched two hitless innings. John Wetteland pitched the 10th
for his 37th save.
	   Jeff Abbott, Albert Belle and Ray Durham homered for the White
Sox. Bell hit his 40th of the year in the fourth, giving him 40
homers in three of the last four seasons.
 &UR; Yankees 10, Mariners 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, Chili Davis doubled to highlight a five-run first
inning and Orlando Hernandez made it stand up as New York beat
Seattle.
	   New York won its third straight game and, at 97-36, surpassed
last year's record of 96-66. Chuck Knoblauch had four of the
Yankees' 12 hits and Scott Brosius hit a two-run homer into the
upper deck.
	   Shane Monahan, Russ Davis and Rob Ducey homered for the
Mariners, making them the first team to hit 200 home runs in three
straight seasons. Ken Griffey Jr., the AL home run leader with 44,
went 0-for-3 with a walk.
	   Hernandez (9-4) pitched seven innings and gave up three hits,
including home runs by Monahan and Davis. Paul Spoljaric (4-3) was
tagged for nine runs and nine hits in three-plus innings.
 &UR; Angels 7, Red Sox 6 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Anaheim capitalized on Steve Avery's wildness and Ken
Hill's return from the disabled list as it kept beating top AL
teams, holding on for a win over Boston.
	   That followed three wins in five games in New York against the
Yankees, who have the best record in the majors. The Red Sox,
second best in the AL and in command of the wild-card race, dropped
their second straight.
	   Hill (9-5) was activated before the game and allowed three runs
and eight hits in six innings. He had been on the disabled list
since undergoing surgery June 15 to remove bone chips and shave
spurs in his pitching elbow.
	   Avery (9-6) allowed two hits in his first 4 1-3 innings, but
retired just one more batter. He left after walking three
consecutive hitters, two with the bases loaded that brought in the
first two runs of the five-run fifth.
 &UR; Royals 6, Orioles 5 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Pat Rapp pitched 6 2-3 innings of four-hit ball
before being hit by a line drive as Kansas City extended
Baltimore's losing streak to five games.
	   Rapp (11-11) was replaced in the seventh after a liner by B.J.
Surhoff hit him below the right knee. The injury was diagnosed as a
bruised shin.
	   Jeff Montgomery got three outs for his 29th save. Larry Sutton
homered for the Royals, who have won seven of nine. Kansas City
turned five double plays.
	   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 41st homer, and Mike Bordick added a
solo shot for the Orioles. Sidney Ponson (7-8) took the loss.
 &UR; Blue Jays 7, Twins 6 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Shawn Green's second homer of the game, a two-run
shot in the seventh, sent Toronto past Minnesota.
	   Minnesota's Paul Molitor, who drove in four runs, hit his 600th
career double in fifth and joined Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner as the
only players in history with 3,000 hits, 600 doubles and 500 stolen
bases.
	   Green hit his first shot off one of the Skydome's restaurant
windows in the fifth. With the Blue Jays trailing 6-5 in the
seventh, he hit his 28th homer off Mike Trombley (4-4).
	   Woody Williams (10-8) was the winner.
	   Jose Canseco hit his 37th homer for Toronto.
 &UR; Athletics 14, Indians 6, 10 innings
	   In Cleveland, Oakland scored eight runs in the 10th, highlighted
by Mike Blowers' two-run double and Jason Giambi's three-run homer.
	   With the score tied at 6, the A's loaded the bases off Cleveland
reliever Steve Reed (2-2) on two walks and an infield hit. Scott
Spiezio then lined a 3-2 pitch down the left-field line for two
runs.
	   Miguel Tejada hit a tapper to first baseman Richie Sexson, whose
throw to the plate was too late to catch Bip Roberts. Rickey
Henderson added an RBI single to make it 10-6, Ryan Christenson had
an RBI single and Giambi hit his 21st homer. Giambi and Rickey
Henderson each had four of Oakland's season-high 24 hits.
	   Gil Heredia (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Tigers 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Bubba Trammell's solo homer in the ninth lifted
Tampa Bay past Detroit in a game between the AL's worst teams.
	   Trammell, selected from Detroit in the expansion draft, hit a
1-1 pitch off Brian Moehler (12-11) into the lower deck in left for
his 10th homer.
	   Jim Mecir (7-2) got the victory, and Roberto Hernandez pitched
the ninth for his 22nd save. Paul Sorrento had a three-run double
in the first.

Fishermen in Indonesian town burn property of ethnic Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of fishermen in a coastal
town burned cars and houses belonging to members of the ethnic
Chinese minority, a newspaper reported Saturday. At least 14 people
were arrested.
	   Hundreds of police and soldiers were unable to prevent the mob
rampaging until late in the evening Friday in the Java island town
of Cilacap, The Jakarta Post reported. The rioters were angry over
low wages and alleged corruption.
	   The unrest was the latest in a string of riots this week around
Indonesia, which is suffering economic turmoil that has stripped
millions of their jobs and pushed up prices.
	   Ethnic Chinese dominate the economy and have been often been
blamed for the crisis. They were also targeted in more widespread
violence that led to the downfall in May of former President
Suharto after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Authorities arrested 14 people but there were no reports of
injuries in Cilacap, 435 kilometers (270 miles) east of Jakarta,
the capital.
	   The rioting began when the fishermen burned at least 10 trawlers
moored in the fishing port near the town, the Post reported. They
then moved into Cilacap, burning and damaging four cars, 10
motorcycles and 20 houses belonging to ethnic Chinese.
	   Soldiers blocked thoroughfares but were outnumbered and had to
call to call for backup from neighboring towns.
	   The crews of the fishing boats said they were exploited by their
employers and had not received a pay raise in six years. The
fishermen are paid 2,000 rupiah (18 U.S. cents) a day, a salary
below the minimum wage, the Post quoted Cilacap police chief Col.
Andi Lolo as saying.
	   The protesters also complained that port officials extorted
money from them.
	   Under Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, the government
has pledged to curb corruption and is instituting democratic
reforms. General elections are scheduled next year.

Prime minister visits area devastated by storm flooding

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sloshing through mud, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Saturday inspected areas devastated by flooding, stopping
by at home for the handicapped where five people were killed by a
mudslide.
	   Heavy rains that began earlier in the week continued in Tokyo
and nearby areas in eastern Japan, causing rivers to swell and
flooding thousands of homes.
	   Police said at least 13 people have died and 32 people injured
nationwide, as of early Saturday, in damage caused by the heavy
downpour brought on by Tropical Storm Rex.
	   Search efforts continued Saturday for three missing people in
Tochigi, after a river burst its banks Thursday.
	   Nearly 8,000 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, police said. Mudslides totaled 575, while 19 bridges
have been swept away, they said.
	   Thousands of people have been evacuated throughout the
disaster-struck regions.
	   Obuchi arrived in the morning in Fukushima Prefecture (state),
175 kilometers (110 miles) north of Tokyo, and was expected to
visit nearby Tochigi Prefecture in the afternoon.
	   He was shown on nationwide TV news shaking hands with people who
had fled their homes and telling them, ``Keep strong.''
	   The Central Meteorological Agency said Tropical Storm Rex was
expected to hit the eastern coast of Japan over the weekend or
early next week.
	   As of noon Saturday, Rex, packing winds of up to 126 kph (80
mph), was slowly moving northeasterly from out in the Pacific
Ocean, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo, it said.
	   The agency warned of additional mudslides as well as thunder and
lightning, strong winds and hail in affected areas.
	   Ibaraki Prefecture, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, was expected to have 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain
Saturday.
	   The rains have filled roads with mud and smashed rice stalks in
fields. TV news showed people fleeing on boats from homes so buried
in murky water that only rooftops showed.
	   Elsewhere, people waded through kneehigh waters, and in coastal
areas, waves tossed docked boats.
