<HEADLINE> French, Canadian Consortium Signs Oil Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A consortium formed by Elf
Aquitaine of France and Bow Valley of Canada signed a deal here
Sunday night with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) to
develop Iran's offshore Balal oil-field on the "buy-back" scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that Elf
Aquitaine would hold 85 percent and Bow Valley the rest 15
percent of the contract valued at 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil field is 100 kilometers southwest of Lavan island in
the Persian Gulf in a water depth of 70 meters and has
recoverable reserves estimated at 119 million barrels of good
quality oil.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Mehdi Husseini told IRNA that the
first oil of around 40,000 barrels per day would be pumped in
2001 and the term of the contract is about six years.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Elf Aquitaine and an Italian company also signed a
deal to boost Iran's oil production in Iran's Dorood oil and gas
field.
</P>
<P>
The contracts defied the U.S. Iran-Libya Sanction Act, which
bans investment of more than 20 million U.S. dollars in Iran's
energy sectors.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called for the lifting of the U.S. sanction law,
saying that all foreign oil firms, including U.S. companies, are
welcomed to make investments in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Australia Sign Memo on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Australia signed here on
Sunday a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in veterinary
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and
Land Reclamation Youssef Wali and Minister of Primary Industry and
Fisheries of Western Australia State Monty House signed the memo,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the memo, the two sides will work out a program for
technical cooperation in the veterinary area, including exchange
of technical teams in livestock production and meat industry.
</P>
<P>
The memo stipulated that the two sides will also exchange
veterinary scholarship aimed at enhancing the skills of
veterinarians in the meat and livestock industry in Egypt and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also examine opportunities for cooperation
in the field of land reclamation at Egypt's Toshka and East
Oweinat projects to support the activities of the private sectors
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off the Toshka project in 1997 in an effort to
channel Nile water to irrigate a swatch of desert in the south.
The East Oweinat project, also in the far south, is designed to
reclaim land from desert with subterranean water.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Australia have long been cooperating in livestock
farming. The memorandum of understanding will further deepen the
relationship and contribute to enhancing the strong economic ties
between the two countries, the news agency said.

The Western Australia State official is on an Egypt tour which
will wind up on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State to Be Founded in 2001: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- An independent Palestinian state
will be founded in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the year 2001,
a senior official with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
has said.
</P>
<P>
Hani Al-Hassan, member of the PLO's Central Committee on
foreign affairs, made the remark at a seminar marking the 23rd
anniversary of the Palestinian Land Day, the Palestinian Arabic
newspaper Al-Guds reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that a high-ranking Palestinian
official mentioned 2001 as the year in which an independent
Palestinian state is to be established. Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has been insisting that the coming May 4 will be the date
for him to declare Palestinian statehood despite Israeli
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, also an advisor to Arafat on foreign affairs and
strategy, said the issue of statehood is no longer a subject under
negotiation and land is now the core of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are in Gaza and the (West) Bank, determined to endue the
independent Palestinian country with sovereignty and to launch
economic construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Palestinian leaders are consulting
with the European Union (EU) over the issue. The EU in a
resolution in March called on Israel and the Palestinians to start
the final status talks in the coming months, based on relevant
U.N. resolutions and signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The EU hoped the talks can produce results within a year to
realize the "unconditional and lasting rights of the Palestinian
to self-determination."
</P>
<P>
Beyond the time limit, the EU said, Israel will have no power
to "veto" an independent Palestinian state in the territories. It
also assured that it will be ready to recognize the Palestinian
state at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace-making has been stalled since
last December. Arafat has stuck to May 4 for statehood declaration
when the five-year interim period under Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the final status talks on
borders, refugees and the fate of the holy city of Jerusalem
should have started by May 1996 and a permanent peace deal between
the two sides should be completed by May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened that
Israel will annex parts of the West Bank if Arafat unilaterally
declares an independent state.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Washington as part of his global
campaign to rally support for his statehood declaration, Arafat
also failed to get U.S. backing to his potential move.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is in Jordan for talks with King Abdullah Bin Hussein on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited the U.S., western Europe and Egypt, and is
expected to travel on to Russia, Turkey, China and Japan to
solicit international support.

CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here Sunday for Beijing on a five-day state visit to China at
the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak did not speak to reporters upon departure at Cairo
International Airport. He led a high-level delegation including
prime minister, ministers of power and energy, information and
foreign affairs in his seventh trip to China since 1976.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in China, Mubarak will hold talks with Jiang
Zemin on ways of further promoting the bilateral cooperation
relations and international and regional issues of common
interest, especially the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and China have been maintaining close cooperation and
consultations on world political affairs and international and
regional issues since 1956 when the two countries set up
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expanded the economic and trade ties in recent
years, establishing a number of joint ventures for the development
of Egypt's industrial zone in the north of the Suez Gulf.
</P>
<P>
China is the first stop of Mubarak's Asian tour, which will also
take him to South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah Bin
Hussein arrived in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah
Sunday on a three-day official visit to strengthen bilateral ties
and seal a financial aid package promised by Saudi leaders.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was greeted at the airport by Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, along with Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The two monarchs will hold talks later in the day on a number
of political and economic issues of mutual concern, including the
Middle East peace process and the promised Saudi aid to Jordan,
according to the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king will also convey his gratitude to Saudi
Arabia for its support to the new monarch following the death of
King Hussein last February. A high-ranking Saudi delegation headed
by the crown prince went to Amman to pay last respect to Hussein
and attend his funeral.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan were
affected by Amman's siding with Iraq during the 1990-1991 Gulf
crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh, once the largest donor country to Jordan, suspended
its nearly 200 million U.S. dollars in annual economic aid and cut
its oil supply to Amman after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the two Arab kingdoms have been
amending the damaged ties, which received a boost after Hussein's
death and Abdullah's accession to the throne of the Hashemite
Kingdom on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has sent several of its ministers to
Jordan to follow up closely the financial situation there and
promised to provide necessary help.
</P>
<P>
But Jordanian officials complained that Riyadh had been too
slow in translating into action its pledged economic aid Amman
desperately counts on.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Sentenced to Death for Abducting, Raping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo court Sunday ordered the
hanging of a man who abducted a three-year-old girl and repeatedly
raped her in the two-month-plus captivity.
</P>
<P>
After the sentence, judge Ahmed el-Ashmawi said he was
punishing a man "who committed a crime that made the sky shudder."
</P>
<P>
Talaat Abdel-Mawgoud, 27, confessed to kidnaping the girl in
January and then repeatedly raping her. His court-appointed lawyer
requested mercy, but told the judge there was nothing he could say
in his client's defense.
</P>
<P>
Shouts of joy from the girl's relatives and observers filled
the courtroom when the death sentence was handed down.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Mawgoud confessed to luring the girl in front of her
house in El-Qanater el-Khaiyria, 25 kilometers northwest of Cairo,
with promises of chocolates. He took her by bicycle to nearby
el-Manashi and rented a room.
</P>
<P>
For 67 days, he stayed there, telling people he was the girl's
father. A neighbor, however, noticed the girl's health
deteriorating and took her to a hospital. She reported
Abdel-Mawgoud to police after doctors told her the girl had been
raped.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's top Muslim cleric, Nasr Farid Wasel, must ratify the
sentence before it is carried out. That process usually takes a
week.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S., British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was injured
Sunday when U.S. and British warplanes bombed civilian facilities
and military sites in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 3:35 p.m. local time (1135 GMT) 13 formations of enemy
planes from Kuwaiti and Saudi bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace over Nasiriya, Samawa and Basra provinces.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi warplanes intercepted the enemy planes and forced them
to flee to their bases at 3:53 p.m. local time, added the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes resumed their regular bombings on
Iraqi targets Friday after the holy period of pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
During the holy hadj, U.S. and British jets suspended their
almost daily attacks on Iraqi military and civilian targets in
the no-fly zones in order not to arouse protests from Arab
people.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, U.S. and British warplanes bombed the main
control system of an oil export station in Baker harbor in
southern Basra province.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq,
Baghdad declared that it did not recognize the restricted zones and
would fire at any allied planes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diverts Aircraft From Incirlik to Europe for Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon, striving to deal
with sustained drain of air forces in bombing against Yugoslavia,
has diverted important parts of the U.S. air fleet patrolling the
northern no-fly zone in Iraq to Kosovo for NATO's sustained air
strikes against Yugoslavia, U.S. officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among the planes sent to Europe for the intensifying air raids
are Navy EA-6B Prowlers, which are electronic warfare planes that
jam and can attack air defense radars, and refueling aircraft, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.S. and British fighter jets used to enforce
the northern no-fly zone in Iraq have not flown since March 20,
four days before NATO launched its airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Officials at U.S. European Command in Germany acknowledged that
some aircraft at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, charged with
monitoring the sky over the northern no-fly zone, had been
diverted to the NATO Allied Campaign.
</P>
<P>
They would not provide any details, including how many or which
kinds of aircraft were sent.
</P>
<P>
"We have made no secret that we have borrowed assets from
Northern Watch," Army Col. Gary Hovatter, a European Command
spokesman, said Friday. Northern Watch is the Pentagon's name for
the U.S.-British mission over the northern no-fly zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some other officials said the military action against
Yugoslavia caused a "significant" drain on the fleet at Incirlik.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Private Investment Pours into Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Investment
Authority said Sunday that the flow of private investment into the
country shown a marked increase over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an investment promotion meeting here, Tadesse
Haile, general manager of the authority, said entrepreneurs are
increasingly interested to invest in the country's nine states due
to government's initiative to speed up development in the states
as well as tax holidays and other incentives policies.

"Some five years ago, Addis Ababa had the highest share of the
national investment with 80.8 percent," but now its share has
dwindled to 31 percent, said Tadesse.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, 4,667 investment projects
worth 37.9 billion birr (4.8 billion U.S. dollars) had been
approved in the country between May 1992 and September 1998.
Among them, 1,220 projects with an estimated investment capital of
7.9 billion birr (1 billion U.S. dollars) have already gone
operational.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng in Ankara for Talks with Turkish Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), arrived
here on Sunday for talks with Turkish leaders on issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the media at the Ankara International Airport, Li
said that he was impressed most by Turkey's strategic importance
on the world map and the role it can play in promoting peace and
development in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
The top Chinese legislator arrived in Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey, last Friday on a five-day official visit to this
country that sits across the continents of Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he was expecting talks with Turkish leaders to
exchange views on a wide range of issues of common concern during
his stay in Ankara, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be specifically focused on ways to further
develop the cooperation between China and Turkey in trade and
economic fields as well as in the political sphere on the basis of
the five principles of peaceful co-existence, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the escalated attacks by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization against Yugoslavia, Li noted that the tragedy has
entered its 12th day and is still unfolding.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned about the worsening situation," Li
said, adding that he would like to exchange views with Turkish
leaders on this crisis during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Stop bombing and return to the negotiating table for peace is
the only way out for solving the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin, who met Li at the
airport, said Turkey attaches great importance to its cooperative
relations with China in all fields, and has a strong political
will to further develop ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He said he would exchange views with Li on ways to promote
bilateral cooperation in the economic and trade areas, and explore
ways on how to increase exchanges between the parliaments of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Turkey are the two countries who can play important
roles in maintaining peace, stability and development in this part
of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing NATO strikes against Yugoslavia, Cetin said
this is the biggest tragedy in the world after the Second World
War which ended in 1945. Turkey maintains that this crisis should
be settled through peaceful means, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the second leg of Li's current six-nation tour, which
has taken him to Greece and will further bring him to Syria,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says No Change of Policy On Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) spokesman Sunday ruled out any change of its
policy on Kosovo, saying nobody as a matter of fact has been
trying to take Kosovo away from Yugoslavia and "the allies never
supported the goal of independence in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Asked if NATO has adapted its policy to a new situation, NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters that NATO still believes the
answer is a highly-developed state of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia is a multi-ethnic society, which is like
most European countries, not only because of 1.8 million Kosovar
Albanians and there are the Hungarian-speaking ethnic community
and a sizable Muslim community. "For the future of Yugoslavia, it
certainly cannot be a mono-ethnic state," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that the future of Yugoslavia depends crucially on
the ability of the different ethnic groups living some kind of
harmony each other. "Now, many other countries grappled with this
problem and might more or less solve it, at least solve it without
violence. And therefore if other European countries are able to do
this, should not be beyond the wit of Yugoslavia to find a formula
for this as well, that is where a way will go to a democratic
Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, there is no doubt, autonomy works out better
in democratic states than in authoritarian ones because democratic
states clearly more willing to make the compromise for power
sharing to allow different communities to have autonomy together,"
the NATO spokesman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Nine Lebanese civilians, including
four children, were wounded Sunday in Israeli bombardment on
south Lebanon villages, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims, eight people were injured when a shell
Israeli troops fired landed in the courtyard of a house in
Habboush, just north of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A two-year-old child was seriously wounded in the shelling,
the sources added.
</P>
<P>
A 13-year-old child was also wounded by Israeli shelling on
Arabsalim village in the same area.
</P>
<P>
The attacks raised to 26 the number of Lebanese civilians
wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this year. One person
was killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli warplanes also struck suspected
targets of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the
border enclave. There is no immediate reports of casualties in
the assaults.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli occupation forces out
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Woes Continue with Another Winless Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Dalian Wanda
extended their winless streak to four matches--the club's worst
record--as the visiting Jilin Aodong forced out a goalless draw in
Sunday's Chinese first division soccer league.
</P>
<P>
But Shanghai Shenhua, the only other side besides Wanda to
taste the title-crowning victory since the launch of the Chinese
professional league in 1994, managed a first win in the season, a
narrow 1-0 victory over the home side Chongqing Longxin.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, lingering at tenth on the table after collecting three
points and only one goal from four matches, looked the shadow of
the team which swept four league trophies in the past five years--
four times in a row--in Sunday's match and more and more voices
are calling for their coach Xu Genbao's head.
</P>
<P>
At the post-match news conference, Xu admitted Wanda are going
through their hardest period in five years but parried the
question of when he would step down.
</P>
<P>
"I will quit when it is necessary, " Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Xu's counterpart at Shanghai Shenhua, the Brazilian Lazaronni
fared better today, leading the last season's runners-up to their
first win since the season kicked off on March 21.
</P>
<P>
The second-half change-over by the Brazil's 1990 World Cup
manager proved to be fatal for the hosting Longxin, as the
substitute Huo Zhiyu headed the winning goal in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Quanxing scored an emphatic 3-1 home win over Guangzhou
Songri, jumping to the top of the table with ten points and eight
goals from four matches.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Fushun, the newly-promoted side which has been billed
as "the Chinese Kaiserslautern" for their impressive season-
opening performance, a 3-1-0 record including a stunning first
round win over Wanda, trounced another first division new comers
Wuhan Heart K 4-0. Qu Shengqing scored a pair of goals in the
match to keep his status as the leading scorer with four goals.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, with worse goal difference than Quanxing and placed
second on the table, smacks of the German side which made history
last season by becoming the first newly-promoted club to win the
Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Beijing Guo'an slip up in the final moments as
Qingdao Hainiu snatched an equalizer in the 88th minute to bring
out a 1-1 away draw. Guo'an stands on the third place with nine
points.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Taida was held to a goalless home draw by Shangdong
Luneng while Shenzhen Ping'an suffered a home 1-2 loss to Shenyang
Haishi.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says to Go Ahead With Sustained Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Sunday vowed to push bombing raids forward against
Yugoslavia as there was still no sign of Belgrade's submission to
NATO's abuse of military force.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the sustained air campaign is the right approach"
to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into accepting
NATO's deal on Kosovo, Albright told NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
She put the blame on Yugoslavia for the flooding of refugees,
which was the direct results of the 10-day NATO bombing on the
province of Kosovo, forcing ethnic Albanians living there to flee
for safety from NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Albright confirmed that President Bill Clinton was considering
sending Apache helicopter gunships to Albania, along with some
U.S. soldiers to support the air effort. She would not say how
many troops, but reiterated the administration's opposition to
sending ground troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Yugoslav leaders must withdraw their forces and
allow NATO "implementation force" to enter into the sovereign
territory of Yugoslavia, the province of Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people were killed
in a head- on collision between a minibus taxi and a car in the
Northern Cape on Sunday, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident was the worst since the start of the Easter
weekend. Fourteen people were killed in a six-car pileup on Friday
in Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted police spokesman Tony Modise as saying that
Sunday's accident happened shortly after 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) near
Warrenton, some 400 kilometers southwest of Johannesburg, when a
Nissan minibus struck an Opel Rekord travelling in the opposite
direction and overturned.
</P>
<P>
One of the vehicles' drivers apparently lost control and the
two vehicles collided head-on, causing the taxi to move off the
road and flip over, Modise said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people died instantly and another person died later at
the Warrenton hospital.
</P>
<P>
Five other passengers were taken to hospitals in Kimberley and
Warrenton for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were still trying to establish the identities
of the victims and which passengers were travelling in each
vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Build More Jewish Settlements in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Arens said Sunday in Hebron that Israel will build more Jewish
settlements in the city.
</P>
<P>
Arens was speaking to local Jewish settlers while laying
down a corner stone for a new settlement that is to be built near
Dabouya in the old city of Hebron, the Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli troops in Hebron shut down the Ibrahim
Mosque in the city to enable local Jewish settlers to celebrate
their feast of Passover.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, situated in the south of the West Bank, is under the
Palestinian control. Under heavy military protection of Israel
Defense Force (IDF), about 500 Jewish settlers are living among
130,000 Palestinians, which has made the city a flashpoint of
clashes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a settler's
van and wounded three Jewish women in the city.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, 20-year-old Badar Kawashmeh, a palestinian
resident in the city, was shot dead by the IDF.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Minister Says No Trial for U.S. Captured Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. soldiers captured by
Serb forces will not be put on trial and will be freed when the
NATO bombing raids end, a Yugoslav minister said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Of course they will not be tried and they will be back in
their homes as soon as this stupidity stops," Milan Bozic,
Yugoslav minister without portfolio and deputy mayor of Belgrade,
said on the ABC program "This Week."
</P>
<P>
Last week, some reports said the Yugoslav government was
collecting evidence for a trial of the captive U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
But Bozic said reports of a trial were false, attributing them
to "malevolent communication from some media on the West."
</P>
<P>
Bozic said the three would be well treated. "I can assure the
American public that there will be no problem with them," he said
while being interviewed on ABC by satellite transmission from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities said the three U.S. soldiers were
captured when they were in Kosovo.

WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is deploying
Apache helicopter gunships to the Kosovo conflict but has not yet
made a decision to use them there, U.S. National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"A decision has been made, at this point, to deploy them,"
Berger told CBS's "Face the Nation."
</P>
<P>
He was answering to a question about the truthfulness of a
report that said the United States was deploying an unspecified
number of low-flying Apaches and 2,000 support troops to Albania,
which signaled a wider ground war.
</P>
<P>
"What it means is that the president has been responsive to the
request from his commanders in the field for additional assets.
These helicopters... are able to go in to Kosovo and do
considerable damage to the Serb forces in Kosovo should they be
used," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"The forces that are going associated with them are not ground
forces to go into Serbia or to go into Kosovo. They are associated
with the use of the Apache helicopters if a decision is made to
use them," he said. "A decision has been made, at this point, to
deploy them."
</P>
<P>
On the dangers of helicopter deployment, he said, "There are
dangers in all aspects of this but I think it is something that
our military commander believes will be userful and I think the
president fells it is a reasonable request."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Urges to Halt Drafting New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean opposition party Sunday
called on the government to halt the drafting of a new
constitution until the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA)
agrees to participate on the behalf of the majority of
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the opposition Zimbabwe National Debate
Association Kurauone Chihwayi said in a statement that his party
believed that there was lack of transparency within the National
Constitutional Commission which was mainly dominated by the ruling
party, Zanu (PF).
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said his party "has noted that Zanu (PF)
has over 50 percent representation within the commission which is
supposed to have equal representation of all stakeholders,".
</P>
<P>
"The drafting of a new constitution should not be controlled by
the government since this was initiated by civic organizations and
individuals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our organization is keen to see the drafting of the
constitution proceeding but we believe the NCA should be part of
the team," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling upon all non-members of the ruling party Zanu
(PF) to quit from the National Constitutional Commission which was
appointed by President Robert Mugabe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional assembly recently turned down the
government's invitation to participate in the commission which was
appointed by the State to redraft the country's constitution.

WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the National
Institute of Standards And Technology (NIST) is creating a
computer model, the Industrial Fire Simulator, to make fire safety
systems of the future better and more economical.
</P>
<P>
According to an NIST press release, the fire simulator combines
computer technology, the latest advances in mathematical modeling
techniques and measurements from controlled fire experiments
conducted at the NIST and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The computer model will simulate fire spread and the response
of a given sprinkler system. They will produces video simulations
of possible fire scenarios that can be viewed and quantified to
evaluate the likely effectiveness of the proposed fire protection
system.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately the program will help fire protection engineers
design more effective fire safety systems tailored to individual
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The NIST expects to make the first version of the Industrial
Fire Simulator for fire sprinklers available by the end of the
year.

MOSCOW -- The Russian Foreign Ministry Sunday denounced the
United States for imposing sanctions on three Russian firms, which
reportedly sold anti-tank missiles to Syria, a nation on the so-
called U.S. list of "terrorism sponsors."
</P>
<P>
This is an "unfriendly move" and Russia reserves the right to
take corresponding measures, said the ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as another strike on the bilateral relations
which is being tested by U.S.-led NATO military attack on
Yugoslavia, the ministry said the move clearly shows that the U.S.
is once again trying to replace international agreements with its
internal laws and demonstrating disrespect for international norms
and principles of conduct.

purchases from and exports to the Tula Design Bureau, the Volsk

<HEADLINE> Libya's Handover of Lockerbie Suspects to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan government will soon hand
over the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing to the U.N., Ahmed
Bin-Hali, assistant secretary-general of the Cairo-based Arab
League (AL) was quoted as saying in Libyan capital Tripoli Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bin-Hali has led a delegation involving the seven-member AL
committee on the Lockerbie issue to supervise the handover
process, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chief U.N. legal counsel, Hans Corell, is
expected in Tripoli soon to escort the pair, their defense
lawyers, physician and parents to the Hague, the Netherlands, as
part of the arrangement between the U.N. and Libya.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Pan Am flight 103 exploded midair over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people in the air and on the ground, mostly
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long accused two Libyans, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, of blowing up the
jetliner and demanded the two men stand trial in either of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council clamped sanctions on Libya in 1992
and tightened them the next year to try to compel the Libyan
government to extradite the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
But Tripoli refused to surrender the pair, arguing that they
can not get fair trial in the West while demanding a third country
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain dropped their insistence last August and
proposed the trial be held in the Netherlands before Scottish
judges and under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya in principle agreed to the proposal, but the handover was
snagged later after Tripoli sought further clarification from the
U.N. over where the two, if convicted, will serve their jail terms
and when the seven-year sanctions will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, South African President Nelson Mandela, who
arrived in Tripoli a day earlier, announced that he had clinched a
deal with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and all the remaining
obstacles to the handover were removed.
</P>
<P>
Libya agreed to hand over the two suspects by April 6 and
allowed them to serve their prison sentences in Scotland if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
In return, the sanctions will be suspended upon the arrival of
the pair in the Netherlands and be lifted within 90 days after
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submits a report to the Security
Council, stating that Libya has complied with all relevant
resolutions.

<P>
"It is a great race to end the evening. I have a surprising
night," said Australia's Philip Rogers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's team coach Koji Ueno said they had aimed to clinch the
title and break the record. He said the result of the night is "an
accumulation of experience" and the goal of the team is the
champion of next year's Olympics.
</P>

set a championships record by winning the men's 200 meters medley
final with a time of 1:55.81. His countryman, Grant Hackett, who
cut 4.8 seconds off the record in the men's 400 meters freestyle
Friday, set a championships record by winning the men's 1,500
meters freestyle final with a time of 14 minutes 32.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Mark Foster of Britain set a championships record by winning
the men's 50 meters butterfly final with a time of 23.61 seconds.

CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Goweili has disclosed that Egypt's rice exports made big increase
during 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of March, rice exports amounted to some
226,000 tonnes as compared to 140,000 tonnes a year earlier, which
means an increase of 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Turkey is the first among Egyptian rice
importers. Turkey's imports in the new season amounted to some
56,000 tons which represented 25 percent of Egypt's total rice
exports, followed by Syria, Rumania and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Goweili pointed out that Egyptian rice exports to Israel have
also increased from 237 tonnes in the 1997-1998 to approximately
550 tonnes in the 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi Minister of Finance Hikmat Mizban Ibrahim
has announced that Iraq has decided to reduce customs duties on
U.S. and German-made private cars from 30 percent to 10 percent of
the import value.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Iraq has also decided to cut customs
duties on cars made in other countries from 10 percent to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the decision was aimed at meeting the needs
of the transport sector and satisfying private demand.
</P>
<P>
JEDDAH -- The second Iranian commodity fair opens Sunday in
Jeddah, and is organized by Al Harthy Fairs company together with
the Iranian Drasayan company with the participation of about 145
firms.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commodities on display include industrial and
agricultural products as well as handicraft items. It exhibits a
wide ranges of vehicles, buses, building materials, automobile
spare parts, iron and steel, ceramics, household utensils and
electrical appliances, as well as the world-famed carpets.
</P>
<P>
The first fair of Iranian products was held in Riyadh late last
year, and had achieved important results. It was then attended by
large numbers of Saudis who were keen to learn about Iranian
products for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchanges between the two countries started to pick up in
the past few years, reaching 271 million dollars in volume in
1997, of which 213 million dollars represented Saudi exports to
Iran as compared to 58 million dollars of Iranian exports to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Wheat yield in Iran registered an annual rise of 7.9
percent in the past decade from 1989-1998, the Iranian Agriculture
Ministry announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's wheat output stood at about 6 million tonnes in 1989,
but it increased to over 11.9 million tonnes in 1998, a report
from the ministry was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The value of the surplus wheat product in the past decade
amounted to 7.5 billion U.S. dollars on the basis of 200 dollars
per tonne, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The economic value of the rise in wheat production is even more
than the total investment made by both public and private sectors
in the agriculture field.
</P>
<P>
Iran's wheat consumption was reported at 10 million tonnes
every year.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- A consortium formed by Elf Aquitaine of France and
Bow Valley of Canada signed a deal here on Sunday with National
Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) to develop Iran's offshore Balal
oilfield on the "buy-back" scheme.
</P>
<P>
Elf Aquitaine would hold 85 percent and Bow Valley the rest 15
percent of the contract valued at 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil field is 100 kilometers southwest of Lavan island in
the Persian Gulf in a water depth of 70 meters and has
recoverable reserves estimated at 119 million barrels of good
quality oil.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Mehdi Husseini told IRNA that the
first oil of around 40,000 barrels per day would be pumped in 2001
and the term of the contract is about six years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investment made by Elf and Bow Valley would be
returned in a period of three or four years after the oil field
begins to pump oil.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Elf Aquitaine and an Italian company also signed a
deal to boost Iran's oil production in Iran's Dorood oil and gas
field.
</P>
<P>
The contracts defied the U.S. Iran-Libya Sanction Act, which
bans investment of more than 20 million U.S. dollars in Iran's
energy sectors.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called for a lift of the U.S. sanction law and stated
that all foreign oil firms, including the American companies, are
welcomed to make investments in Iran.

DAMASCUS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
will pay a state visit to Russia on April 13 to enhance military

</P>
<P>
Al-Assad will hold talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov during his three-day visit.

Under the deals, Russia will provide Syria with air defense
system Lais 300, tanks and Sokhoy fighters and help upgrade
Syria's Mig fighters.

But Washington, pressuring Moscow to cancel the contracts, has
decided to impose sanctions on three Russian firms that were
directly involved in the deals with Syria.
</P>

On Saturday, Moscow rapped the U.S. planned sanctions as a
"blackmail" and "provocation to the weak-nerved."

Political observers here hold that al-Assad's visit to Moscow
is to enhance bilateral cooperation and Russia's role in the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Suspects Arrives in the Netherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Lamen khalifa Fhimah and Abdel
Basset, the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing,
arrived in the Netherlands from Tripoli on Monday for an
unprecedented trial before a Scottish court, according to news
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Britain expressed immediate welcome to the handover and
announced to suspend seven years of U.N. sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The two, landing at a military airport north of The Hague with
U.N. envoy Hans Corell, were to be tried under the Scottish legal
system at Camp Zeist, a former Dutch military base now ceded to
Britain. Before that, the two were expected to spend at least one
night in a Dutch detention center.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the same day, a handover ceremony was held in the
Libyan capital of Tripoli, and U.N. representative Corell and
families of some of the bombing victims were present at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had promised to hand over the two
suspects in the Lockerbie case by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Pan Am flight 103 exploded midair over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people in the air and on the ground, mostly
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long accused the two suspects of
blowing up the jetliner and demanded the two men stand trial in
either of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council clamped sanctions on Libya
in 1992 and had them tightened the next year to try to compel the
Libyan government to extradite the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
But Tripoli refused to surrender the pair, arguing that they
could not get fair trial in the West and demanding a third country
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain dropped their insistence last August and
proposed the trial be held in the Netherlands before Scottish
judges and under the Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya in principle agreed to the proposal, but the handover was
snagged later after Tripoli sought further clarification from the
U.N. over where the two, if convicted, would serve their jail
terms and when the seven-year sanctions would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, South African President Nelson Mandela, who
arrived in Tripoli a day earlier, announced that he had clinched a
deal with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and all the remaining
obstacles to the handover were removed.
</P>
<P>
Libya agreed to hand over the two suspects by April 6 and
agreed that the two Libyans serve their prison sentences in
Scotland if convicted, as was demanded by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In return, the sanctions will be suspended upon the arrival of
the pair in the Netherlands and be lifted within 90 days after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan submits a report to the Security
Council, stating that Libya has complied with all relevant
resolutions.

BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) spokesman said here Monday that NATO has
escalated its air campaign aimed to strategically degrading the
military capability of the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
Air Commodore David Wilby, the military spokesman, told a daily
news briefing that with clear weather last night all allied
aircraft returned to their bases after engaging targets in and
around Belgrade and throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"An improvement of the weather enabled us to make full use of
all our assets. We have comprehensive number of targets throughout
the full range of military categories, these included petroleum
production and storage, air fields, air defenses, ammunition
storage and bridges," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Wilby said the alliance also hit important headquarters of
Yugoslav air defense forces in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"Air forecast remains favorable, and we will continue intensify
our operations. We will capitalize on the clear weather to attack
strategic and operational targets throughout the operational
area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But in particular, we will focus our attention on fielded
forces in Kosovo. However, this is no easy task," he pointed out,
adding that the Serbian forces are taking every advantage of
deserted buildings and terrain to camouflage their positions.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attributes Refugee Crisis to Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting NATO Deputy Secretary-
General Sergio Balanzino Monday wrongly blamed Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for the massive exodus of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Describing the impact of the refugee wave as "a real earthquake,
" Balanzino, who arrived here Monday, said "NATO and Romania agree
that, in this situation, great efforts must be made to convince
Milosevic that his way of acting is not only disastrous but
altogether criminal, against Yugoslavia's interests."
</P>
<P>
Balanzino made the remark after meeting Romanian Foreign
Minister Andrei Plesu.
</P>
<P>
Romania is the first stop of Balanzino's three-day Balkan tour
aimed at assessing the gravity of the refugee crisis in the region.
He is due in Bulgaria later in the day and will travel to
Macedonia and Albania Tuesday, returning to NATO headquarters in
Brussels Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Plesu said that Romania was deeply worried about the
developments in the neighboring country and also said the refugee
problem was almost an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO staged airstrikes on Yugoslavia on March 24,
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia, have fled. Albania, which has a three million
population, is submerged by 204,000 refugees from Kosovo, while
Macedonia has received an influx of 115,000 Kosovo Albanians, and
Montenegro, a republic of Yugoslavia, 3,300.
</P>
<P>
NATO has said that the attacks on Yugoslavia aimed to force
Serbians to reach peace agreement with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who have been trying to seek independence from Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Manufacturers Expect Revenue to Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Most of U.S. midsize
manufacturers expect revenue growth in 1999, due primarily to
expanding economies at home and abroad, the Wall Street Journal
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 75 percent of 300 chief financial officers polled expect
revenue to improve over last year's level, according to a survey
sponsored by Fleet Financial Corp.. At the same time, nearly two
of three manufacturers say they have no plans to raise their
prices.
</P>
<P>
For midsize manufacturers, defined as companies with annual
revenue from 25 million to 500 million dollars, expectations of
higher sales coupled with price stability reflect broader economic
trends. one factor that may help to contain costs is a moderate
outlook on the wage front, with only half of the executives in the
survey expecting an increase in labor costs per unit.
</P>
<P>
Among midsize exporters, most are watching for signs of
recovery overseas, with 60 percent looking forward to better sales
in 1999, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Optimistic revenue forecasts are also leading to heightened
expectations for manufacturing mergers. More than one in five
companies in the survey acknowledged current plans to acquire or
be acquired by another company.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of 20 women
entrepreneurs will represent Pakistan at the International
Franchise Expo to be held this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Pakistani women will be participating
in the exhibition, where over 300 companies from 45 countries will
also take part, Tehmina Daultana, minister of state for women
development, said here Monday.

Unlike other Pakistani delegations, all the members of this
group would themselves bear the cost of travel and stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the purpose of the visit, Daultana, who will
lead the delegation, said, "Women are going there for doing
business and to promote the economic interests of the country."
"We can only compete in this area if we get to know the world
market," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We are going there with a purpose to get new ideas
and to understand the requirements of the international market."
</P>
<P>
Women, which represent 50 percent of Pakistan's population,
should play an active role in strengthening the national economy,
she said, adding that "we can earn a lot of money but that is
possible only through very hard labor and by working together."
</P>
<P>
These Pakistani women are involved in such businesses as
industry printing and publishing, textile, dress designing, print
media, bakery and kitchen cuisine and media production, according
to the minister.

PARIS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- France said on Monday that the NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslav forces will be more and more violent
and that the Western military alliance is preparing for everything,
including a ground intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"You should understand that if we don't want to make civilians

Kosovo will receive more and more violent strikes. That is
already the case today," said French Defense Minister Alain

Asked whether NATO will send ground forces to Kosovo, he said:

"This operation calls for perseverance because it is an action
which needs continuity and regularity," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the "rapport of force is in the process of
changing and (Yugoslav President) Milosevic can count each day the
units he has lost, the means for moving around he has lost, the

<HEADLINE> Feature: "I Want to Make Living by Myself" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Kayson Muyumbano, an orphan living
in Kanyama township in Zambia's capital Lusaka, was unfortunate in
his teens. But now, his life will turn over a new leaf with the
help from a job training center.
</P>
<P>
His mother died of illness two years before his graduation from
 secondary school, followed by his father's death later. He had
no job after his graduation and had to rely on his older brother
for a living.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make a living by myself," Mutumbano, now 27, told
Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1998, he came to Chibolya Youth Training Center and
started a auto-mechanics course in the community-based
organization.
</P>
<P>
Muyumbano is now planning to open an auto-repair workshop of
his own or seek a job as an auto-mechanic to accumulate money to
marry.
</P>
<P>
For Joy Chipopola, another student studying in tailoring course
in the center, her life is similar or even worse than Muyumbano's.
</P>
<P>
Chipopola also lost her parents when she was in her teens. She
lived with her aunt and then her uncle who also unfortunately died
later one by one.
</P>
<P>
The girl completed her Grade 12 study last year and came to the
center early this year to study in catering course.
</P>
<P>
She plans to study nutriology for another two or three years in
another place after she finishes the catering course in the
center.
</P>
<P>
Chipopola said the study in the center is very useful and she
feels at home there. However, her first choice is to become a
teacher, she said.
</P>
<P>
Kanyama Youth Training Center was set up in 1989 when the
number of students studying in the center was less than 20 in
tailoring and shoe- making courses.
</P>
<P>
It has gradually enjoyed a growing favor among the unemployed
and out of school youths.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990s, another training center was set up in Chibolya
community not far from the first one to meet the growing demand of
the young people.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 170 students in the two centers
trained in auto-mechanics, auto-electrics, catering, poultry
management, tailoring, carpentry and brick-laying.
</P>
<P>
Some of the courses last for one year and others last for only
three weeks.  The financial resources come mainly from tuition
and local and foreign donors. Non-governmental organizations
from Denmark and Norway, for instance, donated some money to the
centers every year between 1991 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kanyama center manager Victor Chola said that their aim is to
enable the young people to rely on their own and to reduce poverty
by offering skill training to young people, especially those in
Kanyama area.
</P>
<P>
Most of the graduates have already gone into self-employment
and some others have been employed in corporations.
</P>
<P>
Those who have not accumulated enough money to start their own
business or have not found a job can start their own business in
the centers after paying for the facilities.
</P>
<P>
Elijah Simuyemba, for instance, has been tailoring in Kanyama
center since his graduation there in 1995 and he is also a
part-time instructor of the center.
</P>
<P>
He now earns 150,000 kwacha (about 65 U.S. dollars) a month, a
decent sum in terms local standard. "Things are getting better,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
For another example, Graybon Chilofya, a carpenter, can earn
between 200, 000 and 600,000 kwacha a month, depending on the
market for his products. He has been making furniture in Chibolya
center and marketing his products by himself since his graduation
from the center in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high unemployment rate, among the youths in
particular, training centers like Kanyama and Chibolya are
mushrooming in many communities across the southern African
country.

MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Monday has called for political dialogue that can promote
an agreement between the Yugoslav government and the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia would make every effort to help achieve the agreement,
said Primakov, who has tried in vain to broker peace between
Yugoslavia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO's military attacks on Yugoslavia will only destabilize the
situation of the Balkans and Europe as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The barbaric NATO bombardments are a tragic mistake," said the
prime minister, pointing out that the emphasis of NATO bombing has
been shifted to civilian infrastructure and key facilities of
residence.
</P>
<P>
Russia has said it will not take any military actions to halt
NATO's attacks though it is a traditional ally of Yugoslavia.
</P>

Russian President Boris Yeltsin has said repeatedly that Moscow
will not become involved militarily in the conflict.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Twenty firefighters in
Australia's largest city Sydney were battling an eight-meter-high
mass of foam Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Inspector Ian Krimmer of the New South Wales State Fire Brigade
said the foam, which measured 80 meters long, 20 meters wide and
eight meters high, was located in Sydney's western suburb, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Krimmer said an emergency telephone call alerted authorities
Monday night and 20 firefighters were working with the Environment
Protection Authority to disperse the foam, which is not toxic.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big mass of foam, very similar to soap suds," Krimmer
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the source was still not located, but dye tests were
being undertaken in nearby drains and an industrial complex three
kilometers away was also being investigated.
</P>
<P>
Recent rain had agitated the foam, which firefighters were
breaking up with hose sprays, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be here for quite a few hours cleaning it up,"
he added.

MOGADISHU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Tension between faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the independent businessmen belonging to
the same Habar Gidir clan in Mogadishu is growing over the
importation of a newly printed Somali shilling notes.
</P>
<P>
More than 39 battle wagons belonging to the businessmen group
with over 600 heavily aimed militiamen have been deployed between
Ballidogleh airport, about 90 kilometers south of Mogadishu, and
the town of Afgoie, only 30 kilometers south of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Confirmed and confidential sources indicated Monday that 35
billion Somali shillings (four million U.S. dollars) is due to
arrive in Ballidogleh airport in the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The money is the first portion of a large consignment of Somali
 shillings worth of 14 million dollars printed in Ottawa of Canada
by a Malaysian company known as Adorna Group of Companies
contracted by the Somali businessmen.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Somalis shilling notes are
printed in Canada by the Adorna group for Somalia where there has
been no central government for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
Only two years ago, an amount of Somali shilling notes worth
over 4.3 million dollars was introduced into the markets of
Mogadishu with an agreement by Aidid.
</P>
<P>
But, now it is the independent businessmen who are importing
the money without the consent of Aidid, a move which may change
into armed confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Doctors to Care Serbs in Pristina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot doctors will go to
Pristina, capital of the Serbian province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia,
to provide medical aid to the Serbian people there, the Cyprus
News Agency (CNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are members of the international non-governmental
organization "Doctors of the World."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to CNA, Doctor Eleni Theocharous said they will form a
surgical medical team and have already been in contact with the
hospitals where they will work.
</P>
<P>
She said the team is expected to leave for Pristina on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Theocharous said that members of "Doctors of the World" from
different countries are already in Yugoslavia's neighbors
Macedonia and Albania providing aid to ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo, while no doctors have been sent so far to care for
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"The Cypriot doctors are the first to go to Pristina to care
for the Serbs," she added.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes against
Yugoslavia have lasted almost two weeks, causing both military and
civilian casualties. The western alliance hoped the air strikes
could force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a
peace deal with separatist ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the population in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Kosovo refugee crisis worsened as more ethnic
Albanians streamed into neighboring countries. Hundreds of
thousands of refugees fled Kosovo since NATO strikes began on
March 24.

<HEADLINE> Saudi FM Meets Jordanian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
Al-Faisal Monday met separately with visiting Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh and head of Jordan's Royal Palace
Abdul Karim Al-Kabariti on bilateral ties and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed ways of expanding political and
economic ties, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian side expressed wish that Riyadh would increase
its investment in Amman and open Saudi markets to Jordanian labor
and products.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on the latest developments in the
region, especially the Mideast peace process and the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian officials are currently accompanying Jordanian
King Abdullah Bin Hussein on a three-day state visit to Saudi
Arabia, his first foreign tour since he took the Jordanian throne
in February after his father King Hussein's death.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah, who arrived in Riyadh Sunday, held talks Sunday
night with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed the current situation on the Arab,
Islamic and international arenas, as well as bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch also expressed gratitude to Saudi Arabia
for its support to him and his country since he took office.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan were
stained by Amman's siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War
triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh, once the largest donor country to Jordan, had suspended
its nearly 200 million U.S. dollars of annual economic aid to
Jordan and cut its oil supply to Amman after the war.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the two Arab kingdoms have been
making efforts to amend their ties, which witnessed a boost since
King Hussein's death on February 7.
</P>
<P>
A high-level Saudi delegation headed by Crown Prince Abdullah
attended King Hussein's funeral.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has since sent several ministers to Jordan
to follow up the financial situation in the country and has
promised Jordan necessary help.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials complained that Riyadh had been
slow in translating into action its pledged economic aid which
Amman counts on.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday voiced his hope that justice would be done in the
1988 mid-air bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, now
that Libya had surrendered for trial two suspects accused of
involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long wait. The secretary-general is pleased with
these results and hopes that justice will now be done," U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said shortly after Libya surrendered to the
United Nations the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
Libya handed over the two men, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-
Amin Khalifa Fahima, early on Monday to Hans Corell, the U.N.
undersecretary-general for legal affairs, in keeping with its
pledge last month to surrender them by April 6. They will be
tried in the Netherlands by a Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Corell, a Swedish lawyer, had conducted months of
indirect nail-biting negotiations between Libya and the United
States and Britain. South Africa and Saudi Arabia then were
instrumental in getting Libya to agree to the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie bombing took place in December 1988, killing a
total of 270 people.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, Libya accepted the London-Washington offer
to have the two Libyans tried in the Netherlands before a Scottish
court in accordance with the Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions against Libya will be suspended automatically as
soon as Annan sends a letter to the U.N. Security Council late on
Monday confirming officially that the two are in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed in 1992 and tightened in 1993, include
bans on air travel, weapons and certain types of oil-related
equipment.

<HEADLINE> Rising Fatal Accidents at S'pore Construction Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is concerned with
rising fatal accidents in the construction industry and relative
authorities pledged to step up enforcement to eliminate unsafe
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a press release Monday
there were nine fatal cases in construction worksites in March
1999, compared with three in January and two in February.
</P>
<P>
Noting the most common cause of these accidents is falling from
height, followed by being struck by falling objects, MOM said,
"These accidents could have been easily prevented had more efforts
been rendered to institute preventive measures."
</P>
<P>
MOM said the number of fatal accidents in the construction
industry had shown a rising trend since 1994.
</P>
<P>
There were 32 cases in 1994, a high of 72 cases in 1997, MOM
noted, adding the number contracted to 68 last year.
</P>
<P>
MOM said contractors could do more to bring about a greater
reduction in the number of such cases although fatal accidents
dropped to 14 cases in the first quarter of this year from 18 in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the Department of Industry
Safety under MOM conducted 5,000 inspections of construction
worksites last year and issued 711 composition fines for offenses
in contravention of the Factories Act or its subsidiary
legislation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to site inspections, MOM planned to step up the
enforcement program, including special enforcement exercises, to
get contractors to eliminate unsafe conditions at their sites.
</P>
<P>
In practice in Singapore, contractors were fined in a range
from 250 Singapore dollars (145 U.S. dollars) to 1,000 Singapore
dollars (560 U.S. dollars) for offenses that could result in
injury to workers and worksites found to be grossly unsafe were
issued "stop work orders" which require the contractor to stop any
work that gave rise to the hazardous condition until suitable
steps were taken to eliminate the hazards.
</P>
<P>
MOM also stepped up its training programs for the construction
industry to train project managers on the fundamentals of safety
and the establishment of a safety management system on site and
also to conduct training for supervisors and workers.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Calls for Independent Investigation Into Ship Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for a shipping
company of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said
here Monday that the investigation of the collision of two
civilian cargo vessels between the DPRK and South Korea should be
carried out without external interference.
</P>
<P>
"Since the accident happened between civilian vessels of the
north and the south, we consider it most reasonable that the
problem should be resolved smoothly by the parties concerned from
a compatriot and humanitarian stand without the interference of
authorities, a third country or a third party," the spokesman for
the DPRK's Myohyang Transit Marine Transport Company said.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, the DPRK's trade cargo vessel "Manphok" collided
with "Hyundai Duke" of South Korea in the open sea 420 miles away
from Colombo port in Sri Lanka and resulted in the sinking of "
Manphok."
</P>
<P>
Two seamen of "Manphok" were rescued by "Hyundai Duke," but the
other 37 crew members are still missing and feared dead. "Hyundai
Duke" was only slightly damaged and pulled into Colombo for
repairs, but no human and material losses were reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denounced the South Korean authorities for
abusing the collision to "wage hostile propaganda."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, "Manphok" left Singapore Port on
March 26 at a speed of 11 knots, while "Hyundai Duke" left the
same port on March 29 and took the same course at a speed of 26.2
knots.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that 'Hyundai Duke' chased after our vessel," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul said that the accident occurred because "Manphok
" ignored the "alarm whistles given by the "Hyundai Duke."
</P>
<P>
South Korea's explanation "cannot be construed otherwise than a
premeditated and deliberate plot of the South Korean authorities
to conceal the truth, mislead public opinion and abuse the tragic
maritime accident for North-South confrontation," the spokesman
added.

JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Muslim groups on Monday called
for a commercial strike in the holy city of Nazareth to protest
against the planned building of a plaza for Christians in the city.
</P>
<P>
The plaza project was approved by the Nazareth municipality
for millennium pilgrims. But Muslims claimed the land on which
the plaza will be built, had been the site of a former mosque.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out Sunday in the city, where Jesus spent his
boyhood, over the disputes between Muslims and Christians in which
dozens of people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Motti Zaken, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser on
Arab affairs, has met with Christian and Muslim notables in
Nazareth. The concerned parties agreed to meet on Thursday to
discuss Muslim claims.
</P>
<P>
The Nazareth municipality has insisted that the land in
question was registered in the name of the British high
commissioner in 1943 and was passed to the municipality's
ownership after Israel's foundation.
</P>
<P>
The land in dispute is near the Church of the Annunciation,
where Christian traditions hold that Angel Gabriel appeared before
Mary to tell her she was pregnant with Jesus.

JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 17 houses owned by migrants
were set on fire Monday as fresh rioting broke out in Sungai Bulan
village, Sambas district in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province,
according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
There was no report on casualties.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted a witness as saying that the riot began late
Sunday when villagers of Sungai Bulan were angered by a bus driver
who ignored their request to drive slowly so as not to disrupt a
wedding reception along the road connecting Pemangkat and Kota
villages.
</P>
<P>
The villagers reportedly waited for the driver to pass the same
route and destroyed his bus, sparking a clash that spread
throughout the village.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic clashes in Sambas, which began early last month
between Madurese settlers and members of the local Malay
community, have already claimed at least 175 lives, displaced
12,000 residents and inflicted damage on hundreds of buildings.
</P>
<P>
The area has recently been put under control and residents have
begun returning.
</P>
<P>
West Kalimantan's four million population is 41 percent Dayak,
39 percent Malay, 14 percent ethnic Chinese and two percent
Madurese, with several other ethnic groups making up the
remainder.

trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Li also thanked the Turkish government for upholding the
one-China policy and for understanding the Chinese government's
policies towards ethnic groups in the country.
</P>

<P>
To further develop the friendly cooperation between the two
countries is not only in the best interest of the two peoples, but
is also conducive to keeping peace and stability in the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and the Chinese government always attach great
importance to developing ties with Turkey, and are willing to
make joint efforts with their Turkish counterparts to further
promote the cooperation in all fields, particularly in the areas
of politics, economy, and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two countries should also strengthen their
cooperation and consultation in the world affairs, thus building a
long-lasting friendly cooperation between the two countries on the
basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Cetin said that Turkey attaches importance to
China's role in regional and world affairs, and to the overall
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cetin stressed that Turkey upholds the principles of mutual
respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs in
international relations. Turkey opposes activities in whatever
form by national separatists.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair
of China. The Turkish government maintains one-China policy, and
recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the
only legitimate government representing the whole China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Turkey would not develop any official relations
with Taiwan, and its relations with Taiwan would be limited only
to non-governmental exchanges in the fields of trade and economy
and culture, he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes Measures to Maintain Stable Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
devised a range of measures to maintain stable prices for goods
and keep inflation between 6 and 7 percent during the remaining
months of this year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
To that end, VNA said, the government's Pricing Committee has
continued to implement renovation and perfect price policy and
management mechanisms. It has given incentives to agricultural
production in rural, mountainous and island areas to prevent
possible local hunger.
</P>
<P>
Other major initiatives include coordinating with Vietnam's
Finance Ministry to issue guidelines on principles and production
cost accounting, minimizing impacts of world market prices upon
the domestic price system, protecting production and consumption
and preventing unpredicted price increases for a number of
essential goods.
</P>
<P>
Apart from measures to stabilize prices, Vietnam's Pricing
Committee has coordinated with agencies concerned to strengthen
inspection of price violations, evaluate prices for land, natural
resources and state-financed materials and equipment and propose
measures to control exchange and interest rates to the government.
It will also supervise the implementation of policy on market
price management and stability.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's General Department of Statistics,
Vietnam's price index in the first quarter of this year increased
by 2.9 percent from last December. The price index rose by 1.7 and
1.9 percent in January and February respectively, but dropped 0.7
percent in March. The prices for food rose 3.2 percent and those
for consumer goods and services rose by 1 to 2 percent.

<P>
ATHENS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott held separate talks Monday morning with Greek
foreign and defense ministry officials on the developments in
Kosovo and the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who arrived here Sunday evening on a Balkan tour, met
successively with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and
Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos, but no statements were made
after their talks, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Talbott's current trip is reportedly to pledge U.
S. support necessary to address the impact of the unfolding
humanitarian, security and economic crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which opposes the airstrikes by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia, is now concerned
about both the prospect of a large influx of refugees from Kosovo
and the possibility that a huge resettlement of refugees in
southern Albania might prove demographically disastrous to the
ethnic Greek minority there.

<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Monday called on young Filipinos to work constructively and
actively in efforts to confront the country's problem of
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the launching of the Green Brigade Movement,
Estrada said the youth will be mobilized in protecting the
environment and reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic progress should not compromise the
protection of the environment, noting that to neglect the
environment would compromise the future of the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
"The environment must not be made to suffer or become the
victim of our efforts to strengthen the economy or to provide
jobs to our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country is losing 273 hectares of forest every
day and has lost more than 80 percent of its mangroves.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, only seven percent of its corals are healthy while
air pollution in Manila continues to deteriorate, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The youth will be our allies in the protection of our
environment. They will also watch over our officials who connive
with polluters and illegal loggers," Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> France Insists Kosovo Refugees Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- France insisted on Monday that
Kosovo refugees return to their homeland instead of going to
another country as permanent refugees.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said on Monday that the
refugees have the "vocation" to return to Kosovo, and that NATO
should prepare for their return as part of the military action.
</P>
<P>
"The displaced people of Kosovo, victims of ethnic cleansing by
violence and terror, have the vocation to return to Kosovo. The
preparation for their return should be a constant dimension of our
action," he said when inspecting the sending by planes of
humanitarian cargoes to the Balkans from an airbase near Marseille.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is not the right time to ask every member
country of NATO to provide asylum for the refugees, because it
would give them the idea that they would become permanent refugees
living in exile.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Germany, Turkey, Norway, Greece and Canada
have agreed to receive up to 120,000 Kosovo refugees, but France
has so far refused to open its door to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Richard suggested that NATO help Macedonia and Albania,
countries with weak infrastructures, to deal with the difficult
task of receiving these refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO will station a large number of ground troops
in Albania to help deal with the humanitarian disaster. Some 12,
000 NATO troops, including 2,000 French troops, are already
stationed in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister also warned about "interior risks"
which could come from the refugees themselves as well as the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
The KLA is reportedly recruiting youths among the refugees to
fight the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
Nine Transall transport planes of the French army Monday flew
to Skopje, Macedonia and Tirana, Albania, from their base in
Istres near Marseille, bringing 100 tons of food, survival
materials, clothes and tents to the refugees.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Four leading non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia Monday formed a coalition, urging
the government to take immediate steps to boost domestic food
production.
</P>
<P>
The coalition known as the Malaysian People's Protection
Coalition comprises of Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC),
Cuepacs, Malaysian Youth Council (MYC) and Federation of Malaysian
Consumer Associations (FOMCA), representing 3.5 million members.
</P>
<P>
The coalition called on the Agriculture Ministry to draw up a
national food policy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would experience a food crisis if efforts were not
taken to enhance domestic food output, coalition Chairman Zainal
Rampak who is MTUC president said at a press conference in
Petajing Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Cuepacs President N. Sivasubramaniam said too much emphasis had
been given to the industrial sector to the extent of overlooking
the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
MYC Urban Development Committee Chairman Norizan Sharif said
there was an urgent need for a national food policy to ensure
sufficient supply of food in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country could not go on relying on imports to meet the
growing demand for food, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia spends nearly 10 billion ringgit (2.631 billion U.S.
dollars) on food imports as domestic output accounts for only 65
percent of total consumption.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Lessen Dependency on Imported Edible Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government will pump
big amounts of money into the vegetable oil sector to lessen its
long-time dependency on imported edible oil.
</P>
<P>
According to a Monday report by the East African, the
Nairobi-based weekly newspaper, the Vegetable Oil Development
Project, which will be earmarked 60 million U.S. dollars from the
state coffers, will target both large- and small-scale producers
and processors of oil crops.
</P>
<P>
The east African country imported 75 percent of its vegetable
oil and fat requirements, Zakayo Muyaka, deputy coordinator of the
vegetable oil development project, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Ugandan government's spending on imported
cooking oil has topped 62.5 million dollars and if without
intervention, it can shoot up to 120 million dollars by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The edible oil project with three phases dealing with oil plant
 production and procession is also to increase the general
availability of such crops as maize, soya beans and ground nuts,
Muyaka said.
</P>
<P>
The project, if successfully implemented, is expected to boost
the intake of edible oils in Uganda, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The country's edible oil consumption rate is 2.3 kilogram per
person per annum, well below the minimum recommendation of 3.3 kg
by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
This low intake of edible oil is partly responsible for
widely-spread malnutrition and stunted growth among children under
five years old in Uganda, according to the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 percent of the Ugandan children suffer from chronic
malnutrition.

<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The gross national product (GNP) of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in current prices amounted to about 4.1 billion
U.S. dollars, whereas the transfers made by Palestinians working
in Israel reached 330 million dollars by the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Alam Al Yom daily quoted a recent report by the Arab
Economic Union Council as saying that the West Bank contributes
about two thirds of the GNP and Gaza Strip the remaining one
third. Total consumption in the region is 20 percent higher than
the real domestic production.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
have agreed to grant 114 million dollars to Yemen in soft loans
for the implementation of development projects within the
framework of Yemen's structural reform program, a Yemeni official
said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Arab daily Al Hayat quoted the Yemeni Undersecretary
of Finance for Foreign Affairs Ahmed Ghaleb as saying that an IMF
team would arrive in Sanaa on April 18 to examine the subsequent
steps and the implementation of the reform program during the
first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister of
Agriculture Youssef Wali has disclosed that a number of Arab
states are currently tuned to investment in the southern valley of
Toshki now that feasibility studies foresee high returns.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Al Hayat reported that there were 812 projects under
way at a total investment cost of 10.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Fertilizer producers in Egypt are demanding
restrictions on the entry of Libyan fertilizers to Egyptian
markets.
</P>
<P>
In an interview printed in Monday's Al Hayat, Osama Al Ganayni,
chairman of the Egyptian fertilizers company Abu Qir, said a
number of Egyptian importers of the Yoria fertilizers from Libya
have increased shipments to Egypt to benefit from customs
exemption and the marketing difficulties facing Libya due to the
economic embargo.

LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has accepted to co-host the
African Nations' Cup with Ghana in the year 2000, local media
Monday quoted Chief of General Staff Vice Admiral Mike Akhigbe as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said here on Sunday that Nigeria, which is now hosting the

competition with Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of African Football (CAF) last month gave the
hosting right of the championship to Nigeria and Ghana, and asked
for response to the offer before April 10.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe praised the CAF for giving Nigeria the privilege of co-
hosting the tournament which was taken away from Zimbabwe because
of lack of facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria's hosting the WYC was not only to develop
the potentials of the nation's youths, but also to create an
avenue for international relations.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Establishes Software on Trade Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established a
computer software called "the ECOWAS trade opportunities and
management system" for the west African region.
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted an ECOWAS document
entitled "promotion of intra-community trade, the role of ECOWAS"
as saying that the software will equally serve as an avenue for
the exchange of information on the availability of goods and
services among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The software installed with its focal point at the community
computer center in Lome, capital of Togo, is at its pilot stage,
but will connect national chambers of commerce and various private
sector associations when fully developed.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the complete ECOWAS trade information
service will include the provision of reports of periodic market
surveys, publications of trade directory and a handbook on legal,
financial and regulatory procedures in member countries to guide
the activities of exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the west African clearing house
which was established in 1975 to facilitate intra-regional
payments has been transformed into a specialized agency known as
the West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) to promote regional
monetary cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The monetary agency is charged with the responsibility of
searching for regional currency convertibility and a single
monetary zone, the document said, adding that the governors of
central banks in the region spearheaded the introduction of the
ECOWAS travellers' check as part of the monetary cooperation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS is aimed at creating a single regional market of
more than 210 million people and which would be characterized by
free movement of goods and service, market access without
administrative and tariff restrictions and the use of a single
currency.

French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Sunday that it
remains a "fundamental objective" for France that the Kosovo
Albanians return home, because France does not accept "the fait
accompli of deportations."
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said on Monday that the
Kosovo Albanians have the "vocation" to return to their homeland
instead of going to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Germany, Norway, Turkey, Greece and Canada
have agreed to receive 120,000 Kosovo Albanians as refugees, or
nearly one third of the refugees who have fled home over the past
two weeks.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Establishes Software on Trade Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established a
computer software called "the ECOWAS trade opportunities and
management system" for the west African region.
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted an ECOWAS document
entitled "promotion of intra-community trade, the role of ECOWAS"
as saying that the software will equally serve as an avenue for
the exchange of information on the availability of goods and
services among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The software installed with its focal point at the community
computer center in Lome, capital of Togo, is at its pilot stage,
but will connect national chambers of commerce and various private
sector associations when fully developed.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the complete ECOWAS trade information
service will include the provision of reports of periodic market
surveys, publications of trade directory and a handbook on legal,
financial and regulatory procedures in member countries to guide
the activities of exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the west African clearing house
which was established in 1975 to facilitate intra-regional
payments has been transformed into a specialized agency known as
the West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) to promote regional
monetary cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The monetary agency is charged with the responsibility of
searching for regional currency convertibility and a single
monetary zone, the document said, adding that the governors of
central banks in the region spearheaded the introduction of the
ECOWAS travellers' check as part of the monetary cooperation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS is aimed at creating a single regional market of
more than 210 million people and which would be characterized by
free movement of goods and service, market access without
administrative and tariff restrictions and the use of a single
currency.

<HEADLINE> Lao National Assembly Third Session Ends After Passing Four New Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lao National Assembly closed
its third ordinary session last Saturday after passing four new
laws, calling for the Lao people to make efforts to implement the
socio-economic development plan, Lao official news agency KPL
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly session expressed satisfaction with the
active efforts and measures of the government in dealing with the
current economic difficulties and achieving the targets of the
socio-economic development plan for 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
An emerging achievement was the output of the rainy season rice
crop, amounting to 1.675 million tons of paddy rice. The total of
rice-growing area in the dry season was increased to 87,000
hectares. The movement of building model families in production
and the commodity production experienced satisfactory growth. The
industrial, communications and transport sectors continued to
grow.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Assembly noted that there were still
economic difficulties: the rise of goods prices and the inflation
rate were not under control. These phenomena impacted on the
implementation of the 1998-1999 plan for socio-economic
development as well as on the living conditions of ethnic people.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly called for the entire population to
promote the traditions of patriotism, consolidate the national
unity, promote thriftiness, and make concerted efforts for the
implementation of the socio-economic development plan for
1998-1999 and the five-year state plan (1995-2000). The people
were also urged to ensure national stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The session voted unanimously in favor of four new laws on the
processing industry, environmental protection, town planning, and
highways.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Major General Bounthone Chithvilaphonh was
elected chairman of the National Defense and Security Commission
of the National Assembly in the place of the late Brigadier
General Saysompheng Soulignaseng.
</P>
<P>
The third ordinary session of the Lao Fourth National Assembly
opened on March 22.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading British Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Emergency plans to fly thousands of ethnic Kosovo Albanians
as far afield as America and Canada were criticized Sunday night
by European officials and charities who believe the refugees
should be sheltered closer to home.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The worsening Kosovo refugee crisis forced Downing Street
into a significant retreat on Sunday when it announced that
Britain would give sanctuary to "some thousands" of ethnic
Albanians. Tony Blair had said only a few hours earlier that
dispersing Kosovars across Europe was a "policy of despair" that
would play into Slobodan Milosevic's hands.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain bowed to U.S. pressure Sunday to open its doors to
Kosovan refugees as part of an airlift to ease the crush at the
Macedonian border where the immense scale of the humanitarian
disaster is still unfolding and the death toll is beginning to
mount.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO moved decisively Sunday night to reclaim the initiative
in the war for Kosovo, promising to unleash unrelenting bombing
waves upon Yugoslavia and dispatching 24 Apache helicopter
gunships and 2,000 support troops to the area. Their arrival would
mark a new, riskier stage in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Western diplomats are discussing plans to send a NATO "
escort force" of at least 60,000 troops into Kosovo to protect
returning refugees, once air strikes have driven Yugoslav forces
out of the region.

between 20 and 40. Male victims outnumbered females at seven
against one.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Under Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central bank is
carrying out sweeping reforms to make itself more effective in
coping with the financial crisis, according to a report received
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank is engaging in an entire reform of its structure,
including the introduction of an across-the-board dynamic human
resource management and development, said the report issued by the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The reforms involved the bank's five main functions, including
monetary policy, financial institution policy inclusive of
supervision and examination, payment system, financial institution
development fund and the corporate debt restructuring advisory
committee.
</P>
<P>
A new Financial Institution Policy Department was set up to be
in charge solely of financial standards so that it would have a
clear responsibility and would not have to deal with day-to-day
operation which would be handled by the supervision and
examination segment.
</P>
<P>
An International Department was also set up so that researchers
could concentrate on academic works and leave technical works,
including drafting letters of intent with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to the Economic Research Department.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also launched a broad-based human resource
development and training project with an earmarked budget of 100
million baht (2.7 million U.S. dollars) so that all the bank's
5,000 staff will become more professional.
</P>
<P>
"Our staff are scholarly. We have 700 with master's degrees, 40
with PhDs and 70 percent of the staff have at least a bachelor's
degree. But hey still appeared an isolated lot, talking less to
related organs. As a result complete information was not available
in making decisions," the report quoted bank Governor Chatumongol
Sonakul as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the human resource development initiative, the staff are
required to audit their peers and even the performance of their
bosses. Department heads must also be rotated into various
departments to acquire comprehensive skills and information,
Chatumongol said.

<HEADLINE> Poll in Israel Shows Growing Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll conducted in
Israel showed 56 percent of the Israelis believe the Palestinian
demand for an independent state is "justified," while 43 percent
answered in negative.
</P>
<P>
The March 1999 Peace Index, published on Monday, was conducted
on March 30 among 497 Israeli adults by the Tami Steinmetz Center
for Peace Research at Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
The monthly Peace Index, designed to determine Israeli
attitudes toward the peace process, showed only 45 percent of
those surveyed gave positive answers to the same question six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
About 69 percent of the respondents believe that the peace
process will lead to an independent Palestinian state, while 25
percent think it will not.
</P>
<P>
On whether Israel can afford to agree to the establishment of
an independent Palestinian state in the framework of a peace
accord, some 56 percent of the surveyed answered affirmatively
while 39 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
Some 68 percent of the respondents think Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will not declare an independent Palestinian state on
May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, some 47 percent of the surveyed believe that Israel
should continue to negotiate with the Palestinians even Arafat
unilaterally declares the statehood, while 45 percent said the
talks should be called off if so.
</P>
<P>
In the December 1998 survey, only 26 percent said that
negotiations should continue in case of a unilateral declaration
of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the respondents believe that if Arafat
declares a state on May 4, it will affect the results of Israel's
May 17 elections. Of those, 44 percent said that the declaration
will strengthen the right wing parties, compared with 12 percent
who believe it will strengthen the left.
</P>
<P>
Some 37 percent of the surveyed believe a government led by
current hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is most likely
to succeed in promoting the peace process while protecting
Israel's interests, while 31 percent gave their hopes to Labor
leader Ehud Barak and 12 percent to centrist Yitzhak Mordechai.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
expressed its concern over the organization of Indonesia's June 7
general election and has promised to provide technical assistance
to the country.
</P>
<P>
The EC hopes the election would be fair and just, EC Vice
President Leon Brittan told reporters after meeting with
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said EC assistance for the election is not political in
nature, noting that it is only technical aid to support a fair and
just election.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has not provided financial support. However, it
will convince international organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and the European
Trust Fund to help Indonesia," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the EC will send financial experts who could advise
the country on economic recovery, he said, adding that it will
also provide technical assistance in the making of public policies
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit, said his
visit to Indonesia and other Asian countries aims to impart to
crisis-hit countries that efforts on economic recovery should be
given priority.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Brittan will also meet with other senior
officials, including Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Trade and
Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan, Foreign Ministry officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Suspects Handed Over For Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Lamen khalifa Fhimah and Abdel
Basset, the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, were
handed over on Monday for trial in the Netherlands before a
Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
U.N. representative Hans Corell and families of some of the
bombing victims were present at the handover ceremony, a report
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
'' In a historical moment awaited by the world, the two Libyan
suspects in the Lockerbie case were handed over to be flown to the
Netherlands for trial before a Scottish court. " the report said.
</P>
<P>
Arab and African dignitaries who witnessed the handover
included Jakes Gerwel, an aide to South African President Nelson
Mandela and a key broker in arranging the suspects' transfer.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Arab League Secretary-General Esmet
Abdel-Meguid as calling for the total lifting of the sanctions and
not just a suspension once the handover takes place.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had promised to hand over the two
suspects in the Lockerbie case by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Pan Am flight 103 exploded midair over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people in the air and on the ground, mostly
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long accused the two suspects of
blowing up the jetliner and demanded the two men stand trial in
either of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council clamped sanctions on Libya
in 1992 and had them tightened the next year to try to compel the
Libyan government to extradite the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
But Tripoli refused to surrender the pair, arguing that they
could not get fair trial in the West and demanding a third country
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain dropped their insistence last August and
proposed the trial be held in the Netherlands before Scottish
judges and under the Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya in principle agreed to the proposal, but the handover was
snagged later after Tripoli sought further clarification from the
U.N. over where the two, if convicted, would serve their jail terms
and when the seven-year sanctions would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, South African President Nelson Mandela, who
arrived in Tripoli a day earlier, announced that he had clinched a
deal with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and all the remaining
obstacles to the handover were removed.
</P>
<P>
Libya agreed to hand over the two suspects by April 6 and
agreed that the two Libyans serve their prison sentences in
Scotland if convicted, as was demanded by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In return, the sanctions will be suspended upon the arrival of
the pair in the Netherlands and be lifted within 90 days after
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submits a report to the Security
Council, stating that Libya has complied with all relevant
resolutions.

<P>
PYONGYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and the United States last week held talks here
focusing on technical aspects of U.S. experts' visit to an
underground facility in Kumchangri, the Korean Central News Agency
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirmed that the access by the U.S. side to
the facility will be an on-site visit which will take place at the
invitation of the DPRK, not an inspection, and decided to handle
working matters in compliance with this, the agency reported.
</P>

The experts discussed technical matters including details and
method of the on-site visit to the facility in Kumchangri and
apparatuses which visitors are allowed to carry along. U.S.
experts will make the visit in May after paying fees, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held from March 31 to April 3 in accordance with
a bilateral decision reached last month in New York allowing

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Egyptian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
expressed his confidence here today that with the formation of
Sino-Egyptian strategic cooperative ties, the cooperation between
the two countries in various fields would achieve a new phase of
development.
</P>
<P>
"China and Egypt can learn from each other, especially in
economic reform," Zhu said during his meeting with Egyptian
President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu cited Mubarak as an old friend of Chinese leaders over
three generations, saying that he has made "precious"
contributions to pushing forward friendship between China and
Egypt, as well as between China and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"The current China visit of Mubarak will help to deepen the
understanding of the two countries and further the bilateral
friendly cooperation," Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Although China and Egypt are geographically far away from each
other, China pays attention to the social and economic development
of this middle-east country," Zhu said, adding that China is glad
to see that under the leadership of Mubarak, Egypt has overcome
the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis by maintaining
social stability and sustainable economic development, as well as
enhancing people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
"This is a marvelous achievement, " Zhu said.

He expressed his hope that China would make more contributions
to the construction of an economic development zone in the Suez
region, a cooperative project between the two countries.

and encouraged Chinese enterprises to make investments in Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Thai ties have become the
model of good-neighborly and mutually beneficial cooperation
between countries with different social systems, Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu, when meeting with Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn this
afternoon, said the relations between the two nations have
maintained a healthy and stable momentum.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to the princess who is on her ninth
China visit, Hu spoke highly of her positive contributions to Sino-

</P>
<P>
"Today's good-neighborly ties between the two nations are
closely linked to the importance attached and positive promotion
by the Chinese and Thai leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the royal family
of Thailand have always cared about and supported the Sino-Thai
friendship cause and made positive contributions to the further
enhancement of bilateral traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
"The princess has written books about China and played an
important role in increasing understanding and friendship between
the two peoples," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the princess's ongoing visit will
help further her understanding of China's society and culture, and

Hu asked the princess to pass on President Jiang Zemin's best
wishes to King Bhumibol.
</P>

Sirindhorn said she is here to gain more understanding of
China's history, culture and examine the economic and cultural
circumstances in the Yangtze River Delta, which is one of the most
developed zones in China.
</P>
<P>
"There exist lasting friendly relations of cooperation between
the two countries," she said, adding that King Bhumibol is very
concerned about bilateral friendly cooperation and China's
development.
</P>
<P>
She said there are also broad prospects for cooperation in
agriculture and water conservancy between Thailand and China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices surged on the
Singapore Stock Market Monday as market sentiment was buoyed by
the expectation of the country's economic recovery and signs of
improving sentiment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index soared by 26.88 points to
1,581.6, this year's new high.
</P>
<P>
The total volume ran up to 544.48 million units valued at
639.47 million Singapore dollars (about 370.99 million U.S.
dollars). Gainers outstripped losers by 277 to 45 with 131
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Ho Pro was at the top of the actives chart of the day with a
turnover of 30.58 million shares. It was followed by GES which had
24.41 million shares done. Wing T was next with 20.9 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
DBS F headed the ascent of the day running up 80 cents to close
at 13.8 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sem gained 75 cents to finish at
12.1 Singapore dollars. GE Life picked up 70 cents to end at 12.1
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, YHS topped the losers of the day, suffering a
loss of 118 cents to close at 3.6 Singapore dollars. SPH 100 was
the second biggest loser shedding 20 cents to 19.8 Singapore
dollars. Creative 50, SPH and UOB sank 10 cents each to finish at
20.1, 19.7 and 8.9 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that shares kept the momentum of last week's
gains, with property counters leading the upsurge.
</P>
<P>
They said the rally was encouraged by lower mortgage and fueled
by news that 85 percent of new private homes launched in the first
quarter were sold.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said there were indications that some foreign
funds were moving out of Wall Street to look for bargains in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some analysts noted that penny stocks are now
lagging far behind and feeling the chill wind of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
They said that so long as the market's general direction
remains upward and the small-cap counters remain out of favor,
selective laggards could begin attracting attention again.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a larger

imports over exports.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in February this year amounted to 4.9 billion
ringgit (about 1.289 billion U.S. dollars), against a surplus of
4.3 billion ringgit (about 1.131 billion dollars) in January 1999
and a surplus of 2.6 billion ringgit (about 684.21 million
dollars) in February 1998, according to trade statistics released
here Monday by the Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
This was the 16th consecutive month that Malaysia had recorded
a surplus since November 1997, the department said.
</P>
<P>
During the month under review, imports declined 14.2 percent to
 16.99 billion ringgit (about 4.471 billion dollars) while exports
 dropped 2.1 percent to 21.93 billion ringgit (about 5.771 billion
 dollars), the monthly external trade statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's external trade balance during the first two months

<HEADLINE> 1st OAU Conference on Human Rights to Be Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced here Monday that the first OAU ministerial
conference on human rights would be held in Mauritius from April
15 to 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
It called upon all its member states "to ensure that they are
represented at an appropriate level."
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release issued here said that the conference at
the dawn of the third millenium is intended to review the human
rights situation in Africa, examine the root causes of human
rights violations and elaborate a collective vision for the
future.
</P>
<P>
The conference will adopt a declaration and plan of action, the
OAU said, adding that "the plan of action will lay down the
strategies that member states and the OAU consider necessary for
enhancing the promotion and protection of human and peoples'
rights in Africa."
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the conference will be preceded
by an experts' meeting from April 12 to 14 at the same venue.
</P>
<P>
The human rights conference will be held pursuant to a
resolution adopted by the 64th Ordinary Session of the Council of
Ministers held in Yaounde, Cameroun in July 1996 which decided
that there was need for such a conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held less than a year after the adoption
of the protocol on the establishment of the African court on human
and peoples' rights, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
It recalled that the 34th OAU summit held in Burkinabe capital
Ouagadougou last June adopted the protocol, which was signed
immediately thereafter by 30 African states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OAU also announced here Monday that prior to the
 ministerial conference, a forum for African non-governmental
organizations will be convened in Kenyan capital Nairobi from
April 7 to 9.
</P>
<P>
The forum is intended as a mechanism for the organizations to
input their recommendations into the conference through 15
representatives who will be at the forum and who will attend the
ministerial conference as observers, it added.

<HEADLINE> Fossilized Pollen Offers Clues on Climate Changes in Yangtze (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Fossilized pollen preserved at the
bottom of lakes and marshes is providing Chinese scientists with
clues on vegetation and climate changes in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River over the past 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
"The pollen records provide scientific bases for the prediction
of climate changes in the coming decades and century," said Tang
Lingyu, a researcher with the Nanjing Institute of Geology and
Paleontology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"The records show that the climate in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River during the past 10,000 years has gone
through a process from cold and dry to moist and hot, and then to
dry and mild again," Tang explained.
</P>
<P>
"And the climate warming we are experiencing today is quite
similar to the warming change 8,000 years ago," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The geologist explained that large amounts of pollen produced
by various plants were mixed in the air by the currents, and then
sank to the bottom of lakes, marshes and in the sea.
</P>
<P>
"The pollen of various plants differs in the form and structure
and, therefore, the fossilized pollen component in the stratums
sheds light on the vegetation situation in ancient times," said
Tang.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of a plant is determined by the temperature,
rainfall and other climatic factors. By studying the information
of more than a hundred plant species we can calculate the climate
conditions of a certain time," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pollen records in the Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of
Yangtze, and in Zhenjiang, Wuhu and Anqing regions in the lower
reaches of the river show that the average temperature in the
regions increased sharply by six to seven degrees centigrade from
10,000 years to 8,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
And the temperature remained high during the following two
millenniums, higher than today on average, according to the
records. From 6,000 to 4,000 years ago the average temperature
fluctuated by as much as four degrees.
</P>
<P>
In the last 4,000 years the temperature has dropped by four
degrees. "But the region has entered a new period of warming, and
the climate will change to warm and moist," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
According to the research by Yu Ge, with the CAS Nanjing
Institute of Geography and Limnology, the forests in the middle
and lower reaches of the river grew luxuriantly 8,000 to 6,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"However, nearly one third of the vegetation has been damaged
by human activities in the last 5,000 years," said Yu.
</P>
<P>
Many experts share the opinion that the devastating floods in
the Yangtze River last summer were the combined result of abnormal
climate, the El Nino phenomenon, deforestation and ecological
deterioration.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Suspects Handed Over For Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Lamen khalifa Fhimah and Abdel
Basset, the two Lybian suspects of in the 1988 Pan Am bombing were
handed over on Monday for trial in the Netherlands before a
Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
U.N. representative Hans Corell and families of some of the
bombing victims were present at the handover ceremony, a report
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
'' In a historical moment awaited by the world, the two Libyan
suspects in the Lockerbie case were handed over to be flown to the
Netherlands for trial before a Scottish court. " the report said.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had promised to hand over the two
suspects in the Lockerbie case by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Pan Am flight 103 exploded midair over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people in the air and on the ground, mostly
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long accused the two suspects of
blowing up the jetliner and demanded the two men stand trial in
either of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council clamped sanctions on Libya
in 1992 and had them tightened the next year to try to compel the
Libyan government to extradite the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
But Tripoli refused to surrender the pair, arguing that they
can not get fair trial in the West while demanding a third country
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain dropped their insistence last August and
proposed the trial be held in the Netherlands before Scottish
judges and under the Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya in principle agreed to the proposal, but the handover was
snagged later after Tripoli sought further clarification from the
U.N. over where the two, if convicted, will serve their jail terms
and when the seven-year sanctions will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, South African President Nelson Mandela, who
arrived in Tripoli a day earlier, announced that he had clinched a
deal with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and all the remaining
obstacles to the handover were removed.
</P>
<P>
Libya agreed to hand over the two suspects by April 6 and
agreed that the two Libyans serve their prison sentences in
Scotland if convicted, as was demanded by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In return, the sanctions will be suspended upon the arrival of
the pair in the Netherlands and be lifted within 90 days after
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submits a report to the Security
Council, stating that Libya has complied with all relevant
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Meretz Platform Recognizes Orient House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Meretz Party has called
for the recognition of the legal status of the Orient House
in Jerusalem and support for the establishement of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The Meretz made the calls in its platform prepared for
the upcoming elections in May this year. The platform was
distributed to the media on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Meretz calls for the legal status of the Orient House in
Jerusalem to be recognized. Having a place representing the
Palestinians within Jerusalem does not harm Jerusalem's status
and serves the interests of close to 200,000 Palestinian Arabs
who live in Jerusalem," the platform said.
</P>
<P>
The platform said Meretz does not propose delaying the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Monday that the suspension of offensive military operations
against the New People's Army (NPA) will not be extended if the
rebels fail to release five abducted officers before April 19.
</P>
<P>
"I am getting impatient... If they don't stop, I cannot do
anything but to enforce the law," Estrada said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
The NPA announced last month that it would release the five
military and police officers it abducted in the past two months
between March 22 and April 19.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Estrada also called on the rebels to
cooperate with the government and even offered one of their
leaders an advisory post in his administration.
</P>
<P>
"If they are sincere and they would really want to help our
poor countrymen, they should join our government," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate radio interview, Orlando Mercado, secretary of
defense, said he remains hopeful that the rebels would keep their
word and release the hostages before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre once
more urged the rebels to identify the areas where they may release
the officers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The east African governments are
working together to build a strong common market among Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda, a senior Kenyan official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
A committee will meet in July to ensure that the common market
takes off as soon as possible, said Nicholas Biwott, Minister for
East African and Regional Cooperation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said 15 ministers from the three countries met last week in
 Arusha, a northern town in Tanzania, to harmonize common services
in the fields including communications network, education,
banking, customs and courts.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said that the regional integration is aimed at boosting
the economies of the three countries and creating more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged Kenyan farmers to seek markets outside the
country instead of relying on the local ones alone.
</P>
<P>
"Many farmers, who were disillusioned by lack of markets for
their produce locally, should exploit the expansive east African
market where prices are good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Kenyan businessmen to offer their opinions on the
revising of the draft East African Community Treaty, which is set
to be signed by July.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyan businessmen should come up with their suggestions
between now and July because their colleagues in Uganda and
Tanzania have already done so," said Biwott.
</P>
<P>
He further urged kenya's business community to take advantage
of opportunities resulting from regional integration to expand
their business empires.

<P>
PARIS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While the United States and a number of European countries
will receive 120,000 Kosovo Albanians, France said on Sunday that
it wishes the refugees could go back to their homes. Planes of
allied countries are creating a "human bridge" linking the Balkans
with the United States and some European countries, sending the
refugees to their asylums. Faced with a humanitarian emergency,
NATO announced that it would send 6,000 to 8,000 ground troops to
Albania to carry out humanitarian aid programs for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
-- Albania, which has a three million population, is submerged
by 204,000 refugees from Kosovo, while Macedonia has received an
influx of 115,000 Kosovo Albanians, and Montenegro 3,300.
</P>
<P>
-- Short of the power to stop the Kosovo situation from
worsening, NATO attacked several targets in Belgrade over the
weekend, including oil stocking centers, bridges and the Serb
interior ministry. For the first time since 1945, a European
capital was subjected to such a scale of air bombings.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The primary evacuations of Kosovo refugees toward several
Western countries were delayed Sunday due to administrative
obstruction in Macedonia, while a humanitarian bridge has been
built to send aid to the refugees in Albania and Macedonia. The
United States, Germany, Turkey, Norway, Canada and Greece have
opened their doors to the refugees, but France does not intend to
receive a large number of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
-- While NATO is intensifying its airstrikes against Yugoslavia
by bombing downtown Belgrade, U.S. President Bill Clinton has
ordered the sending of 24 AH64 Apache helicopters to the Balkans,
to attack Serb tank forces in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> China's Supply of Agricultural Means of Production Sufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's supply of major
agricultural means of production is sufficient for the current
spring sowing, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out in 800 counties nationwide shows that 11
out of 13 categories of means of production will be 95 percent
supplied for the spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
The bureau noted that 96 percent of chemical fertilizer and 99
percent of pesticides needed in the period will be supplied, up
two percentage points over the same period last year respectively.
</P>
<P>
The demand for seeds will also be met basically, according to
the NBS, noting that all the grain crop seeds and 98 percent of
oil-bearing crop seeds will be available.
</P>
<P>
Middle-sized and small agricultural tools will be over-
supplied, said the bureau, adding that the supply/demand ratio
stands at 107 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also admitted that though the prices for most
agricultural means of production have fallen, farmers are buying
less than in the same periods in previous years.
</P>
<P>
It noted that some farmers believe the price of such items
will drop further and are therefore reluctant to buy these
products at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Other farmers, especially those in areas hit by last year's
severe floods, don't have the money to buy those products, the
survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
A local survey on 1,300 rural households in central China's
Hunan Province shows that they need a total of 640,000-yuan worth
of agricultural means of production for preparing the coming
spring sowing, but by the end of February, they had only raised
396,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows Reprisals Against Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Muslim military group
Hezbollah has vowed to conduct attacks to avenge the Israeli
shelling on Sunday which wounded 10 Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio Monday quoted Hezbollah's south
commander Nabil Qaouq as saying the Israeli "enemy" has violated
the cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was brokered by the United States to end a
16-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon, prohibits any attacks on civilian
targets or from civilian areas on both sides of the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Qaouq's comments came shortly after 10 Lebanese civilians,
mostly children, were wounded Sunday afternoon when Israeli
artillery troops blasted villages in south Lebanon in an apparent
bid to find the hideouts of guerrilllas of Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
</P>
<P>
Qaouq said Hezbollah considers itself responsible for the
security of Lebanese civilians, vowing to launch retaliatory
attacks at an appreciated time.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Hezbollah always chose to fire Katyusha rockets
into northern Israel as responses to Israeli assaults on Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah have been fighting to oust Israeli
occupation forces out of the country.

<HEADLINE> EU Helps Zimbabwe Improve Health Delivery System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare
Ministry will in the next two weeks get a one billion Zimbabwean
dollars (26 million U.S. dollars) grant from the European Union to
improve the ailing health delivery system, the daily Herald
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
EU head of delegation in Zimbabwe, Asger Pilegard, was quoted
as saying Sunday that the money would go toward the improvement of
the country's rural health centers and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The grants is part of a five billion Zimbabwean dollars (260
million U.S. dollars) funding to Zimbabwe from an EU national
indicative program aimed at promoting areas like health, education
and agriculture, Pilegard said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Zimbabwean government called for donor support to
prop up the country's health sector, which has deteriorated over
the years due to under-funding triggered by the prevailing
economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
The one billion Zimbabwean dollar injection marks the beginning
of the first five-year phase of EU support for the development of
health services in rural areas, including capacity building before
it decentralizes the delivery of health services, Pilegard said.
</P>
<P>
Pilegard said the grant was meant to assist the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare in its health sector reforms.

Monday suddenly summoned seven of his cabinet ministers to discuss
the government's proposal on autonomy for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the completion of the (proposal on) wide-ranging
autonomy (for East Timor) and the option for East Timor to
separate from Indonesia," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told
reporters following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He however declined to give details, saying only that upon its
completion, the proposal will be discussed with the United Nations
and the Portuguese government.
</P>
<P>
The other ministers who were summoned were Coordinating
Minister for Political and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung,
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita, Coordinating Minister for Economic and Development
Supervision Hartarto, Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare
and Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono, Defense Minister Gen.
Wiranto and Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as its 27th province, but the United Nations has
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Indonesian government announced a major shift
in its policy on East Timor, offering independence if the
territory rejects Indonesia's offer of a special, broad autonomy
package.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has suggested that the United
Nations-sponsored direct balloting to determine if the East Timor
wants autonomy or independence should be held in July.

<HEADLINE> 6 More Firms Apply for Cellular Phone Service in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Six more local and
international companies have applied for operating mobile cellular
phone services in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Communications Commission are evaluating the
applications and has invited public comments on the companies,
media reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission listed the companies as the Betafone Limited of
Dar es Salaam, Mobile Telephone Networks International Limited of
Port Louis and Beta Communications of Dar es Salaam in joint
venture with Skytel of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Other companies are Equator Air Limited of Dar es Salaam in
joint venture with Discount Investment Corporation Limited of
Israel, Planetel Communications Limited of Dar es Salaam, and the
London-based Mobile System International Services.
</P>
<P>
Currently, MIC Tanzania Ltd. which is trading as Mobitel, and
Tritelecommunication (Tanzania) Limited which stands for Tritel,
are the only two mobile cellular phone service providers in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Mobitel, the first cellular phone company to penetrate the
Tanzanian market five years ago, is lowering connection charges
and expanding coverage areas in face of the stiff competition from
Tritel.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited has
 reportedly applied to operate cellular phone service and is
expected to start operation by June.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Communications and Transport, Ernest
Nyanda, said in February that his government encourages private
telephone companies to compete so that their phone gadgets could
be cheaper.

<HEADLINE> Most of Ugandans Lack Modern Health Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 percent of the Ugandans
have no access to modern health services and depend on traditional
herbal healers, a report available here Monday revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to the report on a study of Uganda's reproductive
health services, about 51 percent of the population are further
than five kilometers from a health center.
</P>
<P>
The report said that of the Ugandans who use modern medicine,
40 percent use public health facilities and the remaining 60
percent use the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The doctor-to-population ratio is one doctor for every 30,000
people while that of midwives is one midwife per 3,000 mothers,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's total recurrent spending on health ranges from seven
to 12 U.S. dollars per person. Two thirds of this is spending by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Government spending is reportedly only four dollars per person,
between seven to nine percent of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
Disproportionate allocation of health funds is partly
responsible for the poor performance of primary health care in
remote areas, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There has been an outcry demanding a big increase in the
country's non- wage spending on primary health care.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiamen Defect to Lebanese Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the Israeli
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) have defected to the Lebanese
army along with their wives and children, the Voice of the People
radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deserters were reported to have walked on foot about 12
kilometers on Sunday to hand themselves over to the Lebanese
army, from Shabaa village, the SLA's headquarters inside the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There are currently nearly 2,500 SLA members, who are helping
Israeli forces to patrol its occupied border zone in south
Lebanon and handling the security affairs in Jezzine, a
predominantly Christian town near the zone.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were considered as traitors in Lebanon and its
commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by
a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
With the speculation mounting that Israeli forces may conduct a
unilateral partial withdrawal from south Lebanon, the SLA's morale
is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government in a bid to escape reprisals afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust Israeli
occupation forces and its ally SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zhu's Visit to Canada to Boost Trade Confidence (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji's upcoming
visit to Canada will boost the confidence of entrepreneurs in the
two countries and open new areas in trade and economic cooperation,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"Premier Zhu's visit to Canada, which has enjoyed a smooth
bilateral relations with China, will boost the confidence of
Chinese and Canadian businessmen on continuing their cooperation,"
an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
And the premier's visit will also push forward cooperation in
wider areas of trade and investments, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that China and Canada can step up their
cooperation in areas such as energy, transportation,
telecommunications, environmental protection, agriculture and raw
materials, hi-tech and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the principle of long-term friendship, equality,
mutual benefit and common prosperity, China and Canada will take
an active and practical manner in pushing forward bilateral
cooperation, especially in the central and western parts of China,
" according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu will visit the United States and Canada between
April 6 and 20, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi announced last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada are now important trade and investment
partners. Sino-Canadian trade and economic cooperation have kept
growing since the two countries established diplomatic relations
in 1970 and signed an official trade agreement in 1973, MOFTEC
officials said.

<P>
Chinese and Canadian leaders have exchanged visits frequently
over the past several years and have reached wide-ranging
consensus on the development of a 21-century oriented partnership.
Bilateral trade has been expanded to various areas of the economy
and technology, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng told his visiting Canadian
counterpart last year that China and Canada are economically
complementary, and it is in the interests of both countries to
expand trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Minister of International Trade, Sergio Marchi, said
that his country would give priority to developing trade with and
investments in China. Power, telecommunications, finance and
agriculture are the main fields that Canada hopes to enlarge
cooperation with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
In late 1998, Canadian Industry Minister John Manley visited
China and urged Canadian entrepreneurs to establish joint ventures
in the economically-fast growing central and western parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume reached 4.37 billion US dollars last
year, a record high, making Canada the 10th largest trading
partner of China.
</P>
<P>
The number of Canadian-financed projects in China had reached 3,
982 by the end of 1998, with contractual investment of 6.37
billion US dollars, while realized Canadian investments hit 1.77
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For More Oil, Gas In Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China expects to find 60 million
tons of oil and 10 billion cu.m. of gas in the Bohai Bay, the
country's largest offshore oil source.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, the president of the China Offshore
Oil Bohai Corp (COOBC), the Bohai Bay has an annual output of 2.2
million tons of oil and 370 million cu. m. of gas.
</P>
<P>
China is increasing efforts to explore two large Bohai
oilfields, the Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbao 35-2, with more than
200 million tons of oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6, which is 100 kilometers east of Tianjin, has
170 million tons of proven reserves. There are 11 wells drilled
here.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2, which is 20 kilometers south of Tanggu near
Tianjin, has 4 test wells and proven reserves of 70 million tons.
Its reserves are estimated at 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Lin says that the distance between the two oilfields is just 20
kilometers, making joint development possible in a 70-sq. km. area
in the central Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
He says that 7 standard platforms will be erected in the two
oilfields and two pipelines will be laid to take the oil inland
and terminals will be built at Jingtang Port. He expects the
exploration of the two large oilfields to help the development of
a group of medium-sized or small oilfields in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
A 650-meter stretch of the coast will be used for oil transport
berths in a 7.29-billion-yuan project, he says.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A new health alert on cholera has

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Start Registering for June Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Like in other cities across the
country, Indonesians in the capital city of Jakarta Monday morning
should have started registering for the June 7 general election,
but few people went to register.
</P>
<P>
An official of the General Election Commission (KPU) told
Xinhua that most citizens and villagers are preparing to register
because they just received forms sent by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Soebagio, deputy chief of the social affairs sector at the
commission, said that in the past the government sent workers to
every home for the registration but this year voters are called to
go to public places, including schools, village meeting halls and
sub-district offices, with their identity cards for registering.
</P>
<P>
KPU Chairman Rudini appealed to the nation Sunday evening to
register for the general election, touted as the country's first
democratic poll in over three decades.
</P>
<P>
Registration, which is voluntary, begins on Monday and will
continue through to May 4.
</P>
<P>
The poll is restricted to citizens at least 17 years of age and
those who are younger than 17 but are married.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Election Committee Jacob
Tobing warned people against registering more than once, a
criminal offense punishable by one-year imprisonment. Anyone who
votes more than once in the June election will face up to six
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the registration, some Jakartans said they
were not enthusiastic about registering themselves to vote. They
said they preferred to be visited by KPU workers.
</P>
<P>
But some others said they would not miss the poll and would
voluntarily register themselves.
</P>
<P>
A housewife said she would vote in the election because she
wanted to have a new experience.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the People's Consultative
Assembly decided in November last year to hold a multi-party
general election on June 7 this year and 48 out of 120 political
parties in the country have the qualifications to take part in the
election.
</P>
<P>
In the past 32 years when former President Soeharto was in
power, only three parties -- the ruling Golkar, the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
-- were allowed to contest the general election.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto stepped down on May 21 last year amid the worst
political and economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
KPU officials estimated that about 128 million of the 202
million people in the country are eligible voters in the June 7
election.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua)-- The majority of Chinese people are
against the state's monopoly of telecommunication services,
according to a recent survey by the China Business Climate
Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
The Center questioned 1,290 residents in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou and 72 percent of the respondents said the state
monopoly in the sector should be broken allowing competition to be
introduced, otherwise development will be stifled.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about the state-owned telecommunications companies
came from 37 percent of the respondents who described poor service
and the arrogance of many staff. Meanwhile 24 percent of the
respondents said telecoms costs are still too high.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 percent believe that state monopoly is not conducive to
the best use of funds and technology and, indeed, hinders long-
term development.
</P>
<P>
A sizable proportion of the respondents also said that
competition should be introduced in the railway, postal services

According to an earlier report, about 20,000 refugees camped in
Kaputa were facing starvation after the camp ran out of food
supplies some days ago.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the camp had been compounded by non-arrival of
two trucks carrying food relief from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Household Electrical Appliances Expected to Sell Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Demand for household electrical
appliances will continue to rise this year as more policies aimed
at boosting the domestic market take effect, according to Tao Ye,
an official with the Association of Household Electric Appliances
of China.
</P>
<P>
Tao said today that sales of microwave ovens, air conditioners
and water heaters will continue to grow this year, although at a
slower pace than previously. The growth rate will still be higher
than 10 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of refrigerators, washing machines and electric fans will
remain stable this year, growing at an estimated 4 percent, she
added.
</P>
<P>
She also said that although urban demand for household electric
appliances drops off, the vast potential of the rural market will
be tapped into this year, as a major step in boosting domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
According to Tao, enterprises are now focusing their attention
on the development of new and economical products which are
suitable for rural consumers.
</P>
<P>
"As buying a house is high on the spending agenda for urban
consumers in the next century, the demand for household electric
appliances, almost regarded as essentials, will rise as well," she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report released by the State
Administration of Light Industry, 82 household electric appliance
companies registered a total sales volume of 86.4 billion yuan (
about 10.4 billion U.S. dollars) last year, including 18 whose
sales volume exceeded 1 billion yuan (about 125 million U.S.
dollars).

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Four more foreign insurance
companies have been given approval to open branches or set up
joint ventures in China, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and

</P>
<P>
They are the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies and the John

The move is intended to "further restructure China's insurance

in a press release.
</P>
<P>
All four companies have been in business a long time and are
financially sound with good reputations.

"Prior to this week's decision, the four had all set up
representative offices in China and conducted their work in
accordance with Chinese laws and maintain well-established

Foreign insurance companies were first given permission to open
representative offices in the 1980s, and some of them have been
allowed to conduct business on a trial basis since the early 1990s.

Apart from this new group there are another 12 foreign

JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Twenty dead bodies were found in

went to Ambon, capital of Maluku Province, and some cities in
Sulawesi and Java.

Susanto said the exodus from Tual might continue as most parts
of the district have been considered inconvenient for people to
live there.

A Ministry of Agriculture official says that China is
undergoing major changes in its food supply concepts and depending
simply on traditional farming is giving way to developing non-
farmland resources, while dependence on grain has been moving
toward a greater variety of food resources.
</P>
<P>
Per capita daily caloricity and protein and fat consumption in
China is 2,700 c., 70 grams and 57 grams, respectively, which is
sufficient but still less than in developed countries. Quality and
variety in food need to be improved, the official says.
</P>
<P>
China has great potential in non-grain food resources,
including sea water and fresh water breeding, fruits in
mountainous areas, and the domestication and use of wild animals
and plants, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> China's Bank Loans On Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Claims that China's commercial
banks are only grudgingly granting business loans have been
dismissed by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank carried out a survey when a number of enterprises
which failed to secure loans complained.
</P>
<P>
However, the PBOC found that they had been turned down largely
because of their poor credit record. According to the bank, this
resulted in some people misunderstanding the prudent risk
prevention practices used by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized enterprises with healthy profits are
satisfied with their loan facilities, the PBOC declared.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks are now implementing a credit grading system
for loans which means much tougher rules affecting potential loans
for loss-making enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC report explains that the major reason for the slowing
increase in bank loans over the past few years is that many
enterprises have more diversified channels to raise capital, and
the structure of capital sourcing has been rationalized. In fact,
it says, the total amount of capital used by enterprises has
actually increased by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the PBOC said that efforts by commercial banks to
reinforce risk management and rationalize their credit structure
needs understanding and support from all sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed that commercial banks will continue to give
financial support to enterprises with good profits, according to
the laid down credit regulations.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Ban Essential For Fish Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April (Xinhua) -- The fishing ban to be introduced in
the South China Sea is aimed at protecting marine resources,
according to Yang Jian, an official with the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Yang, director of the ministry's fishery department, said that
China will assume management of foreign fishing boats only within
the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.
</P>
<P>
"Outside the zone, in waters under Sino-foreign joint
management and in disputed waters, the fishing ban will not cover
foreign boats," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that China will unilaterally prohibit its
domestic vessels from fishing in these waters during the
moratorium period, essentially to reduce overfishing which had
depleted fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
He also called on other countries to adopt similar policies to
protect decreasing marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Following the summer fishing ban in the Yellow Sea and the East
China Sea, China decided to impose a two-month ban on fishing in
the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Trawlers and purse-seine fishing will be banned during June and
July in the maritime areas north of 12 degrees latitude in the
South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
China will also re-introduce the fishing ban in the northern
section of the Yellow Sea north of 35 degrees north latitude for a
further two weeks later this year.

DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The production of tea, one of the
major
cash crops in Bangladesh, has suffered from a five-month-long
drought and rainless weather.
</P>
<P>
The moisture content of the soil has gone to wilting point
causing shrinking of both "young" and "mature" tea plants.
</P>
<P>
The tea industry has already recorded a 5-percent loss in
production. Even if it rains now, the loss could not be recovered,
and as a whole, there would be a loss of 15 percent in tea
production, The Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper Monday quoted
tea planters as saying.
</P>
<P>
There has been no rainfall since November 1998 against a
10.28-centimeter rainfall in the previous season in northeast
Srimangal, Moulvi Bazar district, the center of tea production of
the country, and hot dry-weather is inviting "red spider"
infestation in tea plantation.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 20 percent of the "young" tea plantation
has got burning effect while the amount for unpruned "mature" tea
would be as high as 30 percent. Tea bushes catch fire daily and
the management is in grave tension to face such a situation.
</P>
<P>
Tea processing in factories, which has not started, has already
delayed by one month.
</P>
<P>
M. Quasem, general manager of James Finlay PLC, the major tea
producing company of Bangladesh, said that 30 percent of the total
unpruned tea plant of Finlay tea garden was badly affected by the
drought. He added that Finlay's production so far this year was 5
percent less than that of the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Experts here opined that even if rain comes soon the plants
would require at least a month to get rid of drought effect and to
shoot new branches and leaves.
</P>
<P>
Tea, the second most important cash crop after jute for
Bangladesh, earned about 43.32 million U.S. dollars from export in
the July 1997-June 1998 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For More Oil, Gas In Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China expects to find 60 million
tons of oil and 10 billion cu.m. of gas in the Bohai Bay, the
country's largest offshore oil source.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, the president of the China Offshore
Oil Bohai Corp (COOBC), the Bohai Bay has an annual output of 2.2
million tons of oil and 370 million cu.m. of gas.
</P>
<P>
China is increasing efforts to explore two large Bohai
oilfields, the Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbao 35-2, with more than
200 million tons of oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6, which is 100 kilometers east of Tianjin, has
170 million tons of proven reserves. There are 11 wells drilled
here.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2, which is 20 kilometers south of Tanggu near
Tianjin, has 4 test wells and proven reserves of 70 million tons.
Its reserves are estimated at 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Lin says that the distance between the two oilfields is just 20
kilometers, making joint development possible in a 70-sq.km. area
in the central Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
He says that 7 standard platforms will be erected in the two
oilfields and two pipelines will be laid to take the oil inland
and terminals will be built at Jingtang Port. He expects the
exploration of the two large oilfields to help the development of
a group of medium-sized or small oilfields in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
A 650-meter stretch of the coast will be used for oil transport
berths in a 7.29-billion-yuan project, he says.

<HEADLINE> Who Are Investing In Chinese Stocks? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The dominant role of men in
China's economic life has been confirmed yet again by a recent
survey that showed that 71.3 percent of the investors in China's 2
stock exchanges last year were male.
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Daily's 6-year survey showed that women
investors fell from a peak of 32.3 percent in 1996 to last year's
28.1 percent because of the bearish mood of the markets. Investors
ranging in age from 30 to 49 account for 51.3 percent of the total,
according to the survey of 10,580 people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, last year there was a 2.7 percent increase in the
number of investors below the age of 30 and a 1.6-percentage point
increase for those above 60.
</P>
<P>
Last year also saw an 11.82 percent increase in the number of
investors with at least a college education. This group accounted
for 65.4 percent of the total. The number of people with only a
primary-school education fell by half from 1997 to 1.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, managers of state-owned enterprises,
retired officials, teachers, accountants, and other professionals
accounted for 87 percent, while laid-off workers accounted for 7.
15 percent, the same amount as in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the number of investors registered on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges rose by 5.77 million. That was less than half
the 1997 increase of 10.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Western Powers Criticized for Delaying Selection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Western powers have come under
fire for seeking to undermine Thailand's bid to win the top post
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), thus delaying the selection
of a new chief.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign supporters of Thailand's candidate, Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panichpakdi, have raised the criticism for the
actions of Western powers, media reports Monday quoted Ong-art
Klampaibul, Supachai's secretary, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several countries had telephoned Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan to confirm their support for
Supachai, Ong-art said.
</P>
<P>
"Supporters of our candidate expressed disagreement with the
efforts by some countries to block Mr. Supachai from getting the
post of WTO director-general," said Ong-art.
</P>
<P>
"They have urged him not to give in his fight," Ong-art said.
</P>
<P>
WTO members last week again failed to reach consensus on who
should get the job because Washington secretly vetoed against
Supachai, who is also commerce minister.
</P>
<P>
The selection of a new WTO director-general has become a
two-man race between Supachai and former New Zealand prime
minister Michael Moore, both facing opposition from hostile camps.
</P>
<P>
Some countries recently notified Thailand they would not
support Suipachai, but they failed to explain why, Ong-art said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will continue its intensive lobbying, especially among
countries which had yet to take a side, he said. These countries
include Germany, Austria, Portugal and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for a decision on a replacement for outgoing chief
Renato Ruggiero, whose term expires on April 30, has been
postponed until April 14, when the WTO General Council is due to
meet.
</P>
<P>
Four deadlines have now been set and missed amid efforts to
find the first non-European head of the global organization.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero has insisted he will step down on April 30. But if no
successor has been chosen by then, his departure could trigger a
leadership crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a rule, WTO's new chief is appointed by consensus, only if
that cannot be established could a formal vote be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body chief will have to steer the organization
to the expected launch in December of fresh global trade
organizations, to last until 2003.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade have always been headed by a European, and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
appointment of a figure from their midst.

<HEADLINE> NATO Troops Enter Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A few dozen NATO soldiers Sunday
entered Albania by helicopters to help Albania distribute
humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO relief commanding officer, U.S. General Bill Hinton, said
in Tirana these NATO soldiers are here to "carry out humanitarian
mission" and protect, together with Albanian police and army, the
relief supplies. They are the first batch of forces NATO planned
to send to the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Hinton said a few hundred NATO soldiers are expected to arrive
in Albania in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced Saturday it decided to send "several thousand"
armed soldiers to Albania to help "ensure humanitarian aid
deliveries" to refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'alema, German
Interior Minister Otto Shilly, British Secretary of State for
International Development Clare Short and U.S. Senator Frank Wolf
visited Albania to find out the refugee situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with them, Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko appealed to the international
community for emergent action to help Albania solve the refugee
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 refugees from Kosovo fled into neighboring Albania
when NATO launched strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24,
bringing severe political, economic and social pressure on the
country. The Albanian government appealed for international aid
repeatedly and asked NATO to deploy forces in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Has No Plan to Take More Refugees From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia was not considering
increasing the number of immigration places for refugees from
Kosovo, Australian Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock told Sky News that under a permanent entry program
determined earlier this year, 4,500 of 10,000 refugee places were
allocated to people from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the government would increase that number in light of
the Kosovo crisis, Ruddock replied: "If there were an option that
we were exploring about those matters I'd make an announcement but
I don't intend any announcement in respect of additional places at
this time."
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said Australia would be offering permanent settlement
rather than temporary refuge to ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Our approach has always been to provide settlement
opportunities on a permanent basis rather than a temporary basis,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 18 million, Australia is the world's
smallest continent that covers 7.6 million square kilometers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Sunday that Moscow does not want to be involved in a
arms race.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, he stressed however, Russia will
make every effort to maintain a high-level and powerful national
armed force with high battle effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the feasibility of transferring Russian economy
into "military system", especially, to strengthening the country's
international status in solving the Balkan conflict, Ivanov said
that Russia, as a big power in the world and a permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council, should consider both its own
security and the positive role it should play in preserving the
worldwide stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The Russian President, government and parliament will decide
what relevant steps to be taken, he said, noting that "the key to
the question does not lie in arms race or the militarization of
the nation's economy, but in our strategic bid to maintain a high-
level and powerful armed force with strong battle effectiveness".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Burial Practices Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in Tianjin
visited graveyards for the past two weekends before the Qingming (
Pure Brightness) festival to mourn the dead on April 5.
</P>
<P>
Things are different this year however, because the site has
shifted from inside to outside as many local people move their
relatives' ashes out of mausoleums and bury them under trees.
There have been 12,000 such cases over the past 9 years.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is one of the Chinese cities where people most like to
keep the ashes, says Zhao Jinliang, a Tianjin Bureau of Civil
Affairs official, and their numbers are growing by 25,000 every
year and that means a large amount of room.
</P>
<P>
So, the tree burials have been a good solution because it
coincides with people's thoughts that a person is safe only when
the body returns to the earth and it keeps the city beautiful by
providing more trees.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader, was one of the first to
take this step, when he asked that his ashes be scattered in the
sea, which has become the second most popular place for people to
put the ashes of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
These sea burials have been encouraged in the cities of Tianjin,
Beijing, and Fuzhou and the numbers have grown from 4 in 1997 to
80 in Fuzhou. About a hundred people in Tianjin applied for this
kind of funeral for their loved ones when the local civil affair
bureau announced that they will hold a public sea-funeral in April.
</P>
<P>
The first-stage of the reform was cremation. Cremation rates
in large Chinese cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin are
already as high as 100 percent. In the past, most people were
buried when they died.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology will sponsor later this year a symposium on cross-
straits industrial use of scientific developments this year to
promote cooperation with Taiwan scientific researchers and high-
tech ventures.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Be United to Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Bernama) -- Malaysia's Supreme Head of
State Tuanku Ja'afar Monday called on his countrymen to remain
united to face greater challenges.
</P>
<P>
The people's unity has enabled Malaysia to build a modern and
progressive society, he said here when opening the fifth session
of the ninth parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Only with solid unity that is based on the principle of
working together, consensus and respecting one another can we step
forward into the new millennium in greater confidence," the king
said.
</P>
<P>
"The people of this country should be grateful because unity
among us is still strong in spite of threats from various
quarters, internally or externally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said the country's economy would see positive
growth this year but Malaysia must prepare for greater challenges
from external risks which he said could halt a full economic
recovery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Spelling out the risks including an uncertain international
financial market, unencouraging economic prospects of advanced
countries and slower growth in world trade, he said: "We must be
prepared and to look at ways to overcome the possible greater
challenges caused by external factors."
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to adopt pragmatic
policies aimed at improving the country's ability to withstand
external shocks, strengthen its financial system and stimulate
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The king believed Malaysia's economy would achieve positive
growth this year despite the uncertain external factors.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue with efforts to attract
foreign direct investment, especially in high value added and high
technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
The king said that in electronic technology and digital world
which is developing rapidly, various changes would be expedited to
enable Malaysia to play a role and to improve the country's
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
He said plans are afoot to develop Malaysia's communications
and multimedia sector into a world hub as envisioned in the
country's Vision 2020 target, the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)
and the National Information Technology agenda.

<HEADLINE> ADB Supports Sri Lankan Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
will support Sri Lanka in two projects for water supply and
afforestation, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under an ADB aided-program, Sri Lankan National Water Supply
and Drainage Board will launch a water supply and sanitary
improvement project in six out of the 24 districts in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover the districts of Anuradhapura,
Hambantota, Kalutara, Kegalle, Monaragala and Puttalam for each of
which 800 million rupees (11.4 million U.S. dollars) have been
allocated.
</P>
<P>
Under the project each district will get an urban water supply
scheme and nine small town water supply schemes.
</P>
<P>
The project also envisages the construction of 150 rural water
supply schemes and disbursing 3,000 rupees (43 dollars) each among
40,000 families to enable them to secure sanitary facilities.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will also give monetary support for the afforestation
of 8,000 hectares under a community participatory forest program.
</P>
<P>
The program is a massive forest conservation drive aimed at
involving communities islandwide in forest conservation
activities.
</P>
<P>
Although initially it was proposed to target 15,000 hectares,
the projected cover has been increased to 25,000 hectares
following the successful completion of the project ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has been the main financial assistance organization to
Sri Lanka for years. Sri Lanka received 190 million dollars loans
for projects from the ADB in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Lowers Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has decided to cut its key interest rates by another 12.5 basis
points effective Monday after treasury bill rates continued to
slip last week, the Business World newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the bank, was quoted as saying
that the bellwether 91-day treasury bill rate, at 11.78 percent as
of last Monday's auction, is already lower than the 11.875 percent
rate at which the Central Bank is willing to borrow money
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation "distorts" market rates and may be attracting
too much funds to the Central Bank where higher yields are
available, he said.
</P>
<P>
Effective on Monday, the Central Bank's overnight borrowing and
lending rates stand at 11.75 percent and 13.75 percent
respectively, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It is the eighth time this year the Central Bank has lowered
its overnight rates, which are used primarily to control
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
The new rate cut could surprise bankers who are expecting the
Central Bank to make the decision after the official March
inflation figure is released this week, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said he is even hoping that the March inflation figure
would be lower than that recorded in February, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has been trying for the past three months to
prod banks into lending more to get the economy moving.
</P>
<P>
But official figures show that for January at least, bank
credit remained weak as net domestic credit fell 3.8 percent on a
year-on-year basis.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air Force Considers Buying Second-hand German Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Struggling to retain its capability in a time of economic
difficulty, the air force is looking to deploy about 30 Alpha jets
at a "bargain price" of one million baht (27,027 U.S. dollars)
each, a source was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Air force chief ACM Thananit Niamthan wanted to buy the old
German planes, which had an average age of 20 years, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
ACM Mahintra Thaiamthat, the air force chief-of-staff who
chairs the panel studying aircraft procurement, was in Germany to
get first-hand information about the Alpha jets, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Initially, about 50 planes may be bought. Up to 20 of them
would be dismantled for parts to repair the ones that were still
in good condition. After "the culling operation", the air force
would end up with about 30 jets for deployment.
</P>
<P>
"cash-starved as we are, buying second-hand armaments is one
practical solution," the source said.

<HEADLINE> Turning Mammoth Jade into Buddha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Local people of northeast China's
Liaoning Province plan to make some very large Buddha statues out
of what it might be the world's largest piece of crude jade,
estimated to weigh 60,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The precious stone, 25 meters in diameter, was discovered in
1996 in Youyan county of Liaoning, where it is called the "king of
jade stones".
</P>
<P>
The local government and people there have spent a year getting
the jade split from the rest of the hill where it was found but,
were not able to move it elsewhere. So they decided to make it
into a number of statues of Buddha, the icon of religious belief,
right where it was, but, unfortunately, a lack of money has held
the process up.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Xukai, the vice-head of Youyan, refining the
jade stone would require far more money than the county has in its
coffers. And more investment is needed if the sculpture work is to
be done.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds Seminar on ASEAN Transport Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar held a seminar here Sunday
on the development of transport and communications in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by Myanmar Minister of Rail

Secretariat Honorio R. Vitasa and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Myanmar ministries of transport,

<HEADLINE> ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (11) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 11 of a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Why does the MSAR enjoy a high degree of autonomy?
</P>
<P>
The MSAR is an administrative region of China with a high
degree of autonomy that manifests itself in the two following ways:
</P>
<P>
First, the internal affairs of a country or region fall into
three categories: administrative, legislative and judicial.
</P>
<P>
Article 2 of the Basic Law provides for a high degree of
autonomy and executive, legislative, and independent judicial
powers, including that of final adjudication, with the
authorization of the National People's Congress. This means that
the MSAR enjoys full autonomy in all its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Article 13 states that while the central
government is responsible for foreign affairs for the MSAR, the
Region can conduct on its own in accordance with the Basic Law,
including concluding and implementing agreements with other
countries and regions in economic and other specified areas.
</P>
<P>
This means that the MSAR enjoys far more autonomy than ethnic
autonomous regions on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Second, because the Basic Law grants autonomy to the MSAR in
local affairs, the Region enjoys far more autonomy than parts of
countries under the federal system.
</P>
<P>
Under US law, for example, states have neither the power to
pursue their own monetary and taxation policies nor the power to
issue currency and set up separate customs regulation, to say
nothing about the power of final adjudication. Under the Basic Law,
however, these powers are vested in the MSAR and the central
government will not interfere with them.
</P>
<P>
No government in any other unitary country or part of a federal
country enjoys as much autonomy as the MSAR does. This local
autonomy comes from authorization of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Because China is a unitary state and Macao is a local
administrative region, the high degree of autonomy Macao enjoys
naturally comes from central government authorization.

<HEADLINE> ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (12) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 12 of a question
and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What is meant by the term "People of Macao administering Macao?
"
</P>
<P>
Article 13 of the Basic Law states that the executive branch
and legislature of the MSAR are to be composed of permanent
residents of Macao in accordance with provisions of the Basic Law.
This article expresses the basic principle "People of Macao
administering Macao" as stated in the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
This means that affairs in Macao are run by the people of Macao
and that the Chinese Government will not send officials from
Beijing or other parts of China to interfere in Macao's
administration and it shows that the Chinese Government has every
confidence in the 400,000 people of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The people of Macao administer Macao as a basic feature of this
high degree of autonomy they enjoy and this provides an
indispensable guarantee for the exercise of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"People of Macao" here refer to permanent residents of the MSAR
as defined in Article 24 of the Basic Law and local inhabitants as
referred to in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration. Any person
meeting these conditions as spelled out in the Basic Law, whether
Chinese, Portuguese, or from elsewhere can become a permanent
resident of the MSAR and take part in governing Macao.
</P>
<P>
It must be emphasized that those "people of Macao administering
Macao" should mainly be patriots. This is because Macao is a part
of China and the majority of inhabitants there are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
It is only when inhabitants who love China and Macao have a
major part in administering Macao that the "one country, two
systems" principle can be implemented in Macao and the long-term
prosperity and stability of Macao be ensured.
</P>
<P>
The principle of the people of Macao administering Macao can
also be found in other provisions of the Basic Law. The Chief
Executive of the MSAR, the principal officials of the MSAR
government, the President and Vice-President of the Legislative
Council, the President of the Court of Final Appeal, the
Procurator-General and members of the Executive Council must all
be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Members of the legislature must be permanent residents of the
MSAR as must civil servants of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Football Schools Yet to Produce Skillful Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Football schools and training
program in Indonesia have yet to produce skillful players while
those institutions played an important role in the development of
national football.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Indonesian Football Federation (PSSI)
Nugraha Boesos said during a dialog with Jakarta high school
students here on Saturday that Indonesia has some 200 football
schools and seven training centers overseen by the Education and
Culture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
These schools and training centers are located in Jakarta,
Medan, Palembang, Padang, Salatiga, Ujungpandang and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the inability of the schools to produce skillful
athletes was the lack of an effective training program.
</P>
<P>
"This is the problem, our coaches do not have a clear training
program," Boesos was quoted by Antara News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, PSSI is trying to improve the training of football
coaches and its management.
</P>
<P>
On the role of students in developing national football, Boesos
said, it will need their own support to activate football amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, it has now become difficult to find open spaces in the
capital city to play football as most of them had been built into
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government should provide more sport facilities
in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a former senior football player Ronny Pattinasarani
said that one way to improve football training -- in view of the

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Holds Zambia in Soccer Under-23 Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia national under-23 team
was held to a 0-0 draw by Lesotho Saturday at Sesotho stadium in
Lesotho capital, according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambian coach Ben bamfuchil was very angered by the result
dismissing the game, the All-Africa Games second round first leg
qualifer as simply pathetic.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying Saturday in Maseru,
the capital of Lesotho, that the performance by the players was
not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sothos had up to eight defenders at the back who
were not even attacking and it was disappointing for his players
Harry Milanzi and Charles Lota.
</P>
<P>
He said the midfielders, Rotson Kilambe, Spaita Mumba, Numba
mumamba and Chanda Wwape simply failed to control the ball up
front.
</P>
<P>
He had to substitue Mwape for Mwenya Chipepo in the second half
with the hope of changing the tempo of play but the measure could
not help either, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bamfuchile hoped they would take a different stance whey they
face Lesotho in the return match in two weeks time.
</P>
<P>
"They just have to put their attitudes right and know that
there is no small team in football because this will be the only
way they will have to succeed," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
He said Lesotho will however not be a team which could threaten
Zambia's qualification to the All-Africa Games especially if it is
not underrated.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Grant Long's five-meter shoot
with 2.6 seconds to play gave the Atlanta Hawks an 85-83 victory
over the Charlotte Hornets, who have lost four straight games.
</P>
<P>
Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo missed two free throws with 1:12
left and was called for goaltending against Eddie Jones with 16
seconds to go, allowing the Hornets to tie it at 83-all.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta did not call timeout and Long set a high pick for point
guard Mookie Blaylock. As the Hornets swarmed Blaylock, Long
floated to the left corner, took a pass and knocked down the open
shot.
</P>
<P>
Long scored half of his 10 points in a second-half surge led by
the bench that gave Atlanta control. The Hawks held a 41-19 edge
in bench scoring.
</P>
<P>
Alan Henderson scored 18 points and Tyrone Corbin contributed
15 off the bench for Atlanta, which has won two in a row without
leading scorer Steve Smith, sidelined with a sprained left knee.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Kournikova in Family Circle Cup Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The youngest matchup in the
history of the Family Circle Cup final turned out to be no contest
in South Carolina, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Martina Hingis of Switzerland cruised past fellow
and seventh seed Anna Kournikova of Russia, 6-4, 6-3, to claim $
150,000 at the $1.05 million event.
</P>
<P>
With a combined age of 36 years, five months, Hingis and
Kournikova were the youngest players that meet in the finals at
this event. In 1989, Steffi Graf of Germany played Natasha Zvereva
of Belarus, with an aggregate age of 15 months older than today's
duo.
</P>
<P>
The record for the youngest final matchup on the WTA Tour was
set at San Diego in 1991, when Jennifer Capriati at 15 years, four
months defeated fellow American Monica Seles at 17 years, eight
months.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Hingis, who teamed with Kournikova to win the
Australian Open doubles championship, needed just over an hour to
claim her 22nd career singles title and third of the year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 champion also won the season's first Grand Slam event
and the Pan Pacific Open at Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
In her previous three events, Hingis reached the quarterfinals
in Paris and Indiana Wells, California before losing in the
semifinals at the Lipton Championships last week.
</P>
<P>
Hingis improved to 6-1 all-time against the 17-year-old
Kournikova, nailing 23 winners and winning 75 percent of her
second serves. Her Russian counterpart committed 30 unforced
errors.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Sweden Falls, U.S. Beats Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Sweden made a
surprise exit to Slovakia in the Davis Cup first-round tie on
Sunday as Karol Kucera scored his second singles victory of the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Kucera fought back from one set down to beat Swedish number one
Thomas Enqvist 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to dash the home side's hopes
that they could complete a revival from 2-0 down just as they had
done in the opening round last year in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Thomas Johansson closed out the tie with a 6-4, 6-4
defeat of Dominik Hrbaty in a meaningless rubber that made the
final score 3-2.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, the United States beat Britain 3-2 to end a
thrilling British comeback when Jim Courier beat Greg Rusedski 6-4,
6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 1-6, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten won a personal dual against
Carlos Moya in a battle between the last two French Open champions.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, the 1997 winner, crushed present champion Moya 6-2, 6-
4, 6-1 for his third victory of the weekend to give his side a
winning 3-1 lead, cut to 3-2 in the dead final rubber.
</P>
<P>
In Harare, Australia ensured their progress to the next round
by beating Zimbabwe as Patrick Rafter gave them a winning 3-1 lead
and Mark Philippoussis won the dead fifth rubber.
</P>
<P>
Rafter routed Byron Black 6-4, 7-6, 6-2 for the decisive
victory and his second singles win of the weekend and declared
himself ready to add to his two major victories at the last two U.
S. Opens.
</P>
<P>
Russia won both singles on the final day against Germany and
probably ended Boris Becker's appearances for his country.
</P>
<P>
Belgium matched the Russians by taking the two closing singles
in Ghent to beat the Czech Republic 3-2. France completed a 4-1
victory over the Netherlands as Cedric Pioline cooled off Richard
Krajicek 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 for the winning point.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland lost the dead singles matches against Italy, having
sealed victory on Saturday when they won the doubles over last
year's beaten finalists to lead 3-0 and ensure a quarterfinal tie
in Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Offer Safe Haven to Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Canada announced
Sunday that 5,000 Kosovar refugees will be offered safe haven in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
This is in response to a call by Mrs. Sadako Ogata, United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for the
international community to harbor refugees fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Chretien decided that Canada would respond
immediately to the request from the United Nations to assist the
countries in the Balkans, which can no longer cope with the influx
of refugees," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy in a
release.
</P>
<P>
"The eventual return of these refugees to Kosovo under secure
conditions remains the wish of both the refugees and the UNHCR.
The immediate priority for citizenship and immigration will be to
provide a safe haven with shelter and food for these 5,000
refugees," said Citizenship and Immigration Minister Lucienne
Robillard in the release.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Department of National Defense will coordinate closely
with Citizenship and Immigration Canada to facilitate the
transport of refugees to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says N.Ireland Peace Process "in Crisis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said
Sunday that the year-old Northern Ireland peace agreement was in
crisis and the demand for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to
disarm was a "provocation."
</P>
<P>
Adams's remarks was made at a rally to mark the anniversary of
the 1916 Easter rising against British rule in Dublin -- and as
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble predicted an IRA
weapons handover would take place in weeks.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who leads the Ulster Unionist Party, was quoted in the
Sunday Times as saying he believed republicans would accept the
declaration despite moves by Sinn Fein Saturday to distance itself
from it.
</P>
<P>
"One of the provocations has been the demand on the IRA to
disarm. This is something which the IRA has made clear it feels
under no obligation to do," BBC quoted Adams as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader was expected to have talks with Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern before the Northern Ireland-based
negotiations resume later this month.
</P>
<P>
Adams, in line with other members of his party at a series of
meetings throughout the weekend, still gave little sign of there
being room for maneuver on decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party insists that the IRA must begin to
disarm before its political wing Sinn Fein could join the cabinet.
But Sinn Fein argues there is no such precondition of
decommissioning in the peace agreement, thus blocking the peace
process over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks between major political parties in the
province will resume on April 13 after 12-day adjournment to find
a way out of the deadlock.

<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Monday that NATO ground forces would not be sent into Kosovo
"unless it is to police an agreed political settlement."
</P>
<P>
In an article in the British tabloid, The Sun, Blair said the
NATO military campaign against Yugoslavia "was never going to be a
simple military operation."
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of NATO ground forces being sent in
unless it is to police an agreed political settlement," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Serb military chiefs should have no doubts about NATO's
resolve.
</P>
<P>
"We will end the campaign and enable the people of Kosovo to
live in peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the article, he insisted again that NATO was "on the right
side" in the war which he presumed that NATO "will win."
</P>
<P>
The Monday edition of The Sun also carried a front-page
editorial with the headline "Don't Send Our Troops Off to Die."
</P>
<P>
The editorial accused the "so-called experts" in Britain and
the United States who "were lining up demanding a ground war" as
"madness."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a ground war because we don't want to see Europe
engulfed in a ghastly bloodbath that would cost the lives of many
of our heroic young troops," the tabloid said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sending Apaches to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send 24
Apache attack helicopter gunships and 2,000 supporting soldiers to
Albania to take part in the escalated bombing raids against
Yugoslavia, the Pentagon said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It's a logical expansion of the current air operation,"
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said at a briefing. "It gives us
greater precision, all-weather capability, day or night, to go
after the types of weapons that the Yugoslav army... is using."
</P>
<P>
To protect the Apaches, U.S. troops will man 18 multiple launch
rocket systems deployed to Albania as well with short- and
medium-range missiles that are aimed to take out Yugoslav air
defenses throughout Kosovo, where the Yugoslav army is resisting
any invaders into the sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the use of Apaches would give NATO "the type of
tank-killing capability that bad weather has denied us."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the increasing risk to U.S. forces by using the
helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, close-in engagement is by definition riskier than
more distant engagement," he said.
