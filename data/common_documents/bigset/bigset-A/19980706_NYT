ANGELS SWEPT BY A'S
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels walked with a swagger throughout June, but
they stumbled into the All-Star break after their fifth consecutive
loss, a 5-4 setback to the Oakland A's on Sunday afternoon before
23,208 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The losing streak is the Angels' longest of the season, and the
three-game sweep at the hands of the A's is the first time they've
been swept in a three-game series since the Indians did it to them
April 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Angels is that they're still in first
place in the American League West _ by 1{ games _ and the three
days off will give them a chance to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get away from each other,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``We spend so much time together, it's good to get
away and spend some time with your family. We've been together
every day since spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time for them to get away from me, and for me to
get away from them,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Then get
after it on Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels certainly played like a team that was tired, and
tired of each other on Sunday. They had a 4-1 lead after a four-run
fourth inning, highlighted by Jim Edmonds' 15th home run and
DiSarcina's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   But even with starter Chuck Finley on the mound, the Angels
couldn't hold the lead. The A's tied the game in the eighth on
Kevin Mitchell's first home run of the year and went ahead in the
ninth against Troy Percival (1-3), who got the loss. Percival
walked Mitchell with the bases loaded to force in what turned out
to be the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had their chances but failed to do what they had done
so well during June, when they went 22-6 _ like moving runners up.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had runners on first and third with one out in the
seventh inning when Damon Mashore _ pinch running for Tim Salmon _
got picked off first after A's pitcher Mike Fetters faked to third
and threw to first. Cecil Fielder struck out to end the frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fetters has got a real good third-to-first move,
outstanding,'' Collins said. ``(Third base coach) Larry (Bowa) told
him about it. But until you go out there and actually see it, you
don't know how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the Angels had Garret Anderson on second with a
leadoff double. Matt Walbeck tried to get him to third. But
Walbeck's bunt went right back to Fetters, who threw Anderson out
at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very good during the homestand; that's
obviously an understatement,'' Collins said. ``All the things that
went right in June, we didn't do any of that the last five days. We
didn't make the big pitch, get the big hit or make the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters (1-2) got the win and Billy Taylor pitched the ninth to
earn his 18th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels now have three days to rest and get ready for the
second half of the season, and Collins said he hopes the five-game
losing streak eats at his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they do,'' Collins said when asked if his players will
contemplate the slump over the break. ``Because that's what you do,
you get angry. I know I am. My coaches are. You don't play the game
to get beat. You don't make up nine games in a month to lose five
games in a row. I hope they stew. They can have all the fun they
want in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Angels, though, say they need to have a little fun
away from the ballpark now. Upon finishing up a chat with reporters
after Sunday's game, Edmonds said, ``The sun's going down, got to
get to the river.''

JERRY BRUCKHEIMER _ HOLLYWOOD'S $1 MILLION MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writers Glenn Whipp and   Dave McNary   also
contributed to this story) 
BY BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  ``Armageddon,'' the most expensive movie of the summer, opened in
time for the holiday weekend, backed by all the hype and
intimidation Disney's formidable marketing machinery can muster.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet with a star-studded cast (Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy
Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler), perhaps the most bankable name on the
credits is producer Jerry Bruckheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Call him Hollywood's $100 &UR;  &LR; million man.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer belongs to an elite club _ including Steven
Spielberg and James Cameron _ that film studios gladly give free
rein, even in a time when most in the business are trying to limit
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Bruckheimer's inclusion is obvious. His string of
hits includes ``The Rock,'' ``Con Air'' and, with late partner Don
Simpson, such pop phenomena as ``Flashdance,'' ``Beverly Hills
Cop,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Dangerous Minds,'' as well as summer hits
like ``Crimson Tide'' and ``Bad Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``Armageddon,'' which cost $140 &UR;  &LR; million to make and
$60 &UR;  &LR; million to market, already has met with critical disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it opened to a somewhat disappointing $52.5 &UR;  &LR; million in
its first five days, according to estimates Sunday from studio
sources.
</P>
<P>
   If that and the lackluster performance of the summer's other
predicted, sure-fire smash, ``Godzilla,'' has the 54-year-old
producer worried that audiences are tiring of his high-decibel
style of moviemaking, he doesn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there is the pressure of knowing that nobody's
going to hit it out of the park every time,'' he said
philosophically. ``You don't try to strike out. You try to do the
best you can, but you're not always going to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   So the question looms large: Are the kinds of shallow-yet-strong
impact films Simpson and Bruckheimer made a Hollywood staple still
the summer moneymaking machines they've been for more than two
decades?
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken, without a hair on his scalp or face out of place,
Bruckheimer projects the confidence of a man who possesses the
elusive Hollywood megahit formula. Or, as he repeatedly tries to
frame it, an even rarer, more mystical attunement to the mass
audience's ever-changing tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about making a blockbuster,'' Bruckheimer said.
``I think about trying to make an effective movie. There's always
more pressure when a movie is expensive and there are high
expectations bandied about in the press. I'd rather come in with
something that hasn't been talked about and, because you did your
job effectively, it becomes a hit. That's the most fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've gotta listen to the people who are paying their
money,'' he adds. ``You have market indicators, predictions can be
made, but there's a whole mass out there making decisions
independently that are geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer's films are distinguished by their rapid narrative
momentum, exciting visuals, big action sequences, deafening
soundscapes, seasonings of raucous humor and broad emotional
strokes. They're easy to get and, some would say, just as easily
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bruckheimer has repeatedly insisted that the staple of
serious cinema _ character development _ is fundamentally important
for his movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to populate your films with punctuation points that
the audience can identify with emotionally,'' he said. ``I've
always felt that, no matter how spectacular your production may be,
if you don't care about the characters, the movie isn't going to
please many people. It's about creating characters and themes that
are engaging, then surrounding them with drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, though, say Bruckheimer's movies have little to do
with creating characters and drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, Simpson and Bruckheimer are responsible for
devaluing the moviegoing experience during their lifetime and were
able to package a kind of violence and adrenaline in an attractive
way,'' said Charles Fleming, author of ``High Concept: Don Simpson
and the Hollywood Culture of Excess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spawned legions of imitators who have been able to
make similar movies. ... These movies have affected our perspective
as moviegoers and we have accepted a certain level of violence and
hollowness that we would not have accepted before,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Film critic Leonard Maltin, though, gives Bruckheimer his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give a lot of people what they want to see,'' he said.
``Critics can talk themselves blue in the face, but that fact
remains. What troubles me is that his movies are also a product of
a marketing machine that makes people think they're what they want
to see _ whether they deliver the goods or not. I didn't hear
anyone raving about `Con Air,' but they got those people to pay
their money and see it.''

   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps two of the reasons audiences flock to Bruckheimer's
films are themes that pop up over and over _ patriotism and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer is big on technology. He thinks most directors and
screenwriters lag behind their audiences when it comes to embracing
new media and innovations. Audiences, he said, are used to surfing
the Internet and cable channels and thus want faster and more vivid
movies. If the movies don't deliver that, they'll get their kicks
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely frightening what you can do now with film,''
Bruckheimer said. ``The envelope has been pushed so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer movies also have a strong jingoistic element. You
can hardly sit through 10 minutes of ``Armageddon'' without seeing
an American flag, military uniform or some strong, nationalistic
image.
</P>
<P>
   Said actor Owen Wilson, one of the movie's oil riggers: ``Jerry
pitched it like, if you don't do the movie, you're not patriotic.
In fact, you're probably a communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer is the first to admit that his brand of box-office
magic doesn't always work. The Detroit-reared son of German
immigrants, he cut his professional teeth producing commercials for
car companies before moving on to Madison Avenue, then to
Hollywood, where he initially had middling success with such
projects as ``Farewell, My Lovely'' and ``American Gigolo.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand slams started coming when Bruckheimer teamed up with
former Paramount executive Simpson in the early '80s. They had
their first surprise blockbuster with 1983's ``Flashdance,'' and as
time went on displayed an amazing knack for getting rising,
not-quite-there stars into their breakthrough vehicles: Eddie
Murphy in ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' Tom Cruise in ``Top Gun,'' Will
Smith in ``Bad Boys,'' and, probably, Affleck in ``Armageddon''
(who won the role before the release of ``Good Will Hunting,'' when
he impressed all the female assistants at Bruckheimer's production
company).
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer said that even if he changes his approach, one thing
always will remain constant: `I'm still going to try to make
pictures that excite me.''

COLLINS: MORE INTENSITY NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Manager Terry Collins ripped his players for a lack of
intensity after Saturday night's loss to the Oakland A's, and he
says they'll need to get it back after the All-Star break if they
hope to maintain their lead in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with tremendous intensity in the month of June,
where every game meant something,'' Collins said. ``We need to do
that again because the second half of the season is when pennants
are won. You've got to go out every night and forget about the day
before. If we approach it that way, we'll win our share of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins pointed to the four games against the Dodgers that might
have drained the club emotionally going into the final stretch
before the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There sure was a lot of emotion in those four games,'' Collins
said. ``You play the game on emotion and we might have used up a
lot. It's a good time to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a break,'' pitcher Troy Percival said. ``The guys
have to stay mentally strong. We're not the most talented team in
baseball. We're not even the most talented team in the AL West. But
we're definitely the toughest and most resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels do return, they play four against the Mariners
in Seattle. Even though the Mariners are in last place in the
division, Collins says the games will be big.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a bad first half, but they are a better team than
that,'' Collins said. ``They know it, everybody knows it. Coming
out of the break, one thing that might get them going is to beat us
up a little bit. One thing we need to do is win a couple games.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins decided to change his pitching rotation for the series
in Seattle in order to give Jarrod Washburn a few extra days of
rest. Washburn felt ``tightness'' in his left (pitching) forearm in
his start Saturday and left the game after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares will start Thursday, followed by Chuck Finley,
Jason Dickson and Steve Sparks.

MY WORLD CUP RUNNETH OVER WITH BOREDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Searching for some information on the British Open
golf tournament, I called a fellow in England, who quickly turned
the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you Yanks going to get serious about football?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another proselytizer trying to convert an American soccer
heathen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably about the time you Brits develop a cuisine,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   The chat deteriorated, pointing up the most personally annoying
part of the World Cup: the soccer fanatic's insistence on
inflicting his god on those of us who worship rocks, trees and
300-pound offensive linemen (amazing how little difference there is
sometimes between the three. But I digress).
</P>
<P>
   The world is a big place. It has lots of things going on. If
soccer is among those recreations that turns your crank, bully for
you. Far be it from me to deny any man or woman the thrill of
one-nil.
</P>
<P>
   But I reserve the right to say no thanks to the buttonholing,
cajoling, coercion and subversion that occurs every four years when
World Cup fans insist on the event holding as much meaning to me as
them.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude has nothing to do with xenophobia or American
chauvinism. Nor is it a failure to understand the game. Frankly,
there are few sports simpler, which is why it has such wide appeal.
It's also a great sport for kids, who can learn the virtues of team
play without having to be either large or injured a lot.
</P>
<P>
   But as spectator entertainment, well, give me the back of the
cereal box. And please don't try to sell me on last week's
England-Argentina match. Yes, it was close and dramatic. Guess
what? Sports are supposed to be close and dramatic. Don't confuse
closeness with wonderfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Here's four reasons for allowing the rest of the sports world to
continue its party without my valued contribution:
</P>
<P>
   Hands. For anyone raised in America, hands are everything. It's
part of the culture. We like to be handy. We're hands-on kind of
folks. We're often put off by hand-outs, but we can respect a
hands-off boss. We've always lent a hand. But as competitors, we
don't show our hand.
</P>
<P>
   In soccer, only the goalies can use hands, and most of the time
they may as well be clubs for all the dexterity involved in
stopping shots. Any kid who watches Ken Griffey Jr. make a leaping
catch at the wall, or Jerry Rice pluck a pass off the grass or
Michael Jordan strip a ball from Karl Malone, knows that something
is missing in a game where hands are nothing more than penalty
makers. Hey, pro football scouts even grade offensive linemen on
the ability to grab.
</P>
<P>
   Until science creates a foot with an opposable thumb, soccer's
fundamental flaw will prevent persuading kids who want to do more
than shove hands into their jean pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring: I know, this is an old complaint. But it's not just the
lack of scoring, it's what lack of scoring does to the contest.
When the U.S. fell behind 1-0 in their Cup game against Iran, I
swear that every Iranian in the world was standing in the
goal-mouth to prevent a U.S. score. Because scoring is so hard, the
first lead, especially in major international matches, tends to
stick because of defensive paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Ties: If baseball were to condense an entire game to moments of
action, the video would last 10 minutes. For a football game, maybe
15 minutes. Soccer proudly boasts of having more action than
either, but to what end? The tie is often regarded as a good
result. Including qualifying, the Italian team in the Cup played
three 0-0 games and three 1-0 games. Even though soccer has
conceded to overtime periods, many matches still come down to the
shootout, which is as silly and irrelevant a contrivance for
deciding a sports event as ending Game 7 of the NBA Finals with
paper-scissors-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism: Through no fault of the sport, soccer bears the
hopes and fears of entire nations. It can't shed that dubious
baggage, as the French cops have discovered. World Cup results
should have no bearing on national identity except for pride, but
inevitably it makes some people crazy, as we've seen with the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately in this country, since the fall of the Soviet Union
ended the last great international athletic rivalry for the U.S.,
it appears most Americans don't get too worked up anymore (how much
sleep was lost worrying about the meager American medal count in
the Winter Olympics?). We're too busy trying to dominate the world
with computers, airplanes and ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., Cup TV ratings predictably have been wretched.
Telecasts of American matches during the day failed to outpoint the
soap operas they pre-empted. The international matches on ESPN
don't outdraw the X-Games.
</P>
<P>
   But I imagine American basketball, baseball and football
wouldn't get much of an audience in Europe or South America. That's
OK. Even we Yanks have a hard time watching Russ Davis play third
base or Vin Baker shoot free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a private pain, one in which no obligation is felt to
share with the world.

RANGERS ROLL PAST MARINERS, 8-4, AS GONZALEZ REACHES 101 RBI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Hank Greenberg knocked in 103 runs before the
All-Star break in 1935, but the Detroit Tigers' slugger didn't go
to the big game. The two American League first basemen that season
were Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez one-upped Greenberg last night.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit two home runs and drove in four runs to power the
Rangers to an 8-4 victory against the Seattle Mariners at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rangers' right fielder 101 RBI as the All-Star
break begins today. And unlike poor Greenberg, Gonzalez is going to
the big game.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is scheduled to start for the AL tomorrow night in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He heads to the game as a star among the All Stars. RBI records
might not be as scintillating as home-run records; they don't make
for spectacular highlights on ``SportsCenter''.
</P>
<P>
   But what Gonzalez did last night is just as incredible as
anything that Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Sammy Sosa did in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while you have a very special night that comes
along,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``This game's been played a
long time, and not too many guys have driven in 100 runs before the
All-Star break. It's a very special night for Juan Gonzalez, and a
special night for our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   To be exact, now there's two. Greenberg and Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred ribbies before the All-Star break is amazing,''
said Gonzalez, who couldn't stop smiling after the game. ``It is
the best moment in my career, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of the home runs came off Mariners starter Randy Johnson
(7-8). The first, with Roberto Kelly aboard in the first inning,
gave the Rangers a quick lead. The second, with Will Clark on after
a run-scoring double, broke the game open in the seventh inning and
make a winner of reliever Xavier Hernandez (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won their second consecutive game after breaking a
six-game losing streak. They picked up another game on the Anaheim
Angels in the AL West, and go into the break 1 1/2 games out of
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to be in a better position than we are now, but it
could be a lot worse,'' Oates said. ``I said in spring training
nobody's got the pitching to run away with the division. It's going
to be nip and tuck the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, the division race was secondary to Gonzalez's
achievement for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable,'' said Mike Simms, who also hit a
two-run home run off Johnson. ``You have to tip your hat to him,
and shake your head and say wow at the same time. I think everyone
in this clubhouse is looking forward to the second half to see what
kind of numbers he can put up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the second half. The Rangers will try to run down the
Angels, and Gonzalez will take aim at another name from history,
namely Hack Wilson and his record 190 RBI in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is on pace for 188.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``Records aren't easy. The key is
to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he'll have to be content with being the second man with
100 before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe Juan has 101 RBIs,'' Mariners manager Lou
Piniella said. ``It used to be a barometer for a very successful
full season.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez established 100 before the break as a goal when he got
to 96, but then he went through a six-game drought. He broke it
with one Saturday but still needed three yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying,'' he said. ``I never quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he shook his head and smiled some more.
</P>

ELECTIONS IN 3 STATES ARE AN EARLY TEST FOR ZEDILLO'S PARTY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico _ President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party
coasted to victory Sunday in gubernatorial balloting in one
sparsely populated northern state, but more important elections in
two neighboring states were too closely contested to determine a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's voting in Chihuahua, Durango and Zacatecas was viewed
as a crucial early test of opposition chances to defeat Zedillo's
Instititutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, in
presidential balloting two years from now. Despite their
importance, no official results were expected until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountainous state of Durango, the PRI's candidate, Sergio
Guerrero Mier, who is a former federal deputy, was leading
opposition rivals by a margin of 10 percentage points and appeared
headed for victory, according to exit polls reported by the
television networks Televisa and TV Azteca. The opposition vote in
Durango was split among three parties, one of which the PRI has
funded in the past as a way of dividing its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In more closely watched elections to the north in Chihuahua, the
results remained inconclusive late Sunday evening. According to TV
Azteca's exit poll, the PRI enjoyed a small lead there over the
opposition National Action Party, or PAN, which has governed the
state since 1992. But PAN leaders challenged the Azteca report, and
Televisa said this evening that it considered the Chihuahua race
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by official returns, the PRI's victory in Chihuahua
would be important not only because the state, which borders on
western Texas and New Mexico, is one of Mexico's fastest-growing,
but also because the PRI has never before recovered a statehouse
previously lost to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacatecas, a mining center on Durango's southern border, the
leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, was leading in
early returns, according to the Azteca exit poll. But that report,
too, was not conclusive. PRI leaders said their candidate was ahead
in Zacatecas, and Televisa refused to predict a winner there.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has never lost a gubernatorial election in Zacatecas. A
PRD victory there would especially painful for the president's
party because Ricardo Monreal, the PRD's candidate, was one of the
PRI's own top congressional leaders until earlier this year, when
he was passed over for the gubernatorial nomination and defected to
the leftist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the elections in Chihuahua were weighted with the most
symbolic importance because Gov. Francisco Barrio is from the PAN,
and the PRI poured national resources into the state in an attempt
to orchestrate a showcase victory. The Chihuahua elections were the
PRI's only possibility before the 2000 presidential vote to
recapture a statehouse controlled by the opposition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Chihuahua race the two main candidates were Patricio
Martinez, 50, a federal congressman who was mayor of the Chihuahua
state capital from 1992 to 1995, and Ramon Galindo, 41, who stepped
down as the PAN mayor of Juarez earlier this year to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In public opinion polls, Martinez took a strong lead after his
nomination in March, and although Galindo reduced the margin during
the four-month campaign in the surveys, he was never able to pull
past the PRI candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election poll by a Juarez newspaper, Norte, in the
last week of June, said that Martinez was favored by 38 percent of
the voters and that Galindo was favored by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Esther Orozco, 53, an award-winning biologist who
represented the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, was
backed by 7 percent of the voters in Chihuahua, according to the
Norte pre-election poll. Some 14 percent of Chihuahua voters were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has controlled the presidency and most state and local
posts since its founding in 1929 by generals who fought in the
revolution from 1910 to 1917. In many elections since, including
the 1976 presidential vote that Jose Lopez Portillo won, the
party's candidates have run unopposed. Many other victories for the
party have resulted from skullduggery or outright fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari recognized
the first opposition gubernatorial victory, by a PAN candidate in
Baja California, the opposition has won six statehouses, and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist party was elected last year to
be Mayor of the Mexico City Federal District.
</P>
<P>
   The combined votes of five opposition parties constitute a slim
majority in the 500-seat Chamber of Deputies, although they do not
always vote together against the president's party, which has an
outright majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the elections in Chihuahua lies partly in the
central role of that state _ which borders west Texas and is
Mexico's largest in terms of territory _ in the opposition's
15-year struggle to end the governing party's domination.
</P>
<P>
   The election in 1983 of Barrio of the National Action Party as
mayor of Juarez, the state's largest city, helped the PAN that year
to make the opposition's first broad inroads against the governing
party's power in several northern states. Three years later, in
1986, when Barrio made his first run for governor, authorities from
the governing party gave the victory to his opponent from their
party, ignoring accusations of fraud lodged by international
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrio led a hunger strike, and hundreds of followers carried
out months of protests across Chihuahua, at one point shutting down
the international bridge linking Juarez and El Paso. When Barrio
ran again in 1992, Salinas recognized his victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters credited Barrio Sunday with improving public
administration in Chihuahua in his six-year term, which ends this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PAN has carried on a great war against corruption in
Chihuahua,'' said Gonzalo Solis, a mathematics professor at a local
university here, who said he voted for Galindo.
</P>
<P>
   But a civil engineer, Jorge Soto, said he cast his vote for the
governing party, faulting Barrio for allowing crime to run out of
control.

ANDREW CROFT, 91, BRITISH EXPLORER AND MILITARY CONSULTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. Andrew Croft, a British explorer of the frozen north who
became an expert on winter warfare during World War II and made his
expertise available to the U.S. Army during the Korean War, died
June 26. He was 91 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   Croft, an Oxford graduate who was an Anglican clergyman's son,
chose a life with more than its share of faraway places and
derring-do after spending a troubling year on the European
Continent between the World Wars.
</P>
<P>
   After trying his hand at the cotton trade, he went to the
Continent to learn German and French because he was thinking of
becoming a schoolteacher. But then, as The Daily Telegraph put it,
``Croft's observation of the rise of Nazism convinced him of the
inevitability of war and disinclined him to settle into a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Croft, then a civilian, became one of three members of the
British Trans-Greenland Expedition in 1934. It was led by Lt.
Martin Lindsay of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Croft was the
expedition's principal dog driver and photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was to explore the western side of the unknown
mountains which extend for 350 miles between Scoresby Sound and
Mount Forel,'' Croft wrote in his book ``Polar Exploration'' The
second edition was published in 1947; the first edition came out in
1939. ``Lindsay determined to approach the mountains from the
west,'' he wrote. ``This meant a long journey across the ice cap
before the objective could be reached. The plan had the additional
attraction, however, that the height of this part of the ice cap
was then unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Croft went to Jakobshavn, on Greenland's west coast, late in
1933. There, as he wrote, his ``main tasks were to select the best
43 sled dogs and learn how to drive them; to choose an overland
route up on to the edge of the icecap; and to lay a depot there of
about two tons of dog-food.'' Doing those preliminary tasks, he
traveled 3,000 miles by sled in the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
   After some delay, the three explorers set out on their
expedition in June 1934. But, he wrote: ``Two days before the
journey began, there was a violent storm. In 36 hours, all the snow
in sight was washed away, exposing crevassed ice-ridges and filling
the intervening valleys with ice-cold slush.''
</P>
<P>
   The expedition managed to cross Greenland, traveling 1,O80 miles
from west to east, in 15 weeks, setting a record for a
self-sustaining journey by dog sled.
</P>
<P>
   Croft was aide-de-camp to the young Maharajah of Cooch Behar in
India in 1934 and 1935 before becoming the second in command of the
10-member Oxford University Arctic Expedition to North-East Land,
which did research in fields including glaciology on
Nordaustlandet, an icy, 5,710 square mile Norwegian island in the
Arctic Ocean's Barents Sea in 1935 and 1936. He was also the
expedition's photographer and in charge of its sled dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The greater part of the island ``is covered by icecap which is
gradually retreating and exposing more land,'' Croft wrote in
``Polar Exploration.'' ``The only reliable way of studying this
glacial retreat was to carry out a series of observations on the
icecap over as long a period as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1935 the expedition's base hut was built below
a rocky headland on the island's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such problems, Croft wrote, the expedition made valuable
contributions to knowledge of the island and in addition, ``an
extensive scientific program was accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined the British army when World War II began and went on
to be an intelligence officer in Norway and a military attache in
Sweden. He also helped gather data about floating ice to provide to
Allied convoys bound for the Soviet Union. He remained in uniform
after the war and put his expertise at the disposal of the U.S.
Army as a liaison officer in Washington in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Rosalind, died in 1996. He is survived by their three
daughters.

JOHN PRESCOTT, 63, EX-DIRECTOR OF NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Ariz.)  (lh) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John H. Prescott, a marine biologist who directed the New
England Aquarium in Boston for 22 years and was among the first to
describe how dolphins use sound waves to find food, died June 30 at
his home in Weston, Mass. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Prescott studied how dolphins navigate and
described the way they send out high-frequency sonic pulses and
then focus the returning signals inside a football-shaped region of
their foreheads. The technique is so precise, he said, that a
blindfolded dolphin can distinguish between different shapes of
toys in the water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Prescott became the executive director of the New
England Aquarium, which he described at the time as simply a
tourist attraction on the Boston waterfront, ``like a postage stamp
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescott introduced rigorous marine science to the aquarium and
developed research and education programs of international stature,
said Scott Kraus, the aquarium's director of research. It soon
became a model for other aquariums around the world, and it is now
widely considered one of the top institutions of its kind in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1994, Prescott retired and set up the Prescott Group
for consulting on conservation and aquarium development. He joined
the team of scientists that converted the sealed areas of Biosphere
2, near Tucson, Ariz., into public spaces for educational exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott was also an outspoken advocate of the conservation of
large whale and other marine populations, Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
   At the aquarium, Prescott established one of the first marine
animal rescue programs. He assembled a team of veterinarians to
care for whales, sea turtles and other creatures and prepare them
for return to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   An episode of the public television series ``Nova'' in 1988
documented the work of Prescott's team at the aquarium in caring
for three whale calves who survived after 27 pilot whales had died
on the beaches of Cape Cod in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott developed theories to explain why whales sometimes
beach themselves and die. He found that pilot whales, which grow to
22 feet, are highly communal, with ``a cohesive social structure''
that works as a survival strategy at sea but can become a fatal
flaw. For example, he found, when one whale becomes disoriented in
a storm, others will follow it onto a beach.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott was born in Corona, Calif., and received his bachelor's
degree in zoology at the University of California at Los Angeles in
1957. He went on to do graduate work at the University of Southern
California and at the Harvard Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   He was assistant curator of fishes and general manager of
operations at Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, Calif.,
before joining the New England Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott was chairman of the committee of scientific advisers to
the United States Marine Mammal Commission and head of the National
Humpback Whale Recovery Team. He was also a director of the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria and wrote
scientific papers about whales, seals, porpoises, dolphins and
fishes.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Sandra Baker Prescott; a brother,
William Prescott of Forest Falls, Calif.; two sons, Craig Prescott
Oakes of Tucson, Ariz., and Blane Prescott of Los Angeles; two
stepsons, William B. Marsh of Cambridge, Mass., and John B. Marsh
of Boston, and one grandson.

RANGERS BOMBARD JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ At their current pace, the Mariners will
finish last in the American League West, lead the majors in errors
and possibly blown saves, and rank right up there in make-overs.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman David Segui recently bleached his hair blond.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Ken Griffey Jr. went bald.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the Mariner center fielder is going to the All-Star Game in
Denver as a Barry Bonds look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't a guy get a haircut?'' Griffey asked after the Mariners
stumbled into the three-day All-Star break with an 8-4 loss to the
Texas Rangers before 38,053 fans at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The series finale featured two home runs by Juan Gonzalez, who
drove in four runs and became only the second player in major
league history to drive in more than 100 runs before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has 101 RBIs, two fewer than Hank Greenberg in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that 100 RBIs was a very successful season,''
Mariner manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is threatening to break Hack Wilson's single-season
record. Wilson drove in 190 runs for the Chicago Cubs in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The M's are threatening to go from first to last in the AL West
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a couple of opportunities here to pick up some
ground,'' said Piniella, whose defending division champions lost
the final two games of the three-game series after reeling off
three straight wins. They still trail first-place Anaheim, losers
of five straight, by 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Griffey's new look took away some of the focus
from another so-so start by Randy Johnson. The left-hander looked
good at times, striking out 12 Rangers, but only ordinary at
others.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine hits he surrendered were Gonzalez home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranger run-producing machine socked his 25th homer of the
season in the first inning with Roberto Kelly aboard on a single,
and capped a game-clinching three-run Texas rally in the seventh
with his 26th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Randy pitched better than the final score would
indicate,'' Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``It wasn't
up to par with the game he pitched in San Diego (Johnson's seventh
and last win), but he got hurt (Sunday night) with some bloopers
that fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's worst season in years continues with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Good at times. Bad at times.
</P>
<P>
   He has struck out 12 batters in each of his past four starts,
but the eight runs Johnson surrendered were the most he has allowed
in one game since June 16, 1995 against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have dealt Johnson two of his eight losses this
season, scoring 14 earned runs in 11 innings. Gonzalez became the
second player this season and sixth overall to hit two homers off
Johnson in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Johnson) had stretches when he threw the ball good,''
Piniella said, ``and stretches when he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He struck out the side in the third inning. The fourth inning
began with Ivan Rodriguez's double and opposite-field homer to
right by Mike Simms, giving Texas a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners retaliated in the fifth, wiping out the three-run
deficit on RBI singles by Alex Rodriguez and Griffey and a
bases-loaded walk to Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But reliever Xavier Hernandez, who walked Martinez, kept Seattle
from going ahead by retiring Glenallen Hill on a first-pitch pop-up
to Ranger catcher Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners put the potential go-ahead runner on second base in
the sixth inning when Rico Rossy, replacing Russ Davis at third
base, singled and advanced on Joey Cora's groundout. Alex Rodriguez
fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   Rossy drew solid reviews for his defense, handling four chances
crisply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has good hands and did a nice job over there,''
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who went into the series finale with 35 homers and a
.297 batting average, walked his first two times, singled in the
fifth to get his average to .299 and then lined out to right field
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   And then he got a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks great, man,'' bald teammate Jay Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey showed off his new look to his wife, Melissa, standing
outside the visiting clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks just like Barry (Bonds),'' she said. ``I might get
mine bleached.''

RED SOX SURVIVE WILD RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ No one hands out prizes after a game like this. They
just count survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team gets a purple heart,'' Jim Corsi said after the Red
Sox held on for a 15-14 win over the Chicago White Sox Sunday at
Fenway Park. ``The bullpen gets an F.''
</P>
<P>
   And manager Jimy Williams dodges a bullet. That's why he gladly
welcomed the All-Star break after the Red Sox took a 9-2 lead after
three innings and 11-3 after five, gave it all back during
Chicago's eight-run sixth, surged ahead again, 15-11, in the
seventh, and withstood a three-run home run by designated villain
Wilfredo Cordero off Tom Gordon in the eighth, the first home run
allowed by the All-Star closer this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After today's game,'' said Williams, who went through seven
pitchers and an untold number of antacid pills, ``we probably need
three days. I think we all do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who had 20 hits for the second time in three days,
batted around in both the second and third innings to take a 9-2
lead against Jaime Navarro, Chicago's purported ace. Navarro was so
undone by Mike Benjamin's first home run in more than two years,
which came two pitches after Scott Hatteberg went deep with John
Valentin aboard, that afterward he said he was thinking of either
giving up his job or demanding to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, may have mentally begun loading their
golf clubs and fishing reels onto their getaway flights, because
instead of coasting into the break, they were forced to hang on for
dear life.
</P>
<P>
   With an eight-run lead entering the sixth, Williams dismissed
starter Steve Avery, who was more artful with his glove, especially
when he nabbed Mike Cameron's bunt in the second and snared Frank
Thomas's liner in the fourth, than he was with his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Dario Veras, two weeks removed from the trade that
brought him and fellow reliever Carlos Reyes from San Diego for Jim
Leyritz, walked Magglio Ordonez to begin the stint and failed to
retire the next four batters that followed, going walk, double,
walk, bloop single, and two-run double by Ray Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an eight-run lead and start walking people,
walks, hits, clunk a couple, hit a couple real hard, things can
happen,'' Williams said. ``Eight-run lead, it's not real healthy to
start walking people.''
</P>
<P>
   Adios, Dario. In came Corsi, who got two fly balls around a walk
to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought after we got a couple of outs there and had a lefty
(Ron Mahay) going against a lefty (Robin Ventura) we were in a good
spot,'' Corsi said, ``but the spit was just starting to hit the
fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see that happen maybe five or six times a year. The
bullpen is like a tourniquet, trying to stop the bleeding, but
sometimes no matter what you do, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura doubled off Mahay to make it 11-8. Mahay out, Derek Lowe
in.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe hit Ordonez with a 3-and-2 pitch, dropped a feed from first
baseman Benjamin for a two-run error, then uncorked a wild pitch to
tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressive, wasn't it?'' said Lowe, who also had to cope with
a sore-headed Ordonez seeking to mix it up with him after crossing
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That led to words from Hatteberg (amateur lip readers detected
the Sox catcher addressing Ordonez with ``Frost you, you piece of
cake,'' or words to that effect), provoking Cordero to run in from
second and apply a shove to his former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   That emptied both benches and the bullpens, but Hatteberg
elected not to escalate the proceedings. ``I looked at him, it was
Cordero,'' he said. ``What was I going to say? There's nothing
between us. He's a friend of mine. He told (first-base coach Dave)
Jauss later in the game that he wasn't trying to bump me so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But there would be one more bump from Cordero, even after the
Red Sox regained the lead with a seventh-inning rally that began
with Troy O'Leary's double, one of his four hits and six line
drives (two were caught), continued with Valentin's tie-breaking
single and Darren Lewis's two-run double, and ended with Darren
Bragg's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who hadn't pitched in five days, replaced pitcher No. 6,
Carlos Reyes, who had breezed through the seventh but gave up a
single to Thomas and walked Albert Belle to start the eighth.
Gordon immediately coaxed a double-play ball out of Ventura, but
walked Ordonez and watched Cordero crank one off the speakers on
the light stanchion in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Williams had sent one of his starters, Tim Wakefield,
to the pen, just in case. Not to worry. Despite walking the next
batter, Cameron, Gordon ended the eighth by striking out Chad
Kreuter, and set down the White Sox in order in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas flied to center fielder Lewis to end the game,
Hatteberg was seeing his 190th pitch of the game, which is two more
than his Chicago counterpart, Kreuter, saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, man, I'm dead tired,'' Hatteberg said. ``That eight-run
inning, it's a blur.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in the haze, there was still a win. ``Just another
one-run win, I guess,'' Williams said. ``We could have caved in,
but we didn't.''

 WOMEN'S OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ It was 45 feet perhaps, maybe longer. Jenny
Chuasiriporn, perhaps too young to realize what she was about to
do, only wanted to know one thing before putting: ``Joey, tell me a
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother/caddie didn't hesitate. ``Foot left.'' And as his
sister settled over the putt, Joey added: ``Give it a good run.''
In other words, said Jenny, ``he didn't want me to leave it
short.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball rolled over a small hill in the 18th green at Blackwolf
Run and as it picked up steam, it kept its line. Fifteen feet from
the hole, Chuasiriporn could not believe what she was seeing. ``My
eyes popped out.'' The ball dropped and Chuasiriporn, having shot a
1-over 72, put her hand over her mouth, stunned, almost
embarrassed, her youthful innocence shining through. ``I was really
thinking two-putt from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the incredible birdie putt left us with this most
improbable scenario _  &UR; today &LR;  at noon a 20-year-old amateur who
made up a four-shot deficit on the final day will play off over 18
holes for the US Women's Open championship against a 20-year-old
professional from South Korea, Se Ri Pak, who missed an 8-foot
birdie attempt after Chuasiriporn's dramatics and settled for
76-_290.
</P>
<P>
   It figures that a couple of kids will stick around and play a
course that simply beat up the finest women golfers in the world.
It's the first time since 1984 that the winning score was over par,
and the highest winning score since 1983, when 6-over also won.
Over the final 36 holes here, only one player posted a sub-par
round.
</P>
<P>
   The money already may have been decided (as an amateur,
Chuasiriporn can't be paid, so Pak will get the top prize of
$267,500), but both young women have their sights set on making
history. Only one amateur (Catherine LaCoste, 1967) has won the
women's national championship, and regardless of who prevails
Monday, she will be the youngest champion in the history of this
event.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have imagined such an ending, but as this US
Women's Open played out on a near impossible course, it became
apparent that anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Pak started the day a shot ahead of Mhairi McKay, a 23-year-old
from Scotland who was playing her first US Women's Open, and
Liselotte Neumann, the 32-year-old Swede who won this event in
1988. The wind, which had hammered the field Saturday, was less a
factor, though birdies remained but a whisper at this 6,412-yard
layout. Pak would make just one, as would McKay, while Neumann
didn't make any. Chuasiriporn made two, most memorable the one at
18, but in a US Open, where pars are as a valuable as Bill Gates's
portfolio, it was her steady par-35 on the front that got her a
share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   She needed help, of course, which first Pak, then McKay
provided.
</P>
<P>
   At the 402-yard, par-4 third, Pak pulled her drive into the
rough and committed an Open sin: She tried to pound a long shot out
of it. ``I hit 5-iron,'' she said. ``A mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot went even farther left into grass that was up to her
knees. She slashed it out, but ended up with a double bogey, tied
with McKay at 3-over.
</P>
<P>
   McKay, paired with Pak, parred the par-4 fourth and found
herself in the lead when Pak missed the green and made bogey. But
her Open spotlight was about to be buried in a greenside bunker the
size of Seagull Beach. It's where her approach to the par-4 seventh
landed, and though she learned her game over the holy ground of
Turnberry, this difficult shot proved too much. McKay took three
shots to get out, made a 7 and fell from the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Duke senior, Chuasiriporn, who about that same time
was curling in a 20-footer at the par-3 eighth to go back to
5-over. She was tied with Pak and Neumann, but not for long. Pak,
from thick rough, made another mistake at the par-4 ninth, electing
to go for a green guarded by water. ``I was thinking lay up, then I
said, OK, I go.'' She went, all right, directly into the water and
fell to 6-over, a shot behind.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, as she had done Saturday, too, picked up a rash of
bogeys (Nos. 7, 11, 12), and fell two behind Chuasiriporn, who was
ripping off six straight pars, the type of play that is usually
reserved for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have too many expectations,'' said
Chuasiriporn. ``I really just went out there just trying to hit a
lot of fairways and greens.''
</P>
<P>
   She followed that strategy pretty well, until 15 when she drove
it left into a fairway bunker. It led to just her second bogey of
the day. But it came at about the same time as Pak was making her
only birdie of the afternoon, a 7-footer at the 14th. The powerful
Pak, who stormed into prominence with her triumph in the LPGA
Championship two months ago, was back in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Chuasiriporn pushed her tee ball on the par-3 17th over a
mound into thick rough and made bogey, Pak had a two-shot lead and
seemed assured of being the first since Juli Inkster in 1984 to win
two majors in her rookie season. But golf can take as quickly as it
gives, and Pak put her tee shot on the 17th almost exactly where
Chuasiriporn did. She, too, made bogey, which grew more significant
by the festivities going on up on the 18th green at about the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, a Baltimore native whose parents are from
Thailand, thought her birdie bomb had given her second place, that
she was two shots behind. ``What is she, at how many over?'' she
asked at the scorer's tent. Told that she was tied for the lead,
Chuasiriporn nearly lost it. ``I just kind of turned to my brother
and he was just delighted, almost in tears, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tears flowed even more moments later when Pak, having
nestled her approach to about 8 feet of the 18th pin, missed the
birdie putt that would have won it. Instead, she missed it right,
meaning two youngsters will get another crack at a course that many
veterans probably would never like to see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Chuasiriporn said, standing
amid a group of USGA people who probably were trying to make sense
of it all, too.

SAMPRAS SEIZES GRAIL _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was the third coming of Goran the Croat. Seeming a
bearded Biblical holy man calling down thunderbolts on his enemies,
enspiriting his flock, preaching life after defeat ... he
nevertheless wound up in the wilderness again.
</P>
<P>
   This time his people, most of Sunday's multitude of 13,120 in
the tennis shrine called Centre Court, looked into his mesmerizing
chestnut eyes and believed. They believed he would be forgiven the
sins of his two previous comings to the Wimbledon final: 1992,
flesh turning weak in the fifth set, wilting before Andre Agassi;
and 1994's faint-hearted drubbing by the philistine Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   But this was surely to be the day of atonement for Goran
Ivanisevic. In his Italian-tailored loincloth, swinging a
lightning-spurting crozier, he was smiting Sampras mightily,
pushing the King of Grassland into a fifth-set corner. Having risen
from the dead-end season he'd been enduring, Goran the Croat was in
a ``seek and ye shall find'' mood.
</P>
<P>
   He came, he sought _ and he found hellfire yet smoldering within
Sampras. Ivanisevic got burned, 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6,
6-2, and his flock wailed and tore their hair.
</P>
<P>
   A notable hair-tearer for Ivanisevic all right, one that plunged
him into the abyss of despair:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only kill myself. It will be too much to come back
again. This was my worst moment. I gave everything to win the
fourth set, but then it was like somebody hit me. I went down, he
went up. But my legs ... my legs were tired. I couldn't get to the
net like I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But his resurrection to respectability really had foundered long
before. Sampras twice stood on the brink of a two-set pit at 5-6
and 7-8 in the second-set tie-breaker, naked to Goran the Croat.
The King of Grassland had nothing more to offer than second serves
that stood up like masochists, begging to be flagellated.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic obliged by lashing them ... but into the net, and
would recall them as damning his chances for salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete didn't play well,'' he said. ``This was my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This was also what once more confirmed Sampras's greatness.
Winning when the temperature of The Heater (as he calls his best
friend, his serve) drops severely, his forehand looks docile and
his head droops like a yo-yo is the quality that makes him an
all-time champion. Winning ragged because his heart wouldn't let
him lose, because his pride in possession of the prize among prizes
_ Wimbledon _ was a shield against all the thunderbolts that Goran
the Croat hurled. That sets Sampras apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place does something for me,'' Sampras says. ``I can
reach down and find something extra here.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before in 13 major finals had he been pinched in a fifth
set, but he reached and found. His record in fifth-set crucibles
tells you much about the champion: 26-9 career; 4-0 at the Big W.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different, the fifth, new,'' he said. ``You don't want
to make a mistake.'' He didn't, summoning the necessary service
returns. His miserly three unforced errors in the ultimate set (19
for the match) said that though his majesty was missing, he was
defending the crown zealously. Calmly, patiently, he let Ivanisevic
make the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Becker, thrice the king, used to say there was something
mystical about the somber forest green ampitheatre where they're
crowned. He felt inspirational tremors running through him as he
entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nothing like that,'' the undramatic Sampras said with a
shake of his head. ``But it's a special place.'' Sampras's place.
His magical garden.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is becoming a man for the ages, though merely 27 next
month. He doesn't recall meeting Laurie Doherty or Willie Renshaw.
Maybe in the next life. But he does know Bjorn Borg, who 18 years
ago became the third man to bring Wimbledon to its grass-stained
knees on five occasions. And Sampras makes four in the tournament's
112 years.
</P>
<P>
   Britons Doherty and Renshaw may have jiggled in their tombs.
Doherty won five titles between 1902 and 1906 and Renshaw the
rec-ord seven between 1881 and 1889, a simpler time when it was
virtually a British intramural affair. No barbarians from America
or Croatia butted it.
</P>
<P>
   None of those guys, however, is safe from Sampras the Stalker.
He's sneaking up on 61-year-old Roy Emerson, whose record for major
titles _ a dozen _ has been inviolate for 31 years. Sampras has 11
now, and Ivanisevic doesn't own the one he might have had by
flogging those tie-breaker returns properly.
</P>
<P>
   But Goran the Croat made Sampras play, made his loud and hopeful
flock pray _ and made the day for a championship that seldom goes
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goran was terrific,'' says Sampras. ``But only one name can go
on the trophy ... there's nothing I could say to make him feel
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The third coming has come and gone. Sampras is this much of a
believer: he thinks there will be a fourth. ``Goran will win this
someday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Goran the Croat, anguishing about that second set
tie-breaker, will pace and curse despondently in the wilderness,
wearing the requisite hairshirt. But at least one from his Italian
tailor.

<P>
   FITCHBURG, Mass. _ Granted, this city is not known for being a
party place, but it's a fair bet that there was a lot of
celebrating going on Sunday night after the four-day
Fitchburg-Longsjo Classic bike race. Especially for riders on the
Wisconsin-based Saturn team.
</P>
<P>
   That team's Frank McCormack, of Leicester, won the men's overall
race, covering 243.5 miles in 9 hours 22 minutes 34 seconds. On the
women's side, Dede Demet of Boulder, raced the 127 miles in
6:04:23. To top it off, Karen Bliss Livington, also of the Saturn
team, won the women's 25-mile stage Sunday. (The Saturn victories
ended there, as Czeslaw Lukascewcicz of the Canadian Club Cycliste
Espoir won the men's 49.5-mile stage).
</P>
<P>
   But McCormack, 29, insisted that the celebrations would be
low-key.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think things will be real quiet tonight,'' he said,
indicating that his mom and dad from Plymouth, along with brothers
Shawn and Mark, would be headed home after being houseguests for
the past four days. ``So we'll take it easy tonight and go to the
beach tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing McCormack on the podium with the winner's jersey was a
familiar sight to fans of the 39-year-old Fitchburg race _ he won
it once before in 1994. But back then he wasn't affiliated with a
national team (nor did he have the twin 3-year-old sons he held on
the podium). So the victory then was what he thinks was his ``big
stepping stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year the Saturn team signed him up, and the following
year he went on to win the National Criterium race, something he
repeated the next year. He's kept on the winning track with an
overall victory in the Tour of Japan in May.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's race, McCormack was wearing the leader's
jersey after Saturday's 103-mile circuit race at Wachusett
Mountain, and was in front of Trent Klasna by 14 seconds, which is
seemingly not a lot. But in Sunday's race, which covered 55 laps of
the 9/10ths-of-a-mile course that circled downtown Fitchburg, all
McCormack had to do was stay with the main pack to retain his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Knickman and Danny Pate bolted in front of the pack of 116
riders with more than 40 laps to go, and built a lead of more than
a minute on the pack. But no one, including McCormack, seemed too
concerned. Knickman, after all, sat at more than 8 minutes back in
the overall classification, so even though he lapped the field, he
was really no threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be patient and not go after every break,''
McCormack said. He acknowledged, though, that he also couldn't
afford to get too complacent. ``Yeah, I'd be sitting back in the
pack, and Brian (Walton) would come get me,'' he said, referring to
his teammate and third-place overall finisher.
</P>
<P>
   So McCormack and his teammates rode not to win, but just to
place, and let the guys in front knock themselves out in the
82-degree weather. Knickman ended up with the sprinter's prize and
$560 in ``primes,'' or lap prizes, but McCormack walked away with
the gold medal and $1,300. Brother Mark finished seventh overall,
while Shawn placed 66th.
</P>
<P>
   Demet held on to her overall lead by staying with her teammates
in the final sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two turns to go on the final lap, I just didn't have the
legs,'' she said. ``But luckily, Karen did.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument from winner Bliss Livingston. ``I just really
punched it with 200 meters to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she got the stage win, and Demet the overall win and $400.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn team must have slept well Sunday night.

    DEATH TOLL REACHES FIVE IN TACOMA BAR SHOOTINGS
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS, RUTH TEICHROEB AND RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Five people were killed and six others were
wounded early Sunday when three gunmen walked into a karaoke bar
and blasted away at employees and customers in this city's worst
multiple homicide in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have no suspects but hinted that the slayings
at the Trang Dai Cafe in the Lincoln business district of south
Tacoma could have been gang-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're speculating it was gang-related because of the type of
shooting,'' said police spokesman Jim Mattheis. ``It wasn't a
robbery. They didn't say anything and didn't take anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar, one of several Southeast Asian businesses in the
neighborhood, was targeted in a drive-by shooting June 28. No one
was injured in that incident. Police said they don't know whether
it was related to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Police also had an ongoing investigation of the bar at South
38th Street and South Yakima Avenue because of ``criminal
activities,'' Mattheis said, but would provide no details.
Residents of the neighborhood yesterday said the bar had a
reputation for drug activity and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were identified as Tuong Hung Do, 33, Duy Le, 24, and
Tuyen Vo of Tacoma, a 21-year-old waitress at the bar. All three
were from Tacoma. Names of two other victims were not available
last night.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wounded was in critical condition last night at
Madigan Army Hospital at Fort Lewis, and was not expected to
survive. The other four were taken to Tacoma General Hospital and
St. Joseph Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   A woman was treated for minor injuries at St. Joseph Medical
Center and released, while Pat Nguyen, 40, the owner of the bar,
was treated for a gunshot wound to his upper body and released.
</P>
<P>
   At Tacoma General, 28-year-old Hoai Nguyen was in satisfactory
condition last night after undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound
to his left shoulder. Another man was released after being treated
for a bullet wound to his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the gunmen _ at least one carrying a semiautomatic
rifle _ walked in through the front doors of the bar and opened
fire on about 16 employees and customers about 1:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dark. There was no way the victims knew something was
coming,'' Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   The only light in the one-room bar was a disco ball and black
lights, he said. The ball was still spinning slowly as Pierce
County medical examiners removed the last three bodies from the bar
about 16 hours after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The intruders rapidly pumped off dozens of rounds, spraying the
entire interior of the bar. Police said they did not appear to
target anyone in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen continued firing as they backed out the front door
moments later.
</P>
<P>
   They fired several more times through the one-story building's
thin wooden walls as they hurried down a side alley to the back of
the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the three men fled in a waiting car.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, and I thought it was
fireworks,'' said Charlene Armstrong, who lives on the corner south
of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a car skidding by.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who has lived in the neighborhood since April, said
it is usually a quiet area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids run around all the time,'' Armstrong said. ``This
surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived about 1:45 a.m., four people were dead. One
body lay under a table near the front door. Two others were by
booths at the side of the room, and a fourth lay by the back door.
</P>
<P>
   Things were calm by the time police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was inside the building and kind of wandering around
in shock,'' Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in the bar was armed, none had a chance to shoot back,
Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings stunned Lincoln business district residents and
merchants. They said there have been occasional problems in the
area, but nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   Police interviewed four of the shooting victims but would not
reveal what they said. Police also are reviewing a security
videotape they obtained from a nearby business.
</P>
<P>
   Police pleaded for the public's help in catching the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take someone to come forward,'' Mattheis said.
``This is a close-knit community. It's going to take somebody to
put their fears aside and come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brian Ebersole said yesterday that he hoped the slayings
would not taint the city's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is unprecedented,'' he said. ``It could have
happened anywhere in America. Unfortunately, it happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersole, who once lived in the neighborhood, said it has not
been plagued by any more problems than other
</P>
<P>
   areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragic day for the city of Tacoma, and for the
Vietnamese community,'' Ebersole said. ``This is an aberration.
We'll work through this and will continue to make this a safe
community.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that Tacoma has about 2,500 residents of Vietnamese
descent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 residents of the neighborhood _ most Vietnamese
American _ crowded the sidewalk across the street from the bar
yesterday after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Some came hoping to learn the whereabouts of relatives they
believed were in the bar when the shootings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jimmy Win, whose cousin Vo waitressed at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Vo didn't come home after work and her car was still parked in
front of the bar yesterday afternoon, Win said before he learned of
her death.
</P>
<P>
   Win said he heard about the June 28 drive-by shooting right
after it happened and came looking for Vo because he was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard they had some trouble with a couple of people, a
couple of weeks before the drive-by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tien Nguyen said he came to the scene looking for his
brother-in-law, Huynh Khanh, who was at the bar Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Khanh, 28, worked at the bar, playing the karaoke music for
customers, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for my brother-in-law,'' he said shakily. ``I
heard about all this on TV this morning. He didn't come home last
night and I'm worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuan Nguyen was in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   He was looking for his brother, Tung Nguyen, 23, an Alaskan
fisherman who had gone into the bar as a customer Saturday night,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Khanh nor Tung Nguyen had turned up by late last night.
</P>
<P>
   Pira Chap, 21, who often eats at a nearby restaurant, said the
Trang Dai is known as a gang hangout.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattheis would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some interest in this because of some criminal
activity, but I wouldn't call it a gang hangout,'' Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald O'Donnell, manager of Lincoln Bowl across the street and
two doors down from the bar, said the community and police had
worked together to reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame for the neighborhood,'' O'Donnell said.
``This area, as far as I'm concerned, in the last several years is
on an upswing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bowling alley was closed Saturday because of July Fourth.

<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Olin Browne's golfing dreams began when he was
19, working a summer in the bag room at New Seabury on Cape Cod.
The road became a long and twisting one, leading him through the
mini tours in Florida, the Hogan and Nike Tours, until his moment
in the sun finally came 20 years later in the most dramatic of
fashions in Sunsday's final round of the Greater Hartford Open at
the TPC at River Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   As defender Stewart Cink and Larry Mize watched from the green,
Browne lofted a sand wedge from the side of the green and watched
it roll into the cup for a birdie on the first hole of a playoff.
When Cink (67_266) missed his uphill putt from 12 feet beneath the
pin, Browne (67) had come full circle in the game to earn his first
PGA Tour victory. Mize (69) already had played his third stroke at
the end of an afternoon that saw him sitting on a four-stroke lead
as he approached the 15th tee.
</P>
<P>
   It was there he unraveled, opting to strike a 5-iron from the
tee on the par 4 296-yard hole. When it slid right and into the
trees, he ended up returning to the tee and hitting the same 5-iron
into the fairway but ended up with a 6. After Mize missed a putt
from inside 2 feet on the next hole, the heat had been turned on
full blast. Mize still could have won it, but he hit a 4-iron
second shot over the 18th green, left his third short, and missed.
They returned to the 18th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may say 15 was the key hole, but I still could have won
the golf tournament,'' said Mize. ``I made a silly mistake on 18. I
know better. I had 189 yards to the hole. The wind's in our face.
The 4 is probably perfect under normal conditions. Maybe at the end
of the day my brain's not working right. I know better. You can hit
it over the green real easy. We talk. I never blame the caddie. I'm
the boss. I still pull the club. I'm the final decision. I hit the
shot I needed to hit. I pulled the wrong club.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink, who was at 12-under when he left the 15th tee and Mize
18-under, played the final seven holes 4-under par. ``Honestly,
when I finished 17 I didn't think I had a chance at a playoff,''
said Cink. ``Someone said Larry bogeyed 16, and after that I knew
that 17 and 18 were difficult into the wind. I gave myself a chance
for a birdie. I had hit a good 3-iron into the green. I had the
putt going straight and a little left. I know now it's a little
slower than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, whose chances seemed dashed when his tee shot on the
par-4 10th went into the trees to the left and said he ``had no
shot,'' ended up with a 6 to drop out of a share of the lead. He
birdied the par-5 13th out of a bunker and the 16th when he struck
a 7-iron to 8 feet. He ended up with virtually the same shot he had
in the playoff on the 18th and nearly holed it. ``I had to ease it
up over a hump,'' said Browne. ``It bent a little more. This was
more uphill and less left to right. As a result of where I chipped
from earlier, I had a good idea what it was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne's best previous finish was a tie for fourth in Tucson
seven years ago but he gained a dose of confidence when he finished
tied for fifth in the US Open last year at Congressional. ``I'm not
sure I'll know how it feels until tomorrow or later,'' he said.
``I'm obviously exceedingly pleased and excited at the moment.''
The chip? ``It looked good, then it hit the pin and dropped. A
magical moment.'' This was a moment that rewarded all the work and
desire to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game teaches you resilience and it teaches you to accept
defeat,'' said Browne. ``It's a hard thing for an athlete to do. If
you hit one great shot, you have 10 mediocre shots and five
horrible ones. The learning process is so demanding, and the
learning curve is so extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Through 20 sometimes struggling years, Browne learned well.

   Alexander P. Waugh, a retired judge of Superior Court of New
Jersey, died June 21 at his home in Chatham, N.J. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh sat on the court from 1956 to 1972, hearing Essex County
cases until 1965, and from then until his retirement serving as
assignment judge for Morris, Sussex and Warren counties.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Caldwell, N.J., he received his bachelor's degree
from Columbia College in 1939, nine years after earning his law
degree at what is now Rutgers Law School in Newark, N.J. A
Republican, he served as a state assemblyman in the early 1930s and
as a municipal judge in Verona, N.J., from 1937 to 1940.
</P>
<P>
   He was mayor of Verona in 1942 when he resigned to enter the
U.S. Navy. He served in the Pacific and was discharged as a
lieutenant in 1945 but continued to serve in the Naval Reserve,
reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gov. Robert Meyner appointed him to Superior Court, he

   Caleb Sampson, a composer for films and an unusual band called
the Alloy Orchestra, who also wrote music for silent films, died
June 8 at Cambridge City Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 45 and
lived in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   He committed suicide, said his wife, Kathleen Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   Using metallic junk like bedpans and truck springs for
percussion instruments, as well as keyboards and synthesizer, the
Alloy Orchestra played for six years at many international film
festivals, creating vivid, humorous music for silent film classics
like ``Nosferatu,'' ``Metropolis'' and ``Steamboat Bill Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson had written music for filmmaker Errol Morris. He
provided the soundtrack for Morris' 1997 film ``Fast, Cheap and Out
of Control.'' He had also composed music for many independent
filmmakers and animators, as well as for ``Sesame Street'' and some
HBO television specials.

   Maurice Sorrell, a photographer who covered the height of the
civil rights era in the South and became the first black member of
the White House Photographers Association, died June 22 at
Providence Hospital in Washington. He was 84 and lived in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell was a news photographer in the Washington bureau of
Johnson Publishing Co., which publishes Jet and Ebony magazines,
from 1962 until he retired in 1993. He photographed civil rights
events in the 1960s despite ``dogs snipping at my heels, tear gas,
bayonets at the back,'' he once recalled in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the White House Photographers Association in 1961
after some trouble working with other White House photographers. As
he recalled: ``They had a little thing where they would get arm in
arm and try to push me back. Once they found out that I could shoot
as well as they could, they accepted me.''
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering in Sorrell's honor in 1997, a letter from
President Clinton was read that lauded his achievements in
``capturing history on film.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Washington, went to schools there and became
fascinated by photography. He worked for years at the Federal
Bureau of Printing and Engraving and at the Defense Department, but
not as a photographer. He was a staff photographer for The
Afro-American newspaper in Washington before joining Johnson
Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Beatrice, and a sister, Lillian
Strange, of Hyannis, Mass.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jazz drummer, pianist and composer Errol Parker,
whose thick and highly arranged music doggedly confirmed African
connections in jazz, died at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan Thursday.
He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said his daughter, composer Elodie
Lauten.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was born Raphel Schecroun in Oran, Algeria, which was
then French. He fought in the French army in World War II, and in
Paris he studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. A
self-taught pianist, he played with Django Reinhardt while in Paris
in his mid-'20s and later played with James Moody, Don Byas and
Kenny Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he wrote the song ``Lorre,'' a classical-jazz piece that
became a hit in France. He moved to New York City in 1967 and
started his own record label (Sahara Records), on which he issued
more than a dozen records. He finally switched to drums to realize
his vision of a North African style of jazz drumming, with minimal
cymbals and a conga drum in place of snare. In 1983, he formed the
Errol Parker Tentet, one of the more innovative bands of the 1980s.
He wrote a memoir published by Cadence Books in 1995 and by
Filipacchi in France the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Parker died shortly after hearing his music performed by the
Errol Parker Tentet at St. Peter's Church, at a benefit concert on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his sister,
Janine Beisson, of Gif-sur-Yvette, France.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PARIS _ There are many mysteries at the top levels of soccer,
and some of the most intricate originate where economic and social
systems have been radically altered.
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav ``Ciro'' Blazevic qualifies among the most interesting
of those mysteries. On the surface, he is a multi-lingual charmer,
close friend of high-level politicians such as Croat President
Franjo Tudjman, a kind father figure to the players on the Croatia
national team. He is also a national hero after guiding the team to
Wednesday's World Cup meeting with France at Stade de France _ the
first time a nation has qualified for the semifinals in its World
Cup debut in the tournament's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   But Blazevic also has a dark side, rooted in the struggles of
the Balkans, in the wars and the treachery that have marked this
complex region.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Blazevic is the most imaginative of survivors. He has
had to be in order to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic first made his mark in this drama that is playing out
as both an expression of nationalism and sporting accomplishment by
coaching Dynamo Zagreb to the Yugoslavian championship in 1982.
Croats used this as a symbol of their desire to reassert their
identity and to create their own country, which had been considered
impossible while Josip Broz Tito ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, as Croatia continued to regard soccer as a
key element in its fight for independence, midfielder Zvonimir
Boban kicked a Serbian policeman who had been harassing a fan
during a Dynamo Zagreb-Red Star game. The photograph of Boban's
kick became a point of reference for Croats, but it also caused
Boban to be banned from the Yugoslav national team for the 1990
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   By '91, Croats had voted to secede from Yugoslavia. Tudjman
considered soccer an important vehicle for promoting the nascent
republic and named Blazevic minister of sports.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, the not insignificant matter of Blazevic's role in the
Olympique Marseille scandal jeopardized his status. Blazevic, who
had coached at Nantes, spent at least one night in a France jail
after a Marseille court discovered that routine payoffs had been
made by Olympique Marseille officials, including team president
Bernard Tapie.
</P>
<P>
   Tapie, among the most ambitious and richest of Frenchmen, spent
more than a year in prison. Blazevic escaped relatively unscathed _
fortunately for the Croatian national team and for the image of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Though Croatia has other highly qualified coaches, such as
Tomislav Ivic, the designated savior is Blazevic. He has nurtured
the current generation of players, many of whom were part of the
1987 Under-20 World Championship team while playing for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a father-son relationship with him,'' said
midfielder Alijosa Asanovic, who scored the first goal for
Croatia's national team in a 2-0 win over the US in 1990. ``If I am
sad, he is sad. If I am happy, he is also.''
</P>
<P>
   With his outgoing personality, blunt comments, and almost
surreal ability to overcome obstacles, Blazevic removes pressure
from his players. Blazevic is an excellent tactician whose 3-5-2
alignment has frustrated opponents, and a master motivator.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss journalist who spends summers fishing in Montana made
the unsolicited claim Sunday that the US national team should hire
Blazevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best soccer coach in the world, the best teacher of
the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Blazevic's off-field controversies, the journalist
said: ``Maybe he is mafia. But if you want the best, it is
Blazevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic as US national team coach is a longshot at best. But if
he is being excluded for reasons unrelated to coaching ability, it
raises questions about what standards Blazevic should be judged by.
Should Blazevic be condemned for not having a Pollyanna background?
</P>
<P>
   ``My two brothers died for Croatia during the Second World
War,'' Blazevic said in a recent interview with Libertion in
Croatia's headquarters in Vittel, in the Vosges region. ``And my
mother died, also, from grief. Me, I had a terrible childhood in
which I had to deal with Hitler fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Blazevic became a pragmatist. Born in Bosnia, he
travels on a Swiss passport after having coached in Switzerland. He
mixes humor and irony, and an astrologer's predictions, in
assessing his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be coach of this team as long as I live,'' Blazevic
told Zdravko Reic of World Soccer. ``It's written in the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But the astrologer also predicted that Blazevic could suffer a
heart attack while sitting on the bench during the World Cup.
Judging by Blazevic's past, it would take more than that to keep
him down.

EDITORIAL: PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   As more and more Americans communicate and do business
electronically, the fear is spreading that information they
transmit can be seized by hackers or criminals and used for illegal
or unsavory purposes. Fortunately, the technology to thwart such
invasions already exists. It is called encryption, or the encoding
of digital information to secure its privacy. But the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is trying hard to prevent the growing use
of encryption, both in the United States and abroad, because of
fears that the protective technology itself will get into the wrong
hands. That shortsighted stand will not only undermine efforts to
protect commercial transactions but may also hamper law enforcement
rather than help it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's current policies toward encryption
have been largely dictated by the FBI and the Justice Department.
These two agencies now block encryption makers from exporting their
most advanced technology unless they agree to develop a method
allowing law-enforcement agencies to gain access to it. The method
favored by the FBI is known as the key escrow, in which the key to
cracking a code is kept with a third party that could hand it over
quickly if law-enforcement agencies demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   But the key escrow method itself poses tremendous threats to
privacy. There is a danger that access to keys for the code could
be abused by law-enforcement agencies and others. Worse, the United
States would be required to share key escrow information with
law-enforcement agencies of other countries, and giving access to
private communications to countries with poor human rights records
could lead to crackdowns on dissidents using encryption for their
own communications.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry officials, the export controls are already
backfiring. More and more foreign companies are supplying
encryption technologies without key escrow arrangements, making it
virtually impossible for the FBI to eavesdrop and stealing business
from U.S. firms. The growing foreign role diminishes the ability of
the FBI to demand new safeguards or ways to penetrate the
communications of criminals who use encryption.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton might normally be more sympathetic to concerns
over maintaining privacy in the digital world. But since Attorney
General Janet Reno has protected Clinton from an independent
counsel on campaign finance, the White House is said to be loath to
oppose either her or Louis Freeh, the FBI director, on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the debate over encryption has created some
unusual political alliances. Many conservative Republicans have
stood with leaders of the high-tech industry to oppose any kind of
ban on encryption within the United States and to support a
loosening of export controls on encryption technology. It has been
odd to see Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Dick Armey,
the House majority leader, stand with civil libertarians against
the demands of the FBI. But the FBI is not without influence. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, more friendly to the agency, has prevented a
bill encouraging greater use of encryption from coming to a vote in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns of law-enforcement agencies are legitimate. But
smart criminals are already using encryption, some of which is
readily available on the Internet. That was the message conveyed
only a few weeks ago by such unlikely allies as Bill Gates of
Microsoft and Jim Barksdale of Netscape, who are on opposite sides
in the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft but
agree on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI should give up its losing fight against encryption and
work with industry to develop new means to catch criminals who use
it. One approach under discussion would be to develop software
technology that could be surreptitiously placed in a suspect's
computer to capture keystrokes before they are encrypted. Any such
operation would have to be carried out under strict court control
as the electronic equivalent of a search warrant. But
law-enforcement agencies have to find a legal and ethical way to
stay ahead of technology, rather than stand in the way of it.
Trying to block advances in the digital age is futile.

REVOLUTION HAPPY WITH WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Revolution coach Thomas Rongen stood in the steamy
visitors locker room of Houlihan's Stadium late Saturday night, his
shirt drenched in sweat, his necktie pulled apart, sporting a weary
smile. It had been quite some time _ nine games, to be precise _
since he last enjoyed a Major League Soccer victory.
</P>
<P>
   But, after watching his team match its own league record for
futility with those nine straight losses, Rongen and the Revolution
rekindled that winning feeling with a rousing 3-2 victory over the
Tampa Bay Mutiny on a sweltering Fourth of July evening before a
crowd of 22,704.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Kansas City (where New England suffered a 1-0 setback
Wednesday night), we knew we had played well and it would be just a
matter of time before we turned it around,'' said Rongen. ``The
manner in which we did _ going up twice, and them tying the game,
and then for us just to hang in there in a very humid environment
that really takes a lot out of a team _ speaks volumes. I didn't
stop believing and they didn't stop believing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Revolution, Raul Diaz-Arce never stopped
believing either.
</P>
<P>
   After Ivan McKinley broke a scoreless stalemate in the 53d
minute with his first goal of the season, Diaz-Arce rallied his
team with a pair of tie-breaking goals. He broke a 1-1 deadlock
with a penalty kick in the 75th minute _ that resulted from the
red-card ejection of Mutiny goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli _ then
tallied the winner in the 84th minute by converting a pass from
Oscar Pareja.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I never had my doubts,'' said Diaz-Arce, who surpassed
Joe-Max Moore (11 goals in 1996) as the team's leader for goals in
a season with his 12th and 13th. ``I believed in this team. I
believed that if we stayed together we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravelli's ejection came after he kicked the ball at referee
Ruben Rodhas, who was busier than a Vegas blackjack dealer in
dishing out eight yellow cards and two red cards. Rodhas flashed
the other red at Revolution midfielder Imad Baba, who was banished
in the 89th minute for violent conduct after he threw a ball at the
head of Tampa defender Chris Houser. Baba and Ravelli will miss
their next games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the league will understand that I didn't do it
deliberately,'' Ravelli said. ``I tried to tell the referee that I
didn't mean to do it, but he didn't want to hear me. It's sad when
something like that happens. It feels like everything is against us
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution could relate. But Saturday night they finally
turned the tables in scoring a victory that carried with it many
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to snapping their losing streak, the Revolution
scored their first road victory in 18 games vs. Eastern Conference
opponents and won for the first time in five visits to Tampa. They
also climbed back into the playoff picture by improving to 5-12
overall (good for 13 points in the standings) and leapfrogging over
Tampa (4-13) and Miami (6-12), with 12 points apiece. New England
moved from sixth to fourth place in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggested to the guys that it's a brand new season,''
Rongen said. ``I told the guys, `We've got 16 games left, so let's
pretend this is the break and here's where it's going to start.' I
think we played that way. We really played like we weren't going to
lose. On this level, it's all about overcoming adversity, and only
good teams can do that.''

SAMPRAS CLAIMS 5TH CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pete Sampras did it again Sunday, winning his second
consecutive Wimbledon singles championship, the fifth time he's
taken the world's most important tennis crown, tying him with Bjorn
Borg for most in the open era.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras beat Goran Ivanisevic, 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6,
6-2, in a match that lasted 2 hours 52 minutes, and his victory
enabled the 26-year-old to retain the No. 1 world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras picked up a check for $722,000 and Ivanisevic pocketed
$361,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras now has 11 Grand Slam titles, more than any other active
player, and he's now one from tying Roy Emerson's record of 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time for it to sink in, but it's a bit
overwhelming to have won five and be a couple from the record,''
Sampras said. ``It's really hard to talk about. It's overwhelming
to think of myself in those terms. I've always tried to stay humble
through all my accomplishments. It's hard to believe (tying) Borg's
five; I thought that would never be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a lot of years left in me. This is like the
Super Bowl. This is what the game is all about to me. But I'm not
thinking much about next year. I just want to try to enjoy this. As
a kid, when I saw Borg's five, I never thought that I would be in a
position to tie it, and it's a little overwhelming to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has won a Grand Slam title every year since 1993, and
now has 55 career singles titles. This was his third this year, to
go with wins in Philadelphia and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to all the finals I've played, this is by far the
toughest,'' Sampras said, ``but all Wimbledons are very, very
sweet. This one _ I didn't think I was quite in control of the
match, and Goran was playing huge _ and the fifth set was really
anyone's ballgame. There's not really much that separates us, just
a couple of points here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who had only 12 aces to Ivanisevic's 32, believed he
was fortunate to take the second-set tie-breaker, when the
Croatian's serve-and-volley forehand landed long, setting up a
service winner to the forehand for Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially important since Ivanisevic had won the first
set by tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second set tie-breaker was a huge part of the match,''
Sampras said. ``There was a shot that he missed by about an inch.
He converts on one of those and it's two sets to love and I'm
digging myself a big hole to come back. It takes a little luck to
come back, especially this one in the final.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the fifth set. Ivanisevic, going for his
first Grand Slam title after having lost in the final here in 1992
and 1994, grew tired, possibly carryover from defeating Richard
Krajicek, 15-13, in the fifth set of Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raised his game in the fifth, but I was getting slower and
he could return better on my serves,'' said Ivanisevic. ``If I had
gone up, 2-0, that's a different story. I don't think he would have
come back, no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, indeed, began doing better on Ivanisevic's serves in
the fifth, chipping them back. With Ivanisevic slower in getting to
the net, it was easier to pass him.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also believed it was to his advantage that he got to
serve first in the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big mental advantage,'' he said. ``You're always a game
up, and you feel like if you break him you're up three games. It's
not a huge part of the match, but it certainly helps to start
serving the fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said he had no idea that Ivanisevic was getting worn
out, however. But he broke Ivanisevic twice in the fifth set, in
the sixth and eighth games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of a weird feeling but, you know, this is what
the game is all about,'' Sampras said. ``We're two heavy hitters
going at it and one of us is going to win and I was fortunate
enough to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``His serve was still coming in real big. The fifth set of a
Wimbledon final, you just have to suck it up as best you can, but
he's played a lot of tennis over the past three or four days. Maybe
that took its toll, but I didn't sense him getting tired at all.''

GIULIANI'S GOAL OF CIVIL CITY RUNS INTO FIRST AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-GIULIANI-FIRST-AMENDMENT-SUM, sidebar on judicial
decisions stemming from lawsuits against the city). 
(nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his pursuit of a ``civilized'' New York of
small-scale protests and huckster-free sidewalks, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani keeps bumping up against the First Amendment and getting
bruised.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional guarantee of free expression and assembly has
been invoked in about a dozen lawsuits that successfully challenged
the mayor's most cherished quality-of-life initiatives and in
reaction to his often testy confrontations with critics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is deploying a phalanx of police officers to block a
taxi drivers' protest, charging higher fees for the right to
operate a newsstand or relegating sex shops to industrial zones,
Giuliani has seen his administration accused of trading New York's
boisterous tradition of free speech for a quieter but less colorful
urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have not passed judgment on the mayor's vision for
the city or on his temperament, although a federal appeals court
judge did poke fun at him for objecting to a bus advertisement for
New York magazine that used his name.
</P>
<P>
   But with one major exception _ the sex shop zoning law, upheld
by a federal appeals court last month _ they have found fault with
the way the city regulates activities protected by the First
Amendment. Two weeks ago, the sex shop owners asked the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for a rehearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him credit for a lot of things, but I think he is
plainly far less sensitive to First Amendment concerns,'' said
Richard D. Emery, a lawyer who has brought two free-speech lawsuits
against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office did not respond to requests for an interview.
But the mayor, a former federal prosecutor, is clearly riled at the
frequently voiced suggestions that both his style and his
substantive programs lack proper respect for the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent news conference, for example, a reporter asked the
mayor how he would respond to those who say he wants to quash
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wrong,'' the mayor curtly replied.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment lawsuits and less-formal complaints against
the Giuliani administration fall into two broad categories. One
concerns the mayor's attitude to dissent (vindictive, critics say).
The other focuses on the inevitable tension between a government
trying to manage public spaces and people seeking to parade,
protest, preach and pitch their wares on public property.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are not unique to New York or to this
administration, Giuliani's lawyers say, nor is the mayor breaking,
or losing, new ground. Former Mayor Ed Koch, for example, fought a
free-speech challenge to a city law that required performers at the
Central Park band shell to use city sound-control technicians. The
U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law. Under former Mayor David
Dinkins, the city tried to stop the Learning Annex, an adult
education program, from installing newspaper boxes on sidewalks but
eventually lost that case on First Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani appears to land in court on such issues more often,
it is only because he is an aggressive and engaged manager, said
Lorna Bade Goodman, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Law Department has been very busy under Giuliani,'' she
said. ``He has an idea a day. He is really a very active, active
public administrator, constantly thinking about new problems and
areas for city government to tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to establish exactly how many of the 8,000
lawsuits filed annually against the city raise First Amendment
issues. What sets Giuliani's record apart from the record of his
predecessors is that free-speech lawsuits repeatedly challenge the
laws at the center of the mayor's most high-profile programs.
Neither Koch nor Dinkins provoked anything close to the number of
free-speech lawsuits in state and federal courts, civil liberties
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 13 years, and my legal director has been here
even longer, and we've never filed as many cases involving one
administration,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, which staged an Independence Day rally
on the steps of City Hall to spotlight its continuing First
Amendment battles with the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's organization has weighed in, either as counsel or in
friend-of-the-court briefs, in 12 lawsuits against the
administration that involve free-speech issues. They include the
taxi drivers' complaint last month over Giuliani's blockade of
their protest, two cases challenging city rules prohibiting
employees from talking to the news media and a lawsuit by a church
in the South Bronx that saw its AIDS education program kicked out
of a city park. The plaintiffs prevailed in each of those cases,
although the city has appeals pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vision is a new New York,'' Siegel said, ``and it's a
vision that is more authoritarian, repressive and antithetical to
our rich tradition of tolerance for the right to protest and
dissent. It's inconsistent with what the city has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Republican mayor in a generation, Giuliani rode to
office in 1994 on a wave of popular disgust _ with crime and the
perceived tyranny of panhandlers, homeless people and thugs who
seemed to have taken over the city's parks and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   A nonpolitician in a job traditionally held by men who rose step
by step through the political ranks, he spoke about improving New
Yorkers' quality of life and carried a big stick, aggressively
enforcing existing city regulations and initiating new regulations
of his own to clear the sidewalks, reduce noise and lessen
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His targets fought back. A street musician who was charged $45
for a one-day permit to perform filed suit, arguing that the city
charged too much for regulating an activity protected by the First
Amendment. A federal judge agreed, and the city is now studying its
permit fees. A sidewalk artist shooed away by the police for not
having a permit also filed suit. The case went to a federal appeals
court, which said that selling art is also an activity protected by
the First Amendment. The city can license artists, but it must
stick to the stricter standards that federal courts require when
regulating speech and expression. The Supreme Court declined to
hear the city's appeal, letting the ruling stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Giuliani striking out on a new urban path here?'' asked
Myron Magnet, editor of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, which urges the mayor to battle
on against other urban scourges like earsplitting car alarms and
rude public servants. ``I would say he is returning to an old one.
All that Giuliani is doing in his civility campaign is to try to
take back those public places that were hijacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery, the First Amendment lawyer, had a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say Giuliani is trying to redefine the public space,''
he said, ``but he's also just striking out.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this century, federal courts have provided plenty of
judicial guidance to governments in how far they can go in
reasonably limiting the time, place and manner of activities that
are protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rule is that any restriction must be neutral regarding
the content of the expression, it must serve a specific government
purpose, and it must leave open ample alternative channels of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   In recent New York City cases, judges have faulted the Giuliani
administration for not completely meeting those standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the newsstand case, for example, a federal judge criticized a
regulation giving the city unfettered power to terminate a
newsstand operator's concession without a hearing. That could
induce a news vendor to censor the materials he sells out of fear
of offending city officials, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of judicial rulings against New York City mirrors
the national trend, said Robert C. Post, a law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley who has written extensively on
the issue of public spaces and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole,'' he said, ``the courts have been sympathetic to
speech and unsympathetic to giving too much discretion to
politicians who want to enforce bourgeois norms in public space.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's singlemindedness when it comes to his anticongestion
campaign is both his strength and his weakness, say urban affairs
experts and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an enforcer, and he's defining laws more narrowly than a
healthy community would define them,'' said Fred I. Kent III,
president of Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit group based in
New York that advises cities nationwide on how to revive and
nurture their neighborhoods. ``His quality-of-life program _ it is
mostly good, but you have to define your parameters and let
creativity come out. I don't think he knows what the limits are.''

<P>
   Kent said that Giuliani's plan to reduce congestion by banning
vendors of food and general merchandise from large swaths of
midtown and the financial district in Manhattan might be an example
of exceeding the limits and passing into the realm of urban
sterility. It is a plan that raises not only First Amendment
questions _ since it would encompass sellers of written material _
but also basic questions about the mayor's vision of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's missing something very important _ a good street
with a lot of activity on it is self-controlling,'' Kent said.
``Street life is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Giuliani often staked out the more extreme approach to
regulating the use of public space. His original zoning plan for
keeping sex shops out of residential areas was more drastic than
the law finally approved by the City Council and upheld as
constitutional on June 3 by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. Similarly, his vendor-control plan is
much more sweeping than one developed by the city's 40 business
improvement districts, which endorse opening up additional streets
to vendors but assigning each one a street corner.
</P>
<P>
   In his zeal to insure the free flow of traffic and pedestrians,
Giuliani also recently declared that no more than 30 people may
assemble at one time on the steps of City Hall, a favored venue for
the news conferences and photo opportunities of some of Giuliani's
political adversaries. The mayor said he was only reviving a
longstanding police rule intended to preserve order at the entrance
to City Hall, but his edict set off a predictable chorus of
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of Saturday's rally staged on the City Hall steps by
the New York Civil Liberties Union, Siegel sent a letter to the
Police Department informing it of the Independence Day
demonstration. The city responded that it would ``authorize'' 35 to
50 speakers, but the civil liberties union wrote back that he had
written to the Police Department only as a courtesy, not as a
request for permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position,'' the group wrote, ``is that individuals wishing
to hold press conferences on the steps of City Hall need not seek
nor obtain the permission of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Hall rule has been ignored for ceremonies on the steps
that are approved by Giuliani, including awards ceremonies for
firefighters and for David Wells, the Yankees pitcher. It has been
applied, however, to many of Giuliani's political adversaries,
among them state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who tried to make an
announcement there and was banished with his audience of 30-plus
people to City Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of selective enforcement that makes you
vulnerable to First Amendment accusations,'' said Gene Russianoff,
senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, is not the first mayor to abruptly invoke the
mantra of public order when he is irritated with crowds of
lobbyists and protesters on the City Hall steps. Russianoff
recalled a time during the Koch administration when the
Straphangers Campaign, a public-advocacy group, brought a big
roulette wheel to the steps as a prop for a news conference about
subway safety. A police officer, improvising on the spot, told them
to leave, saying City Hall could not be photographed with a game of
chance.

SUMMARY OF FIRST AMENDMENT CASES AGAINST CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-GIULIANI-FIRST-AMENDMENT) 
(nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is a summary of judicial decisions stemming from some
of the First Amendment lawsuits brought against the Giuliani
administration.
</P>
<P>
   DEMONSTRATIONS: A federal judge said in May that the city
violated the First Amendment rights of taxi drivers by refusing to
permit more than 20 drivers to assemble for a protest. The city is
appealing the granting of a preliminary injunction. A request for a
permanent injunction is pending in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   SEX SHOPS: The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding a
lower court decision, said city zoning laws to prevent sex shops
from clustering in residential areas do not violate the shop
owners' First Amendment rights. The sex shop owners have petitioned
the court for a rehearing.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEWALK ARTISTS: Saying that artists enjoy the same First
Amendment protection as vendors of written material, a federal
appeals court found the city's licensing regulations for sidewalk
artists unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear
the city's appeal on that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A group of artists filed a new lawsuit in March that challenges,
on First Amendment grounds, a separate Department of Parks and
Recreation rule requiring artists to obtain a permit to display
their works in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum
sidewalk is under the department's jurisdiction. That case is
pending in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, a federal district judge said the city's
$45-a-day permit for street musicians did not meet the standards
for regulating a First Amendment-protected activity. The fee is
excessive, the judge said, and does not accurately reflect the
city's cost to administer the permit program. The city has
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSSTANDS: The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
said that operating a newsstand is a First Amendment activity and
that regulations give the city too much leeway to terminate a
newsstand concession. The judge said a state court must rule on a
separate claim by the newsstand operators that the city's new fee
schedule for newsstand concessions is unconstitutional. The city
has not decided whether it will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   WHISTLE-BLOWERS: The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in
March that city rules barring employees from talking to reporters
infringe on the employees' First Amendment rights. The decision
stems from lawsuits filed by the Latino Officers Association and by
a former supervisor in the Administration for Children's Services
who was fired after speaking to a reporter. The city's Law
Department said it would ask the Supreme Court to hear an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ACCESS TO PARKS: The Appellate Division upheld a state court
decision that found that the Department of Parks and Recreation
violated the First Amendment rights of the All Saints Lutheran
Parish when it prevented the church's AIDS education project from
demonstrating and distributing condoms in a South Bronx park. The
city did not appeal.
</P>
<P>
   BUS ADS: A federal judge said the city and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority violated the First Amendment when it
removed New York magazine's ads from buses at the request of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who was lampooned in the ads. On appeal in the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the city was dismissed from the
case but the ruling was upheld against the transportation
authority, which may still appeal.

INNOVATE ENJOYS ROCKINGHAM TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
 BREEDERS CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ Grass races, run on tight inner courses, are all
about trips. In a nine-horse field that contains only two
legitimate contenders, whichever of the top two gets the best trip
will win, and that's how Innovate defeated Heaven's Command in the
$79,300 Rockingham Park Breeders' Cup Handicap Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The race shaped up as Innovate, the 2-1 ($6.60 to win) second
choice, vs. Heaven's Command, the 3-5 favorite, in a field rounded
out by seven overmatched locals. Innovate, ridden by Frank Lovato,
had a perfect outside trip from post No. 6, got the jump on
Heaven's Command, who had to swing out five-wide for the drive
under Chris DeCarlo, and held the odds-on pick safe to the wire.
Innovate, who had a 2-length lead at the eighth-pole, prevailed by
three-quarters of a length in 1:44 4/5 for a mile and one-16th over
the firm grass course. Sandy Gator, the best of the horses based at
Rock, was along in time to be third under Rudy Baez, a length and
one-quarter farther back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trip was clean, that was the winning difference,'' said
Lovato, who rode Innovate for the first time. ``I got the setup. My
filly was pretty fresh. She was a little sharper than her form
might indicate. I was clear on the outside. Heaven's Command was
behind a couple of horses. I was afraid that she might get through,
but she didn't. I had to have the horse to do it. Innovate put me
in the position I had to be in. She gave me a big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovate, a 4-year-old daughter of Relaunch, is trained by noted
New York conditioner H. James Bond and owned by William Clifton and
Rudlein Stable. Innovate was defeated by Heaven's Command in the
Columbiana Handicap at Hialeah May 2, the last time Innovate ran.
However, it was discovered that Innovate was suffering from an
entrapped epiglottis and she underwent laser surgery to correct the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``She threw her head up during the stretch run of the Columbiana
and we knew something was wrong,'' said Carlos Correa, assistant
trainer for Bond. ``We had her 'scoped and found the problem. She's
been doing great since then and she was right for this race,
believe me. Heaven's Command beat her last time but our filly was
having trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innovate also had a shoulder problem last year that came back
and bothered her again this year. She's had her problems, but when
we have her right, she's a nice filly. I believe we'll be back for
the Spicy Living (Aug. 2). She didn't race too hard today and she
likes this course. When the other filly came to her, she still had
a lot left. We'll be back. We like coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCarlo blamed a slow break from post No. 3 for the problems of
Heaven's Command, who is trained by Christophe Clement, and she did
break last. Still, she was trapped behind four horses turning for
home after trying to get up the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was my horse didn't break,'' said DeCarlo, who
was riding Heaven's Command for the first time. ``I didn't get the
position I wanted. Chris told me that she usually breaks pretty
hard but she didn't come out today. I didn't have the greatest of
trips but I definitely think the break beat me. It was one of those
things. I thought I had a shot at Innovate at the quarter-pole but,
when I got to within three-quarters of a length, Innovate just
stayed there and I knew I was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our horse moved a little too late,'' said Nicholas Balachard,
assistant trainer for Clement. ``She had to be swung to the
outside. That's the way it goes.''

EDITORIAL: MONARCH OF CENTER COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   This has been a vintage year for fans who appreciate great,
seasoned athletes performing brilliantly in the hallmark
competition of their sport. First there was John Elway, the Denver
Bronco quarterback, leading his team to a Super Bowl victory, the
first of his distinguished career. Then Michael Jordan propelled
the Chicago Bulls to another National Basketball Association
championship. Sunday, it was Pete Sampras' turn. He dispatched
Goran Ivanisevic in a difficult five-set match to win his fifth
Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   Like Elway and Jordan, Sampras is the rare athlete who can lift
a game to a new level of excellence and keep it there for years. He
couples the power of previous players like Pancho Gonzalez and Jack
Kramer with the finesse of John McEnroe, a combination that has now
produced 11 Grand Slam titles. Only Roy Emerson, the skillful
Australian player of several decades ago, has won more Grand Slam
men's titles. Sampras is one behind, along with Rod Laver, the
great Australian player, and Bjorn Borg, the groundstroke master
from Sweden. At Wimbledon, the only man besides Sampras to win five
titles in the modern era was Borg.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who is 26, ought to set a new standard for Grand Slam
victories before his career ends. Even when his sizzling first
serve is not landing consistently, the case Sunday, he can still
carve the court with pinpoint volleys and a powerful baseline game
that he uses sparingly but effectively. There is no better
all-around player.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, a Croat, can uncork even faster serves than Sampras,
some topping 130 miles an hour, but he still lacks the stroke
repertoire necessary to win at Wimbledon, even in a
serve-and-volley showdown. Too many of his volleys Sunday slapped
into the net or carried beyond the baseline. In the second-set tie
breaker, the pivotal juncture of the match, Ivanisevic simply could
not equal the determination and steely nerves of Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras was making room for himself in the pantheon of
men's tennis, Jana Novotna won her first Wimbledon title. It was an
especially sweet victory for the Czech veteran who had won no Grand
Slam singles championships. Twice before she made the Wimbledon
final but lost. Like the men's final, her match with Nathalie
Tauziat of France was a serve-and-volley contest.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis connoisseurs who prefer the intricate strategy and
sustained tension of baseline play did not find much to savor in
the Wimbledon finals. That is nothing new on the grass courts.
Still, it was a good fortnight of tennis. One of the finest players
ever to take the court put on a show to remember.

EDITORIAL OBSERVERTHE LATIN LEFT SEARCHES FOR A PRACTICAL AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The program of the political left in Latin America has varied
sharply in recent decades. The left has called for armed struggle,
protected industries, nationalization, subsidies _ different plans
but always a plan _ until now. Today, the left knows it opposes
what Latins call neoliberalismo, the region's singleminded pursuit
of foreign investment and the accompanying austerity and
inequality. But leftists have no clear idea what they are for.
</P>
<P>
   Neoliberalism's rise to the status of near-religious doctrine in
Latin America is in part due to the influence of Washington. The
Reagan administration pushed the Latin Americans into pro-business
austerity policies, and set the tone for a worldwide reduction of
government's role. The policy's acceptance in Latin America is also
due to the wealth of its backers in a region where money matters
even more in politics than it does in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But neoliberalism is also a response to the failures of the
left. The continent is still cleaning up the hyperinflation and
stagnation born of the left's irrational public spending and closed
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the left must fix neoliberalism's flaws _ chiefly
that it is not helping the poor. If government does not spread the
benefits of globalization, countries will be divided into a small
group of wealthy businessmen and a large group of marginalized
people who cannot even get an antibiotic or a grade-school
education.
</P>
<P>
   The left's traditional solutions do not apply. Armed struggle,
thankfully, is out of fashion. Most of the state telephone
companies and steel mills the left created were wasteful and
corrupt and did little for the poor. Closing markets has mainly
protected an inefficient national class of cronies. Many of the
left's traditional causes served the middle class, such as
university students, government employees and urban hospitals,
while ignoring the needs of the less vocal and organized poor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus, both among governments and the
international banks that lend to them, that at a minimum,
governments must put a human face on neoliberalism by spending
money on the poor. Chile is the only country that is really trying
this, and the only country to reduce poverty by a significant
amount in recent years. It has done so by sustaining 7 percent
growth for 10 years, and by spending a lot of money on the poor in
programs administered by what is probably the region's least
corrupt and most effective government. Other nations will not be
able to duplicate this success. Even in Chile, moreover, inequality
has risen, and the country's growth, heavily dependent on the
export of its fish and forest products, is not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   If neoliberalism lite is not the solution, what is? Some
possible ideas are coming from a group organized by Jorge
Casteneda, a Mexican political scientist, and Roberto Mangabeira
Unger, a Brazilian who teaches law at Harvard. Over the last
several years, they have drawn together a few dozen of Latin
America's leading politicians _ mostly leftists _ to discuss
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Unger argues that government has a role, although a very
different one than in the past. He and Casteneda believe that
instead of simply spending money to reduce the suffering of the
silent majority, governments must pursue locally designed policies
to draw the poor into the global economy. They also stress the need
to collect taxes. While developed countries collect taxes
equivalent to 30 percent of their economies, in Latin America the
figure is 12 percent _ not enough to finance even a meager social
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Their more radical proposals include a measure that would allow
either the president or the legislature to call new elections for
both branches, a way to break the deadlock that now keeps many
countries from passing reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Their agenda has its quirks, but at least it is a serious
attempt to draw up a program to make the market work for the poor.
The program must be pragmatic enough to attract those in the
political center but radical enough to make a real difference in
people's lives and not simply be a pale copy of the right. It is a
problem that grips Russians trying to break the domination of the
tycoons, and South African officials desperate to improve the lot
of poor blacks. As America's prosperity continues to leave out
large segments of society, the question of how to close that gap is
one the Democratic Party will have to answer as well.

AMATEUR'S 45-FOOT PUTT FORCES A PLAYOFF WITH PAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ By the time Jenny Chuasiriporn reached the 18th
green at the U.S. Women's Open Sunday, she had already accomplished
more than anyone had expected. There she was, a 20-year-old amateur
between her junior and senior years at Duke University, facing a
birdie putt from around 45 feet to tie Se Ri Pak for first place
and force an 18-hole playoff on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Only one amateur has ever won the women's Open, Catherine
Lacoste of France in 1967. And considering the pressure of the
moment, and the length of the putt, the odds against Chuasiriporn
finding a way to make it were great.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, she did it. In a moment that will be etched in
Chuasiriporn's mind for a lifetime, she made a textbook stroke,
watched the ball roll slowly across the green, then covered her
mouth in disbelief as the putt dropped while her 21-year-old caddie
and brother, Joey, ran to give her a triumphant high-five. ``The
last 15 feet, my eyes probably popped out because it was going
straight in,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``I didn't expect it to go in at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak and Chuasiriporn, both 20, will play on Monday thanks to an
incredible fourth-round finish that unfolded Sunday at Blackwolf
Run golf course. Pak, who shot a 5-over-par 76, and Chuasiriporn,
who shot a courageous 72, finished four rounds of emotionally
draining golf tied at 6-over-par 290 for the tournament, one stroke
ahead of Liselotte Neumann (291), who did not make a birdie while
shooting a 76 and whose final chance to join the playoff ended when
she missed a 90-foot putt for birdie at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, playing in the group behind Chuasiriporn, was standing on
the tee box at No. 18 when she heard the gallery erupt, reacting to
Chuasiriporn's putt. Now it was Pak's chance to try for a birdie at
No. 18, which would have won the tournament. But Pak could not
deliver. After hitting a solid drive, followed by an accurate
approach shot, Pak was left with a putt for birdie from around 9
feet. But it slid just right of the hole, and after Pak tapped in
for par, it was assured that a dramatic championship, filled with
improbable twists and turns, would continue for another day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Who can predict what will happen? Will Pak, who won the LPGA
McDonald's Championship in May, become the first LPGA Tour rookie
since Juli Inkster in 1984 to win two majors in the same year? Or
will Chuasiriporn, an effervescent psychology major from Baltimore,
become the first amateur in 31 years to win the national women's
championship? The answer will unfold Monday, and Chuasiriporn, who
had checked out of her hotel, will have to check back in. But for
both players, the ride to get to this point has been thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy,'' said Pak, who reached the 17th tee holding a
two-stroke lead but bogeyed that hole, opening the door for
Chuasiriporn. ``I do my best tomorrow, same thinking. I don't want
money, but I want the trophy.'' No matter what happens Monday, Pak,
who started the fourth round with a one-stroke lead over Mhairi
McKay and Neumann, will see the money. As an amateur, Chuasiriporn
is not eligible for the $267,500 first-place prize.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, an outstanding collegiate player who won the
Atlantic Coast Conference title the past two seasons, will become
far more familiar to golf fans, however. Her parents, originally
from Thailand, own a restaurant in Timonium, Md., called the
Bangkok Place, where Chuasiriporn washed dishes as a child. But the
restaurant was closed all last week, and it will be closed again
Monday, so that Chuasiriporn's parents can watch proudly from the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn said that win or lose, she will return to Duke for
her senior year. If she does win, she will be eligible for an
automatic one-year exemption for the LPGA Tour in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pressure, Chuasiriporn has taken time to enjoy the
moment. While playing No. 16, she stopped to notice former
President George Bush walking through the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to hit my second shot, I turned to Joey, and I'm
like, `There's George Bush down there,''' she said. ``Joey was
like, `Are you going to hit the shot or what?'''
</P>
<P>
   With admirable poise and a flair for the dramatic, Chuasiriporn
managed to catch Pak despite starting the day tied for fourth
place, four strokes off the lead. Her 72 was the second-best score
of the day, topped only by the 71s shot by Danielle Ammaccapane and
Hollis Stacy. For the second consecutive day, nobody broke par, and
while the wind was calmer than it was on Saturday, tougher pin
placements and final-round pressure made this another severe test
of skill.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn passed like a veteran, making only three bogeys and
avoiding the double-bogeys or worse that sank so many others. After
four consecutive pars, she bogeyed No. 5, but she responded with a
birdie at No. 8, making a 25-foot putt, a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Chuasiriporn reached the 13th tee, she was leading
the tournament, one stroke ahead of Pak, who struggled on the front
nine, shooting a 5-over 40. Pak double-bogeyed No. 3 after she
pulled her drive into the deep rough. She bogeyed No. 8, missing a
6-foot putt. Then she bogeyed No. 9, hitting her second shot into
the water, after her drive landed in the rough. Meanwhile, making
seven consecutive pars from No. 8 through No. 14, Chuasiriporn
remained in control, while many other contenders faltered. Chris
Johnson stayed close for a while, but a double-bogey at No. 14 and
a bogey at No. 16 ruined her chance for victory; she faded to a tie
for fourth at 292. McKay never fully recovered from two holes, a
triple-bogey at No. 7 and a double-bogey at No. 11, shooting a 78
and finishing tied for seventh at 293.

   ELMONT, N.Y. _ For the fourth time in 15 years, a horse trained
by Allen Jerkens won the Tom Fool Handicap at Belmont Park Sunday,
but this time, he cut it tantalizingly close. Banker's Gold edged
Boundless Moment and Partner's Hero in a three-horse photo finish
after a furious rush to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   They hurtled down the homestretch past the odds-on favorite,
Richter Scale, who had held the lead with his natural speed until
they turned for home. Then, as Richter Scale surrendered his lead,
it was a 200-yard race to decide a winner. And in a driving finish,
Banker's Gold prevailed by a head over Boundless Moment, who held
second place by a head over Partner's Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scramble, it was one length back to Western Borders,
and then five long lengths back to Richter Scale, who had won his
last two races and six of nine overall.
</P>
<P>
   Banker's Gold, a 4-year-old son of Forty Niner, scored for the
first time since February after running second in the Carter and
Metropolitan Handicaps in his last two starts. Jerkens said he was
relieved the colt closed the gap from second to first, and added:
``His last three races have all been good ones, and it's really
nice to finally win one. He was in good position, and, when he made
the lead, my main concern was that he tends to fool around when
he's in front. But he got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the job done because Richter Scale suddenly faded in the
stretch, and Boundless Moment and Partner's Hero were breathing
down his neck. Jockey Jerry Bailey even had positioned Richter
Scale on the rail, where he had won the True North Handicap last
month. ``But,'' Bailey reported, ``he just didn't finish the way he
did in his last two wins, for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jorge Chavez, the rider on Banker's Gold, wasn't counting
his money yet, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went past Richter Scale,'' he said, ``I thought I moved
too soon because it looked like Jerry wasn't even moving his hands.
But when I realized his horse was stopping, I thought I was home
free at the 16th pole until I saw that horse coming on the outside.
Thankfully, we just had enough to hold him off.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant Boundless Moment. And soon another late intruder,
Partner's Hero, who had also been running at the back of the pack,
made a move, and it took a photo to sort them out.
</P>
<P>
   Banker's Gold, who is owned by Georgia Hofmann, has won 6-of-13
races and has run in the money 10 times. He ran the seven furlongs
in 1 minute 21 seconds, paid $6.60 for a $2 bet to win and earned
$90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jerkens said the next race for Banker's Gold would probably be
the Whitney at Saratoga on Aug. 8, despite its distance of a mile
and an eighth, and added, ``I think he can go a lot farther, if you
can rate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mott, Richter Scale's trainer, said his horse did not seem
to be troubled by the cracked hoof that had bothered him in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any excuse as far as the running of the race
goes,'' he said. ``He seemed to be comfortable with everything
going into this race.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES:
</P>
<P>
   After you break a world record, what can you do for an encore?
Elusive Quality, the 5-year-old horse who broke the world record
for the mile Saturday while winning the Poker Handicap in 1:31 3/5,
has one ultimate goal: the Breeders' Cup Mile on the grass at
Churchill Downs on Nov. 7. His trainer, Bill Mott, said his horse
seemed to be thriving on grass since he switched in May and won two
straight. The only question was how far he could run that fast.
``You have to think he can do it, especially if the grass is
helping him get the mile,'' Mott said. ``He won the first time out
of the box at a mile and a sixteenth, but the more we ran him, the
shorter he got. The question was if he could go a Breeders' Cup
type of mile. But that looks like a question he just answered.''

BROWNE CAPTURES HARTFORD AFTER A FADE BY MIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ With four consecutive birdies having propelled
him into a four-stroke lead with four holes to play, former Masters
champion Larry Mize seemed destined to end a five-year victory
drought Sunday in the Canon Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   But an errant tee shot, a missed 2-foot putt, an overshot green
and a potentially tournament-winning 15-foot putt that suddenly
broke left erased Mize's lead over those four holes to force a
playoff with defending champion Stewart Cink and Olin Browne.
</P>
<P>
   After another bad drive into a fairway bunker on the first
playoff hole, the 444-yard, par-4 18th, Mize soon fell out of
contention. Meanwhile, Cink appeared en route to a repeat victory
when his approach shot landed within 15 feet of the flag and Browne
landed on the left fringe, 40 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Browne then electrified the huge throng on the
natural amphitheater surrounding the 18th hole when he chipped in
for a birdie to win his first tournament. Browne's victory was
sealed when the 25-year-old Cink's attempt at a birdie missed to
the left by about 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his mind-set was before his winning chip shot _ which
he virtually had to make if he were to win the tournament on the
first playoff hole _ Browne, said: ``I was pretty sure he would
make the putt. I had a good bead on the hole, and I just wanted to
make the best shot I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne's triumph, which earned him $360,000, marked the second
year in a row that a nonwinner on the PGA Tour had achieved a
breakthrough on this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After his four successive birdies, Mize took a double-bogey at
the 296-yard, par-4 16th hole and a bogey at No. 16. But he parred
the 17th and went to the last hole with a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mize's tee shot was dead-solid perfect. But then, in what he
later described as the biggest mistake during his late collapse,
the lanky Georgian drilled a 4-iron shot over the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a stupid mistake,'' said Mize, who has won four
titles including the 1987 Masters in a 17-year professional career.
``I should have taken less club, but I was pumped up, and I think
that's what aggravates me the most. Anyway, that was the real
killer. All that other stuff earlier just happens.''
</P>
<P>
   That included his tee shot on the 296-yard, par-4 15th hole, a
5-iron that caught a branch and landed about 25 yards into a wooded
area. It cost him two penalty strokes and, eventually, a
double-bogey. He finished the day at 69; Cink and Browne each shot
a 67.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mize, whose game has fallen on hard times in recent years _ he
had only one top-10 finish in 21 tournaments in 1997 and only one
in 15 events this year _ finished at 14-under-par 266 along with
Browne and Cink, breaking the tournament record by one shot. The
runners-up each collected $176,000 from the $2 million purse.
</P>
<P>
   A stroke behind at 267 were Duffy Waldorf, Fred Funk and the
48-year-old Doug Tewell. Another stroke back was David Duval, the
leading money winner this year, who carded a 68, and Scott Hoch,
who started the final round tied with Mize and Grant Waite of New
Zealand and shot a 71.
</P>
<P>
   Until his victory Sunday, Browne's best finish had been a tie
for fourth place in a tournament four years ago. Most of his
15-year pro career had been spent on the Nike Tour, where he had
four victories between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three days, the course record of
8-under-par 62 was tied, this time by Vijay Singh, the 35-year-old
veteran from Fiji. Singh's 28 on the back nine set a course record
and matched the low for nine holes on the PGA Tour this year. ...
The lone amateur to make the cut, J.J. Henry of Fairfield, Conn.,
who was runner-up in this year's National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament and intends to turn pro later this year,
continued his steady play. Henry, an all-American at Texas
Christian, closed with a par 70 to finish at 2-under-par 278.

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURES SUMMARY No 2461 - JULY 6, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. KILLERS HAVE MORE FUN As players zoom in from around the
world, computer games like 'Ultima Online' are grand social
experiments in community building. There's just one little problem
... By Amy Jo Kim. From Wired magazine. 4,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
THE HIPPOCRATIC WARS The feisty Journal of the American Medical
Association and the staid New England Journal of Medicine are
battling for readers through an unwitting ally : the media. Is
anything being lost in the process? By Ellen Ruppel Shell. From The
New York Times Magazine. 2,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
FROM PROSPECT MAGAZINE (N/A U.K.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  &QR;  HITLER TO HOLDERLIN Much has been written about the great
philosopher Martin Heidegger's involvement with the Nazis. But
Desmond Christy welcomes a new biography which refrains from hasty
judgements, and lets the life speak for itself. Heidegger's real
silence was not about Auschwitz, but about himself. 1,500 words.  &QR;  &QR; 
PORTRAIT : V.S. NAIPAUL To his critics he is an arrogant apologist
for colonialism and a cheerleader for Hindu nationalism. To his
admirers he is the finest writer in the English language and
creator of a new literary form. Jason Cowley talks to the literary
king of rootlessness and finds him content, at last, with life and
England. 4,000 words.  &QR;  &QR;  JEWS AGAINST ISRAEL Israel has reached
mature middle age. Susan Greenberg asks whether the existence of a
Jewish state has been good for the Jews. It is time to think aloud
about costs as well as benefits. Israel was meant to make Jews feel
secure, but it has made them vulnerable. 1,800 words.

<P>
   4. BRUCE BABBITT'S SWAMP U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
was supposed to live above Washington's poisonous atmosphere. Now
he finds his once-pristine image contaminated by scandal. By
Charles Siebert. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________
</P>
<P>
   5. FROM NATURE NEWS SERVICE (N/A France and Spain. Embargo :
18h00 GMT Wednesday, July 8.)  &QR;  IS NOT SMOKING BAD FOR YOU? : When
heavy smokers quit smoking, there are many anecdotal reports and
scientific studies showing that mood, the ability to concentrate
and mental agility may be affected. But does performance in an
abstract psychological test in a lab reflect any impairment in real
day-to-day activities? New research now suggests that it does. By
Helen Phillips. 400 words.  &QR;  SIGNALLING A HEART ATTACK The main
cause of heart attacks, stroke and gangrene of the extremities is a
disease of the arteries known as atherosclerosis, where a build-up
of fatty material blocks the arteries and causes clots. Researchers
have worked out how cells communicate with each other to coordinate
plaque formation. By Helen Phillips. 500 words
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
ELLIS ISLAND : A CELEBRATION OF IMMIGRANTS' HOPE When the
immigrants to the United States got off the boat and took their
first tentative steps on Ellis Island, it was impossible to
suppress the thought : The great saga that began on this sacred
rock off New York is America's greatest story. By David M.
Shribman. Boston Globe Magazine. 1,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
From NEW SCIENTIST (N/A Australia, New Zealand, Brazil)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  YOU ARE FEELING VERY, VERY SLEEPY ... Can we believe someone
who claims under hypnosis that they have forgotten their own name,
become colour blind or regressed to childhood? By David Concar.
3,000 words.  &QR;  ECHOES FROM THE DEEP : During the Gulf War, the
Allied forces ruled out a marine invasion of Kuwait because the
coastal waters could not be adequately cleared of mines. Imagine
being able to sense the underwater world as well as a dolphin can.
That's the dream of a man who is building an 'acoustic' camera that
collects sound rather than light. By Ilan Greenberg. 1,500 words.  &QR; 
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE : A tale of romance, fiendishly clever
gadgets and dull yellow crystals .... The extraordinary story of
the latest in memory chips. By Bob Johnstone. 1,500 words. 8.
PREDICTING YOUR GARDEN'S FUTURE : GAUGING VEGETABLE YIELDS You may
be growing vegetables - but how many can you expect, and when?
Susan McClure offers a guide to estimate vegetable yields - and
have your predictions come true. 1,400 words + photo.

   &UR; ANYTHING YOUR LITTLE HEART DESIRES: AN AMERICAN FAMILY STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Bosworth. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Bartley C. Crum, the famous corporate lawyer of
the 1940s and '50s and champion of leftist causes, tracks the
dazzling arc of her father's life, including his undoing by his
personal and political furies. Last year our reviewer, Richard
Lingeman, called this a ``multilayered act of discovery and
reconciliation ... in which redemption comes from the truth of the
telling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNDERWORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Don DeLillo. Scribner, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling wake for the Cold War explores how people
rearranged their lives around the moral void of Mutual Assured
Destruction, with its attending terror and absurdity. Selected by
the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1997,
the novel spans half a century, from its opening in 1951 at one of
baseball's legendary games to its epilogue in central Asia. The
characters -- both fictional and cultural heroes like Frank Sinatra
and Lenny Bruce -- are psychological fallout victims. ``
`Underworld' surges with magisterial confidence,'' Martin Amis said
here last year. ``It isn't every day, or even every decade, that
one sees the ascension of a great writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RESURRECTION: THE STRUGGLE FOR A NEW RUSSIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Remnick. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that the Russian people have had their fill of
Boris Yeltsin and the oligarchs who gained power after his
re-election in 1996. ``As a gifted journalist, with an eye for the
broad themes as well as the telling details of a story, he provides
us with an amplitude of particulars'' about the miseries that have
occurred during Yeltsin's reign of deception and criminality,
Abraham Brumberg wrote here last year. The thesis of  &UR; PETERSBURG,
CRUCIBLE OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION &LR; , by Katerina Clark (Harvard
University, $18.95), is that the city's idealistic artists and
intellectuals during the tumultuous years between 1913 and 1931
created an atmosphere that made the Great Terror of the late 1930s
possible. This revisionist account is ``a major contribution to the
cultural history of this seminal period,'' Harlow Robinson said in
the Book Review in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BLESSING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Mitford. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   This spirited riff on French-British relations on the highest
social plane pits a beautiful English wife and her charming French
nobleman husband against a diabolical villain: their young son. The
result is a ``cunningly constructed, artfully written ... farce of
the most civilized kind,'' Elizabeth Janeway wrote here in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMAGINING ROBERT. MY BROTHER, MADNESS, AND SURVIVAL: A MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Neugeboren. Owl/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A novelist describes his younger brother's 30-year battle with
mental illness, and his own struggle to navigate the nightmarish
system of mistreatment and inattentive care that dooms many victims
of schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. This is a
``powerful story,'' Frederick Busch said in these pages in 1997. In
 &UR; OUT OF THE SHADOWS: CONFRONTING AMERICA'S MENTAL ILLNESS CRISIS &LR; ,
by E. Fuller Torrey (Wiley, $16.95), a psychiatrist reports that
millions of Americans are suffering from severe mental illness
without treatment. ``The crisis he delineates should stir any
halfway sensitive human being to anger,'' Daniel J. Kevles wrote
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDERGROUND MAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mick Jackson. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel focuses on one of Victorian England's most
famous eccentrics, the real-life fifth Duke of Portland, who built
an elaborate network of tunnels beneath his lands to allow him
hidden access to all parts of his realm. ``Jackson has produced a
marvelous study of human foibles,'' Erik Burns said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEAR AND HIS DAUGHtER: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Stone. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist's first collection of short fiction is populated by
men who feel most alive when they are angry. In evoking a kind of
grinding male arrest, ``Stone turns the scraps and figments of
style that we call characters into real people,'' James Wood wrote
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEVER EAT YOUR HEART OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Judith Moore. North Point, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A California writer and editor expresses her life story through
the food she has prepared, peppering her lively account with
bite-sized essays on everything from the history of the cranberry
to the sex life of turkeys. Last year our reviewer, Susan Cheever,
called this a ``tart, satisfying'' memoir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TEACHINGS OF DON B.: SATIRES, PARODIES, FABLES, ILLUSTRATED
STORIES, AND PLAYS OF DONALD BARTHELME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Kim Herzinger. Vintage International, $15.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a parody of Bret Easton Ellis or a shaggy dog story
about a 4,000-pound Gouda cheese, the 63 pieces collected here
bristle with the author's delight in surprising the reader with his
genre-jumping acrobatics. The result is ``a small education in
laughter, melancholy, and the English language,'' James Marcus
wrote here in 1992.  &UR; A DOG'S HEAD &LR; , by Jean Dutourd, translated by
Robin Chancellor (University of Chicago, $12), is a slender
Barthelmesque fantasy about a middle-class Frenchman born with the
tete of a spaniel. This satirical novel is ``sad-eyed, witty and
often very funny,'' C.J. Rolo wrote here in 1953.

 &HT;    Americans consumed by love affair with debt
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Poets and songwriters have long warned us that love
can make people do crazy things. But the lust for bigger kitchens
and designer clothes also can cause people to act as impulsively as
young lovers who can't see beyond the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The good economy has stirred up our consumer hormones to the
point where millions of Americans are falling for the come-on lines
from bankers who promise cheap mortgages and big credit lines.
Instead of rationally evaluating the offers, we swoon and surrender
to lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Our affair with debt began in earnest about five years ago when
credit card issuers started smothering us with letters promising
easy credit. About 2 billion ``pre-approved'' credit card
solicitations are now sent to U.S. consumers each year.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh plastic in their palms, many shoppers make rash
purchases before considering the consequences of their wild moments
in the mall. Since 1993, credit card debt has doubled, while the
savings rate has slid to about half what it was in the early 1980s.
Predictably, record numbers of borrowers are filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, amid our economic boom, another absurdity is developing:
the percentage of homeowners late with their mortgage payments is
rising. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America recently
reported that in the first three months of this year, mortgage
delinquencies rose to 4.47 percent, up from 4.34 percent in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Why did mortgage delinquencies increase during a period when
unemployment rates were falling and incomes rising?
</P>
<P>
   Late payments started climbing because many borrowers have begun
getting stung by loans that allowed them to purchase homes beyond
their price range. For example, a borrower might have used a very
low-interest, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) a few years ago to buy
a big house. But now that the introductory rate has ended, the
monthly payment has moved up, leaving the homeowner struggling to
keep pace. Meanwhile, rising property tax assessments brought on by
a hot real estate market have increased the financial burden of
owning a home.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, of course, ARMs can be useful. A young
couple with freshly minted college degrees might choose an ARM
because they can be fairly certain their incomes will rise fast
enough to keep pace with interest-rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, people who aren't expecting big jumps in income
are using ARMs to pry their way into pricey homes. In some intown
neighborhoods of Atlanta, housing prices have increased by 30
percent in the past year. Instead of buyers saying, ``Whoa, I'm
just not going to pay $300,000 for a two-bedroom bungalow,'' they
are listening to the real estate agents and lenders who keep
looking for ways to make the deal work.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of years, a sudden jump in interest rates could
drive up monthly mortgage payments and at the same time burst the
real estate price bubble. Today's eager home buyers could find
themselves falling behind on rising loan payments while trying to
hang on to a house with a declining market value.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as late 1997, economists were finding shreds of
evidence that suggested Americans might be slowing their spending
enough to pay down debts and increase savings. But that turned out
to be only a brief breather between trips to the mall. This year,
exuberant spending on housing and consumer goods is taking on an
ardor that could leave millions of Americans broken-hearted in the
next recession.

 &HT;    ShortTakes: Help! A Chevy flashback
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture this. The fate of the republic hangs on it. In the Oval
Office, President Clinton is chatting up the president of Mexico. A
room away, in Mr. Clinton's book-lined study, sits wistful,
trusting Monica Lewinsky, awaiting whatever fate soon to befall
her. Delicately put, that fate seems best visualized as the back
seat of your dad's 1953 Chevy until someone gasps, ``Maybe we
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This according to a friend of Lewinsky's who has testified
before Ken Starr's grand jury. There are some _ me among them _ who
will find this both credible and bizarre. You can't quite picture
Rutherford B. Hayes pleading, ``I do too respect you.''
</P>
<P>
   The president says it isn't so, and furthermore it wasn't sex.
Watching Congress solemnly debating these issues will be worth the
gazillions we'll spend for the hilarity value alone. It's like
having a nightmare in which you are put on trial for having been a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we elected Mr. Clinton presuming he was beyond his
zit years. Still, it all seems a matter best left to Hillary
Clinton than the House Judiciary Committee. I don't know Mrs.
Clinton well at all, but if I were the Prez and given the choice,
I'd rather face Henry Hyde.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Lure of junk mail too much to pass up
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ I have a cardinal rule when it comes to
sorting mail _ never open window envelopes (unless it's payday) or
anything addressed to Current Resident. It's always junk so why
risk a paper cut?
</P>
<P>
   But today I blew it. Greed got the best of me. This one looked
</P>
<P>
   like a check and who am I to sneeze in the face of fortune? I
ripped it open. Rats! No money _ just another load of hype. Seems
some folks in Mission Viejo, Calif. want to loan me some big bucks
on my house _ and the dummies don't even know if the plumbing
works.
</P>
<P>
   'Dear Elizabeth,' they begin which kind of annoys me. We've
never met and already they're calling me by my first name. They go
on to tellme how pleased they are to inform me that my home has
recently been verified as '...eligible for a low interest trust
deed in the amount shown above.' I check the amount. They've got to
be nuts. Besides, I have no idea what a 'low interest trust deed'
is. I suspect it has to do with, 'Here, little girl, take this nice
money and sign here. We'll be around to grab your house on
Thursday. Don't bother to take the cats or the Steinway - we own
them too.'
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I begin to wonder how somebody all the way out in
</P>
<P>
   California knows my house is worth anything. How do they know it
isn't a falling-down dump with blown-out plastic over the windows?
Or do they care? I read on.
</P>
<P>
   They're telling me that if the amount shown on the pseudo-check
is not enough they'd be happy to boost the ante _ even if (get
this) my property has no equity and my credit's lousy. Golly, gee
whiz! What nice folks.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to hurry. It doesn't say why, only that '...due to
the
</P>
<P>
   large volume we are currently receiving...' It doesn't say
volume of what. Maybe if I don't call right away they'll just be
out of the mood.
</P>
<P>
   After all, giving away large amounts of money is bound to be a
little nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   There's even an example of what their money can do for me. They
tell me that if I'm making monthly credit card payments of $420 and
a car loan payment of $385, for a total of $805, I'm probably in
big trouble and they really want to help me out. They want me to
know I have a 'friend' out there whose sole aim in life is to bail
my backside out of pernicious penury.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on me for being suspicious, but I have a few questions
like:
</P>
<P>
   Where did these clowns get their information? Who sold my
personal life to the vultures? And just how stupid do they think I
am?
</P>
<P>
   In the name of fairness, I've decided to answer their offer:
</P>
<P>
   'Dear Unnamed Moneylender:
</P>
<P>
   You're wasting your time _ and mine.
</P>
<P>
   It may surprise you to know that not everyone in America is up
to his or her hipboots in debt. There are generations of us who
grew up with the old-fashioned work ethic strongly intact: Work for
it _ pay for it _ and if you can't afford it, don't haul it home in
the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever told us the economy owed us a thing. When our kids
needed braces, we didn't take off for two weeks in Acapulco on the
plastic. And we never bought into the notion that a kid growing up
without a television, a VCR, and a big-buck stereo of his very own
was a candidate for a call from Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, we were able to avoid buying into the belief that
without $150 sneakers and designer jeans our kids would become
social outcasts and be forever doomed to a life of tedious
mall-walking.
</P>
<P>
   To a multitude of Americans, credit cards are a convenience _
not a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   So to all of you wannabe Shylocks, strike my name from your
mailing list and get a real job. You don't have to pay my bills for
me and I'm sure as hell not going to pay yours for you.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Not at risk
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: China trip a success, tentatively
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's long trip to China was somehow oddly
distanced, as if the event were unreal, a virtual presidential trip
rather than a palpable one. It was watched at home with seeming
indifference, just another of those occasions of no better than
passing interest that unreel on the nightly news and have type
ladled over them in newspapers mainly out of a vestigial sense of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Has the busy effort to enscandal the Clinton presidency finally
reached the point where the only thing that counts is the latest
tweak in l'affaire Lewinsky or newest arcanum shaken from the
impenetrable muddle of ancient Whitewater and the real business of
the presidency is just time out?
</P>
<P>
   It does not seem to matter that all the -gates have so far
repaid expectations with only a market basket of small potatoes.
The Clinton presidency no longer has much, if anything, to do with
governance. It's just more tabloid TV, a niche production
positioned somewhere between ``Hard Copy'' and ``Entertainment
Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   China is emerging as a major player in world affairs. It is
revving up an economic engine that in time could displace Japan's
as Asia's most powerful. Its military is large and troublesome in
its willingness to hawk technology to other regions' bully boys.
Beijing's geopolitical aims are unclear, probably even to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In short, China matters, a great deal. And Sino-American
relations have been at best shaky since Beijing cruelly quashed a
popular movement for democracy, yet neither nation can afford the
risks of miscalculation that would be inevitable in disengaged
antagonism. The two very different systems must find ways safely to
manage those differences.
</P>
<P>
   In that, President Clinton appears to have succeeded, at least
tentatively. He has carried the bilateral relationship past the
horror of Tiananmen Square but without compromising American
principles. Clinton firmly reiterated U.S. support for human rights
and democracy, emphasized the world's interest in seeing China's
massive pollution brought under control and even spoke up for
Tibet, an especially touchy point with the Chinese autocracy.
</P>
<P>
   No, there were no major breakthroughs, but then none had been
intended or expected. The trip itself was the breakthrough, and all
the more so for President Jiang Zemin's willingness to let the
American president make his points directly to nationwide Chinese
audiences. If that is precedent, the quality of all international
relations with Beijing will have been jumped several places
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the television networks kept their news stars home, as if
the trip were just something White House spinners had cooked up to
take the anchors' eyes off the ball, the mother of all photo ops.
No Gunga Dan this time. No risk Peter Jennings might be caught
abroad _ as he was covering the pope in Cuba _ if another bimbo
erupted. NBC sent Geraldo Rivera, as if to tell the president just
where he stands.
</P>
<P>
   The whole occasion seemed a strange temporal refraction, as if
carried to us from some familiar-seeming but still exotic parallel
universe, one in which Bill Clinton really, really is president. In
their begrudged and sometimes scoffing coverage, the TV networks
made it clear they weren't going to fall for that.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 27,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

 &HT;    Cyberscene: There's always someone to talk to
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So you'd like to have a little chat?
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people use the Internet as a way to make friends and
have typed conversations with them using one of the many chat
services there. You'll find plenty of do's and don'ts about
chatting with strangers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But, other than to say that it's just common sense not to tell
anonymous strangers your name, telephone number, address or any
personal information, this article isn't about the right and wrong
of chat. Instead, it'll guide you to places where you can get the
software you need, sites that offer instruction on how to use chat,
and even offer a brief course in chat etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at one of the best Web sites for basic chat
information. It's not a commercial site and that makes the complete
information and terrific links all the more impressive. The start
page is called Internet Relay Chat and can be found at
http://hoga.wwa.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)edge/irc.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a beginner, you'll find the Newbie section especially
helpful. In simple language, you'll be able to cover topics such
as: How to get Hooked up, Servers and How to Connect, Join Channels
and Communicate with Others.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've learned what to do and why you might like to do it,
you'll need the computer programs that let you reach some of the
Internet Relay Chat areas. That's another nice feature of this
page: It also has links to downloads for the chat programs. You'll
be able to download the programs free and the page offers software
for almost any computer platform you can name (and some you
probably have never heard of) including Unix, Windows, DOS,
Macintosh, OS/2, VMS, Amiga and X-Windows.
</P>
<P>
   There are several choices for most platforms. My favorite
software programs for Windows and Macintosh chatting are both
available from this site. I'd select a program called mIRC for
Windows and IRCle 2.1 for Macintosh computers. But, since these
programs are free, you may want to download a couple and find
something that suits your own tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're connected and online with other chatters you'll
notice that a lot of abbreviations and special terms are used. If
you want to sound like you've been around for a while, you may want
to drop in on a page called Chatter's Jargon Dictionary at
http://www.tiac.net/users/scg/jargpge.htm. You'll soon learn that
if someone is ROFL they're ``rolling on the floor laughing'' or if
they tell you something IMHO, it's ``in my humble opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   So far we've talked about the type of chat that is known as IRC.
But there is a new breed of chat on the Net that goes beyond
typing. It's called virtual worlds. In most of these Web-based chat
services, you'll be able to see a cartoonish representation of the
person you visit with.
</P>
<P>
   There are way too many virtual chat services to list them all.
If you want to explore that type of chat, there's an excellent
collection of links from the Yahoo search engine at 
http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Internet(underscore)Games/Virt
ual (underscore)Worlds/3D(underscore)Worlds/.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who are only casually interested in chat and do not
want the trouble of downloading chat programs may want to check out
some of the Web-based chat services. In most cases, you need
nothing more than your Web browser to chat there. Again, there are
literally dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web chat services. So you
should start with another group of Yahoo sites at 
http://www.yahoo.com/Computers(underscore)and(underscore)Internet/In
ter net/World(underscore)Wide(underscore)Web/Chat/.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Check it out. We'll chat more later.

 &HT;    Cystic fibrosis sufferer keeps defying the odds
 &HT;    By Kevin Wishard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Bobby Hogberg was born in 1959, children
like him who had cystic fibrosis were expected to live 10 years.
Little was known about the disease or how to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Hogberg, 38, has beaten the odds. His fight has required a
rigorous regimen of therapy and repeated hospitalizations. But
Hogberg, who lost two sisters to the childhood disease, never gave
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't be alive today,'' Hogberg said recently. ``But you
can't let those feelings seep in, because if you do, you're halfway
to giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hogberg is in a Houston hospital fighting for his health
once again. This time, he's trying to overcome a stomach blockage
that is symptomatic of cystic fibrosis and hold on to the new lungs
transplanted into his chest in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hogberg, a resident of Georgetown, is among the 6 percent of
cystic fibrosis patients alive today who are 35 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal inherited disease among
whites. In 1970, doctors projected a life expectancy of 18 years
for children diagnosed with the disease, which affects the body's
ability to ward off infections and restricts breathing and
digestion. Victims usually die from lung damage caused by the
buildup of thick mucous and chronic infections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, scientists discovered a gene that, when defective,
causes cystic fibrosis in 90 percent of cases. The discovery has
led to promising gene research and new treatments that thin mucus
and improve lung function. Those developments and an increased
emphasis on nutrition and diet have resulted in the number of
patients 18 and older nearly doubling in the past 10 years.Today,
the life expectancy for babies born with cystic fibrosis is 45
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Frank, a pediatrician who treats Hogberg and about 70
other cystic fibrosis patients in the Austin area, said Hogberg's
spirit and determination to get better have worked in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tried new therapies . . . and he has not got
discouraged, even though for the past two to three years he's had
one problem after another,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogberg was among the first to try a hand-held device called the
Flutter, which sends strong vibrations through his chest cavity,
helping to clear mucus collecting in his lungs. He also was among
the first to benefit from Pulmozyme, which thins mucous.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved a second
groundbreaking drug, TOBI, an inhaled antibiotic developed from
tobramycin. It delivers a concentrated dose directly to the site of
the lung infections.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, Hogberg was placed on the list of prospective
transplant recipients. In February, just a month after his father's
death, Hogberg was told to get to Houston as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-hour surgery was difficult because Hogberg's lungs were
severely damaged. Scar tissue from previous infections had built up
between the lungs and the bones protecting them. A few days later,
he had more surgery to remove blood clots that were preventing his
lungs from working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Then he faced another problem: His kidneys were damaged during
the prolonged surgery, and he needed dialysis for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he began to recover, believing the prayers offered by
his family and friends had been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just taking that first breath _ that was what I had fought for
for so long. . . . It was exhilarating,'' Hogberg said after
returning home in April. ``I wasn't wearing oxygen, and my fingers
and my lips were pink.'' amily history
</P>
<P>
   One in 20 people are symptomless carriers of cystic fibrosis,
which strikes children who inherit the defective gene from both
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Barbara Hogberg had three children before they realized
they were carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene. In 1956 the couple
buried their first daughter, Karen, before she was 2, without
knowing she had suffered from cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hogbergs' second daughter, Patti, was diagnosed with
the disease in 1960 at age 2,they realized the illness was probably
responsible for Karen's death. Doctors tested Bobby when he was 3,
discovering that he, too, carried the defective gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I denied it because he was such a healthy child,''
Barbara Hogberg said. ``He was a typical boy who just got into
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, Patti's health was poor, while Bobby
played sports and kept pace with his peers. His breathing
difficulties didn't surface until puberty. About that time, a month
before her 15th birthday, Patti died.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hogberg began to realize his life would not be normal. His
parents began clapping his chest and back for 30 minutes three
times a day to clear his lungs. But he continued to play baseball
and golf and race motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hogberg never doubted her son would outlive others
struck by cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's determined and hard-headed and had an attitude that this
was not going to beat him,'' she said. ``And his father always told
him that Hogbergs never quit. Hogbergs don't moan and whine.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, many more cystic fibrosis patients will live as long as
Hogberg has without a lung transplant, which has long been
considered the final treatment option, physicians say.
</P>
<P>
   Older patients
</P>
<P>
   The medical community, which had left the treatment of cystic
fibrosis largely to pediatricians, recently began adapting to the
aging population of cystic fibrosis survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we looked up and said, `Oh, my God, we've got adults,
and we've got a lot of them,' '' said Linda Ward, clinic
coordinator for the cystic fibrosis care center at Santa Rosa
Children's Hospital in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Now older patients are facing health problems such as high blood
pressure, osteoporosis and back pain.
</P>
<P>
   The transition is challenging for patients who are being asked
to take responsibility for their care and for parents who have
always been involved in their children's health care decisions,
said Dr. Steven Copenhaver of Scott &AMP; White hospital in Temple.
Physicians are trying to integrate the adult care at the 113 care
centers around the nation. In Texas, those centers are in Dallas,
Houston and San Antonio. Satellite care centers are in place at
Brackenridge Children's Hospital in Austin and at Scott &AMP; White in
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common problems triggered by the complications of
cystic fibrosis in older patients are diabetes and rheumatic
diseases. Pregnancies also are difficult. Men who suffer from
cystic fibrosis are sterile, and about 30 percent of women are
infertile.
</P>
<P>
   Hogberg's outlook
</P>
<P>
   At just over 6 feet tall, Hogberg weighs less than 130 pounds.
He's a proud, independent man who built a courier business that has
suffered during his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at myself in the mirror and thought, `That's me with
no oxygen on, and I'm not winded,' '' he said soon after the
transplant. ``I thought, `God, it worked.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, he was released from the Houston
hospital. He returned the oxygen tanks that had been a virtual
lifeline and began trying to rebuild muscles that had shrunk from
years of inactivity. He hoped he had won a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told him to expect to return to the hospital for
adjustments in the balance of drugs needed to keep his body's
immune system from rejecting his new lungs, which came from a
16-year-old boy who died in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   He's been in three times, the current stay now extending into
its eighth week .
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said Friday that he had undergone additional
surgery and was having trouble eating.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Westergren, lung transplant coordinator at The Methodist
Hospital, said Hogberg's resilient nature is an inspiration to
those who have worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby just shows an enormous amount of raw courage,'' she
said. ``To keep hanging in there, knowing the odds are against him.
There's always the chance that the disease will win, but he's
fought it for so many years and won that I wouldn't put it past him
to fight it for years to come.

 &HT;    Commentary: Rise and shine, it's vacation time
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ On vacations, there are basically two kinds of
people: those who relax and those who can't.
</P>
<P>
   The first kind arrive at their destination ... and flop. They
sleep in late, eat a leisurely breakfast, take long naps in the
afternoon, sit around reading books, have long, not-very-animated
discussions, eat some more, go to bed. The pace is slow, there are
no schedules, no agendas, no itineraries. No sightseeing, no
tourist attractions, no visits with anyone other than those they
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the other kind of people. The manic ones. They're
up at the crack of dawn, have a moment-by-moment itinerary, go at a
full-out pace the entire day, schedule in just enough hotel time to
shower and change, and then they're off again. No minute is left
unfilled. Every attraction within 100 miles is toured and recorded
in their travel journal with preprinted brochures and vistaview
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Any relative within driving distance is visited. At 6 a.m. every
morning, they're leaning over your peacefully sleeping face,
saying, ``Ready? We've got a big day ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Each to his own, I say. Unless you're in my family. We are
primarily vacationers of the first ilk. In other words, we go
someplace to do nothing, and we are very happy in our idleness.
Extrememly so.
</P>
<P>
   There is one in our family, however, who is of the other ilk.
He's a go-getter, a rise-and-shine kind of guy, a
what-are-you-waiting-for man. He usually annoys the heck out of us.
</P>
<P>
   We recently returned from a vacation, so the memories of this
difference in styles is fresh in my mind. Drilled into my
subconscious, if you will. Like a root canal.
</P>
<P>
   While four of us sprawl haphazardly in our temporary abode,
reading or sleeping or watching old movies on TV, this son is in
our faces, demanding action.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that there is some expectation that comes with a
vacation. We do plan about one event a day _ a trip to the beach or
pool, a movie, a good restaurant, an amusement park. The usual
stuff. It's just that this son expects us to participate in at
least four major events daily. I don't have that much energy. And
what I do have, I want to save.
</P>
<P>
   He, on the other hand, can become bored quicker than a
two-by-four.
</P>
<P>
   Our recent trip was to my folks' farm in Missouri. There's not a
lot of attractions for the visiting tourist in their little town.
In fact, things are so slow that visiting the new Wal-Mart ranks
right up there with a trip to Disney World. I kid you not.
</P>
<P>
   My folks waited months for this new shopping mecca to rise in
their midst. I got weekly long-distance updates on its progress:
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got the steel shell up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting the outside walls on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooh, they're pouring the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't been this excited since their town got a Golden
Corral.
</P>
<P>
   So, for our let's-go son, a daily trip to Wal-Mart was an
absolute must. This, the son who will not step foot in the Wal-Mart
in his own hometown. But when we visit the grandparents, suddent
it's (IT)the(RO) place to go. Actually, it's the only place to go.
</P>
<P>
   He comes back from his daily trips like Magellan reporting to
the queen on the wonders of the New World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found these great shirts for under $20!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these neat necklaces, and I couldn't believe the
prices!''
</P>
<P>
   So, when we arrived back home, I thought he would be thrilled
when I pointed out the construction site of our new Super Wal-Mart.
Imagine the departments it will have. A SUPER Wal-Mart, after all,
would be extraordinary. Much better than a regular Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   He idly looked out the window of our car as we drove past and,
once again on his own turf, muttered, ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, well. We always take for granted the wonders in our own
back yards, don't we?

 &HT;    COLUMN: Lure of junk mail too much to pass up
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ I have a cardinal rule when it comes to
sorting mail _ never open window envelopes (unless it's payday) or
anything addressed to Current Resident. It's always junk so why
risk a paper cut?
</P>
<P>
   But today I blew it. Greed got the best of me. This one looked
</P>
<P>
   like a check and who am I to sneeze in the face of fortune? I
ripped it open. Rats! No money _ just another load of hype. Seems
some folks in Mission Viejo, Calif. want to loan me some big bucks
on my house _ and the dummies don't even know if the plumbing
works.
</P>
<P>
   'Dear Elizabeth,' they begin which kind of annoys me. We've
never met and already they're calling me by my first name. They go
on to tellme how pleased they are to inform me that my home has
recently been verified as '...eligible for a low interest trust
deed in the amount shown above.' I check the amount. They've got to
be nuts. Besides, I have no idea what a 'low interest trust deed'
is. I suspect it has to do with, 'Here, little girl, take this nice
money and sign here. We'll be around to grab your house on
Thursday. Don't bother to take the cats or the Steinway - we own
them too.'
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I begin to wonder how somebody all the way out in
</P>
<P>
   California knows my house is worth anything. How do they know it
isn't a falling-down dump with blown-out plastic over the windows?
Or do they care? I read on.
</P>
<P>
   They're telling me that if the amount shown on the pseudo-check
is not enough they'd be happy to boost the ante _ even if (get
this) my property has no equity and my credit's lousy. Golly, gee
whiz! What nice folks.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to hurry. It doesn't say why, only that '...due to
the
</P>
<P>
   large volume we are currently receiving...' It doesn't say
volume of what. Maybe if I don't call right away they'll just be
out of the mood.
</P>
<P>
   After all, giving away large amounts of money is bound to be a
little nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   There's even an example of what their money can do for me. They
tell me that if I'm making monthly credit card payments of $420 and
a car loan payment of $385, for a total of $805, I'm probably in
big trouble and they really want to help me out. They want me to
know I have a 'friend' out there whose sole aim in life is to bail
my backside out of pernicious penury.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on me for being suspicious, but I have a few questions
like:
</P>
<P>
   Where did these clowns get their information? Who sold my
personal life to the vultures? And just how stupid do they think I
am?
</P>
<P>
   In the name of fairness, I've decided to answer their offer:
</P>
<P>
   'Dear Unnamed Moneylender:
</P>
<P>
   You're wasting your time _ and mine.
</P>
<P>
   It may surprise you to know that not everyone in America is up
to his or her hipboots in debt. There are generations of us who
grew up with the old-fashioned work ethic strongly intact: Work for
it _ pay for it _ and if you can't afford it, don't haul it home in
the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever told us the economy owed us a thing. When our kids
needed braces, we didn't take off for two weeks in Acapulco on the
plastic. And we never bought into the notion that a kid growing up
without a television, a VCR, and a big-buck stereo of his very own
was a candidate for a call from Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, we were able to avoid buying into the belief that
without $150 sneakers and designer jeans our kids would become
social outcasts and be forever doomed to a life of tedious
mall-walking.
</P>
<P>
   To a multitude of Americans, credit cards are a convenience _
not a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   So to all of you wannabe Shylocks, strike my name from your
mailing list and get a real job. You don't have to pay my bills for
me and I'm sure as hell not going to pay yours for you.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Not at risk
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sweet and single Teresa is really a burly truck driver
named David from Montana, married, with tattoos and kids. And the
wealthy neurosurgeon you met last night is a lonely schoolteacher
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Let's chat about chat and the people you meet there.
</P>
<P>
   Chat is a feature you'll find in several forms on the Internet.
Most Internet veterans who like to chat online use IRC -- Internet
Relay Chat -- to have typed conversations with strangers. There are
also chat programs that run directly on Web pages and need no
special software. But the idea behind all the various ways of
chatting is to be able to have a conversation using the Internet
instead of the telephone or two rocking chairs on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   I started using chat almost as soon as it became available on
the Internet. And I met some nice people there, folks who became
real-world friends. I'm glad I met them and that sort of thing is
still possible. But the Net was a smaller and friendlier place back
then. I hate to sound elitist, but -- as the Internet has grown --
there's been a dumbing down. It's no different than the way
broadcast television progressed. In the Golden Age of television,
the screen was filled with classic variety shows, intelligent
comedy and original plays. There has been an inevitable lowering of
taste to fit the lowest common denominator both on television and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of frightening stories about really scary people
-- criminals of various types -- who use the Internet to meet their
victims. That threat of physical harm is an important reason to be
careful on chat and with e-mail acquaintances. But, that's not the
topic for today. Instead, let's talk about some real concerns I
have about chat that have more to do with the threat it can pose to
your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying chat is evil, or the people
you meet there are somehow lesser humans than the folks you'd find
hanging around the community swimming pool or sitting at the tables
of your favorite coffeehouse or bar. But I am saying that -- unlike
the people you meet in the real world -- there are fewer ways to be
able to use your common sense and intelligence to judge how worthy
David or Teresa is to be a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to my example of the people you'd meet at the
community swimming pool. Let's say you pull up a chair in the shade
and strike up a conversation with the people sitting nearby. Right
away, you're able to tell how old they are, what sex they are, and
just get a general impression of how they act. Almost certainly, if
you talk longer than five minutes, you'll learn their names and
perhaps where they work.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about how chat works on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, unlike on ``Cheers,'' nobody knows your name. You
use a nickname. And since there are no controls over what nickname
you choose, David can become Teresa if he decides that would be
fun. All of a sudden things are very much like they'd be if
everyone you meet at the swimming pool is wearing a disguise and a
mask.
</P>
<P>
   Humans being human, this anonymous world tempts a lot of people
to indulge in some fantasy. Not all of it is bad or even harmful. A
bald middle-aged guy like me can become a 22-year-old soccer player
with curly blond hair. An unemployed person can briefly become the
chief technical officer for a large corporation. Who's to know?
And, if you don't take the folks you meet in the chat areas
seriously, what does it matter anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That's just my point and the thing that I most dislike about
chat. At best, most of what you do there really doesn't matter. You
may spend hours a week chatting with Ben72 or MaryBeth98, get to
know them and even get to care about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But try calling up ole Ben72 some morning when your car won't
start and ask him for a ride. With rare and wonderful exceptions,
the people you meet there are cyber-friends. They'll hold your hand
electronically or listen to your troubles with a keen ear. But,
when the real world intrudes, often as not they aren't around and
don't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm suggesting that most people who spend hours a week making
cyber-friends would have happier and better lives if they put the
same amount of time and effort into making real-world friends.
Friends in the real world can be inconvenient and aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   These friends don't come with on/off switches. And that, to me,
is their virtue.

 &HT;    Actress Bullock has role in real estate
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Actress Sandra Bullock may be best known for her
roles as an Internet whiz and a damsel in distress, but in Austin,
she's building a reputation as a real estate investor.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who already is building a house on Lake Austin, is
apparently behind a partnership that bought the 48-year-old
Stratford Arms office building at 500 W. Sixth St. downtown.
</P>
<P>
   A deed filed in the Travis County Courthouse June 23 shows that
the building was purchased in cash by a Louisiana limited
partnership from Elba Restaurant Corp. Real estate brokers and
others say that Bullock is one of the partners. The asking price
for the building, which went on the market in December, was $1.65
million, according to Kemp Management, which marketed the property.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's Austin attorney, Ken Campbell, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old actress of ``Speed'' and ``The Net'' fame has
made a splash since making Austin her home last year. She filmed
much of her recent movie, ``Hope Floats,'' in Central Texas.
Bullock is the latest in a series of owners of the four-story,
14,481-square-foot Stratford Arms. With its high ceilings, brick
walls and fireplaces, the former apartment building is one of
downtown's more unusual office properties.
</P>
<P>
   Besides just being a good investment, there could be other
reasons why Bullock might be interested in an office building: Her
new production company, Fortis Films may be looking for space.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Mythology and marketing of movie soundtracks
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Featuring new songs by L.L. Cool J, Puff
Daddy, Ice-T and the Lox!''
</P>
<P>
   As a film critic, nothing galls me more than this sort of
screaming pronouncement in a movie trailer. My response, never mind
if I'm a fan of the bands or not, invariably goes like this: Who
gives a $%&AMP;!!
</P>
<P>
   Will I rush to a movie predicated on the hope I will hear a
fleeting splinter of a Smashing Pumpkins song? Is the movie
improved because it's garnished with a nanosecond of the latest
Celine Dion gum drop or even a healthy serving of Red Hot Chili
Peppers? To me, that would be like going to a movie because of the
cozy seats and lovely company.
</P>
<P>
   Piggybacking pop music on a movie is a dicey _ and thoroughly
cynical _ marketing ruse. Dicey because when some of us are tipped
off Will Smith is going to rap in a movie, we want God to tell us
what extravagant sin we're paying for.
</P>
<P>
   Cynical because these pop tunes, unlike a film's original score
_ you know, the instrumental stuff generally performed by a
tuxedo-clad orchestra, not a braying drum machine and a guy with
nouns and serial initials for a name _ are more often than not
irrelevant to the film's craftsmanship. They are songs grafted onto
the completed product, not organic outgrowths of what the film is
trying to say. For instance, please, tell me, what does any Ben
Folds Five song have to do with ``Godzilla''? Anyone? (Besides, I
don't remember hearing any pop songs in ``Godzilla,'' save for Puff
Daddy's ``Come to Me'' blaring over the closing credits, the
crushingly bad movie's highlight.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that pop music can't be responsibly employed. It has, in
fact, been wonderfully used, colorfully enhancing and commenting
upon a film's action. ``The Big Chill,'' ``Goodfellas,'' ``Dazed
and Confused'' and ``Boogie Nights'' are clear examples of pop
music complementing narrative. A more recent instance is the
terrific use of Aerosmith's ``Sweet Emotion'' in ``Armageddon,'' a
film which is in large part a marathon music video, as was the
sensory-throttled ``Top Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   But those films are in a different category. Most of them are
period pieces or the uncamouflaged offspring of MTV. A pop song
becomes a sign-post of place and time. Mass marketing these
soundtracks is a no-brainer. ``Forrest Gump'' was crammed with
period pop that made everybody tingly. So it's not surprising, or
objectionable, that a double-CD of 32 songs from the movie was
released. Gauche and opportunistic, sure, but there are worse
compilations you can own.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm really objecting to is the piecemeal degradation of the
traditional, instrumental movie soundtrack, the nauseating notion
that many so-called ``soundtracks'' are not soundtracks at all.
They are unblushing marketing tools, greedy catalogs of pop music
``inspired by'' a film. It's a hilarious concept to ponder:
Apparently, a bunch of bands have found a movie so darn stirring,
they just had to write a catchy ode to it.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. ``Dead Man Walking: Music Inspired by the
Motion Picture'' and the ``inspired by'' disc for ``The Horse
Whisperer'' are two rare collections of American roots music whose
songs might never have seen the light of day without the impetus of
Hollywood's slavering marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do with a sickly blunderbuss such as ``Godzilla: The
Album''? And, possibly more offensive, is this desperate example of
marketing avarice: `` `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT' INSPIRES TWO SPECIAL
ALBUMS.'' So reads a press release from DreamWorks Records, which
goes on to detail how the company will release a pair of pop-laden
records ``inspired by'' DreamWorks' animated epic ``The Prince of
Egypt'' _ two months before the movie hits the cineplex in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The albums ``will present songs that are inspired by themes
inherent to the film's story,'' pants the release. ``This marks the
first time that two complete albums from different musical genres
(there will be a country album and an R&AMP;B album) have been created
in support of a film release.''
</P>
<P>
   And hopefully the last.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't all be so unseemly if these pop albums didn't elbow
the film's actual scores into obscurity. Once, many Survivor and
Kenny Loggins movie anthems ago, starchy European-style composers
made music for films, small symphonies that roiled the emotions
hand-in-hand with the story on screen. Max Steiner (``Gone with the
Wind,'' ``Casablanca''), Bernard Herrmann (``Citizen Kane,''
``Vertigo''), Elmer Bernstein (``To Kill a Mockingbird'') and
Alfred Newman (``Wuthering Heights'') scored Hollywood's golden
years.
</P>
<P>
   Today populist classical composers such as Jerry Goldsmith
(``Patton,'' ``Chinatown''), Ennio Morricone (``The Good, the Bad,
and the Ugly,'' ``The Exorcist''), John Williams (``Jaws,'' ``Star
Wars'') and James Horner (``Titanic'') keep the tradition alive
with fitting orchestral bombast. Several former pop stars have
trained their chops on composing classical Hollywood soundtracks,
often with spectacular results. Former Oingo Boingo frontman Danny
Elfman leads the pack with soundtracks for ``The Simpsons,''
``Batman,'' ``Dick Tracy'' and a slew of other blockbusters. You
even can buy a greatest-hits collection of Elfman's theme songs.
Former Police drummer Stewart Copeland provided a beautiful score
for the urban drama ``Fresh,'' which was not released in favor of a
rap-ridden ``inspired by'' disc. Randy Newman and Dire Straits
ax-man Mark Knopfler are old hands at soundtracks. Knopfler's
latest twangy effort was for ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, save for a handful of largely pop-driven titles
(see Top 10 list), soundtracks have never been big business. So
it's not as though this new ``inspired by'' phenomenon is
overshadowing a thriving concern. But it sure doesn't help.
Nowadays we are told, very loudly, what pop acts were hired to
contribute a song to a movie before we hear who wrote and directed
the picture. Movie posters were once art, but increasingly they are
blighted by screaming litanies of bands whose music may or may not
be heard in a film. The person whose name follows ``Music By'' can
be found with binoculars near the bottom of the poster, not far
from the copyright line. In the soundtracks aisle of music shops,
you must be vigilant about what you snatch up, the ``score'' or the
``album.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blame teen-movie maven John Hughes for being the first to
exploit pop music as a powerful movie marketing tool. But where it
started is not half as important as where it could end. Exciting
film composers such as Elfman and Thomas Newman (``The Player'')
may be usurped by crass mercantilism, their scores supplanted by
Tori Amos or Foo Fighters covering a pop oldie, which is happening
more and more.
</P>
<P>
   How thrilling it once was to buy, say, John Williams' grandiose
soundtrack to ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' No Led
Zeppelin cover tunes, just unfettered orchestral bombast,
mini-symphonies with relevant titles such as ``Main Title and
Mountain Visions'' and ``The Appearance of the Visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   And so thank goodness for ``Titanic.'' Say what you will about
the film, James Horner's aggressively traditional, classical score
is smashing records for soundtrack sales. The Academy Award-winning
score currently is catching its breath at No.15 on the Billboard
Top 200 (not the fuddy-duddy classical charts), where it has
resided for an astonishing 28 weeks and has sold 24 million copies,
making it the No. 1 best-selling movie score of all time. Though
people may be buying the disc for Celine Dion's hit (``My Heart
Will Go On''), they wind up being seduced by Horner's richly
evocative score. The album is jostling on the charts with the pop
soundtracks to ``City of Angels,'' ``Hope Floats'' and, yes,
``Godzilla: The Album.''
</P>
<P>
   (Dubiously, a sequel album titled ``Back to Titanic,'' featuring
music performed on the ship in the movie and new compositions by
Horner, will be released next month. So much for a perfect world.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Horner's ``Titanic'' is a beacon of hope in the
dispiriting arena of soundtracks, an S.O.S. flare in the cold night
sky. Perhaps there is hope for the invisible composers and their
overlooked work. Perhaps Megadeth and Fiona Apple won't triumph
after all. And perhaps filmgoers are listening a little closer to a
crucial part of what makes movies what they are.

 &HT;    Hopwood appeal lawyers take case personally
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a nearly 40-year-old memory, but it helps
Harry Reasoner explain why his law firm has donated $2 million in
free legal services _ and has pledged more _ to defend affirmative
action at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While in college in the late 1950s, Reasoner took a construction
job and became friends with a helpful foreman, who was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me once, `I would like to have your advice on
something. I need to teach my children that they should step off
the sidewalk when white children walk past. What do you think I
should tell them?' '' Reasoner said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner, who is white, paused in the retelling. ``I'm still
working on my answer,'' he finally said. ``You'd like to think it
is not true today . . . but we're a long way from a colorblind
society.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of Houston-based Vinson &AMP; Elkins, the law firm
representing UT without charge in the Hopwood affirmative action
case, Reasoner, 58, is not proud of the lack of diversity on his
own legal staff. Without affirmative action in higher education, he
fears it would be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting minorities is very difficult for us, and if the
University of Texas Law School does not have a diverse student
body, that will make it increasingly difficult,'' he said. ``We are
frustrated and unhappy with our efforts in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 442 Vinson &AMP; Elkins lawyers who work in Texas _ another
112 work out-of-state and internationally _ 6 percent are black or
Hispanic, according to the State Bar of Texas. And that's 1 or 2
percentage points higher than the other two largest law firms in
Texas. Forty percent of Vinson &AMP; Elkins' lawyers are UT law
graduates, including the nationally prominent Reasoner.
</P>
<P>
   Self-interest aside, there are other reasons Vinson &AMP; Elkins is
leading UT's fight against Hopwood, a 1996 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruling that led to a dismantling of affirmative action
programs in Texas colleges and declines in minority enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   Ties that bind
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unusual for a law firm to do such free work for a
</P>
<P>
   public institution, Reasoner is a big believer in pro bono work,
other Texas lawyers said. He also has deep ties to UT.
</P>
<P>
   A 1962 UT law graduate, Reasoner met his wife, Macey, at the law
school when they were students. He worked as an assistant to her
father, Gus Hodges, a longtime law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The Reasoners' son and daughter are UT Law School graduates, and
Reasoner is president of the school's fund-raising arm, founded in
1952 with help from Charles Francis, then a Vinson &AMP; Elkins
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also does business with the 15-campus UT System.
</P>
<P>
   The system paid Vinson &AMP; Elkins $705,000 in fees and expenses
from Sept. 1, 1993, through May 1998. Except for firms that handle
UT's costlier medical malpractice suits, Vinson &AMP; Elkins' payments
were second only to those of Houston's Arnold, White &AMP; Durkee, UT
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins also represents the UT Investment Management
Co., a private entity that handles UT investments and the Permanent
University Fund. It paid the firm $173,406 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Reasoner said the work his firm does for UT had no bearing
on his decision to take on Hopwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel very deeply that giving access to education
to all of our citizens is vital if the state is to survive and
prosper,'' he said. ``I feel also, if the University of Texas
School of Law does not have a diverse student body, the students
who are there will suffer. You can't remain a top-notch law school
without diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The right lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins will stay in the case as long as it takes,
Reasoner said. UT is appealing to the 5th Circuit and hopes to go
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Reasoner has pledged free
lawyer time and will bill only for expenses, such as copy charges
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Some civil rights lawyers are not thrilled that a big, white law
firm _ one that often defends corporate clients against minorities
in employment discrimination suits _ is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the conservative law firms that represents the
status quo,'' said Al Kauffman, regional counsel for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``All these firms have
been fighting against our interests for years.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund are trying to intervene
in the appeal, arguing that they do not believe the firm can
adequately represent minority interests.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the first trial, UT instructed Vinson &AMP; Elkins
lawyers not to attack the validity of the Law School Admissions
Test, even though the test's ability to predict academic
performance is questionable. The minority groups seeking to
intervene in the case ``wanted the LSAT challenged, and the
administration did not,'' Reasoner acknowledged. ``I don't have any
personal expertise to evaluate the LSAT.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier decades, civil rights firms commonly represented
minorities in education discrimination suits. These days, as
universities are sued for reverse discrimination by whites, schools
often are represented by established, predominantly white law firms
assisting the state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Attorney General Dan Morales bowed out of Hopwood,
saying he personally does not support racial considerations and did
not think an appeal could succeed. He agreed, however, to let
outside counsel take over.
</P>
<P>
   Because Vinson &AMP; Elkins had been aiding Morales all along, UT
was eager for it to continue. Reasoner had tried the case before
the federal district court in Austin and argued before the 5th
Circuit. He plans to argue in the second round of appeals. A second
private firm _ Carrington, Coleman, Sloman &AMP; Blumenthal of Dallas _
and three UT law professors also are working on the case for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a remarkable and very positive thing if UT
had hired nationally known minority advocates,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Farabee, UT System general counsel and vice chancellor, said
lawyers for MALDEF and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund represent their
organizations, not the broader interests of a university. Besides,
he said, UT is being sued by MALDEF in an education finance case.
</P>
<P>
   Farabee said UT could not go wrong with Vinson &AMP; Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Reasoner is one of the deans of Texas lawyers,'' he
said. ``He is one of the most able trial lawyers in America. We
were extremely fortunate to have nearly $2 million thus far of pro
bono service.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner said that while he would welcome the intervention of
MALDEF and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, he sees Vinson &AMP; Elkins'
involvement as positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it's a healthy thing that an establishment
firm that's predominantly white is willing to participate in this
issue,'' Reasoner said. ``We filed a response and said, clearly,
this a momentous public issue; clearly MALDEF and the NAACP
represent people who have a very deep and direct interest in the
matter and . . . in the interest of justice, they ought to be
heard.'' That doesn't mean that Vinson &AMP; Elkins will not fight
hard, Reasoner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear understanding with our client that we are to
make every legitimate argument to overturn Hopwood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pro bono pro
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner, who is more active in the courtroom than many managing
partners of other big law firms, last year successfully defended
CBS's ``60 Minutes'' in a libel case over its report on poor living
conditions in certain El Paso colonias, unincorporated rural
subdivisions that often lack basic services. In 1989, he won a
$1.035 billion judgment for a coal slurry pipeline company that
sued the railroads in an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   After the UT Law School was sued in 1992 by Cheryl Hopwood and
three other white students who contended they were denied admission
so less-qualified blacks and Mexican Americans could get in,
then-Dean Mark Yudof called Reasoner for help. A conservative
Washington firm, the Center for Individual Rights, jumped in to
represent two plaintiffs and was hiring a team of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner said Morales' office would have been hard-pressed to
match those resources, so Vinson &AMP; Elkins agreed to provide free
help some months before the first trial, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins is considered a pro bono leader, said Julie
Oliver, executive director of the Texas Lawyers Care Program, a
legal services support project of the State Bar of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the firm agreed to give its lawyers the same
credit for pro bono work as for hours billed _ a key performance
indicator for lawyers. Most firms give no credit for free hours,
said Scott Atlas, a Vinson &AMP; Elkins attorney who chairs the Law
Firm Pro Bono Project of the Pro Bono Institute and the American
Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put our money where our mouth is,'' said Beverly Reeves, an
Austin Vinson &AMP; Elkins lawyer on the Hopwood team.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the firm's pro bono cases have been highly controversial
_ and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins successfully represented Texas inmates fighting
censorship. Atlas spent years working to free a Mexican national
wrongly convicted of murder at a cost of $2.5 million to Vinson &AMP;
Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years on death row in Texas, Ricardo Aldape Guerra was
released in April 1997 and got a job acting in a Mexican soap
opera. He died in a car wreck four months later.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins does about $230 million worth of business a
year, and Atlas estimated the firm donated about $5 million in pro
bono work last year.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner said that while some partners and clients aren't happy
the firm is fighting Hopwood, he never wants to shy away from
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a law firm just to make money _ that demeans a great
profession,'' he said. ``Lawyers are obligated to give back. For
me, participating in Hopwood is an opportunity to participate in
one of the great issues of our time.''

 &HT;    Hartsfield's new air cargo space almost ready
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hartsfield International Airport officials are set to
hand over the keys this month to the first tenants in a major $34.5
million expansion of international air cargo operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway Cargo Service will occupy the first of three
104,000-square-foot buildings on the south side of the airport. Two
more buildings are under construction, and a fourth will be bid out
later. When the total project is completed, it will add more than
400,000 square feet, doubling the current space of 352,000 square
feet now operating on the north side of the runways.
</P>
<P>
   The airport also has operated a 42,000-square-foot cold storage
operation for handling perishable food products.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion is aimed at attracting new business to Hartsfield,
where Delta Air Lines is the biggest single cargo hauler with 32
percent of the volume. Delta is not one of the carriers being
courted by the airport for the new space.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are still under way on the lease, but Gateway
Terminal Manager Ray Haulk said he hopes to get in the building by
July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway has 50 to 60 contracts with different airlines to handle
their freight, Haulk said. The new facility will more than double
Gateway's employment from 40 to 100 workers. The operation is
expected to move 500,000 pounds of freight a day.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway operates at 10 U.S. airports and contracts with such
international airlines as KLM, Nippon, Swiss Air and British
Airways, Haulk said.
</P>
<P>
   International air cargo is the single-fastest growing activity
at Hartsfield. Through April, it had increased 32 percent from the
same period last year, up to 78,320 metric tons from 59,272 metric
tons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the airport handled 203,000 metric tons of
international cargo with an estimated value of $7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic growth is attributable to a booming region, said
Robert Kennedy, who oversees Hartsfield's air cargo operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a diversified manufacturing base in the Southeast that
is the biggest contributor to our growth,'' Kennedy said. ``Now, we
are getting air service that used to be trucked elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield funded the cargo expansion with airport revenues.
Airport officials say they must expand and modernize air cargo
facilities or face the prospect of losing business to other nearby
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, N.C., Columbus, Ga. and Huntsville, Ala., are
considered Hartsfield's closest rivals for cargo.

 &HT;    New airport chief puts planning atop itinerary
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Benjamin DeCosta has put completion of a master plan
for Hartsfield International Airport's future and keeping current
construction projects on track among his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta, who assumed his duties June 29, told his senior staff
those items were atop his list. He was the general manager of
Newark International Airport in New Jersey before replacing Angela
Gittens, whom Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell did not reappoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport is operating at near-capacity,'' DeCosta said in
an interview at the airport. ``It's growing 7 to 8 percent (a
year), and we need to invest in its capacity, if we are to maintain
high levels of customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Major projects under way include building a fifth runway to land
commuter airplanes, a 400-square-foot expansion of air cargo
operations and putting domestic gates on Concourse E, the
international gateway at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, a Master Plan Coordinating Committee has
been trying to come up with a formula to meet the growth in air
travel through 2015, when annual passenger volume at Hartsfield is
expected to be 121 million, compared to 68 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee _ comprised of 40 members representing the
airlines, business, local governments neighboring the airport and
citizens _ in its only vote opted for a no-build option in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, airport designers have been trying to come up with a
revised expansion scenario the committee could accept. The options
call for a new sixth runway either north or south of the airport
and a new terminal, concourse and cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   The no-build vote was led by Clayton County, Ga. representatives
who have voiced opposition to any new runway construction in the
county and south Fulton County, Ga. residents and business people
who say new runways will destroy their neighborhoods and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta said he is evaluating how to proceed with the Master
Plan process, because of the direction Campbell wants to see the
airport go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has a vision that the airport is key to the success
of Atlanta and the region,'' DeCosta said. Throughout the city
administration, everyone seems to support ``keeping the airport
strong and making its contribution to the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new general manager spent the first week on the job walking
around introducing himself and trying to give people a feel for his
management style, which boils down to ``just call me Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta said the Southern tradition of using the polite courtesy
title struck him as the biggest cultural difference between the
Northeast and Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I've met here refers to me as Mr. DeCosta,'' DeCosta
said. ``Even at the manager and high levels everywhere, they say
Mr. DeCosta. At Newark, I'm called Ben. I even sign my memos Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta has a straightforward approach to managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm famous for walking around the airport with a camera,''
DeCosta said. He takes the photos back to staff meetings and hands
them out to the staff with instructions to ``fix that,'' DeCosta
said.

 &HT;    Some think Atlanta traveling down the same road as L.A.
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Is traffic-clogged Atlanta the next Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   So asked the headline on a recent story in The Wall Street
Journal, which wondered whether smog and traffic congestion were
harming Greater Atlanta's reputation as a pleasant place to live.
The comparison was inspired in part by comments from Chris
Leinberger, director of the real estate consulting firm Robert
Charles Lesser &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is not in danger of becoming the next Los Angeles,''
Leinberger has said in speeches around the country. ``It is the
next Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' snorts Harry West, director of the Atlanta
Regional Commission, the metro area's planning agency. ``We may be
worse in some ways, but to suggest we're L.A. when they have a
population of 18 million is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to traffic and untrammeled growth, those who
have lived in both places don't find the comparison such a stretch,
based on 100 responses to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution call-in
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous because this place doesn't even have a third
of the people of L.A., but its traffic is as bad or worse in some
ways,'' said caller Adrienne Affleck, who commutes an hour each way
from her home in east Cobb County to work in Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there. Not almost there -- we're there,'' said Lee
Gilmer of Alpharetta, who recalled moving from L.A. to Atlanta in
1990 and laughing at people who complained about traffic. That has
changed, he said. ``Having to commute on (Ga.) 400 every morning
there's little doubt that Atlanta has achieved the nightmare that
L.A. has been experiencing for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suggests the two regions compare in scale. The L.A.
statistical area encompasses six times as much real estate as
Atlanta's. L.A. has about twice as many miles of freeway as metro
Atlanta. But for all its storied reliance on automobiles, motorists
tally 13 more miles per day per person in Atlanta on average than
those of Los Angeles, and about twice the proportion of commuters
ride transit to work in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Several themes emerged from callers:
</P>
<P>
   -- Although congestion on L.A. freeways is an all-day affair,
Atlanta may be more frustrating because tie-ups can occur almost
anywhere on the area's meandering, often overbuilt arterial roads.
Los Angeles also is ``supported by a large network of grid surface
streets to give you options when the freeway is clogged,'' as one
caller put it.
</P>
<P>
   -- Freeway driving may be more stressful in Atlanta, because the
weather is more erratic and visibility is lower thanks to hillier
terrain, high sound walls and concrete barriers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Atlanta drivers are more aggressive and less courteous.
</P>
<P>
   -- Although vastly more expansive, L.A.'s sprawl allows easier
access to and from freeways and more sidewalks, bikeways and parks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Atlanta has an advantage over L.A. because it has a rapid
rail system in place.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Southern California's smog is worse.
While Atlanta's ozone problem is labeled ``serious'' according to
federal health standards, L.A. is all alone in the ``extreme''
category. But aggressive measures over the last few years have all
but eliminated L.A.'s ``red alert'' days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people here are taking the air quality situation
as seriously as they are in Los Angeles,'' said Bernie Goldfine of
Acworth. ``Their air is getting better, and ours is not.''

 &HT;    Coke bottles feature NASCAR drivers
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Coca-Cola Co. is hoping NASCAR fans and Coca-Cola
memorabilia collectors will race out to snap up a series of nine
Coke-Cola Classic bottles featuring some of the sport's most
popular drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-ounce bottles feature Dale Earnhardt, Dale Jarrett, Bobby
Labonte, Bill Elliott, Jeff Burton, Kyle Petty, Todd Bodine and
Ricky Rudd _ all members of ``the Coca-Cola Racing Family.'' A
ninth bottle commemorates Coca-Cola's designation as the official
soft drink of NASCAR. Six-packs of the limited-edition bottles are
now being rolled out, and full national distribution is expected by
the end of the NASCAR season this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this will be one of the most popular limited-edition
bottles series we've ever issued,'' said Andrew Angle, senior vice
president of Coca-Cola USA and general manager of Coca-Cola USA
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its bottlers issue between 130 and 150 different
commemorative bottles each year, featuring everything from the
Olympics and the Super Bowl to classic portraits of Santa Claus.
The NASCAR bottles could end up creating a trading frenzy among
fans, because not all of the bottles will be sold in every market,
a Coca-Cola spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's five-year agreement with NASCAR began Jan. 1, when
the company snagged the sponsorship away from rival Pepsico Inc.,
which held it for more than 40 years. Coca-Cola is spending an
estimated $30 million on the sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, meanwhile, on Thursday renewed its agreement to be the
exclusive soft drink supplier to Daytona International Speedway.
Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Pepsi gained exclusive pouring rights at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway and four Penske Motorsports Inc.
tracks. The company is the title sponsor of four races, including
the Pepsi 400, which was postponed from this weekend until October
because of serious wildfires near Daytona International Speedway.

 &HT;    Cyberscene: There's always someone to talk to
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So you'd like to have a little chat?
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people use the Internet as a way to make friends and
have typed conversations with them using one of the many chat
services there. You'll find plenty of do's and don'ts about
chatting with strangers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But, other than to say that it's just common sense not to tell
anonymous strangers your name, telephone number, address or any
personal information, this article isn't about the right and wrong
of chat. Instead, it'll guide you to places where you can get the
software you need, sites that offer instruction on how to use chat,
and even offer a brief course in chat etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at one of the best Web sites for basic chat
information. It's not a commercial site and that makes the complete
information and terrific links all the more impressive. The start
page is called Internet Relay Chat and can be found at
http://hoga.wwa.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)edge/irc.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a beginner, you'll find the Newbie section especially
helpful. In simple language, you'll be able to cover topics such
as: How to get Hooked up, Servers and How to Connect, Join Channels
and Communicate with Others.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've learned what to do and why you might like to do it,
you'll need the computer programs that let you reach some of the
Internet Relay Chat areas. That's another nice feature of this
page: It also has links to downloads for the chat programs. You'll
be able to download the programs free and the page offers software
for almost any computer platform you can name (and some you
probably have never heard of) including Unix, Windows, DOS,
Macintosh, OS/2, VMS, Amiga and X-Windows.
</P>
<P>
   There are several choices for most platforms. My favorite
software programs for Windows and Macintosh chatting are both
available from this site. I'd select a program called mIRC for
Windows and IRCle 2.1 for Macintosh computers. But, since these
programs are free, you may want to download a couple and find
something that suits your own tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're connected and online with other chatters you'll
notice that a lot of abbreviations and special terms are used. If
you want to sound like you've been around for a while, you may want
to drop in on a page called Chatter's Jargon Dictionary at
http://www.tiac.net/users/scg/jargpge.htm. You'll soon learn that
if someone is ROFL they're ``rolling on the floor laughing'' or if
they tell you something IMHO, it's ``in my humble opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   So far we've talked about the type of chat that is known as IRC.
But there is a new breed of chat on the Net that goes beyond
typing. It's called virtual worlds. In most of these Web-based chat
services, you'll be able to see a cartoonish representation of the
person you visit with.
</P>
<P>
   There are way too many virtual chat services to list them all.
If you want to explore that type of chat, there's an excellent
collection of links from the Yahoo search engine at 
http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Internet(underscore)Games/Virt
ual (underscore)Worlds/3D(underscore)Worlds/.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who are only casually interested in chat and do not
want the trouble of downloading chat programs may want to check out
some of the Web-based chat services. In most cases, you need
nothing more than your Web browser to chat there. Again, there are
literally dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web chat services. So you
should start with another group of Yahoo sites at 
http://www.yahoo.com/Computers(underscore)and(underscore)Internet/In
ter net/World(underscore)Wide(underscore)Web/Chat/.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Check it out. We'll chat more later.

 &HT;    Americans consumed by love affair with debt
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Poets and songwriters have long warned us that love
can make people do crazy things. But the lust for bigger kitchens
and designer clothes also can cause people to act as impulsively as
young lovers who can't see beyond the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The good economy has stirred up our consumer hormones to the
point where millions of Americans are falling for the come-on lines
from bankers who promise cheap mortgages and big credit lines.
Instead of rationally evaluating the offers, we swoon and surrender
to lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Our affair with debt began in earnest about five years ago when
credit card issuers started smothering us with letters promising
easy credit. About 2 billion ``pre-approved'' credit card
solicitations are now sent to U.S. consumers each year.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh plastic in their palms, many shoppers make rash
purchases before considering the consequences of their wild moments
in the mall. Since 1993, credit card debt has doubled, while the
savings rate has slid to about half what it was in the early 1980s.
Predictably, record numbers of borrowers are filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, amid our economic boom, another absurdity is developing:
the percentage of homeowners late with their mortgage payments is
rising. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America recently
reported that in the first three months of this year, mortgage
delinquencies rose to 4.47 percent, up from 4.34 percent in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Why did mortgage delinquencies increase during a period when
unemployment rates were falling and incomes rising?
</P>
<P>
   Late payments started climbing because many borrowers have begun
getting stung by loans that allowed them to purchase homes beyond
their price range. For example, a borrower might have used a very
low-interest, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) a few years ago to buy
a big house. But now that the introductory rate has ended, the
monthly payment has moved up, leaving the homeowner struggling to
keep pace. Meanwhile, rising property tax assessments brought on by
a hot real estate market have increased the financial burden of
owning a home.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, of course, ARMs can be useful. A young
couple with freshly minted college degrees might choose an ARM
because they can be fairly certain their incomes will rise fast
enough to keep pace with interest-rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, people who aren't expecting big jumps in income
are using ARMs to pry their way into pricey homes. In some intown
neighborhoods of Atlanta, housing prices have increased by 30
percent in the past year. Instead of buyers saying, ``Whoa, I'm
just not going to pay $300,000 for a two-bedroom bungalow,'' they
are listening to the real estate agents and lenders who keep
looking for ways to make the deal work.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of years, a sudden jump in interest rates could
drive up monthly mortgage payments and at the same time burst the
real estate price bubble. Today's eager home buyers could find
themselves falling behind on rising loan payments while trying to
hang on to a house with a declining market value.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as late 1997, economists were finding shreds of
evidence that suggested Americans might be slowing their spending
enough to pay down debts and increase savings. But that turned out
to be only a brief breather between trips to the mall. This year,
exuberant spending on housing and consumer goods is taking on an
ardor that could leave millions of Americans broken-hearted in the
next recession.

 &HT;    Austin-Bergstrom's cargo facilities offer new opportunities,
room to grow
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On a cool, windy day in late October, a FedEx
jumbo jet took off into the overcast Austin sky en route to Japan,
carrying only two human passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the plane housed 80,000 pounds of food belonging to
its exotic cargo _ 156 Texas-bred ostriches. It marked the first
time live cargo left from an Austin airport, and the only time a
local airport has had enough room to land the McDonnell Douglas
MD-11, one of FedEx's largest airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never have done anything like that at (Robert Mueller
Municipal Airport),'' said Jamy Kazanoff, spokeswoman for
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. ``There wouldn't have been
enough room for the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Transporting live cargo is just one of many firsts for the
airport cargo facility since it moved to Austin-Bergstrom one year
ago last week. Passengers aren't scheduled to start flying from the
new airport until May 1999, but cargo operations are running at
full throttle out of the new airport, with tonnage hitting record
highs and percent growth in the double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening the 155,000-square-foot warehouse area, almost
four times bigger than Mueller's, carriers have moved 209 million
pounds of cargo _ 33 percent more than was moved during the
previous 12 months at Mueller. Cargo shipments include anything
from letters to fully assembled computers to thoroughbred
racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   Austin CargoPort Development, the private company that owns the
cargo space, spent $20 million to develop the site. Today, eight
national and international carriers lease space there, including
FedEx, Airborne Express and EAGLE USA Airfreight, whose parent
company EAGLE USA has a contract with Round RockAustin-based Dell
Computer Corp. United Parcel Service in March added two planes at
Austin-Bergstrom, citing Austin as one of the fastest-growing cargo
markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of ``cargo (handled) now is where we predicted it
would be in 2012,'' Kazanoff said. ``It's been phenomenal. It's
growing at three times the national rate (of 5 percent).''
</P>
<P>
   The boom in Austin's air freight industry is a product of the
large number dearth of technology-related companies in the area,
Kazanoff and others said. Several big companies like Motorola Inc.
make parts that are shipped out-of-state for packaging, and with a
competitive, fast-paced technology market, those companies want
components delivered cheaply and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech shipments are driving the market,'' said Holland
Young, an airport planner for the City of Austin. ``Those
high-value components tend to be low-weight, so it pays for those
companies to ship them by air because it's not real expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Since CargoPort's two buildings opened on June 30, 1997, the
surge in cargo activity also has lured more developers to
Austin-Bergstrom's tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, developer Aeroterm U.S. Inc., which owns the
now-vacant Mueller cargo space, broke ground on a $10 million
project at the new airport that will add another 110,000 square
feet of warehouse space by February 1999. Young said a third
developer plans to build a warehouse for use by passenger jets that
haul cargo on their flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aeroterm is hoping to bring to Austin an international (cargo)
carrier that isn't already here,'' said Aeroterm Vice President
Michael Bradley. ``Some of them operate from our building in
Montreal, and we want to bring them here. Austin will be very
competitive with Houston and San Antonio _ it'll be substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin's burgeoning air freight industry now
surpasses that of San Antonio International Airport, carrying more
tonnage and occupying more space. Still, the amount of cargo space
at Austin-Bergstrom is half the size of Houston's George Bush
Intercontinental Airport. And it handles substantially less cargo
than Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, through which
two-thirds of all Texas' cargo passes. At Austin-Bergstrom, bigger
runways and more space have helped cargo carriers, too. At Mueller,
cargo companies struggled to leave on schedule because of the cargo
facility's proximity to the passenger terminal _ delivery trucks
had to maneuver around all the other traffic on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx took advantage of Austin-Bergstrom's warehouse space to
build a mini-hub. With the mini-hub, packages sent across town
remain in the city instead of getting routed through an
out-of-state hub, like they used to at Mueller. In October, Emery
Worldwide will also lease a 25,000-square-foot warehouse at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is money, and the extra space gives us more efficiency,''
said Bruce Dumler, Emery's general manager. ``If you decrease the
amount of time on the ramp (loading area), it makes it easier for
drivers to meet delivery deadlines. There's much more room here,
and it makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the new cargo space almost caught airport
planners by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, while drawing the early blueprints for
Austin-Bergstrom, only 20 million pounds of cargo moved through
Mueller Airport, so planners forecast little demand for more space.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in 1993, Young said, prompting the need for more
cargo space. But Mueller was already cramped, so officials decided
to begin seeking developers for Austin-Bergstrom's warehouses with
the goal of moving cargo operations there as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, airport planners gave the cargo industry ample room
to grow with Austin. As high-tech companies expand and the business
climate remains favorable for small start-ups, demand for cargo
shipments can only increase, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand was huge, and we knew if we didn't move soon, we'd be
constraining that demand, which constrains economic growth,'' Young
said. ``It (Mueller) was bad _ it was horrible. It got terribly
congested on the ramp. It was a bad situation altogether. We're
glad to have solved that problem.''

 &HT;    Small businesses in the South saw slowest growth rate
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern small businesses_ considered the leader among
small businesses _ had the slowest growth rate in the nation during
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the tight labor market, according to a national
quarterly survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the advantages the South had always had was that labor
was pretty cheap,'' said Roger Harris, president of Padgett
Business Services, an Athens, Ga.-based accounting tax firm that
specializes in small businesses and conducts the quarterly surveys.
``Now, it's catching up. To find good people, it costs more.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the nation rode a wave of growth between
January and March (10.4 percent increase in operating income),
small business owners in the South reported an 8.6 percent drop in
operating income.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not losing money, their rate of growth is not as
strong as it has been,'' Harris said. He cautioned against making a
snap judgment about the performance until second quarter results
are released in early August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could turn around the next quarter. I don't want to be too
alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey polled 3,865 small businesses, most in the retail and
service industries. The companies employ fewer than 20 workers.
Padgett began the survey, which looks at business patterns by
region, in 1992. Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Total sales were up in all four regions. With the exception of
the South, operating income was up as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wages continued to increase in all four regions, with the West
recording the largest increase at 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite positive national results in the first quarter, small
business owners predict slow stagnant second quarter sales and slow
job growth for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very disturbing,'' said Dan Sautner, Padgett chairman.
``Given the second quarter always has been the strongest for small
businesses, these predictions, if accurate, could turn 1998 into an
exceptionally challenging year.''

 &HT;    Hopwood appeal lawyers take case personally
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a nearly 40-year-old memory, but it helps
Harry Reasoner explain why his law firm has donated $2 million in
free legal services _ and has pledged more _ to defend affirmative
action at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While in college in the late 1950s, Reasoner took a construction
job and became friends with a helpful foreman, who was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me once, `I would like to have your advice on
something. I need to teach my children that they should step off
the sidewalk when white children walk past. What do you think I
should tell them?' '' Reasoner said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner, who is white, paused in the retelling. ``I'm still
working on my answer,'' he finally said. ``You'd like to think it
is not true today . . . but we're a long way from a colorblind
society.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of Houston-based Vinson &AMP; Elkins, the law firm
representing UT without charge in the Hopwood affirmative action
case, Reasoner, 58, is not proud of the lack of diversity on his
own legal staff. Without affirmative action in higher education, he
fears it would be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting minorities is very difficult for us, and if the
University of Texas Law School does not have a diverse student
body, that will make it increasingly difficult,'' he said. ``We are
frustrated and unhappy with our efforts in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 442 Vinson &AMP; Elkins lawyers who work in Texas _ another
112 work out-of-state and internationally _ 6 percent are black or
Hispanic, according to the State Bar of Texas. And that's 1 or 2
percentage points higher than the other two largest law firms in
Texas. Forty percent of Vinson &AMP; Elkins' lawyers are UT law
graduates, including the nationally prominent Reasoner.
</P>
<P>
   Self-interest aside, there are other reasons Vinson &AMP; Elkins is
leading UT's fight against Hopwood, a 1996 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruling that led to a dismantling of affirmative action
programs in Texas colleges and declines in minority enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   Ties that bind
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unusual for a law firm to do such free work for a
</P>
<P>
   public institution, Reasoner is a big believer in pro bono work,
other Texas lawyers said. He also has deep ties to UT.
</P>
<P>
   A 1962 UT law graduate, Reasoner met his wife, Macey, at the law
school when they were students. He worked as an assistant to her
father, Gus Hodges, a longtime law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The Reasoners' son and daughter are UT Law School graduates, and
Reasoner is president of the school's fund-raising arm, founded in
1952 with help from Charles Francis, then a Vinson &AMP; Elkins
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also does business with the 15-campus UT System.
</P>
<P>
   The system paid Vinson &AMP; Elkins $705,000 in fees and expenses
from Sept. 1, 1993, through May 1998. Except for firms that handle
UT's costlier medical malpractice suits, Vinson &AMP; Elkins' payments
were second only to those of Houston's Arnold, White &AMP; Durkee, UT
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins also represents the UT Investment Management
Co., a private entity that handles UT investments and the Permanent
University Fund. It paid the firm $173,406 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Reasoner said the work his firm does for UT had no bearing
on his decision to take on Hopwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel very deeply that giving access to education
to all of our citizens is vital if the state is to survive and
prosper,'' he said. ``I feel also, if the University of Texas
School of Law does not have a diverse student body, the students
who are there will suffer. You can't remain a top-notch law school
without diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The right lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins will stay in the case as long as it takes,
Reasoner said. UT is appealing to the 5th Circuit and hopes to go
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Reasoner has pledged free
lawyer time and will bill only for expenses, such as copy charges
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Some civil rights lawyers are not thrilled that a big, white law
firm _ one that often defends corporate clients against minorities
in employment discrimination suits _ is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the conservative law firms that represents the
status quo,'' said Al Kauffman, regional counsel for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``All these firms have
been fighting against our interests for years.''
</P>
<P>
   MALDEF and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund are trying to intervene
in the appeal, arguing that they do not believe the firm can
adequately represent minority interests.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the first trial, UT instructed Vinson &AMP; Elkins
lawyers not to attack the validity of the Law School Admissions
Test, even though the test's ability to predict academic
performance is questionable. The minority groups seeking to
intervene in the case ``wanted the LSAT challenged, and the
administration did not,'' Reasoner acknowledged. ``I don't have any
personal expertise to evaluate the LSAT.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier decades, civil rights firms commonly represented
minorities in education discrimination suits. These days, as
universities are sued for reverse discrimination by whites, schools
often are represented by established, predominantly white law firms
assisting the state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Attorney General Dan Morales bowed out of Hopwood,
saying he personally does not support racial considerations and did
not think an appeal could succeed. He agreed, however, to let
outside counsel take over.
</P>
<P>
   Because Vinson &AMP; Elkins had been aiding Morales all along, UT
was eager for it to continue. Reasoner had tried the case before
the federal district court in Austin and argued before the 5th
Circuit. He plans to argue in the second round of appeals. A second
private firm _ Carrington, Coleman, Sloman &AMP; Blumenthal of Dallas _
and three UT law professors also are working on the case for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a remarkable and very positive thing if UT
had hired nationally known minority advocates,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Farabee, UT System general counsel and vice chancellor, said
lawyers for MALDEF and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund represent their
organizations, not the broader interests of a university. Besides,
he said, UT is being sued by MALDEF in an education finance case.
</P>
<P>
   Farabee said UT could not go wrong with Vinson &AMP; Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Reasoner is one of the deans of Texas lawyers,'' he
said. ``He is one of the most able trial lawyers in America. We
were extremely fortunate to have nearly $2 million thus far of pro
bono service.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner said that while he would welcome the intervention of
MALDEF and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, he sees Vinson &AMP; Elkins'
involvement as positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it's a healthy thing that an establishment
firm that's predominantly white is willing to participate in this
issue,'' Reasoner said. ``We filed a response and said, clearly,
this a momentous public issue; clearly MALDEF and the NAACP
represent people who have a very deep and direct interest in the
matter and . . . in the interest of justice, they ought to be
heard.'' That doesn't mean that Vinson &AMP; Elkins will not fight
hard, Reasoner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear understanding with our client that we are to
make every legitimate argument to overturn Hopwood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pro bono pro
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner, who is more active in the courtroom than many managing
partners of other big law firms, last year successfully defended
CBS's ``60 Minutes'' in a libel case over its report on poor living
conditions in certain El Paso colonias, unincorporated rural
subdivisions that often lack basic services. In 1989, he won a
$1.035 billion judgment for a coal slurry pipeline company that
sued the railroads in an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   After the UT Law School was sued in 1992 by Cheryl Hopwood and
three other white students who contended they were denied admission
so less-qualified blacks and Mexican Americans could get in,
then-Dean Mark Yudof called Reasoner for help. A conservative
Washington firm, the Center for Individual Rights, jumped in to
represent two plaintiffs and was hiring a team of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner said Morales' office would have been hard-pressed to
match those resources, so Vinson &AMP; Elkins agreed to provide free
help some months before the first trial, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins is considered a pro bono leader, said Julie
Oliver, executive director of the Texas Lawyers Care Program, a
legal services support project of the State Bar of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the firm agreed to give its lawyers the same
credit for pro bono work as for hours billed _ a key performance
indicator for lawyers. Most firms give no credit for free hours,
said Scott Atlas, a Vinson &AMP; Elkins attorney who chairs the Law
Firm Pro Bono Project of the Pro Bono Institute and the American
Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put our money where our mouth is,'' said Beverly Reeves, an
Austin Vinson &AMP; Elkins lawyer on the Hopwood team.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the firm's pro bono cases have been highly controversial
_ and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins successfully represented Texas inmates fighting
censorship. Atlas spent years working to free a Mexican national
wrongly convicted of murder at a cost of $2.5 million to Vinson &AMP;
Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years on death row in Texas, Ricardo Aldape Guerra was
released in April 1997 and got a job acting in a Mexican soap
opera. He died in a car wreck four months later.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson &AMP; Elkins does about $230 million worth of business a
year, and Atlas estimated the firm donated about $5 million in pro
bono work last year.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoner said that while some partners and clients aren't happy
the firm is fighting Hopwood, he never wants to shy away from
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a law firm just to make money _ that demeans a great
profession,'' he said. ``Lawyers are obligated to give back. For
me, participating in Hopwood is an opportunity to participate in
one of the great issues of our time.''

 &HT;    Baylor University may phase out use of live bears as mascot
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Baylor University is considering phasing out its
tradition of using a live bear as its mascot, according to
spokesman Larry Brumley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past when we retired bears we found new homes for them
at zoos and wildlife parks,'' Brumley said. ``Now we're running
into challenges finding acceptable places for the bears to retire
to. That's part of what's driving this.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has used live bears as mascots since World War I, when a
bear named Ted was given to the university by the Army's 107th
Engineers after they received orders to leave Camp MacArthur in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The two bears now acting as mascots are Ginny, 2 1/2, and Bill
Boyd, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Baylor has trotted out the bears at football
games, both at home and away. However, the school's entry into the
far-flung Big 12 conference has restricted the mascots' traveling
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baylor's away games are getting farther and farther away,''
Brumley said. ``It's really become impractical to take a live
mascot along.''
</P>
<P>
   Brumley also said athletic directors are increasingly refusing
to allow live mascots brought into stadiums for liability reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor had planned to bring in a cub this year as a replacement
for Ginny, the younger bear taken to games for the last two years.
However, difficulty in finding a new home for Ginny scotched those
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing a bear is not like placing a dog,'' said Rosie
Roegner(NO)cq(RO), nongame permit coordinator for Texas Parks and
Wildlife. ``Black bears require a special diet _ you just can't go
down to the store and get bear chow _ and special facilities.
They're not easy to place.''
</P>
<P>
   Roegner said Baylor's permit allows it to keep its bears on
public display ``for educational purposes.'' The permit is good
until Aug. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor used to place its former mascots in zoos and wildlife
parks such as the defunct Texas Safari in Clifton. However, Roegner
said such sites are no longer hungry for out-of-work bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black bear is a rare species, but it's not something
people go out of their way to see,'' she said. ``Zoos are not eager
to get them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the Baylor Chamber of Commerce, the campus organization
that looks after the mascots, raised $2,500 to build the first
permanent home for the school's bears. The so-called Bear Pit gave
way in 1977 to a plaza across from the student center that features
a large roaming area, a waterfall and a viewing area for
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor bears have marched in homecoming parades, been
photographed with governors and even a president. Ronald Reagan
helped Abner the Bear down a Dr Pepper during a 1980 campaign stop
in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's most famous mascot was a former carnival bear named Joe
College. Yell leader Bill Boyd _ for whom one of the present
mascots was named _ bought the bear, who started the famous routine
of drinking soda water at Baylor games in the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Joe College's popularity endured even after his death. His head
was mounted and hung over the scoreboard at Rena Marrs McLean
Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   But Baylor's use of a live mascot came under attack in 1991 from
a San Antonio wildlife park director: Lynn Cuny, director of
Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation, which had taken in a former
Baylor mascot. Cuny called it inappropriate for a school educating
young people to act responsibly to use an endangered animal as a
mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Brumley said the school still receives correspondence
questioning its practice of having live mascots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as an aggressive campaign, but it's
something we're taking into consideration,'' Brumley said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to keep the tradition of having live
mascots will be made by the Chamber of Commerce and the
administration. Don't look for a decision until at least fall,
Brumley said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is decided, Baylor could continue to have a live mascot
for a number of years to come, said the Chamber of Commerce's
faculty adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the professional trainers tell us Ginny is healthy
and doing well, there's no reason to retire her as mascot,'' said
Steve Sadler, assistant director of the honors program. ``She could
be the mascot for a long time.''

 &HT;    Coke bottles feature NASCAR drivers
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Coca-Cola Co. is hoping NASCAR fans and Coca-Cola
memorabilia collectors will race out to snap up a series of nine
Coke-Cola Classic bottles featuring some of the sport's most
popular drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-ounce bottles feature Dale Earnhardt, Dale Jarrett, Bobby
Labonte, Bill Elliott, Jeff Burton, Kyle Petty, Todd Bodine and
Ricky Rudd _ all members of ``the Coca-Cola Racing Family.'' A
ninth bottle commemorates Coca-Cola's designation as the official
soft drink of NASCAR. Six-packs of the limited-edition bottles are
now being rolled out, and full national distribution is expected by
the end of the NASCAR season this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this will be one of the most popular limited-edition
bottles series we've ever issued,'' said Andrew Angle, senior vice
president of Coca-Cola USA and general manager of Coca-Cola USA
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its bottlers issue between 130 and 150 different
commemorative bottles each year, featuring everything from the
Olympics and the Super Bowl to classic portraits of Santa Claus.
The NASCAR bottles could end up creating a trading frenzy among
fans, because not all of the bottles will be sold in every market,
a Coca-Cola spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's five-year agreement with NASCAR began Jan. 1, when
the company snagged the sponsorship away from rival Pepsico Inc.,
which held it for more than 40 years. Coca-Cola is spending an
estimated $30 million on the sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, meanwhile, on Thursday renewed its agreement to be the
exclusive soft drink supplier to Daytona International Speedway.
Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Pepsi gained exclusive pouring rights at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway and four Penske Motorsports Inc.
tracks. The company is the title sponsor of four races, including
the Pepsi 400, which was postponed from this weekend until October
because of serious wildfires near Daytona International Speedway.

 &HT;    NASCAR seeds planted on West Palm Beach track
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Drivers knew it as ``Palm Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Smiling Lee Petty, Fireball Roberts and Banjo Mathews
raced there in the early days of NASCAR, they were driving what
many racing pioneers still refer to as ``the fastest dirt oval in
the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1949, the old Palm Beach Fairgrounds Speedway off
Southern Boulevard was a half-mile racetrack of crushed shellrock
mixed with oil to prevent dust clouds.
</P>
<P>
   There were other dirt tracks around the country. But ``Palm
Beach'' was special because, unlike most tracks, the oval's two
curves banked at 18 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers wearing fighter-plane goggles ``went in hard and came
out fast'' around those curves, catapulting sideways at 65 mph in
cars like a 1952 Oldsmobile that probably had been borrowed a few
hours earlier from a local car-rental lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could really fly around that thing,'' recalled Ted
Sollohub, 60, who watched races there as a teenager. ``The wall was
just plywood, and they'd hit the wall and go right through it and
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, ``they'd reappear and get back on the track, with
tree limbs sticking out of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly wasn't out of character for a sport historians
say probably started when the second Model T rolled off the line.
According to racing lore, moonshiners transported their product
through the Southern Appalachian mountains in cars with souped-up
engines.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR, formed by Daytona Beach mechanic Bill France, held its
first unofficial race on the hard-packed sand of Daytona Beach in
1948. By 1951, West Palm Beach orchid farmer L.C. Vaughn was
negotiating the first of seven NASCAR races that would be run at
his fairgrounds track over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The track was built just down the road from the Morrison Field
(now Palm Beach International Airport), where oil and equipment
from old World War II planes provided the oil for the race track
and goggles, helmets and seat belts for the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flock won the first race on Jan. 20, 1952, leading his
Hudson Hornet to the 100-mile mark just ahead of Lee Petty and 25
other cars in NASCAR's Grand National inaugural. Flock raced past
the checkered flag after two hours and ``200 grueling laps,''
according to an account by the late Post-Times sports editor Bob
Balfe.
</P>
<P>
   With 6,500 people in the grandstand, Flock accepted the trophy
from racing buff Eddie Brannick, secretary of the New York Giants
baseball team that had won the National League pennant less than
four months earlier on Bobby Thomson's famous home run.
</P>
<P>
   One of Palm Beach's most memorable races was on Feb. 7, 1954,
when Herb Thomas, near the end of a wild duel with Buck Baker,
slammed into the grandstand retaining wall just five yards from the
checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas still managed to finish first. His four wins and $5,150
in prize money at Palm Beach are records. Thomas, 75, doesn't
remember details of the races, but he knew he enjoyed racing at
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right up there with Darlington. It was a nice track. I
never had any trouble with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pit stops at Palm Beach were common for changing tires or
cleaning the oil-puttied dirt from screens protecting the
radiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us half a day to clean the mess, but I loved that
dirt,'' recalled Pat Kenney, a retired driver now living in Stuart.
Kenney's mechanic at Palm Beach was Wendell Yarborough, whose
cousin Cale would go on to become one of racing's most famous
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   James Crowe, who would go on to race stock cars, was a faithful
fan at the Palm Beach track thanks to future Indy 500 winner Al
Keller of Greenacres City. ``My dad wouldn't let me go. So I used
to sneak out of the house,'' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he would wait at the corner of Jog and Lake Worth roads
where Keller, driving a truck that was pulling a trailer carrying
his 1954 Hudson, would let the boy into the cab.
</P>
<P>
   Keller was the first to pass the checkered flag at the last
NASCAR Grand National race at Palm Beach on March 4, 1956. He was
later disqualified for ``a little bumping contest we got into,''
recalled Buck Baker, who was named one of NASCAR's top 50 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   That race was the first run on Palm Beach's newly paved track.
Five years later, Keller was killed in a racing accident in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my hero,'' Crowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's NASCAR races moved north with the construction of
Dayton International Speedway in 1959, but the Palm Beach Speedway
still attracted famous names like Bobby Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Also called Southland Speedway, the Palm Beach Speedway hosted
races until it was demolished after closing in 1983. Its legacy
reaches to modern drivers like Jeff Gordon, a graduate of Palm
Beach Speedway driver Buck Baker's racing school.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who drove a city bus in Charlotte, N.C., when he wasn't
racing, laughed about how the sport has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Jeff Gordon the other day, `Jeff, we helped you make
your money.' He smiled and said, `I know it, Mr. Baker. I know
it.'''
</P>

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Cyber-friends aside, don't forget virtue of real
friends
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sweet and single Teresa is really a burly truck driver
named David from Montana, married, with tattoos and kids. And the
wealthy neurosurgeon you met last night is a lonely schoolteacher
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Let's chat about chat and the people you meet there.
</P>
<P>
   Chat is a feature you'll find in several forms on the Internet.
Most Internet veterans who like to chat online use IRC -- Internet
Relay Chat -- to have typed conversations with strangers. There are
also chat programs that run directly on Web pages and need no
special software. But the idea behind all the various ways of
chatting is to be able to have a conversation using the Internet
instead of the telephone or two rocking chairs on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   I started using chat almost as soon as it became available on
the Internet. And I met some nice people there, folks who became
real-world friends. I'm glad I met them and that sort of thing is
still possible. But the Net was a smaller and friendlier place back
then. I hate to sound elitist, but -- as the Internet has grown --
there's been a dumbing down. It's no different than the way
broadcast television progressed. In the Golden Age of television,
the screen was filled with classic variety shows, intelligent
comedy and original plays. There has been an inevitable lowering of
taste to fit the lowest common denominator both on television and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of frightening stories about really scary people
-- criminals of various types -- who use the Internet to meet their
victims. That threat of physical harm is an important reason to be
careful on chat and with e-mail acquaintances. But, that's not the
topic for today. Instead, let's talk about some real concerns I
have about chat that have more to do with the threat it can pose to
your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying chat is evil, or the people
you meet there are somehow lesser humans than the folks you'd find
hanging around the community swimming pool or sitting at the tables
of your favorite coffeehouse or bar. But I am saying that -- unlike
the people you meet in the real world -- there are fewer ways to be
able to use your common sense and intelligence to judge how worthy
David or Teresa is to be a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to my example of the people you'd meet at the
community swimming pool. Let's say you pull up a chair in the shade
and strike up a conversation with the people sitting nearby. Right
away, you're able to tell how old they are, what sex they are, and
just get a general impression of how they act. Almost certainly, if
you talk longer than five minutes, you'll learn their names and
perhaps where they work.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about how chat works on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, unlike on ``Cheers,'' nobody knows your name. You
use a nickname. And since there are no controls over what nickname
you choose, David can become Teresa if he decides that would be
fun. All of a sudden things are very much like they'd be if
everyone you meet at the swimming pool is wearing a disguise and a
mask.
</P>
<P>
   Humans being human, this anonymous world tempts a lot of people
to indulge in some fantasy. Not all of it is bad or even harmful. A
bald middle-aged guy like me can become a 22-year-old soccer player
with curly blond hair. An unemployed person can briefly become the
chief technical officer for a large corporation. Who's to know?
And, if you don't take the folks you meet in the chat areas
seriously, what does it matter anyway?
</P>
<P>
   That's just my point and the thing that I most dislike about
chat. At best, most of what you do there really doesn't matter. You
may spend hours a week chatting with Ben72 or MaryBeth98, get to
know them and even get to care about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But try calling up ole Ben72 some morning when your car won't
start and ask him for a ride. With rare and wonderful exceptions,
the people you meet there are cyber-friends. They'll hold your hand
electronically or listen to your troubles with a keen ear. But,
when the real world intrudes, often as not they aren't around and
don't want to be.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm suggesting that most people who spend hours a week making
cyber-friends would have happier and better lives if they put the
same amount of time and effort into making real-world friends.
Friends in the real world can be inconvenient and aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   These friends don't come with on/off switches. And that, to me,
is their virtue.

 &HT;    Florida man scammed military, friends as longtime lies surface
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On a sunny June Sunday four years ago,
they played the national anthem just for Jay Casenelli.
</P>
<P>
   He stood at attention and cocked a salute as the colors flew
before him.
</P>
<P>
   His friends from the VFW gathered at the 3220th Army Garrison in
West Palm Beach, drawn by the heroic war story he had told them:
</P>
<P>
   How his Cobra helicopter was shot down near the Laotian border
on that awful day, Feb. 23, 1970, during his second tour of duty in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   How his captors beat him after a failed escape attempt and how
they forced him to curl his 6-foot frame into a 3-foot cage atop a
dung heap.
</P>
<P>
   How his weight fell from 200 pounds to 98 pounds as he pawed the
dirt for the few grains of rice the Viet Cong would throw between
the wooden bars.
</P>
<P>
   How, when liberation finally came after six years, he was
haunted by the faces of the other POWs _ the brothers he was forced
to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   The anthem stopped playing on that June Sunday in 1994 and Jay
Casenelli snapped his salute. All around him admired the POW medal
with the bronze eagle that had just been pinned on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll share this with some ghosts,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Jay Casenelli is himself a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about his war story is true _ not a date, not a detail,
not a word.
</P>
<P>
   He flew no helicopter, endured no beating and suffered no
imprisonment in a wooden cage in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Casenelli spent the Vietnam War years well out of the
reach of the Viet Cong gunfire, in Hazlehurst, Ga., and Marathon in
the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very disheartening,'' said Col. Dave Presley, the Army
officer who had helped Casenelli get his POW medal. ``It looks like
he scammed a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army and Defense Department records show that Casenelli was
not in the military during the 1960s and '70s. The National
Personnel Records Center in St. Louis confirmed Casenelli has no
record of Vietnam service.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Greer, a public affairs officer in Washington with the
Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office, said fraudulent
cases of Vietnam internment continue to cross his desk. Casenelli's
is another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have had a rash of them lately,'' Greer said. ``The
fact is the POW list from Southeast Asia is completely declassified
now. There are no covert operations people who are not on the list.
If you are not on the list, you were not a POW or MIA in Southeast
Asia, and Mr. Casenelli is not on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic misadventure and the good wishes of his friends
enabled Casenelli to receive a POW medal he did not deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Coyner, a public affairs officer with the U.S. Army
Reserve Personnel Command in St. Louis, said the POW medal was sent
to Casenelli because of the recommendation of Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the word of the local base commanders,'' Coyner said.
``We assume they're not lying. But obviously, this was an honest
mistake. We will ask that the medal be rescinded. This is the first
time I've ever seen a case like this _ when we issued a medal that
didn't belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Presley said he wrote the letter to the Army personnel center
supporting Casenelli four years ago because veterans had encouraged
him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got involved because people from his VFW post asked me to
help,'' said Presley, who organized the medal presentation
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   At the VFW Post 4360 lounge in Palm Springs, a Palm Beach Post
article is framed on the wall. The headline reads ``Vietnam veteran
gets POW medal.'' Friends at the VFW who thought they knew
Casenelli were reeling after finding out they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be anyone more shocked than myself,'' said Doug
Byrum, the post commander and a retired Navy chief petty officer.
``I never had an inkling anything like this was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   To join the VFW, veterans are required to submit their DD-214
discharge forms. Officers at the post said they do not have
Casenelli's paperwork or know what he submitted some time during
the early '80s to gain membership.
</P>
<P>
   Byrum said he first met Casenelli about 15 years ago when they
worked together in the small engine repair business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just always assumed he was what he said he was,'' Byrum
said. ``This is very devastating to hear, knowing him as personally
as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Manion, the post commander in '94 and a Vietnam vet, said
Casenelli was an engaging and personable member of the VFW
brotherhood. His black pickup truck had POW vanity plates. He had a
pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed like what he was supposed to be, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that he was that great a storyteller _ it's just
that he was so pleasant every time you saw him,'' Manion said. ``He
seemed like the kind of guy you could believe. We took a lot on
faith, I guess. It makes me sick that we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Casenelli's claim was implausible on its face because of the
time line he presented. As late as last week, he steadfastly
maintained he had been freed by the Vietnamese in 1976 _ three
years after the mass release of nearly 600 American POWs after the
signing of the Paris peace accord. Only Marine Pvt. Robert Garwood,
who was repatriated in 1979, has surfaced since the '73 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe whatever makes you happy,'' Casenelli said last
Tuesday. ``If you want to believe I was in the Florida Keys, then I
guess I was in the Florida Keys.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated requests for documentation of his military
service, Casenelli sent a fax to The Palm Beach Post that read:
``Can NOT provide documentation you requested. Returned to FLA.
Keys sometime after 1973. (Not sure of date or year). Am returning
medal and certificates to Lt. Col. Dave Presley.''
</P>
<P>
   The medal had not been returned as of last Thursday. In another
faxed statement, Casenelli admitted living in Marathon in 1974, not
in a cage in Vietnam as he once maintained. He would not respond to
questions about why he distorted his record.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the family say Casenelli was not known as
``Jay'' until after he moved to Marathon in '74. Before then, when
he lived in Georgia, he was known as Arnold Byron Casenelli, the
name given him at his birth in Kentucky on May 11, 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew him as Arnold,'' said Ada Elton, a former neighbor of
the Casenelli family in Hazlehurst, Ga. ``We knew them quite well
in the early '70s. We saw quite a bit of them and he was always
Arnold or A.B. Casenelli.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she and her husband, Dr. Robert Elton, socialized with
Casenelli and his wife, Pat, in Hazlehurst during the years he
claimed to have been held captive in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.B. was not in the Vietnam War,'' Robert Elton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some time during the mid '70s, Arnold Casenelli started going by
the name ``Jay Angelo'' and listing his birth date as June 5, 1933
_ which is the birth date of his younger sister, Joyce Angela
Casenelli.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the family say when Arnold ceased to be, Jay,
the Vietnam war hero, was born.
</P>
<P>
   Casenelli moved to West Palm Beach in 1984. He taught flying at
the Lantana airport and has worked on airplane engines. In 1991,
friends threw him a surprise party in a hangar at the airport. The
celebration was to mark the 15th anniversary of Casenelli's release
by the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Smith, head of the ladies' auxiliary at the Palm Springs
VFW post, said she has known Casenelli for years and is puzzled his
deception was not uncovered by the veterans he befriended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know how he was able to pull this off,'' Smith
said. ``I can't figure that out. Maybe he was just around people
long enough to tell them his stories and then he backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrum is equally perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew him pretty well,'' he said. ``I guess he
fooled me.''

   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale? Do women live better with men or without them, and
which life will be longer, and which will simply SEEM longer?
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York Times, takes a

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female

Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world

   Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York Times, takes a
crack at answering these questions in a fascinating feature titled
``MEN. ARE WOMEN BETTER OFF WITH THEM, OR WITHOUT THEM?'' It is one

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

Surgeons.
 &UR; By SUSAN GILBERT &QL;

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   Tired of battling doctors, billing clerks, HMOs? May be it's
time to organize, or ``unionize,'' the only unorganized part of
medicine _ the patients! _ writes Robert Lipsyte, author of ``In
the Country of Illness: Comfort and Advice for the Journey.'' ``Our
imperfect union of imperfect people will include the measured
brand-testing of the Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation
of the teamsters' union under Jimmy Hoffa,'' he writes in this
sardonic feature.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary

differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we

</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared

of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Three outrageous ones
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to our respect for love and marriage, for
religion and politics? It's outrageous the way we disparage these
righteous institutions, especially in the jokes we tell.
</P>
<P>
   I submit the following as unconscionable examples:
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous joke No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   A fellow was walking alone on the beach when he spied a swimmer
in trouble way out in the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Not thinking twice, he dove in, swam out to him and rescued him.
Once safely on the beach, it was only then that he noticed how tiny
the man was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saved my life!'' the little man gasped. ``I'm a magic elf.
To reward you I will grant you any three wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure,'' the fellow chuckled. ``Well, magic elf, let's
just call it even.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he waved goodbye and started on down the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But the magic elf, who indeed was a magic elf, couldn't let him
go unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant him great health and great wealth,'' the magic elf
intoned, conjuring up his powers, ``and also a wonderful sex
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years passed. The magic elf was sitting in a tree in
Central Park, as magic elves routinely do, when lo and behold,
coming down the path was the man who saved his life all those years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Hopping from the tree, the magic elf exclaimed, ``Remember me?''
</P>
<P>
   The man, momentarily startled, broke into a wide grin. ``How
could I ever forget you,'' he said, laughing. ``You're the only
magic elf I ever saved from drowning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So how's life treating you?'' the magic elf said,
nonchalantly. ``You look like you're in good health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I ever!'' the man said. ``It's as if my health gets better
and better every year that I grow older. The doctors can't explain
it. It's like a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, like a miracle,'' the elf said, smiling to himself. ``And
you look prosperous as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's even more remarkable,'' the man said. ``Every little
investment I've ever made has turned into a fortune. Nowadays I
have to have two full-time accountants just to keep up with my
money. It's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, indeed,'' the elf said, all the more pleased. ``And how
about the romance department. Has Cupid been kind to you as well?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really wild!'' the man said, waving his arms and
laughing aloud. ``Who'd have ever thought a guy like me would be so
popular with women.'' At this point, he lowered his voice. ``I
don't like to brag, but it's sometimes as often as twice a month.''
</P>
<P>
   The elf frowned. ``Twice a month? That doesn't seem very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The man shrugged. ``For a priest in a small parish,'' he
allowed, ``it's not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous joke No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   A fellow was out working in his yard when a strange funeral
procession passed in front of his house.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hearse followed by a second hearse followed by a man
with a dog followed by some 200 other men walking single file.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow left his yard work and fell in step with the man and
the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to intrude,'' he said, ``but I'm curious as to
whose funeral this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The man with the dog nodded solemnly. ``That first hearse is for
my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,'' the fellow said. ``What happened
to her?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dog bit her and she died,'' the man said, looking straight
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the second hearse?'' the fellow asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for my mother-in-law,'' the man said. ``The dog bit
her, too, and she died.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellow paused for a moment before speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say,'' he asked, ``could I borrow your dog?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in line,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous joke No. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Friday about 2 p.m., the teacher announced to her fourth-grade
class that any of the students who could recite a famous quote and
correctly attribute it would be allowed to leave early.
</P>
<P>
   One little girl immediately jumped to her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A house divided against itself cannot stand. Abraham
Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good,'' said the teacher. ``You may leave early.''
</P>
<P>
   A second girl stood up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to fear but fear itself. Franklin Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent,'' said the teacher. ``You may leave early, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long moment no other child responded. Finally, a
red-haired, freckle-faced boy from the back of the class rose to
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those girls are lying,'' he declared. ``Girls are always
making things up. There's no truth to what they say. Bill Clinton.
See you Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   I only hope you're as outraged as much as I am.

WITHOUT RESERVATIONS: FILMMAKER INTERPRETS MODERN INDIAN LIFE VIA
BUDDIE ROAD MOVIE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has a booming voice that fills a room and a dry wit that
crinkles eyebrows. The 6-foot-2-inch Sherman Alexie has a gentle
handshake, as if he's afraid he'll crush your hand, but he has a
choke-hold on the world's social jugular.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's novels have the bite of a mad dog but rely on the
beauty of the human spirit. The Coeur d'Alene Indian screenwriter
of the critically acclaimed ``Smoke Signals'' considers himself a
reclusive artist but is quick to talk about his childhood and his
political views.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie is difficult to characterize without using the word
``but.'' Fortunately, his literary stylings are less ambiguous. The
31-year-old author has written nine virtuosic books, each with a
different slant on the oft-stereotyped American Indian experience.
All have been commercial and critical successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is the first feature film written, directed
and co-produced by Indians. As its screenwriter, Alexie is proud to
be part of cinematic history.
</P>
<P>
   The film already has garnered the Audience Award and the
Filmmakers Trophy at the most recent Sundance Film Festival. The
``Spitfire Grill'' won the Audience Award in 1996, and ``In the
Company of Men,'' a breakout indie hit, nabbed the Filmmakers
Trophy last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is typical of Alexie's work: rich in
symbolism, peppered with social statements and laced with disarming
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie that challenges the cinematic history of
Indians,'' said Alexie, who grew up on the Spokane Indian
Reservation in Washington state. ``In most films, Indians have been
stoic. That's the stereotype of what Indians are supposed to be _
stoic and alcoholic, depressed poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in fact, Indians are the most joyous people in the world.
The two funniest groups of people I've been around have been
Indians and Jews. So I guess there's something to be said about the
inherent humor of genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with such scathing humor that Alexie wrote ``Smoke
Signals,'' based on his 1994 collection of short stories, ``The
Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven'' ($12.50,
HarperPerennial).
</P>
<P>
   Like the man who wrote the script, ``Smoke Signals'' is rough
but gentle, serious, but singed with humor. And it's not exactly
what you'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   As if to announce the film is different from past American
Indian fare, a disc jockey says early in the movie, ``It's a good
day to be indigenous.''
</P>
<P>
   The script's comical overtones and reflective undertones enabled
``Smoke Signals'' to transcend the unseen cage Hollywood has made
for Indian portrayals, Alexie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences aren't stupid,'' the Washington State University
graduate said. ``They want good stories. And I think `Smoke
Signals' has a great story. Who cares that it's about Indians?
People want to see a movie they can relate to, regardless of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for seven
years, said the film's story is about a precious emotional
resource: forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Its protagonist, Victor Joseph (Adam Beach), hasn't seen his
alcoholic father in more than 10 years. Victor's father, Arnold,
had been given an ultimatum: Quit drinking or leave. He left.
</P>
<P>
   Since his father left him and his mother, Victor has grown into
a strong and athletic ``pseudo-tough'' young man who can't let go
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   He feels partly responsible for his father's absence. Not
helping matters is his unwanted sidekick, Thomas Builds-the-Fire
(Evan Adams), a dorky, compulsive storyteller who continually tells
tales about Victor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Word soon comes to the reservation in Idaho that Arnold has died
in Arizona. Victor needs to pick up some of his father's things,
but can't afford to go.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He'll pay for Victor's trip _ if he can tag along. Victor
reluctantly agrees, and they set out on a journey across the
country _ and across parental divides.
</P>
<P>
   Part buddy film, part drama, ``Smoke Signals'' is a
character-driven movie. Alexie, who lists ``The Graduate'' and
``Midnight Cowboy'' as his favorite films, said this was no
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor and Thomas are really half of me,'' he said. ``I've
always been a storytelling geek jock. I'm a guy who rambles on,
telling stories and irritating the hell out of people around me.
I'm also large and athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a pathological liar,'' he joked. ``But now I
get paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``rags-to-riches'' story, Alexie was born
hydrocephalic and underwent brain surgery when he was 6 months old.
He wasn't expected to survive, and if he did, doctors said, he
would be mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alexie pulled through with no long-term effects. His
condition, however, left him weak and unable to lead an active
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sickly growing up,'' said the Seattle resident. ``I had
seizures and was bedridden. Most little boys use their energy
physically. My energy was used internally. I created imaginary
worlds for myself. I'm a storyteller because I had to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He also buried himself in books. His father, who worked as a
truck driver and as a logger on and off the reservation, was an
avid reader. Alexie followed suit, reading everything he could get
his hands on, from basketball biographies and mechanical handbooks
to cheesy westerns.
</P>
<P>
   But the fraternal influence on Alexie's life goes deeper than
reading habits. As evidenced by the emotionally charged, unspoken
bond between father and son in ``Smoke Signals,'' Alexie's
relationship with his dad is special to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good friends,'' Alexie said, carefully choosing his
words.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had difficulty, mostly when we were younger,'' he said.
``We're at that point where I love him, but I'm pissed off at him.
And I can tell him both things.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, a new parent along with his wife, Diane, who is a member
of the Hidatsa tribe in North Dakota, had to be patient bringing
his paternal movie to the big screen. Before finally collaborating
with first-time director Chris Eyre (a Cheyenne/Arapaho Indian), he
shopped the film around _ with qualified success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have sold this film to studios. They wanted it. They
wanted the screenplay and the book,'' he said. ``But I wanted an
Indian director.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one producer wanted the script _ if he could make one
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to this famous movie producer, he knows who he
is,'' Alexie said, smiling. ``He looked at me and said, `You know,
this is a very interesting story. A very cinematic road trip. Very
touching. Fathers, sons. But do you think we can make these
characters white?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about about 10 seconds to walk out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the film is exactly what he envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals is going to be wildly successful,'' he said,
beaming like a proud papa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be `The Full Monty' with braves and
darker skin.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it's not, it will still destroy a few myths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumor of the demise of our culture is greatly
exaggerated,'' he said. `` We're very strong, and we're surviving
quite well, thank you.'' &QL;

WHEN DID WOMEN START WEARING SLACKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A friend sent me a video cassette of a 69-year-old
Hollywood movie because, he said, it helped put many aspects of
modern life into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The film is called ``The Divorcee,'' and my friend was right. It
demonstrates that there is very little novel happening in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism? Career women? Rebellion against double standards for
the two sexes? Sexual freedom? They are all present in this 1929
movie, one of the first talkies, which, although I'm a cinema buff,
I had never heard of before.
</P>
<P>
   The title role is played by the renowned star Norma Shearer, and
just to make matters clear from the start, she appears in several
early scenes garbed in slacks _ very daring feminine apparel in
1929 even though the other characters seem to take it in their
stride.
</P>
<P>
   This, incidentally, lays to rest the widely believed myth that
slacks were ``invented'' by an exotic European, Marlene Dietrich,
in the mid-1930s and only hesitatingly adopted by American females.
Not so. Here is home-grown Norma Shearer wearing them years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Shearer is a high-salaried career woman who travels
a lot and has a hectic professional life outside of her marriage to
_ heaven help him _ a journalist. Remember, this is 1929, long
before working women, except school teachers, are supposed to have
existed.
</P>
<P>
   But Norma is a faithful wife. When she discovers her husband has
strayed, she divorces him _ by 1929, not as rare an occurence as
one might think. One of her friends has also been divorced and
explains the ``great time'' she has had ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Divorcee'' is full of sex, but there's not a scene or any
language that anyone possibly could object to. As for nudity, there
is not so much as a naked wrist. The result intensifies rather than
diminishes the sexual meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Before splitting with her spouse, Norma also commits adultery _
depicted by a drawn curtain _ and later announces to him that
``I've squared accounts.'' No one could possibly misunderstand her.
</P>
<P>
   The husband had tried to dismiss his own unfaithfulness as ``not
meaning a thing.'' That really infuriates her. Of course, when she
confesses her own transgression, he explodes and walks out. One
must remember that the idea that male infidelity was to be expected
and should be condoned by an all-forgiving wife had long been part
of the social mythology. ``The Divorcee'' reflects how things were
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly an aspect of the contemporary world isn't touched on in
this remarkable film. An example: at one point, a character
announces that his career has received a significant boost by ``the
offer from my company of a big job in the Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   Who says America's global economic expansion began after World
War II?

RASH JUDGMENT: A NEW LOTION PREVENTS POISON IVY ITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaves of three, let them be!
</P>
<P>
   Avoidance and protective clothing have long been the mainstays
for preventing poison ivy. But who really wants to wear long
sleeves, pants and gloves outdoors in the summer?
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, a pre-exposure lotion has been approved
by the FDA for extra protection. IvyBlock, from EnviroDerm
Pharmaceuticals, is the first product on the market containing
bentoquatum, approved by the FDA to shield against poison ivy's
irritating oily sap.
</P>
<P>
   IvyBlock is an over-the-counter, nonprescription lotion that is
applied like sunscreen. It leaves a faint white coating on the skin
that acts as a barrier against the harmful oils in poison ivy, oak
and sumac.
</P>
<P>
   The lotion should be applied at least 15 minutes before possible
exposure and reapplied every four hours as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Its active ingredient, bentoquatum, is a claylike compound
mainly added to paints and lubricants to alter their flow. It is
used in eye shadows, lipsticks and suntan products.
</P>
<P>
   IvyBlock lotion is sold in 4-ounce squeeze bottles for $9 to $10
and is available at drug and general merchandise stores, including
Eckerd, Drug Emporium and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Poison ivy is the most common cause of allergic contact
dermatitis in North America. Fifty to 70 percent of the population
is susceptible, said Dr. Joseph Fowler, associate clinical
professor of dermatology at the University of Louisville in
Kentucky, who conducted some of the trials on bentoquatum.
</P>
<P>
   IvyBlock was developed especially for people such as forest
firefighters, for whom poison ivy is an occupational hazard, Fowler
added.

DISTRICT JUDGE TAKES TRIAL OF FORMER CADET IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Looming down from one wall of his chambers,
a yellowing flier from 1909 touts a pro wrestling bout featuring
one of Judge Don Leonard's grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Across the small office with a view of the Trinity River is an
almost Technicolor-like portrait of John Wayne framed by a pair of
steer horns _ given to the judge only half-jokingly in 1991 after
Leonard wrestled a gun from a murder defendant who was trying to
take him hostage and escape.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, the senior-most district judge in Tarrant County,
doesn't shy away from those old Texas stereotypes but rather
embraces them in a lighthearted way. It's what he grew up with as a
boy in Waco, where he watched Gene Autrey and Roy Rogers films at
the movie house on Saturday afternoons and lived and breathed
sports, high school football in particular.
</P>
<P>
   In his 16th year on the judge's bench, Leonard said the upcoming
trial of former Air Force Academy cadet David Graham will easily
rank as his biggest trial, from a publicity standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The media presence is a necessary headache that helps educate
those who rarely set foot in the courthouse, but it has the power
to disrupt attorneys, jurors and even judges, he said. Leonard
promises he is far beyond getting wrapped up in the media dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more publicity than any case I can remember,'' he said.
``I don't think it's as big as the media does. In the end, it's
still a murder case that has to be tried in a certain way.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard comes from a Central Texas family whose devotion to
criminal justice and public safety stretches back three
generations. The wrestling grandfather with the broad chest and
thick, wavy hair later served as a firefighter in Waco. His father
was a Waco police officer for 25 years who became police chief in
Mexia and only recently retired as a district court bailiff.
</P>
<P>
   The career Leonard really wanted to pursue was football, either
as a player or a coach. He played offensive guard on highly ranked
Waco High School teams and played one year for Tarleton State
University in Stephenville, but he realized he didn't quite have
the swiftness or the size to make a living on the gridiron.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying his wife, Judith, 42 years ago when they were
both freshmen at Tarleton State, they moved to Austin, where
Leonard earned his law degree, and ultimately to Fort Worth, where
he began working in 1961 as an assistant city attorney. They have
two grown daughters and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very rewarding at the end of the day to go home to
somebody who is caring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friends say Leonard has honed a style that is easygoing and
reliant on humor while conveying a sense that he'll only bend so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know what my role is supposed to be,'' he said.
``You can push me to a point, but I'm not a daisy when it gets
right down to push and shove.''
</P>
<P>
   If he thinks you're wasting his time, he might look up from his
reading glasses and ask if you're an animal-rights activist intent
on keeping him away from his house on Lake Texoma and the hunting
and fishing he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much unhappiness that comes through here that I try
to be pleasant,'' he said. ``The work can get you down if you let
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The door to his chambers is rarely closed, and the bustle in and
out is so great that he often has to leave his office if he wants
to have a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the facade and the homespun sense of humor is a strong
intellect, said Fort Worth defense attorney Jerry Loftin, who met
Leonard 30 years ago when they both had law offices in the Union
Bank building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a down-to-earth, smart-as-a-whip judge,'' Loftin said.
``He runs a trial very effectively. He controls a trial. He's
intelligent and smart enough to know how everyone can get a fair
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a connoisseur of barbecue, although he has lost 40 pounds
since he agreed to accept the Graham case from his longtime friend,
District Judge Joe Drago, who presided over Diane Zamora's capital
murder trial and chose not to hear Graham's case.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's trial is expected to last a month, with seven days
reserved for questioning prospective jurors. The former Air Force
Academy cadet faces life in prison if convicted of the December
1995 beating and shooting death of 16-year-old Adrianne Jones of
Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, Graham's former fiancee, was convicted in February for
her role in the slaying and was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been made big by whatever makes cases big,''
Leonard said. ``I think your reputation as a judge isn't how you
handle the great big cases. It should be on how steady you are
every day. That's what I try to do. It forms good work habits.''

SCIENTISTS HOPE HIV RESISTANCE YIELDS CLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Researchers are investigating a mystery factor
that protects some people from HIV infection, despite repeated
exposure to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Studying 60 subjects who engage in high-risk behaviors that
repeatedly expose them to the virus, researchers at the University
of California at San Francisco were amazed when only one was
infected over a 30-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The finding strengthens hopes that, eventually, scientists will
develop a vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus, which
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Scientist Sharen Stranford and her associates selected 60 people
who seemed to be at high risk of HIV infection, either because they
shared hypodermic needles or had sex numerous times with someone
infected by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, following the study, only one had been infected by
HIV. The rest showed no sign of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Their CD8+ T cells display an unusual form of immune response.
Therein may lie the secret of the resistance to HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have beat the odds for many years,'' said
Stranford, who prepared her findings for the 12th World AIDS
Congress, which was held last week in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our subjects are gay men who had unprotected sex with
men who (later) died from AIDS, so they assumed they were infected
and later found out they were not,'' Stranford noted.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of T cells, distinguished by different
protein receptors on their surfaces. One type is CD4+ T cells,
which HIV readily attacks.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Stranford's team found that CD8+ T cells in the
study group somehow prevent HIV from copying itself.
</P>
<P>
   Stranford hypothesizes that for these people, and others like
them, low-dose exposure to HIV acts like a natural vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated exposures may provide a boost to the immune system
without infecting the cells, like a natural vaccine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, a vaccine for HIV could be possible.
</P>
<P>
   The findings ``provide great encouragement for the ultimate
development of a vaccine to HIV,'' said Jay Levy, a professor of
medicine at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Stranford's colleagues in the study were Dennis Osmond, also of
San Francisco; Joan Skurnick and Donald Louria of New Jersey
Medical School; Sheng-Yung Chang and John Sninsky of Roche
Molecular Systems in Alameda, Calif.; Dr. Guido Ferrari and Kent
Weinhold of Duke University; and Dr. Craig Lindquist of Marin
County Specialty Clinic in Greenbrae, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Stranford team's finding ``has been suspected for some
time,'' said Dr. Michael Horberg, president of the Gay and Lesbian
Medical Association in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This welcome insensitivity to infection isn't unique to the AIDS
epidemic, Horberg adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to other epidemics of our time _ the flu
epidemics of the early 1900s, the `great plague' _ there were
people who did not get infected,'' Horberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He speculates that they, too, were blessed with a mysterious
immune resistance to certain types of infections.

RESEARCHERS URGED EXPANSION OF MEDICAID TO COVER HIV INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Medicaid program should be expanded to
provide anti-AIDS drugs to those who have been infected by the
virus but have not developed full-blown symptoms of the disease,
experts at the University of California at San Francisco say.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid currently covers drug treatments only for people who
have developed full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combination therapy using anti-retroviral medications is now
available and for the first time offers real hope for controlling
HIV infection, but not everyone has access to these drugs,'' said
Dr. James G. Kahn of the university's AIDS Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding Medicaid coverage to those infected by the human
immunodeficiency virus, but not yet afflicted by AIDS, thousands of
deaths could be averted, Kahn said. He prepared findings in
collaboration with Brian Haile for the 12th World AIDS Congress,
which was held last week in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Schatz, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian
Medical Association in San Francisco, said the Medicaid issue is
``another problem those of us on the AIDS Council have had with the
(Clinton) administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President (Al) Gore promised a year ago to get expanded
Medicaid coverage for people with HIV,'' Schatz said. Yet the
expanded coverage has been impeded, Schatz charged, by ``number
crunchers'' at the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sinking in a quagmire of numbers crunching _ and people
are dying ... This is a national disgrace. It points out glaring
weaknesses in our health care system,'' Schatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is a program funded by the federal and state
governments that helps pay for health care for the needy. In 1996,
state and federal governments spent a combined $160 billion serving
more than 36 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to expand Medicaid coverage reflects larger
political realities, Schatz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have HIV are gay men, drug users and poor
people of color, none of whom are on the top 10 hit parade of the
GOP ...''
</P>
<P>
   There is ``a general hostility toward spending money on the
needy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hopkins, director of federal affairs for the AIDS
Foundation, said: ``I agree with the assessment of the UCSF
researchers that we could reduce the AIDS death rate considerably
if we were able to expand the Medicaid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the vice president absolutely wanted to
(expand) this. The vice president clearly understands the dilemma
that we're in; you don't want to wait until someone is next to
death before you provide them with care.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately ``the bureaucrats stepped in,'' Hopkins added with
a sigh, ``and once that happens, a lot of really good ideas and
initiatives fall by the wayside.''

 &HT;    A land ethic for July 4
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My 10-year-old friend in Tiger, Ga., the rural
community that's home on weekends, brought me a tiny jar of
huckleberries recently. ``You can eat 'em,'' he said, with a big
grin. ``They're hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The small jar of purple-black berries seemed a proper symbol for
my thinking this July Fourth _ my thinking about how hard it is for
most American families, in city and suburbs, to provide their
children with experiences that connect them to America's natural
majesty. Aldo Leopold, who founded the National Wilderness Society,
called a closeness to the land ``the split-rail value.'' He termed
it ``nationalism in the best sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Split-rail values sound very Republican. They could describe
Teddy Roosevelt, the president who decided some of America's
majestic places should belong to all of the people, not just to the
rich. I wish U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) and some of his GOP
colleagues would study Roosevelt's thinking. Surely one of
Georgia's last undeveloped barrier islands, which lies in
Kingston's district, qualifies as a majestic place. The island's
white sand dunes and wild horses are so breath-taking that John F.
Kennedy,Jr. and Carolyn Bessette chose it as the spot for their
wedding. Congress designated 20,000 acres of Cumberland Island as
wilderness in the 1980s. Now Kingston wants to work a land trade to
give some of the island wilderness back to the wealthy family that
sold it to the park service. Kingston's ``Cumberland Island
Preservation Act'' is enough to make Roosevelt turn over in his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   The island is already listed by the National Wilderness Society
as one of the nation's 17 most endangered wildlands, along with
irreplaceable spots in Colorado, Utah, Alaska and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston's efforts on Cumberland Island might make more sense if
there were not a plan in place to preserve that tract at no expense
to taxpayers _ thanks to the Nature Conservancy and funds earmarked
in the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund. That fund is
financed from royalties paid to the federal government by companies
that hold offshore oil and gas leases, and its purpose is to
preserve environmental treasures as token compensation for
depletion of a finite natural resource that belongs to all of the
people. Some Republicans who are friendly with oil giants_like U.S.
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas)_ hardly out of the Teddy
Roosevelt mold, want to abolish the fund altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about the Kingston bill is that the land the
Candlers would receive _ the island's highest and most beautiful
cliffs _ would be granted to them in fee-simple ownership, which
means the land wouldn't revert to public ownership, as the family's
current life estate will do when the youngest designated heir is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the politicians who need to study our historic
land ethic. Some of our corporate giants do, too. Georgia's
Okefenokee Swamp is also on the endangered wildlands list because
the DuPont Company wants to mine titanium dioxide on its edge. Says
DuPont president C.O. Holliday, ``Environmental impact has to be
viewed alongside the total value a company offers society.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think Roosevelt or Leopold would agree that the
irreplaceable plants and wildlife can be given a dollar value.
Maybe it's a philosophical debate worth airing, though.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's nothing philosophical about the
recent remarks of U.S. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the
House Resources Committee. ``I don't see any justification for the
federal government owning land, other than the Statue of Liberty
and maybe a few parks,'' Young declared.
</P>
<P>
   On July Fourth, what I wish is that some of today's leaders
would spend more time hunting for huckleberries.

BILINGUALISM ALIVE AND WELL IN TEXAS POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Writing about politics these days is becoming
exotic. Or perhaps I should say: ``Escribir sobre la politica llega
a ser exotico.''
</P>
<P>
   As politicians reach out to Latinos, Spanish more than ever is
being sprinkled into political speeches, served up in news releases
and used in interviews on Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   Spicing up your rhetoric with a little ``espanol'' is no
guarantee of success, but it can help your standing with Latino
voters, says Rodolfo de la Garza, vice president of the Tomas
Rivera Policy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is less that you speak it correctly than you attempt to
speak it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where more than a quarter of the population is Latino,
both candidates in the Land Office race _ Democrat Richard Raymond,
Hispanic despite his Anglo name, and Republican David Dewhurst, a
former CIA officer _ speak Spanish well enough to do TV interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican Gov. George W. Bush has been fearless, if not
fluent like his brother Jeb, as he attempts to communicate directly
with Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides delivering occasional sound bites to the
Spanish-language press, Bush laid out a bilingual welcome mat to
Hispanics during the Texas Republican Convention last month in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenemos los mismos valores'' (We have the same values), Bush
told the overwhelmingly Anglo audience.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats _ Spanish-speaking or not _ were quick to grasp
the meaning of Bush's foray into the party's traditional base.
</P>
<P>
   ``While George Bush is delivering part of his GOP convention
speech in Spanish ... we fall further behind the curve,'' San
Augustine County Judge Curt Goetz complained in a flier advertising
his ultimately unsuccessful campaign for chairman of the state
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz also called GOP Texas Railroad Commission candidate Tony
Garza, a fluent Spanish speaker, ``a real threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, one Democrat after another offered up a
Spanish line or two at their own convention last month in San
Antonio. Although Democrats have long peppered their speeches with
Spanish expressions, this year they dropped in full sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nosostros podemos hablar espanol tambien'' (We can speak
Spanish, too), said Paul Hobby, the Democratic candidate for
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant governor hopeful John Sharp also dropped non-English
words into his speech, although listeners could be forgiven for
thinking his pronunciation of ``educacion'' was an imitation of the
Cajun Man of ``Saturday Night Live'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   Although speaking Spanish can pay political dividends, the
often-hard-earned lesson is to proceed at your own riesgo. U.S.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich learned that the hard way recently when
he issued a seriously flawed Spanish news release. (Among other
things, Gingrich described himself as the ``Hablador de la Casa,''
which could be roughly translated as the ``Blowhard of the
House.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``That made him a fool,'' said UT's de la Garza. ``It did not
generate good will.''

OPENING DOORS AT BERKELEY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB WIEDER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROM: Director of Admissions, University of California at
Berkeley
</P>
<P>
   TO: Application Readers &AMP; Evaluators
</P>
<P>
   As you know, the San Francisco Examiner recently wrote about the
fact that we have begun placing increased emphasis on essays
written by applicants, especially hardship essays, in which the
student recounts any notable obstacles, impediments or adversities
he or she had to overcome to succeed academically, such as
disability or illness, abject poverty, a broken or dysfunctional
home, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   As you also know, our applicants are highly ambitious and
intelligent young Californians, which means they are as crafty,
opportunistic and duplicitous a group as you will find outside the
Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Already, we've seen an increased incidence of hardship claims.
Staff members have asked for some guidelines. Since each case must
be judged on its own unique merits, and because we know a
litigation mine field when we see one, no binding guidelines will
be issued. Instead, here are some illustrative claims.
</P>
<P>
   And our recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   PREGNANCY: I was pregnant for most of my sophomore year, and
that dragged my grades down overall, especially first-period
chemistry, which I kept missing because I was in the girls' room
blowing chunks every morning.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most frequent question we are asked: Is pregnancy a
hardship, or the natural consequence of a conscious decision, or
just what she gets for being a little tramp?
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is: If we call pregnancy a hardship, will
the right-to-life groups freak out and deluge us with angry e-mail
and petition the Legislature to start jerking us around? The answer
is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, pregnancy is not a hardship but a blessing. (And if
she couldn't manage birth control, she would have flunked chemistry
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Rejected.
</P>
<P>
   INCARCERATION: I missed most of the 10th grade because I was
doing 10 months at the San Luis Obispo Youth Facility, where they
sent me for the unwise usage of a shotgun during a convenience
store transaction. This played hell with my grade point average,
because they grade a lot tougher in the SLO Equivalency Program
than they do in high school. Also, I had to send back my NRA Boy of
the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this is an eminently avoidable hardship. For
another, if we accept the premise that imprisonment for a criminal
offense is a valid hardship, we could ultimately find ourselves
having to admit brilliant sociopaths, compulsive troublemakers and
former government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected.
</P>
<P>
   DEPRIVATION: We didn't have a computer at home until I was
almost 14, and it was this old reconditioned Canon with about as
much memory as a toaster, and even then I could never use it
because my mom was on this Parents Without Partners chat site
trolling for availables like 19 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't even have a used Canon when we were your age. We had
to get by with a damn slide rule! And the winters were colder, too!
</P>
<P>
   Rejected.
</P>
<P>
   PAIN: It isn't just that I grew up in Oakland, and have thus had
to compensate for underfunded and inadequate educational resources.
It's also that I am a Golden State Warriors basketball fan, which
has been a tremendous emotional and intellectual burden.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks it's easy to care about quadratic equations or
concentrate on intermediate Spanish when ESPN is ragging on your
team and Jay Leno is doing Sprewell jokes, that person doesn't know
what hardship is.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, your director is the holder of season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Admit the kid.

IN NAPLES, HONESTY PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy _ Just as animals are said to be able to smell
fear, I've always suspected the world's hustlers, pickpockets and
scam-artists can smell jet lag. Bleary-eyed, bedraggled and 10
times zones from home, we newly arrived travelers make irresistibly
ripe targets for fleecing.
</P>
<P>
   That must have been how the man behind the ticket window at the
Metropolitana subway in Rome saw me as I stood before him, a dazed,
disoriented look on my face and a backpack with fresh airline
luggage tags on my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due _ Stazione Termini,'' I said, using the sum total of my
Italian, and slid a crisp new 10,000-lire note under the glass.
Without looking up he slid two tickets and two coins back and
gestured for me to step aside for the next customer.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1 in these situations is to know in advance how much
things cost and precisely how much you should be getting back in
change. I knew the subway tickets were 1,500 lire each; even my jet
lag-addled mind could compute that I should have received 7,000
lire back. As I started to turn away I examined the two coins: they
were 1,000 lire each.
</P>
<P>
   I pushed my way back to the window, holding up my tickets and
coins. ``Hey,'' I said, I'm sure I gave you ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Before I could finish, the man gave me an insolent shrug and,
with just the hint of a smirk, slid a 5,000-lire note under the
glass. He didn't even have the decency to pretend that he'd made a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   As Jeri and I rode the jam-packed subway to the train station I
congratulated myself on my savvy. It's rare that I make it through
the first couple days of an overseas trip without being fleeced out
of a tidy little sum by a dishonest taxi driver, street hustler or
would-be guide. I'd never encountered a crooked subway
ticket-seller before, but I'd been up to the challenge. Maybe I was
finally getting the hang of this, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The worst was yet to come, though: Later that day we'd have to
pass through Naples. Since I was a little boy I'd heard so many
stories that I'd come to fear the city as little more than an
open-air convention of the world's most venial muggers, kidnappers,
robbers, extortionists, assassins, con men, burglars, swindlers and
purse-snatchers. In my overwrought imagination I pictured us
running a gauntlet of sinister gangsters and stubble-faced thugs
picking their teeth with switchblades.
</P>
<P>
   My guidebook tried to be reassuring: ``Violent crime is high,
but it is concentrated mostly among the local Mafia gangs; tourists
are rarely targets for anything more than petty thievery and
pickpocketing.'' That made me feel so much better.
</P>
<P>
   As we made our way through the Naples train station I was as
jumpy as Don Knotts. I kept one hand on my wallet, stuffed deep
into my front pocket, and the other around my passport pouch, worn
under my shirt against my chest. Alert for trouble coming from any
direction, my head swiveled on my neck like Linda Blair in the
``Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the only Napoleans we encountered were
friendly and tried to help us find the right track for Sorrento. No
one tried to pick our pockets, hold a knife to our throats or
otherwise live up to Naples' frightful reputation. I began to
wonder whether all those stories were circulated by locals who
didn't want tourists monopolizing the restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the train pulled into Sorrento 90 minutes later, I
felt a palpable sense of relief. We'd survived the crucial first 48
hours of our trip without enriching any pickpockets, larcenous cab
drivers or shortchange artists. It was time to celebrate with a
gelato.
</P>
<P>
   We strolled into the first ``gelateria'' we found and spent a
few delightful minutes working our way up and down the long
counter, smacking our lips lasciviously as we surveyed the
three-dozen flavors: banana, strawberry, blackberry, cherry, lime,
peach, amoretto, chocolate, French vanilla, mint _ it went on and
on, each more tempting than the last. Finally I settled on banana
and chocolate mint; Jeri opted for banana and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Still on alert, I checked that the price was 3,000 lire for each
cone and handed the frowning signora at the cash register a
5,000-lire note and a 1,000-lire coin. ``Prego!'' I said as I
headed for the door.
</P>
<P>
   I was out on the sidewalk and raising my cone to my lips when I
heard the signora yelling at me. She was shaking her fist. I walked
back inside and saw that her fist was full of money. Her other hand
clutched the bank note I gave her _ not a 5,000, as I'd thought,
but a 50,000-lire bill. She counted out my change: 45,000 lire,
about $26. I'd practically begged her to cheat me; frankly, I
wouldn't have blamed her at all if she'd pocketed the money.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a lesson in this little story? I'd say there are two:
One, be ceaselessly alert and vigilant, particularly in the first
jet-lagged day or two of your trip. Even government officials like
the subway ticket vendor in Rome are suspect. And, two, remember
that most people in the world are heartwarmingly honest.

FORMER CADET'S LAWYER PERCEIVES JOB'S ADVANTAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ The phone call to Dan Cogdell came on a
Friday, the day after David Graham was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Houston defense attorney said, his knowledge
of the charge against his future client was limited to news
headlines he had scrolled through on his pocket pager: Two military
academy appointees arrested and accused of the love-triangle
slaying of a Mansfield teen. But that alone was enough to make a
decision _ this was not a job that a defense attorney fond of big
trials would turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shop for criminal lawyers the way they shop for
ambulances _ they call and you better come,'' he said. ``If you
don't come, they'll call another ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial won't fatten his bank account. It will take him away
from Houston and easier, more-lucrative cases for a full month. And
because of the mountain of evidence against his young client _ from
a handgun recovered in his parents' attic to a written confession
and testimony from some of his best friends _ anything short of a
capital murder conviction and a life sentence will be a shock,
legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may well lose this case,'' he said. ``The only thing worse
to me than losing a case is losing a case on the front page of
every newspaper in the country. ... If you do your job right, the
lawyers are going to understand how difficult this case is.''
</P>
<P>
   The promise of nationwide TV and newspaper coverage has a value
of its own, especially for trial attorneys who rely on reputation
to drum up business, said Dick DeGuerin, a prominent Houston
defense attorney who has worked with Cogdell. An aggressive defense
of a case widely regarded as difficult will probably be a winner
for Cogdell regardless of the outcome, DeGuerin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell, 41, will not say exactly what his fees are, but he has
said repeatedly that his defense would probably drain the Graham
family's finances. Indeed, he said, the divorced parents even
signed over their modest Mansfield house to pay for their son's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare person who can afford what a lawyer ought to
charge in a case like this,'' said DeGuerin, who has grabbed
headlines representing clients ranging from U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison's acquittal on records-tampering charges to Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers. ``I don't know of a
good, earnest criminal lawyer who doesn't salivate over a
challenging high-publicity case. It's a business-getter. People
remember your name. When someone gets in trouble, they call you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell's practice is a mixture of high-profile and
bread-and-butter cases. He claimed victory in May after a two-month
federal trial involving five current and former Houston city
officials accused of taking bribes ended with a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
   That long trial put his other work on the back burner and
created a backlog of 17 felony cases for Cogdell that Houston-area
judges were itching to resolve before he left for New Braunfels and
the start of Graham's trial. As a result, Cogdell was scheduled for
jury trials _ from DWI misdemeanors to a transsexual client charged
with murder _ every week from the end of the Houston City Council
trial to the start of Graham's trial Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His associate, attorney Rob Swofford, has handled the bulk of
the preparation for Graham's case, while Cogdell wrapped up other
trials. Although this is an especially busy year with two
back-to-back, high-profile trials, he said he likes to spend 10
months out of the year in front of a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom exposure _ even for a misdemeanor
drinking-and-driving charge _ keeps his trial procedures sharp,
such as his knowledge of trial law, reading juries and, of course,
theatrics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 21, is accused of plotting and carrying out a plan with
his former fiancee, Diane Zamora, to kill Adrianne Jones, who was
found beaten and shot to death along a rural southwest Grand
Prairie road in December 1995. After their arrests nine months
later, the two former military academy appointees each gave written
confessions to police, detailing how they agreed to kill the
Mansfield High School sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   The same team of prosecutors that won Zamora's capital murder
conviction will handle Graham's trial, which has been moved to New
Braunfels because of extensive publicity about the case in Tarrant
County. Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish, the lead
prosecutor, is a former Dallas police officer with 17 years of
experience prosecuting some of the biggest cases in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   After seven days of jury questioning, opening arguments in the
trial are scheduled to begin July 15. The trial is expected to last
four weeks. District Judge Don Leonard will spend a full week
asking prospective jurors what they have heard or read about the
allegations. Then prosecutors and the defense team will question
individual jurors and try to identify those whom they perceive as
either helpful or antagonistic to their sides.
</P>
<P>
   In legal circles, Hill Country residents are regarded as tough
jurors for the defense, and Cogdell said he had hoped the trial
would be moved instead to a large city with a more worldly
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got the reputation of being a very conservative,
pro-government town, and I'm sure that it is,'' Cogdell said.
``Sometimes very conservative, pro-law-enforcement people are more
sticklers for doing things the right way,'' he said, hinting that
he plans to aggressively question the way Grand Prairie detectives
conducted the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell argued unsuccessfully in pretrial hearings that Grand
Prairie police illegally detained Graham for 36 hours and denied
his repeated requests for an attorney. Although Leonard ruled that
the confession was taken legally, Cogdell will have the opportunity
to make those same arguments in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell won't comment about his defense strategy, but many legal
observers wonder whether he's planning something similar to
Zamora's defense strategy, which was to lash out against Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane Zamora tried to blame it all on David,'' DeGuerin said.
``There's a lot of suspense as to what David's going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he thinks that is bad defense strategy and said
it's against the wishes of Graham's mother, who lives in the
Houston area. She instructed Cogdell early on, he said, to defend
her son vigorously but not at the expense of tarnishing Zamora or
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they want justice for our son but not at the
expense of injustice to other people,'' he said. ``That was sincere
on their part.''

   VIETNAM-POW _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The anthem stopped playing
on that June Sunday in 1994 and Jay Casenelli snapped his salute.
All around him admired the POW medal with the bronze eagle that had
just been pinned on his chest. ``I'll share this with some
ghosts,'' he told them. As it turns out, Jay Casenelli is himself a
ghost. Nothing about his war story is true _ not a date, not a
detail, not a word. He flew no helicopter, endured no beating and
suffered no imprisonment in a wooden cage in Southeast Asia. In
fact, Casenelli spent the Vietnam war years well out of the reach
of the Viet Cong gunfire, in Hazlehurst, Ga., and Marathon in the
Florida Keys. ``It is very disheartening,'' said Col. Dave Presley,
the Army officer who had helped Casenelli get his POW medal. ``It
looks like he scammed a lot of people.'' (Moffett, Palm Beach
Post.)

HOW TO IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME, WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Suppose someone makes you an offer, Randy Gibbs
says: If you can foul up your life and make your relationships at
home and work an utter shambles within 30 days, he'll give you $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of cake, right? So, Gibbs asks, why do people think it's
so impossible to improve relationships with their spouses,
co-workers and bosses?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vain of us to think, `There's something wrong in our
relationship _ and I have nothing to do with it,' '' says Gibbs,
author of ``20/20 Insight: 6 Keys to Seeing and Changing the Hidden
Patterns That Control Our Lives and Limit Our Effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs says that once a relationship begins to sour _ whether
it's in a family or an office _ it tends to keep getting worse
because each person's behavior brings out the worst in the other
person.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he gives the example of a wife who was frustrated
because she felt her husband wouldn't do anything around the house
unless she asked, and she felt like she had to ask him all the
time. The husband, though, felt like she was always nagging, and
that made him resist doing anything around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs ran into a similar downward spiral _ or ``dance,'' as he
calls it _ with Bob, a former boss. He believe Bob was too harshly
critical, so he avoided him. Bob felt Gibbs was avoiding him, which
made him more critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in life have a difficult time seeing the patterns we are
creating,'' Gibbs says. ``It's easy to list problems. What is
harder to do is to see the patterns of which they (the people) are
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When there are problems, he says, it's important to understand
that ``it's not me and it's not you. It's what happens between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   With workplace problems, people often reinforce their own
positions by talking to spouses or friends for support, Gibbs says.
That can create a false sense that you are absolutely right and the
person at work is wrong because your loved ones will naturally side
with you, especially if all they know about your colleague is
information filtered through you.
</P>
<P>
   When there are problems at work or at home, Gibbs suggests these
steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look at your actions.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, do you approve of how you've acted? Are you trying to
solve the problem or just blame the other person? If you didn't
have a grudge against the person, how would you act?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much admitting I'm wrong; it's admitting that I'm
complicit,'' he says. ``It's the difference between being
emotion-driven and being value-driven. When you're value-driven,
you're pressured to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs says people often spend lots of time trying to convince
others _ or themselves _ of how they've been wronged rather than
solving the problem. ``I cannot simultaneously defend myself and
build a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Examine your past and your beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Gibbs mentions how the vice president of a small
electronics company announces his belief that people only work for
a paycheck. He bases his decisions on that belief, and is confused
when the company has high turnover despite the generous bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   People who lose their jobs often lose confidence, Gibbs says,
which can make them come across as bitter or angry in job
interviews. Then they don't get the job and they lose more
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they affect us very personally, corporate things
aren't personal. How we choose to make sense of a particular
experience has everything to do with future outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop dancing.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two to tango, even when it's the dangerous dance that
Gibbs describes in his book. If you know how you're annoying
someone else, quit trying to justify your actions and simply stop
the annoying behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs says that if you keep annoying other people, it gives them
an excuse to keep annoying you. ``We stand between them and their
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be open about how you're changing.
</P>
<P>
   If you've had trouble with someone, or you're a boss with
dissatisfied workers, often just changing yourself won't solve the
problem. People are too likely to think you're insincere or have an
ulterior motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lubricate the change process if you let people know what
you're doing,'' Gibbs says. ``They'll cut you all kinds of slack if
they know you're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when he worked with Hewlett-Packard, and managers
would have informal talks with workers every 30 days, letting
people know what changes were being made and why.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gibbs says, many companies just try to push a
problem aside with a temporary fix rather than actually solving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had managers turn to me and say, `I can't believe we're
talking about this?' Why? `Because we've been talking about it for
a year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Find a good mutual starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs often tells people to read his book or a chapter in it so
they have a mutual experience they can use to start the discussion,
leading in to the difficult points. In work instances, a memo or
film or workshop might be used instead.
</P>
<P>
   If two people can't get along, Gibbs says, it helps if they can
agree on what circumstances or incident led to the problem _ even
though their perspectives on it are obviously different.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can see how it came about, you can see how to go about
changing it.''

VULGARITY REDUX 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NORMA J. SHATTUCK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Equal-opportunity vulgarity has truly taken
root this decade.
</P>
<P>
   If San Francisco's mayor and certain members of Congress and a
New York Times pundit can get away with hurling slurs and gross
expletives; if a mover in San Francisco politics is unapologetic at
sending a hate-mail Christmas card, what is our culture's CQ
(Civility Quotient)?
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel somewhat comforted about this up-turn in
brutishness when I discovered that the poet Horace, born 650 B.C.,
rued the rudeness of his time. It's a gem of distilled exasperation
at creeping crudeness:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hence, ye profane! I hate ye all,
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the great vulgar and the small.''
</P>
<P>
   How, I mused, could Horace have peered so far into the future to
forge a link just as I was fuming about Rosie O'Donnell's polluting
of the Tony Awards? The occasion _ recognition of professional
excellence in Broadway theater _ seemed to call for more high-toned
patter than the rancid jokes and jibes that might've originated at
a Los Angeles venue for fledgling comics who'd fall mute without
the f-word.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing via Horace that vulgarity has always been with us may
have broadened my perspective, but it doesn't quell my queasiness.
Crudity, exhibitionism and disregard for others is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The for-profit tainting of images, attitudes and emotions of
little children strikes me as truly beyond the pale. The
foul-talking kiddie cartoon characters on the television series,
``South Park,'' for instance, are the latest craze in a line of
shows with a kids-as-delegates shtick. Their popularity guarantees
a cynical cadre of older children reconditioned to the profane and
the anti-social.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the young can be shocked at what's being shoved at
them, like the 13-year-old quoted in Time: ``There's sex in the
cartoons and messed-up people on the talk shows ....''
</P>
<P>
   Books can be exploitative too. The victims of the ugly
revelations in Kathryn Harrison's incest memoir ``The Kiss'' will
surely be her own children, doomed to have to come to terms with
Mom's successful marketing of her flings (as consenting adult) with
goatish old Gramps.
</P>
<P>
   What is best-sellerdom worth? I don't think it's worth the
betrayal of privacy of those who played no part in the pathology
she describes.
</P>
<P>
   The nothing's-too-personal-to-share '90s promise other such
bonanzas for voyeurs: Those with a particular bent for obstetrical
peeping were among a possible 7.2 million cable TV viewers to watch
a Florida woman give birth. The mother-to-be claims that she is
``no exhibitionist.''
</P>
<P>
   To such passenger lures as ``more leg-room'' and ``latest
movies,'' shrewd airlines may soon be adding, ``Watch X-rated
onboard antics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because air travelers have become increasingly drunken
and sometimes literally unbuttoned. While amour aloft used to
consist of couples cramming into lavatories to satisfy personal
urges, crews report recent cases of sex-without-seatbelts within
full view of other passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Many may claim, of course, that we're no more vulgar now than
when Chaucer was capturing human lewdness, lapses and foibles in
``The Canterbury Tales.'' My contention is that Chaucer, seeing the
Jerry Springer show, would be shocked.

RONALD REAGAN: MAN OF MONUMENTS MADE MONUMENTAL MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HALTON ADLER MANN  
 c.1998 The San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Non-revisionist analysis is demanded before too
much hagiographic history of Ronald Reagan is engraved in granite
and the 40th president is canonized beyond truth and endurance in
airports, public buildings and Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is 87 and mentally enfeebled, the encomiums are
coming faster from editorialists who once excoriated him, their
prose revised to reflect an insufferably sanitized version of his
presidency. Against this relentless tide of tribute, truth must
stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   That truth includes Reagan's anti-communist zealotry that
compelled him to lie in writing every six months when he certified
``progress'' in human rights in El Salvador. That was the absurd,
unilateral ``condition'' Congress required for continued U.S.
support of fascist terrorism by the death squads of that tormented
country.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's monomaniacal determination to overthrow Daniel Ortega
in Nicaragua led to subsidizing of proxy mass murder of thousands
of innocents there by Contra terrorists. Later came the Iran-Contra
scandal, the usurpation of presidential power by Oliver North and
the selling of armaments for American hostages in Lebanon,
impeachable offenses in a non-Teflon presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A similar moral famine afflicted Reagan when he declared that
the only alternative in the Philippines to Ferdinand Marcos' reign
of terror and murder (he did not characterize it as such) was a
communist dictatorship. The peaceful revolution led by the
admirable Benigno Aquino's widow Corazon _ whose husband was
murdered in a public spectacle by Marcos' henchmen _ belied
Reagan's denial of a democratic movement. Reagan was perfectly
willing to keep anti-communist murderers like Marcos in power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elie Wiesel importuned him to shun the Nazi cemetery at
Bitburg at the request of Michael Deaver and Helmut Kohl, President
Reagan went and gave a ludicrous speech. He exculpated the entire
German nation for its barbarity, persecution, genocide and war save
``one man'' he held responsible. Certainly, there was a better way
to honor Germany's decades of dedication to democracy in the wake
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan administration supported Saddam Hussein when Iraq
invaded America's nemesis, Iran, in his eight-year war. It led to
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Gulf War and the present threat
of chemical and biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Also deleted from Reagan revisionism is his sending of 230
Marines to their easily avoidable deaths in what then-Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., called ``Mission Impossible'' in Lebanon. The same
security measures employed by embassies and banks throughout the
world would have prevented the bombing of the Marine barracks in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's mea culpa after the bombing was bought by an American
electorate that could never impute anything but the noblest motives
to ``The Gipper'' and could forgive him almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   As Georges Clemenceau might conclude, history is too serious a
matter to be left to editorial writers and columnists. Give Ronald
Reagan his due, his leadership of the ``revolution'' that bears his
name. It culminated in Republican control of Congress for the first
time in 40 years in 1994. And give him credit for the energy that
contributed to _ but was far from solely responsible for _ the
dissolution of the Soviet Union's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   Extol his B-movie actor's ability to memorize his lines and
deliver them with presidential credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Like him for his affability and personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   But remember and recognize that he was a shallow and shameless
president who exploited a nation's need for shallow answers to
profound and protracted problems.
</P>
<P>
   History must not permit him to ``go gently into that good
night'' unscathed by scandal, impervious to imperfections,
oblivious to the tragedies he wrought, ``blind to criticism and
deaf to dissent.''

FOOTLOOSE AND FANCY: WHAT THE CAVE MAN SHARED WITH TODAY'S TRENDY
DRESSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You know those suede, earth-bound sandals that
are the rage in footwear? It turns out they were fashionable nearly
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like your mom said: ``Never throw anything away _ it'll always
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As Michael J. O'Brien, the Louisiana State University
anthropologist who analyzed 35 specimens of prehistoric shoes
discovered in a cave along the Missouri River and dating back 9,400
years, testifies, ``these shoes were very stylish for the time.''
</P>
<P>
   A report compiled by O'Brien and his co-researchers and
published in Friday's issue of the journal Science found that the
ancient footwear was well-made, having been unearthed nearly whole
in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest sandal in the group was woven from jute much like
that used in footwear today. There also were moccasins, the only
ones crafted in leather, plus sling-backs and slip-ons made from
plant fibers plaited into durable soles and uppers.
</P>
<P>
   Arch support was also a consideration: These primitive cobblers
lined their shoes with cushions of grass, ``like a Dr. Scholl's
foot pad,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a modern version of the Missouri cave shoe, it must
be the sandal that hasn't changed since its invention 101 years
ago, the shoe that shares the salient features of the Flintstonian
flip-flop _ the Birkenstock.
</P>
<P>
   These unrepentant ``hippie'' shoes have soles that mold to the
wearer's foot, just like their historic counterpart, the
straw-filled mocs. That Birkenstock sole is a combination of jute
and cork, biodegradable plant-fibers similar to the yucca-like
plant called ``rattlesnake master'' that was found in that cave.
</P>
<P>
   Icons of the '60s dropout, the neo-Bohemian, and the '90s
style-setter, Birkenstocks hold a kind of reverse status.
Alternative culture types go for their plain practicality and lack
of pretension. A sole of cork, an upper of nubuck straps, two
unshiny buckles: shoes only a mother could love.
</P>
<P>
   Or a Neanderthal.

   BOEING-DELAYS (Seattle) SEATTLE _ Earlier this year, Russian
authorities arrested several people for stealing hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of parts specially manufactured for the
International Space Station. The parts had been ordered by the
Energia company, perhaps the most famous name in the Russian rocket
industry. Thieves, who broke into a factory, planned to melt down
the parts and sell the precious metals on the black market. The
parts were recovered before being destroyed. But the embarrassing
incident underscores the decline of the once-proud Russian space
program. It also is symbolic of the problem-plagued partnership
between Russia and the United States on the space station, for
which The Boeing Co. is the prime contractor.

CASH WOES PLAGUE SPACE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Earlier this year, Russian authorities arrested
several people for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
of parts specially manufactured for the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The parts had been ordered by the Energia company, perhaps the
most famous name in the Russian rocket industry. Thieves, who broke
into a factory, planned to melt down the parts and sell the
precious metals on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   The parts were recovered before being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But the embarrassing incident underscores the decline of the
once-proud Russian space program. It also is symbolic of the
problem-plagued partnership between Russia and the United States on
the space station, for which The Boeing Co. is the prime
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The start of station construction is a year behind schedule
because the Russian Space Agency did not get promised funding from
its cash-starved government. And the country's current economic
problems could mean that it will not be able to launch regular
Progress rocket missions, which will be needed to keep the station
in orbit during construction.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers are saying it's time to drop Russia as a major
station partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International Space Station program is in trouble,'' two
senior members of the House Science Committee said in a strongly
worded letter to President Clinton last week.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan letter was sent by the committee chairman, Rep.
James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., and Rep. George Brown of
California, the committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a situation in which there can be little confidence
that the Russia government will make adequate funding available to
meet its commitments,'' they said in asking that the president
submit within 30 days a plan for the financial rescue of the
station.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing executives involved in the project say Russia should
not be dropped as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very big mistake to try and do this without
them,'' said Doug Stone, head of Boeing's space station program in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Russia is having financial difficulties,'' Stone
said. ``The people in Russia are not happy they are having trouble
getting adequate funding. ... But they have not in any way backed
off from getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Under contract to Boeing, the once top-secret Khrunichev
assembly complex outside Moscow built the first space station
element, known as the functional cargo block, or FGB, for its
Russian acronym. It will provide early station control functions.
</P>
<P>
   The module was funded with $200 million from NASA. Under the
close supervision of Boeing, it was finished in January and shipped
by rail more than 1,200 miles from Moscow to the Baikonur
Cosmodrome launch complex in the republic f Kazakhstan for final
testing.
</P>
<P>
   It is now scheduled to be launched into orbit Nov. 20, to be
followed Dec. 3 by the launch at Kennedy Space Center of Space
Shuttle Endeavour carrying the first U.S. component of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle astronauts will join the two pieces of station in orbit,
marking the start of assembly of the largest and most complex
structure ever built for space.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-built cargo block initially was to have been
launched in December 1997. But the date has been postponed twice
because of delays by Khrunichev in building the critical third
station element known as the service module. That module will
provide early life support to the station crew, as well as
propulsion to keep the station from falling out of orbit and
burning up in the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The first launch of station hardware cannot take place until
NASA knows for sure that the service module, or an alternative,
will be ready for launch a few months later. After repeated
construction delays caused by inadequate funding from the Russian
government, the service module is nearly finished and NASA is
confident it can go ahead with plans to launch the functional cargo
block Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians did exactly what we asked them to do with the
(cargo block),'' Boeing's Stone said. ``It's at the launch site and
ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Barnes is Boeing's program manager in Houston for the
functional cargo block.
</P>
<P>
   She's known to friends as ``Ginger,'' and likes to joke that FGB
actually is an acronym for ``For Ginger Barnes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said both Boeing and Khrunichev have benefited from the
partnership, and the success of the functional cargo block
demonstrates that Russia is a valuable member of the space station
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people, as I did on my first trip over there (to Russia),
look for the differences between us,'' she said. ``What I found,
and what most people have found, is there are more similarities
between us than differences. ... The Russians are very humble, very
hospitable, brilliant and caring people, and we have been able to
use those traits to establish lasting bonds. The FGB is a true
bridge between two powerful nations and two powerful companies _
Boeing and Khrunichev.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies were founded the same year _ 1916. Both
dabbled in areas outside of aerospace at one time. When the early
Boeing Co. was building furniture, for example, Khrunichev was
building children's sleds.
</P>
<P>
   During construction of the functional cargo block, Boeing kept
three full-time employees at the Khrunichev complex. They regularly
visited the factory floor to closely monitor the work and were
impressed at the quality-control system in place, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Khrunichev constructed several physical test stands to emulate
some of the systems on the functional cargo block, said Barnes, who
noted that in this country, those same tests would have been done
by less reliable computer simulation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a public perception in the United States that the
Russians are less technologically advanced, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found just the opposite to be the case,'' she said. ``These
people are experts. They are very proud of their technical
capabilities. They just approach things in different ways than we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrunichev completed many of its contract milestones on the
functional cargo block ahead of schedule so its workers could get
paid _ by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the other station-related programs in
Russia, they have not been as successful because the U.S. has not
funded them,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The critical service module is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the funding shortfalls, the service module is nearly
finished and has been shipped from Khrunichev to the Energia
company for system testing, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are a very confident group of people,'' Stone
said. ``You can depend on them to build a quality piece of
hardware, provided they have the resources necessary to do the job.
Without any reservations, I would say their hardware is just as
good as anything we produce. The difficulty has been making sure we
have an adequate flow of money from the Russian government to the
Russian Space Agency. And that has not been the case. That is
something that we at Boeing, as prime contractor, don't have any
control over. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have proven with the FGB that if the Russians are given
adequate resources to do the job, they will do the job on time, and
not only that, but what they produce will be exactly what they told
you they were going to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial situation, however, continues to look bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Russian participation in the project in 1993
that probably saved the station from the congressional budget ax. A
station funding authorization bill that year survived a house roll
call vote by one vote _ 216-215.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said Russian participation would
</P>
<P>
   accelerate completion of the station by up to two years and save
$2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress, including Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House
Science Committee, had argued against making the station project so
dependent on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of the Soviet empire, Russia's space program,
a symbol of its status as a superpower, fragmented into 38
semiprivate companies coordinated by the Russian Space Agency. Some
of those companies went bankrupt. Others have not been able to pay
workers on time.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the Russian government realized it would be strapped
for funds and recommended that its Mir station become the hub of
the new International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA refused to change its plans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, NASA asked the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory to begin
building an interim control module that could be sent to the
station should the Russian-built service module be further delayed.
The U.S. module would have the fuel and engine needed to keep the
station in orbit, performing much the same role as the Russian
element.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has indicated it plans to use the Navy hardware even if the
Russian service module goes up as planned next year. It could be
attached to the back of the service module and provide an
additional three years of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, during testimony before Congress, NASA Administrator
Dan Goldin acknowledged that if he had it to do again, he would not
have Russia build the critical service module.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's current assembly schedule has the station ready by
December 2003, which is 18 months later than the original
completion date set in 1993. But a recent NASA-commissioned
independent review of the station project found that completion of
the station is likely to be delayed until 2005 or 2006 because of
Russia's inability to meet financial and hardware commitments to
the project.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, estimated that it costs the United States more
than $100 million for every month the station is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   NASA now says the greatest threat to the station posed by
Russia's economic difficulties is no longer the service module but
the Progress vehicles that will provide additional station reboost.
</P>
<P>
   Progress ships are used to keep the Mir station in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of these Progress flights will be needed during
construction of the station. But Russia may not have the funds.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has asked Boeing to determine the cost of building a
propulsion module from space shuttle components in the event Russia
can't supply the Progress ships. It is one of several options being
considered should Russian participation be further reduced, or
eliminated.

   SCI-EASTER-ISLAND (Undated) _ Archeologists are at last making
progress in recovering the history of Easter Island and its 900
stone statues, the island, the people themselves and their
indigenous language. The scientists also are gaining a better
understanding of the motivations, practices and economic
foundations of the statue builders. But the place is in danger of
losing its alluring air of mystery. By John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PENILE-MORPHOLOGY (Undated) _ Among insects, male
reproductive organs differ so dramatically from one species to
another that entomologists rely on the particulars of the cerci,
epiprocts and other bits of arthropod genitalia to distinguish
between species that otherwise look alike. Scientists have long
debated the reasons for such ornateness of penile shape, or
morphology. Now, a Swedish researcher has given the morphology a
new spin, contending that male reproductive organs are the pelvic
equivalent of peacock feathers _ the fruit of sexual selection. By
Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANCIENT-SHOES (Undated) _ One of the longest chapters in the
history of fashion has emerged from an unlikely hiding place _ a
cave overlooking the Missouri River in Calloway County, Mo. From an
ancient garbage dump in the cave, archeologists have retrieved a
series of discarded shoes that range in age from 8,000 to 800 years
ago. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ICE-SHEET (Undated) _ If the earth's temperature heats up as
mainstream scientists predict it will over the next century, the
average level of the world's oceans could rise by about a foot and
a half by 2100, and somewhat more after that, as glaciers partly
melt and the heating makes sea water expand, inundating many
low-lying coastal areas. But it would be trivial compared with the
melting or collapse of the huge West Antarctic ice sheet, the
Godzilla of the game of rising seas. This would loose so much water
into the oceans that they would rise by a truly catastrophic 16 to
20 feet. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-DIABETES (Undated) _ As disturbing and devastating as
the disfigurement may be to some people taking a protease inhibitor
for HIV, the cosmetic changes may be the least worrisome part.
Doctors are worried about more serious, even potentially fatal,
changes in fat metabolism. A small but growing number of studies
find that many such individuals have high levels of cholesterol and
lipids in the blood and other metabolic changes that may increase
the risk of diabetes. The findings are among those revealed at the
12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva. By Lawrence K. Altman.

   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (New York) _ The largest gathering of Apple
Macintosh fans on the East Coast begins Tuesday in Manhattan, and
they have several reasons to be optimistic after more than a year
of darkness and turmoil. Led by co-founder Steve Jobs, Apple
appears to have stabilized its management team, cut costs, made
some money, halted a precipitous decline in market share, outlined
(at last) a clear path for its Mac operating system, and
streamlined and reinvigorated its product lineup. By Peter H.
Lewis.

Jane E. Brody. (``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNS-HEALTH (Undated) _ This is New Year's week at your local
hospital, where July 1 marks a new beginning just as fraught with
symbolism and expectation as Jan. 1 elsewhere. Medical schools end
in June and hospital training programs start in July; last week
everyone in them lurched a step forward. Studies show the month is
no more dangerous than any others, but memories of the grueling
training linger.

the specific molecular composition of the perfect margarita, I

   We're always looking for good uses for old CD-ROMs, but this one
is stretching it a bit:
</P>
<P>
   A friend and CEO of a corporation who has been a Microsoft
developer for many years (''And that's supposed to make him
credible?'') takes his CDs and places them in the microwave for
three seconds. The resulting corona flash was amazing, and the
result is the most wonderful crinkle pattern. He then hangs them on
the wall as art. (''No accounting for taste, I guess.'') It's
awesome to enter a room filled with Microsoft CDs burned at the
stake.

   The lapidary world is finding that CDs make GREAT polishing
discs for faceting gems. I'm not kidding! They are coated ever so
slightly with a bit of carnauba wax and then ``charged'' with

to recycle the darn things, they could bundle 'em up and donate

   In response to one woman's letter about her husband's snooping
into what she was doing on a chat channel, I recently asked if
anybody knew of a specific way it could be done. These responses
should make everybody a little more paranoid:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hubby'' might be using a key-logger _ a hacker's tool used for
recording keystrokes (usually used for the purposes of obtaining
passwords). Most likely he is using the IRC client's own
logger,.MDBR/.MDNM/ though. Whichever way, the guy's a jerk. (''No
argument about that.'')

   There is a simple script that can be used in mIRC, one of the
popular chat programs out there, and I'm sure that with very little
change it would work with Pirch and many other chats. No, I'm not
anal and don't have such a line in my remotes. (''Sure.'') I am
just responding to your request. (''I'd include the script here,
but it would scare the nongeeks. Besides, I don't want any more
snooping than there already is.'') For more on chat scripting, you
can come to Dalnet, channel \ mIRC4Dummies.

   There are many utilities that will track your every move on the
computer. One of my clients thought his salesman was spending too
much time at Pyro Pete's Porn Page (''not that there's anything
wrong with that'') instead of working on his sales reports, so he
had me install a client that he bought that tracks every keystroke.
But why would you want to? The lady who wrote you left out one
important piece of information. Why does the husband feel it's his
duty to check up on her? Maybe she's caused him no end of grief. I
would suggest that he divorce her, but she'd probably get the
computer. Good women are a dime a dozen, but a good computer, now
that's something worth hanging onto.

<P>
   On matters of unwanted sexual advances between men and women in
the workplace, you may think it is impossible to stretch America's
law any further.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has already ruled, just last week, that
employees need not have suffered any disadvantage in their job to
bring a lawsuit for harassment. They also ruled (in a case
involving lifeguards in Boca Raton, Fla.) that employers are to
blame, even when they are miles away, for failing to prevent
harassment among the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the harassment itself remains in the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A case was recently appealed as far as the Supreme Court in
which a teenage building worker (poor dear) has sued for being
mocked by his colleagues because he wore an earring.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? Why, with the case of Smith v United States
of 2021, in which, by a 7-2 majority (Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas dissenting), the court decided that Bobbi Mae Smith had been
sexually harassed not only by her employer, but by society at large
and its agents.
</P>
<P>
   Her employers, MCP Enterprises of Passaic, N.J., had taken every
precaution. Each passage in the building was at least eight feet
wide, and each corner was fitted with warning lights, to prevent
employees bumping into each other.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid unwanted sexual banter at the water cooler,
water and coffee were piped to each desk. Rubber plants (those
provocative stalks, those succulent leaves!) were outlawed. The use
of sexually suggestive equipment, such as paper clips or hole
punchers, was frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   And just to be sure of removing any whiff of sexual
incorrectness, Miss Smith communicated with her boss only by
e-mail, using a program designed to crash at the least indication
of a rise in body temperature at either end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   On the day in question, however, her boss summoned her to his
office. Here, he proceeded to behave improperly. He was seated at
his desk, somewhat closer than the four meters laid down by the
court in Bumpkin v Ferguson (1999).
</P>
<P>
   His hands were not plainly visible (Asphaltic Surfacing v
Simper, 2001), and the blind was drawn, indicating that sexual
congress was in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He then requested her to ``Take a letter, Miss Smith.'' The word
``take,'' of course, was a sexual imperative, implying the
dominance of the male and the submission of the female.
</P>
<P>
   ``A letter'' could be construed to mean a French letter, or a
letter beginning any one of the 15,863 words in English that are
capable of sexual interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss'' implied fixation on the marital status of the
plaintiff, even mockery of same.
</P>

<P>
   On matters of unwanted sexual advances between men and women in
the workplace, you may think it is impossible to stretch America's
law any further.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has already ruled, just last week, that
employees need not have suffered any disadvantage in their job to
bring a lawsuit for harassment. They also ruled (in a case
involving lifeguards in Boca Raton, Fla.) that employers are to
blame, even when they are miles away, for failing to prevent
harassment among the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the harassment itself remains in the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A case was recently appealed as far as the Supreme Court in
which a teenage building worker (poor dear) has sued for being
mocked by his colleagues because he wore an earring.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? Why, with the case of Smith v United States
of 2021, in which, by a 7-2 majority (Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas dissenting), the court decided that Bobbi Mae Smith had been
sexually harassed not only by her employer, but by society at large
and its agents.
</P>
<P>
   Her employers, MCP Enterprises of Passaic, N.J., had taken every
precaution. Each passage in the building was at least eight feet
wide, and each corner was fitted with warning lights, to prevent
employees bumping into each other.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid unwanted sexual banter at the water cooler,
water and coffee were piped to each desk. Rubber plants (those
provocative stalks, those succulent leaves!) were outlawed. The use
of sexually suggestive equipment, such as paper clips or hole
punchers, was frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   And just to be sure of removing any whiff of sexual
incorrectness, Miss Smith communicated with her boss only by
e-mail, using a program designed to crash at the least indication
of a rise in body temperature at either end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   On the day in question, however, her boss summoned her to his
office. Here, he proceeded to behave improperly. He was seated at
his desk, somewhat closer than the four meters laid down by the
court in Bumpkin v Ferguson (1999).
</P>
<P>
   His hands were not plainly visible (Asphaltic Surfacing v
Simper, 2001), and the blind was drawn, indicating that sexual
congress was in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He then requested her to ``Take a letter, Miss Smith.'' The word
``take,'' of course, was a sexual imperative, implying the
dominance of the male and the submission of the female.
</P>
<P>
   ``A letter'' could be construed to mean a French letter, or a
letter beginning any one of the 15,863 words in English that are
capable of sexual interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss'' implied fixation on the marital status of the
plaintiff, even mockery of same.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Smith was so stunned that she remembered nothing of the
rest of the interview, save reminding herself over and over that
she must call her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyebrows were raised when the plaintiff decided to sue the
federal government, rather than her employer. But Justice Hillary
Clinton, writing for the majority, said this was quite justified.

   HELENA, ARK. _ The month of June saw the governor of Arkansas,
Mike Huckabee, announcing that he was going to the Arkansas half of
the Mississippi Delta, to sort out how to make the region grow.
Later in the month, the trip was postponed without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee is not the first politician to get cold feet about the
Delta and, alas, he will not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta, which covers parts of Mississippi, Arkansas and
Louisiana, is one of the poorest regions in the United States. The
area has had high, even extreme, rates of poverty for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Median household income there is $16,583; in the country at
large it is $30,056. In the Arkansas Delta alone, where 61 percent
of the state's population lives, unemployment is twice as high as
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of the houses have no running water. In Mississippi
County, 35 percent of children live in poverty and 40 percent of
residents lack a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips County, on the edge of the Mississippi River, ranks
among the worst in the nation in life expectancy for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the land is poor. The flat, rich fields are
perfect for growing cotton, and towns here once prospered on the
back of it.
</P>
<P>
   Helena, Ark., is typical. Helena was the home of seven Civil War
Confederate generals. The international King Biscuit Blues Festival
still takes place here.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of people from France, Ireland, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland, China and Lebanon migrated to the area before World
War II to make new lives in farming and the retail trade.
</P>
<P>
   All that began to crumble on Oct. 2, 1944, the day of the first
public demonstration of mechanical cotton-picking in Clarksdale,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Machine-picked cotton cost plantation owners $5.26 a bale; a
handpicked bale cost $39.41. Each machine performed the work of 50
field hands. It was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, 95 percent of America's cotton was harvested by
machine. The revolution is still painfully visible in Helena.
There, shacks sit beside rusted cotton gins on the outskirts of
town, and once-grand mansions are slowly falling down.
</P>
<P>
   The region was not left completely without resources. Cotton and
soybeans still grew, and there was still a lumber trade. Clothes
and furniture were manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   But, with one or two notable exceptions, local officials could
not be persuaded to lure new industry in; they were still convinced
that cotton would survive as the kingpin of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the manufacturing sector declined by almost half;
few new manufacturing jobs were found to replace the old. Most
young people now leave the region for larger cities and better
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Segregation, too, has left its mark. Poverty and unemployment
rates are particularly high among blacks, who make up 34 percent of
the Delta's population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Enterprise Development Corporation (EDC) in
Jackson, Miss., a study once showed that the Delta was like a
doughnut, with rich white farmers making up the outer ring and poor
blacks making up the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The long tradition of giving blacks no proper opportunities, to
get either education or proper jobs, continues to divide the region
along lines of race.
</P>
<P>
   When the gambling industry came to the Delta in 1992, setting up
nine casinos in dirt-poor Tunica, Miss., there were great hopes of
a regional revival. These have proved false. More than half the
population of the town of Tunica itself still lives below the
poverty line, and unemployment there is 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also continue to leave; over the past ten years, the
population has fallen by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the gambling industry has not spread either to the
northern parts of Mississippi or across the river to Arkansas,
where some small Delta towns are simply disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   What can help the Delta to rise again? Cotton's shrinking
acreage will not make a comeback. Many plantations have given way
to catfish farms, but these too are past their glory days.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EDC, local small businesses have trouble
getting loans or financing because this is, historically, an
agricultural region; banks will lend money if there is land as
collateral, but are reluctant if there is no land involved.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses need some incentive both to locate in the Delta, and
to stay there. Tax incentives apart, they need to be sure they can
get the work force they need.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Arkansas Mid-Delta Work Force Alliance, a
nonprofit initiative funded by the Foundation for the Mid-South,
has been working to improve the local economy, train the local work
force and find jobs for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   It has had some success in getting people into low-skill,
minimum-wage jobs, but has a long way to go before it makes a mark
on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is also a possibility. The Delta may be as flat as a
pancake, but its musical history is as rich as the soil itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, attempted
to turn Helena into a bright tourist attraction by creating the
Delta Cultural Center to promote the region's rich blues tradition.
The Center now draws in up to 19,000 visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Huckabee sees a similar answer for the future: tourists
mixing with business leaders. Like governors before him, he says he
has hope for the region. But many other minds need to be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people still believe, as one Arkansas economist put it,
that the best thing that could happen to the Delta would be if
everyone just moved away and left it.
</P>
<P>
   Before any inroads can be made with community reinvestment and
new initiatives, a great many parties both public and private _
nonprofit organizations, banks, state and federal officials _ must
decide that they believe the place has a future. &QL;

   BENNINGTON, VT. _ Consider the egg: nutritious, inexpensive,
compact, attractively packaged, indispensable in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, according to recently repeated warnings from the
Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Agriculture and even
the egg industry itself, eating eggs in a less than hard-boiled
state may make you ill or even kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, mayonnaise and hollandaise; farewell, toast soldiers!
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, chicken eggs that were unblemished and
uncracked were widely considered sterile. Now a particular serotype
of Salmonella enteritidis has managed to infect the ovaries of some
hens, and so their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking kills the bug, but recipes that use raw or lightly
cooked eggs can cause a diarrheal disease which, in serious cases,
can leave victims with arthritis, colon perforations or other
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it leads to death.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was alerted to the problem by the Salmonella outbreaks
between 1982 and 1987. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) saw a
comparable increase in American cases around the same time, and
wondered aloud in medical journals in 1990 if they were looking at
a new pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   But wondering was almost all they did. Most health departments
were reluctant to condemn eggs or to issue blanket warnings, and
many consumers considered the risk a small one.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers of cases grew, the CDC's warnings about eggs were
first directed at nursing homes and restaurants; then at people
with weak immune systems, including the very young and very old,
patients with organ transplants, those undergoing cancer therapy
and people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   All these groups together accounted for about a quarter of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, the CDC announced that undercooked eggs were safe
for no one. These warnings did not prevent, that very year, the
largest single outbreak of illness so far traced to eggs in
America, when a nationally distributed brand of ice cream made
about 224,000 people ill in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   There were no eggs in the ice cream itself, but the mixture was
transported in trucks that had previously carried liquid eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak incidentally revealed that, whereas 100,000 cells
of Salmonella were once considered necessary to trigger infection,
as few as ten cells might do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Agriculture Department (USDA), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and even the egg industry agree that nobody
should eat eggs that have not been thoroughly cooked. But how
dangerous are they? There, confusion is still apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the egg industry agree that about one
in 20,000 eggs is actually contaminated: a figure that would put
the average egg-eater at risk only once every 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, however, in a speech at Michigan State University,
Catherine Woteki, the undersecretary for food safety, said that
Salmonella probably caused nearly 900,000 illnesses a year in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, the USDA revised the figure down to 661,633;
but, since Salmonella has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, this
would still account for 661 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   What should be done?
</P>
<P>
   As some scientists in the 1960s and 1970s correctly noted,
Salmonella infection may be rooted in the industrialization of
egg-production. Because egg-laying flocks are closely bred, they
lack genetic variety.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated feed, dirty sheds and the use of antibiotics may
all add to the risk of disease. Yet so, too, may egg-washing.
</P>
<P>
   Washing not only warms up the egg, which then cools slowly in
the carton, but also removes the natural protective film on the
shell, opening the door to contamination from the washing water.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, after an epidemic of egg-related illnesses in New
England, the USDA started a Salmonella surveillance program which,
among other things, attempted to trace implicated eggs back to the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   But the CDC reported that distributors had begun mixing eggs in
the cartons, which meant that they could not be traced. In 1990,
USDA trace-backs successfully identified the source 86 percent of
the time; by 1993, the number of successful trace-backs had dropped
to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the egg industry has used its influence with a
sympathetic Congress to strike down financing for the
Salmonella-tracking program. Although eggs were identified in 1990
as a ``hazardous food,'' meaning they required refrigeration, the
USDA admitted in 1996 that the rules had never been enforced
because the egg industry felt they were too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   This May, the FDA and the USDA jointly asked for comments on a
new proposal to address the problem of Salmonella in eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerating and date-stamping cartons are two of the
suggestions _ along with the idea that consumers should be educated
about the dangers. At present, they remain in ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many egg-warnings on the World Wide Web for
computer-literate cooks, there are none on commercial egg cartons:
precisely the place where they might do some good. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Bill Clinton had not long been in China before his
American tormentors began to change their tune.
</P>
<P>
   Stories that Clinton was embarrassed by the brief detention of a
handful of dissidents and China's denial of visas for some
journalists turned to grudging respect when 100,000 ordinary
Chinese welcomed him in Xian.
</P>
<P>
   But what really made the difference was a debate with China's
president, Jiang Zemin, on June 27. This was broadcast live on
state television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed America's disapproval of the Tiananmen Square
killings in June 1989 and criticized China's behavior in Tibet,
calling for a dialogue between Jiang and the Tibetans' exiled
leader, the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later a speech and lively question-and-answer session
with students at Beijing University was also broadcast live.
Clinton stoutly defended American principles and said they would be
good for China too.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision by the Chinese authorities to allow
these events to be broadcast live took even the Americans by
surprise. Clinton's visit replaced the World Cup as the capital's
main topic of conversation in this lively week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took his campaign style to China. Officials among his
huge entourage were flushed with delight that the president's mix
of empathy, robustness and good humor appeared to go down so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had not heard criticism of official policy aired in
this way before. It came as a surprise to many to hear that the man
whom most Chinese know as ``the splittist, so-called Dalai Lama''
was, according to Clinton, a nice, holy man whom Jiang might like
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The ``June 4th incident,'' as the Tiananmen Square massacre are
known in official jargon, is rarely mentioned by the state media.
Jiang said nothing startling about Tiananmen in reply, only that
stability today would not have been possible without an iron fist
then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that he said anything at all in defense of the
tanks was remarkable. China has only once before seen a political
leader in a freewheeling press conference: Zhu Rongji gave one when
he became prime minister in March.
</P>
<P>
   The country had never seen its president in lively debate. For
some of the time at least, Jiang even appeared to enjoy himself.
The exchange has given the Chinese a new image of their leadership,
which may be one reason why Jiang did it.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Jiang may have considered the resumption of
``normal'' relations with America, nine years after Tiananmen,
important enough for him to adopt this American way of doing things
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang certainly longs for stature on the world stage in a way
that no previous Chinese communist leader has done. He clearly
enjoyed the pomp and attention accorded his own state visit to
America last autumn, and is said to have considered it a matter of
honor that the welcome he received should be reciprocated in full.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Chinese think Jiang may have turned into something
of an Americanophile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the greater openness also reflects changes in Chinese
politics. Since the death of China's paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, early last year, a good deal of wooden dogma has
disappeared from the Communist Party's words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The state media have become somewhat more cosmopolitan and
adventurous: it is no longer considered daring to expose party
shortcomings, at least at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Zhu both vigorously promote greater ``democracy'' at
the grass roots as a way of achieving more accountability. And they
probably agree, up to a point, with Clinton's assertion that civil
liberties underpin economic development. At the least, a more
relaxed political climate helps undermine left-wing opposition to
their painful economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Jiang intends to introduce a faster pace of
political change, bringing the experiment in grass-roots democracy
from the countryside _ where it extends, albeit imperfectly, up to
the county level _ into the cities and perhaps even to national
government.
</P>
<P>
   If so, does this again risk popular expectations racing beyond
the Communist Party's willingness to deliver? Not if the students
at Beijing University are anything to go by. Long famous for
challenging the establishment, in 1989 it set the Tiananmen agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the students are far less radical, and many are not
even sympathetic to those who protested at Tiananmen. Most were
impressed with Clinton, especially as he did not hector China when
talking about American ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says one, ``democracy'' is for America, whereas
``stability'' is for China.
</P>
<P>
   Those of the Tiananmen generation complain that such views show
today's students have been brainwashed by years of propaganda. But
there is another explanation. In 1989, party corruption, entrenched
statism and a worsening economic outlook dashed youthful hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Now no other generation in China has been able to look forward
as much to the possibility of a good career and a freer life.
</P>
<P>
   If Beijing University's students show any stridency, it is a
nationalism tinged with chauvinism. Students are as prickly as
their government over Taiwan. Many insist that America's arms sales
to the island are an overt form of support for independence. What,
one student asked Clinton, are you hiding behind your smile?
</P>
<P>
   Jiang will face criticism inside the party for allowing Clinton
to orchestrate the show. But he will no doubt defend the visit as a
success for China too.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some people close to Jiang appear to support some
sort of accommodation with the Dalai Lama in a way that might,
conceivably, release the thousands of Chinese troops pinned down on
the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang himself will also claim to have got a greater public
assurance from Clinton over Taiwan than before.
</P>
<P>
   And there is other compensation. Japan, India and Taiwan have
expressed concern that China and America might be forging a new and
powerful partnership in the region. Though the perception of that
is more powerful than the reality, it will greatly please China's
masters. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ Bill Clinton had not long been in China before his
American tormentors began to change their tune.
</P>
<P>
   Stories that Clinton was embarrassed by the brief detention of a
handful of dissidents and China's denial of visas for some
journalists turned to grudging respect when 100,000 ordinary
Chinese welcomed him in Xian.
</P>
<P>
   But what really made the difference was a debate with China's
president, Jiang Zemin, on June 27. This was broadcast live on
state television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed America's disapproval of the Tiananmen Square
killings in June 1989 and criticized China's behavior in Tibet,
calling for a dialogue between Jiang and the Tibetans' exiled
leader, the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later a speech and lively question-and-answer session
with students at Beijing University was also broadcast live.
Clinton stoutly defended American principles and said they would be
good for China too.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute decision by the Chinese authorities to allow
these events to be broadcast live took even the Americans by
surprise. Clinton's visit replaced the World Cup as the capital's
main topic of conversation in this lively week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took his campaign style to China. Officials among his
huge entourage were flushed with delight that the president's mix
of empathy, robustness and good humor appeared to go down so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had not heard criticism of official policy aired in
this way before. It came as a surprise to many to hear that the man
whom most Chinese know as ``the splittist, so-called Dalai Lama''
was, according to Clinton, a nice, holy man whom Jiang might like
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The ``June 4th incident,'' as the Tiananmen Square massacre are
known in official jargon, is rarely mentioned by the state media.
Jiang said nothing startling about Tiananmen in reply, only that
stability today would not have been possible without an iron fist
then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that he said anything at all in defense of the
tanks was remarkable. China has only once before seen a political
leader in a freewheeling press conference: Zhu Rongji gave one when
he became prime minister in March.
</P>
<P>
   The country had never seen its president in lively debate. For
some of the time at least, Jiang even appeared to enjoy himself.
The exchange has given the Chinese a new image of their leadership,
which may be one reason why Jiang did it.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Jiang may have considered the resumption of
``normal'' relations with America, nine years after Tiananmen,
important enough for him to adopt this American way of doing things
during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang certainly longs for stature on the world stage in a way
that no previous Chinese communist leader has done. He clearly
enjoyed the pomp and attention accorded his own state visit to
America last autumn, and is said to have considered it a matter of
honor that the welcome he received should be reciprocated in full.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Chinese think Jiang may have turned into something
of an Americanophile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the greater openness also reflects changes in Chinese
politics. Since the death of China's paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, early last year, a good deal of wooden dogma has
disappeared from the Communist Party's words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The state media have become somewhat more cosmopolitan and
adventurous: it is no longer considered daring to expose party
shortcomings, at least at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Zhu both vigorously promote greater ``democracy'' at
the grass roots as a way of achieving more accountability. And they
probably agree, up to a point, with Clinton's assertion that civil
liberties underpin economic development. At the least, a more
relaxed political climate helps undermine left-wing opposition to
their painful economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Jiang intends to introduce a faster pace of
political change, bringing the experiment in grass-roots democracy
from the countryside _ where it extends, albeit imperfectly, up to
the county level _ into the cities and perhaps even to national
government.
</P>
<P>
   If so, does this again risk popular expectations racing beyond
the Communist Party's willingness to deliver? Not if the students
at Beijing University are anything to go by. Long famous for
challenging the establishment, in 1989 it set the Tiananmen agenda.

GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL AT LAKE TAHOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. _ We were seated on a granite terrace
at the brink of Cascade Falls, but it actually felt like we were on
the brink of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Below us, beneath a drop-off literally at our feet, was Cascade
Lake, with sparkling blues and silvers from an afternoon breeze,
surrounded by forest greenness and an azure sky. Beyond to the
east, of course, was Lake Tahoe, cobalt blue and calm, available
for anybody to gaze at for a dose of instant serenity.
</P>
<P>
   To our right, just a few feet away, Cascade Creek went sailing
over the granite rim, creating a 200-foot waterfall, tumbling and
churning, with the cascading water droplets refracting the sunlight
like millions of miniature prisms. To our left, a chipmunk was
perched upright like a statue, begging for a handout like a trained
circus dog. Nobody else was in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Tahoe? This is Tahoe? What about all the people? The tourists
from all over America? Well, yep, this is Tahoe, and the crowds
just plain weren't here.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, I've always made my trips to Tahoe as part of an
expedition, like hiking the Pacific Crest Trail or the Tahoe Rim
Trail or a big story, like last summer when President Clinton
authorized new federal protection of the Tahoe Basin. Not this
time. Like most everybody else visiting Tahoe, I just wanted to
have fun, hiking, biking, maybe boatiny and driving.
</P>
<P>
   What I found was a re-discovery of why Tahoe is like no place
else on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   We started out simple, just to stretch our legs, the same way so
many families approach Tahoe the first day, heading to D.L. Bliss
State Park for two real easy walks. The first is the Balancing Rock
Trail, where after about 40 yards you arrive at this 130-ton,
oblong-shaped granite boulder that is set on this tiny perch and
the whole thing seems to defy gravity. Some day it has to fall,
right? Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Then we switched gears and headed out on the Rubicon Trail, a
meandering path just above the southwest shore of Lake Tahoe,
wandering through pine, cedars and firs, with occasional breaks for
panoramas of the lake. At one perfect lookout point, we took a
lunch stop. In moments, there were a half dozen chipmunks around
us, begging, sitting upright, like a chipmunk circus, hoping for
their nut for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubicon trail runs all the way past Emerald Point to Emerald
Bay, the best spots to soak up the 12-mile expanse of Lake Tahoe,
especially early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The morning air was still cool, mid-30s at dawn, but it warmed
quickly and, by early afternoon, the temperature was in the low
70s, tinged with the scent of pine duff, with light breezes below
puffy cumulus forming over the ridges. Ansel Adams could hardly
have designed a prettier picture.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, you took a bike ride on the paths out of
Richardson's Resort. The bike trail here runs three miles, then
connects to a loop that extends near the lake for another three
miles. If you cross the highway, there are also dirt roads and
routes in Eldorado National Forest where you can extend your trip
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed so pretty that the only way to see it all was
to drive the loop highway around the lake. Let me tell you, two
years ago, on a Friday, it took me more than an hour to drive just
from Truckee to South Lake, with the roads jammed all the way,
never getting over 30 mph. Last week, to my amazement, with an
early start and so few people here, it was an unpressured and
beautiful cruise all the way.
</P>
<P>
   What could be better? Well, this is what: We turned at the sign
for Fallen Leaf Lake Road, then drove to the trailhead for Angora
Lakes. From here, it is a 15-minute walk uphill, when you reach the
first of a series of three pristine lakes set in Sierra granite.
The last of the Angora Lakes is the biggest, emerald-green and
backed by a high granite wall where there were two dozen waterfalls
running from melting snow, with small rental cabins sprinkled along
the western shore.
</P>
<P>
   The locally famous ``lemonade lady'' still sells lemonade at a
small shop here, and for many visitors, drinking a cup is almost
like being baptized.
</P>
<P>
   This just couldn't be beat, right? But then, at the Glen Alpine
trailhead at the end of Fallen Leaf Lake Road, we hiked into
Desolation Wilderness. We passed a series of small waterfalls, then
climbed up a canyon, finally hitting snow at an elevation of about
8,000 feet, about 3.5 miles in near Gilmore Lake. There was perfect
quiet, with the air warm and sweeping views across miles of the
snow-flecked Sierra crest.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be better than this, right? But then it was off to
Cascade Falls, just sitting there at the brink of the falls,
soaking up dream-like beauty in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   Back in South Lake on Friday, the traffic was just starting to
get gummed up for the weekend at the Y, the intersection of
Highways 89 and 50, smog hovering over the roadway while engines
idled, cars at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   But up there at Cascade Falls, Tahoe has rarely felt so pure,
where with just a short drive and an easy hike we gained entry into
a different world where perfection is still possible.

   It was 1992, and a dark time for Honda. The legendary founder,
Soichiro Honda, had recently died. Rumors were circulating that the
company _ maker of the best-engineered Japanese cars _ was about to
be absorbed by its dreaded rival, Mitsubishi Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Bills were piling up from the financial follies of the 1980s,
the company had no new models and the economy was heading downhill
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's boss, did something painful, symbolic
and central to the strategy that has brought Honda back to life: he
axed the company's prized Formula One motor-racing division.

   Nobody expected it, because Kawamoto, who retires this week, has
worshipped fast machines all his life. The second word he learned,
as he watched Japanese fighters soaring skyward, was hikoki
(airplane).
</P>
<P>
   As a young engineering graduate at Tohoku University, he
secretly spent the proceeds of a national scholarship on a
secondhand motorbike for racing, while his family, unaware, kept
sending an allowance and paying the tuition fees. (Years later, his
wife made him repay his father.)
</P>
<P>
   When he joined Honda in 1963, Kawamoto wangled his way into the
research department, so he could work on racing motorbikes and
engines for racing cars. As a young board member he was threatened
with the sack for spending his time tinkering in the workshops and
skipping board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of Honda's most original racing-car designs was sketched on
Kawamoto's doodle pad during a tedious board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Honda was just the place for the young Kawamoto. It was supreme
in motor racing, winning the world car-constructors championship
for six years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Its agile little motor cars had all the poise and balance of the
motor bikes it built alongside them. It went on to turn out
exquisite masterpieces such as the all-aluminium NSX supercar,
capable of going wheel-to-wheel with any Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, it drew gasps of admiration from rivals
with diminutive little mid-engined two-seaters like the Beat. The
company disdained vans and light trucks as the sort of thing
produced by the mere metal-bashers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kawamoto took over as president and chief executive
in 1990, Honda was in thrall to its engineers _ a priesthood housed
in separate premises, untroubled by the dismal businesses of
marketing and accounting, with a say in everything from piston size
to pricing.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy soaring in the late 1980s, it hardly seemed to
matter that customers were not lining up to buy Honda's flights of
engineering fancy. There was always money to be made from sensible
Civics, Accords and dozens of different types of motorbike.
</P>
<P>
   But things were already going wrong. Honda's focus on clever
machines had diverted it from the dull matters that make a business
tick _ paying attention to what the customer wants and producing it
at a reasonable cost. By 1990, Honda was taking nearly twice as
long to get a new model into production as Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's culture had to change; but nothing in its culture told
it how. Fortunately, Kawamoto had the imagination to think beyond
his discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the man who had run Honda's Grand Prix program
showed the company what its priorities should be by putting an end
to its involvement in Formula One racing. And after that, the
company's most senior engineer pushed his fellow engineers from
behind the steering wheel and handed the keys to the manufacturing
and marketing men.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto turned the management system upside down. He got rid of
``Honda-ism,'' a collegiate style of decision-making, and
introduced instead a top-down management that brooked no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Out also went the sacrosanct Japanese seniority system. Now
people are paid and promoted strictly on merit.
</P>
<P>
   Most revolutionary of all, Kawamoto started asking potential
customers what they wanted from a car instead of letting the
engineers dream up designs they deemed the public should have.
</P>
<P>
   Market research revealed that aging baby boomers and their
children were tired of boring, functional sedans _ no matter how
clever their design. They longed for recreational vehicles (RVs) _
vans and Jeep-like off-roaders kitted out with the latest gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Honda has rushed out a series of RVs, starting with
the hugely successful Odyssey seven-seater in 1994, then the CR-V,
the Step Wagon, the SM-X and now the little Capa wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the boxy clothing of each lies a platform and
power-train borrowed from one of Honda's more popular sedans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the engineers would have thrown up their hands in
horror and insisted on designing each new vehicle from scratch. But
the cars-in-vans'-clothing have transformed Honda's fortunes and
now account for more than 70 percent of the company's domestic
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Honda is one of only two car firms in Japan making
serious money (the other remains Toyota), and the only one whose
sales are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Kawamoto saved Honda by betraying his traditions, but he himself
hasn't really changed, as his retirement plans suggest. ``I don't
play golf and I don't sing karaoke,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about cars; and when he isn't thinking about them, he
is restoring or racing them _ indeed, he might well run Honda's new
team from Britain when it returns to Formula One racing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the big question that his successor, Hiroyuki
Yoshino, another engineer who came up through R&AMP;D, will have to
face. Companies are as hard to change as people; so, now that Honda
is out of trouble, will it revert to its engineering-driven,
self-indulgent self? &QL;

   It was 1992, and a dark time for Honda. The legendary founder,
Soichiro Honda, had recently died. Rumors were circulating that the
company _ maker of the best-engineered Japanese cars _ was about to
be absorbed by its dreaded rival, Mitsubishi Motors.

<P>
   Bills were piling up from the financial follies of the 1980s,
the company had no new models and the economy was heading downhill

PLAYING BY `HOUSE RULES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A curious lad named Homer Wells has just made a
fascinating, frightening discovery. Though his outstretched hands
are empty, his words convey a powerful image: Homer has stumbled
upon a discarded fetus, dumped on the ground outside a ramshackle
Maine orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   This memorable scene, instantly recognizable to readers of John
Irving's novel ``The Cider House Rules,'' also constitutes a
defining moment in the six-hour adaptation of Irving's book that
opens Saturday at the Mark Taper Forum.
</P>
<P>
   As Irving writes it, the incident certainly makes for high
drama. But is that the same thing as great theater?
</P>
<P>
   Actor Tom Hulce thinks so, and he's betting that Southern
California audiences will agree that Irving's best-selling book
deserves to be seen in three dimensions, not just on the printed
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is theatrical. It's got a kind of heightened quality to
it,'' says Hulce, an accomplished stage performer probably best
known to movie audiences as Mozart in Milos Forman's ``Amadeus.''
``There's something in the Dickensian influence of this one that it
feels different to me from his other books, in terms of crying out
for a life on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar to millions of readers as a fat, controversial novel of
the mid-1980s, ``The Cider House Rules'' has spent nine years
making a careful transition to the playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   With the author's consent _ though not his active involvement _
Irving's 560-page story of a well-meaning but tortured Maine
country doctor, Wilbur Larch, and his beloved protege Wells, has
been turned into a two-part, six-hour marathon, boiled down from an
eight-hour version that premiered in 1996 at the Seattle Repertory
Theatre. In her review of Part 2, Seattle Times theater critic
Misha Berson noted only one major shortcoming of the time-consuming
production: ``It comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   With a plot that revolves around not only abortion but incest,
domestic violence, social inequality and grinding poverty, ``The
Cider House Rules'' isn't what you'd call beach-blanket reading.
But in typical Irving fashion, the novel alternates comedy and
tragedy, often within the same paragraph. Picaresque adventures and
romantic interludes offset grim evocations of primitive
gynecological methods.
</P>
<P>
   Still, turning a work of such Victorian girth into a nimble
piece of stagecraft posed many challenges for its three adapters,
co-directors Hulce and Jane Jones and playwright Peter Parnell, who
devised the script.
</P>
<P>
   Ask why they did it, and the trio becomes nearly as verbose as
Irving's famously expansive prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the fact that it could deal in scope from parts that
are hugely comic to things that are very serious to things that are
deeply eccentric and other things that are just full of true
sentiment,'' says Hulce during an interview at the Mark Taper's
administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I responded to the father-son story at the center of
it, and to the exploration of the abandoned and neglected and
abused, and what our responsibilities are to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Jones chimes in with another of the story's
themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controlling your own destiny,'' she muses.
</P>
<P>
   ``... What your responsibility is to a gift that you may have,''
Hulce counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with lies,'' Jones responds. ``I mean, it's just about
life!''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The Cider House Rules''' is sometimes reductively
described as Irving's ``abortion novel,'' neither the book nor the
play spend much time thrashing out the subject. What attracted
Hulce and company to the novel wasn't that it was issue-driven, but
character- and plot-driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything Jane and Tom have been saying about their
responses to the novel, I had as well,'' says Parnell, ``and in
addition I felt that I responded to the world of the orphanage as a
Dickensian world, as a world of styles that I felt could work with
both narrative and dialogue, a world that I felt somewhat in its
simplicity reminded me of Thornton Wilder's play-writing, which I
love very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving's admiration for meaty 19th-century novels filled with
long, complicated sentences and tongue-in-cheek asides is
well-known. So is his disdain for what he calls ``the flat,
emotionally inscrutable, spare, modernist and post-modernist
style'' of fiction-writing, the ``grocery list'' prose he
associates with Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``The World According to Garp'' and ``A Prayer for
Owen Meany'' admits he was dubious about the idea of adapting
``Cider House'' for the theater, a literary form for which he
professes little affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lonely there for a while,'' Jones admits. ``I mean, he
(Irving) was so divorced from the idea of it, because of his
feeling of not being very enamored of the theater. He was very
upfront about it, and yet it felt lonely not to have the father's
blessing. I mean, none of us would be here if it wasn't for John's
story.''
</P>
<P>
   But after talking with Hulce and Parnell, Irving allowed the
project to proceed, provided it didn't interfere with a movie
screenplay he's been working on for years. (A film version is
scheduled to begin shooting this fall with Lasse Hallstrom of ``My
Life as a Dog'' directing.)
</P>
<P>
   When Irving finally sat down to watch Part 2 of the Seattle
production a year and a half ago, he wasn't sure what to expect.
The outcome? A conversion as spectacular as any to be found in
Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful,'' Irving says. ``I can't wait to see
the production here (in Los Angeles). I've read the six-hour script
of Peter's, and I'm so envious because I've spent 13 years writing
the screenplay for four different directors. And I keep telling
(Parnell and Hulce), I keep saying, `I'm so jealous of you guys
because you have six hours and I only got two! And every time I see
a version of the play, I'm looking at something and thinking, `Oh
(expletive), I took that out, I lost that scene, I lost that
character.' And they've managed to keep most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The germ of the stage production dates to the early 1980s, when
Hulce read a draft of a ``Cider House'' screenplay and met with the
late Phillip Borsos, the director initially assigned to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked his head off,'' Hulce recalls. ``I talked to him for
two hours about this story. I had no idea that I had the kind of
passion for it that I did. And, as I described the moments, I
realized that they were very theatrical moments, they weren't
cinematic moments, because of the way that the stage uses language
and the way that the stage celebrates sentences _ and sentences you
want to say out loud. And also, as there are so many parts of this
that can only live if you use your imagination. When they become
literal, it's not nearly as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulce and Parnell had been friends since 1982, when they worked
together on Parnell's play ``The Rise and Rise of Daniel Rocket.''
Hulce played the title role at Playwrights Horizons in New York and
also on a subsequent PBS broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, another cast member, would go on to found Seattle's
Book-It Repertory Theatre, a company that re-creates books on
stage, word for word. She describes the company's mission as
``celebrating'' books _ not ``interpreting'' them _ by sticking
with an author's original language and immersing audiences in the
world of the book, ``not just the world created within the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century ago, Broadway was awash in hit plays based on
contemporary fiction, such as Tad Mosel's ``All the Way Home''
(adapted from James Agee's ``A Death in the Family'') and a version
of Nathaniel West's ``Miss Lonelyhearts.'' But as the nonmusical
American theater has grown more marginalized, the novel-as-play has
fallen out of favor. When books get adapted nowadays, they're
likely to be time-tested classics like ``Nicholas Nickleby'' or
``The Grapes of Wrath.''
</P>
<P>
   Its adapters believe that if ``The Cider House Rules'' proves
successful _ a Broadway run still is being discussed _ it could
mean the time has come again for an old-fashioned form of
tale-telling that's too good to keep between the covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that it is not only so smart and so funny and
so determined to explore difficult territory, it hopefully is the
best of what a huge novel-length story can offer,'' Hulce says.
</P>

A GLOWING SEND-OFF FOR MR. RODEO DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Fred Hayman has promoted Rodeo Drive and Beverly
Hills for 30 years, and the city paid him a stylish tribute last
week with a retirement party at the Beverly Hills Civic Center
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, the legendary retailer _ who attracted
international celebrities to his glitzy store (originally Giorgio,
then renamed Fred Hayman) on Rodeo Drive, inspired Judith Krantz to
write the best-selling novel ``Scruples,'' coordinates the fashions
on Oscar night and helped found the Rodeo Drive Committee 25 years
ago _ has closed up shop.
</P>
<P>
   To prove he'll be missed, 350 friends from the community
gathered to toast him with Moet champagne and sing ``Hello,
Freddy,'' a specially written version of the show tune ``Hello,
Dolly.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Merv Griffin played master of ceremonies for the gala
that included entertainment by the L.A. Opera, Paradise Gospel
Church Choir, Mariachi Express and the Little Big Band. Special
guests included author Krantz, as well as buddies Natalie Cole,
Casey Kasem, Robert Loggia and Daily Variety columnist Army
Archerd, who presented Hayman with a mock-up of the publication
featuring a front page tribute to ``Mr. Rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous neighborhood restaurants and hoteliers provided the
dinner fare, which included Chasens' famous chili; McCormick &AMP;
Schmick's oysters on the half shell; Jimmy's sirloin and salmon
tartare; and the Beverly Hilton's crab cakes.

DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a bit of friendly advice to new parents, I often counsel them
never to talk badly about anyone _ friends, in-laws, sisters,
brothers _ in front of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``As sure as they can recite their ABCs, they will tell on
you,'' I've repeated more than once to laughter. ``Granny, are you
fat? Mommy said you're fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Children have a way of making us see who we really are, of
making us feel ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is difficult to consider the daily headlines _ child
mutilated for bed-wetting, daughter sexually abused as mother
watches, 5-year-old injured as mother chases car _ without feeling
as though we've disregarded our responsibility to build spiritual
values in our children by example.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, I feel as though I'm in the very midst of Sodom and
Gomorrah, on the brink of destruction because of the sinfulness of
its people.
</P>
<P>
   But how much does my own behavior contribute to this moral
decay? How does my behavior affect, for instance, the way my
daughters behave toward others? Is my life one that I would want
them to mirror? Am I only ``good'' when I know someone is watching?
Are you?
</P>
<P>
   This has long been my own personal struggle, but I was reminded
again of its importance in the global sense the other day when I
ran across a copy of Aaron Hass' book ``Doing the Right Thing,
Cultivating Your Moral Intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hass is a professor of psychology at California State
University, Dominguez Hills, and an assistant clinical professor of
psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine. He is a husband and
father of three children.
</P>
<P>
   Having read ``Doing the Right Thing,'' I suspect he is honest
and every day makes a sincere effort to treat others as he would
have them treat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a book about abstract or philosophical concepts of
justice,'' he writes in the first few pages. ``This is a book about
approaching your ordinary relationships and your everyday
quandaries with greater empathy, greater sensitivity, greater
fairness and greater kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hass is convinced that in order for him _ and the rest of us _
to feel safer in this ``every-man-for-himself'' world, everyday
moral behavior must be addressed. It is commonplace decency that
will lay the foundation for a better society.
</P>
<P>
   Hass says emotions can get in the way of doing what's right. He
says the golden rule provides the quintessential moral principal of
human relationships. And, among other things, we have a duty to
help others feel good about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to disagree with him on these. But do we need God in
order to do the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   Hass doesn't think so. He believes we can be moral apart from
belief in a transcendent being, if we refuse to accept the
pessimistic view that man is more powerfully driven by evil
impulses than by good ones.
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy that, because I can't forget who I was without God,
and that through him I cannot only be good, but perfect before him.
In the past, when I was wronged, my first thought was to get even.
Today, I'm motivated to pray for those who wrong me, to love them
even though my love may not be returned.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that I am perfect, but it does mean that I no
longer measure my goodness by imperfect man, but by a perfect and
holy God. And it means that more often than not, I can choose God's
will for my life even when I'd much rather do my own thing.
</P>
<P>
   Do I need God to be able do that? Yes, I do.
</P>

GET READY FOR GAVEL-TO-GAVEL HUGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Vickie Campbell held tightly to her painful
history, a stack of battered manila folders chronicling her 10-year
legal battle with her ex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got papers here that say you're the problem,'' the
ex-husband's lawyer said, goading her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 14 pounds of paper here that says he's the problem!''
Campbell shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough of that!'' said Los Angeles Municipal Court
Judge Juelann Cathey, pushing her chair away from her desk.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrapped Campbell in her arms, holding the woman as she
raged about the trouble with single motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to tell you I can solve all those
difficulties, but I can't,'' the judge said, slipping a hand on the
woman's back and ushering her out of chambers.
</P>
<P>
   As they walked together, the judge turned back to the lawyer.
She wasn't really mad. To let him know that, she crinkled her nose,
crossed her eyes and stuck out her tongue until he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Cathey, 62, realizes that in family court, legalese makes about
as much sense as pig Latin. Even when vexing disputes over custody
and property are hammered out, litigants remain bound by memories,
emotions and obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scared, and they're angry,'' Cathey said. ``If I
can get through that and let them know I hear them, then we can
solve some things.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cathey doesn't address people as petitioners, plaintiffs or
parties. She talks to moms and dads and children and babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like giving a kid medicine,'' she said. ``If they
understand they have to take it, it doesn't matter how it tastes.
It doesn't have to be syrupy and sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the logjammed family court system, Cathey is known for
resolving disputes so effectively the San Fernando Valley Bar
Association recently named her Judge of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her demeanor in court is very unique among judges. She is very
casual and human and yet stern when she needs to be,'' said
Lawrence Sobel, chairman of the bar association's family law
section.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because long before she was a judge, Cathey was a
mother.
</P>
<P>
   She married Doug at 18. By the time she was 28, they had six
children: John, Rita, Elaine, Mark, Robert and Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   They lived comfortably in Van Nuys. He worked as a heavy
equipment operator. She visited neighbors, minded her children as
they splashed away summers in the backyard pool and called her
brood in for dinners of black-eyed peas, corn bread, okra and fried
chicken _ Doug's favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy as a lark,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and the kids were playing board games in the summer of '64
when an ashen-faced foreman knocked on the door. Doug had been
crushed by a log while clearing land in Porter Ranch, he told her.
</P>
<P>
   The next hours and days passed in a blur, a maelstrom of grief
and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the sun rose and set by him. I thought I was going
to die,'' she said. ``I wanted to die. I thought, `Why did you
leave me with all these kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother came. So did friends and neighbors and the parish
priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs in the family,'' Cathey told him, a bit of black
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Doug's death was an eerie repeat of Cathey's father's death; her
dad was killed more than 20 years earlier on the job when he
slipped from a grain elevator.
</P>
<P>
   When Cathey's mother went out to work, a then-6-year-old Cathey
learned to fend for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how to manage,'' she said. ``To lock the door and do
your homework and go to school. You carry your key, and if you lose
it, you stand out in the rain. You don't lose it twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced again with the loss of the most important man in her life,
Cathey slipped out alone to buy a black dress for her husband's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The saleswoman at the department store started chatting about
the awful story in the newspaper, a freak accident that killed a
man, leaving a poor young widow to raise six kids, 3 months to 8
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me,'' Cathey told her.
</P>
<P>
   Life, Cathey says, is like a picket fence. There are peaks and
valleys and jagged edges that nearly tear you apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God only gives you what you can stand,'' she says. ``I
think life prepares you for what's ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   From a black dress to her black robe, Judge Cathey continues to
help fractured families cope. Some want her to bandage the tattered
remains of kinship. Others want her to sever the ties once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
   More than merely presiding over court, Cathey holds court, a
grand dame who doesn't need a gavel to wield authority but does so
with the force of her personality.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet, 2 inches, Cathey doesn't just walk into the
courtroom. She breezes in, a whirlwind of blue-eyed enthusiasm with
strawberry blond hair, greeting lawyers and litigants alike with
slaps on the back and bear hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will support your children. You will have pride in them,''
Cathey lectures deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I catch you driving, I will send you to jail,'' she warns
those who lose their license for driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Then she'll come down from her pedestal, rest her hand over
yours, drape an arm over your shoulder, lift you out of your chair
and sweep you into an embrace if she thinks you need one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to come here and take their lumps,'' she says. ``But
I can do it with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Campbell was furious at the judge's decision to grant her
ex-husband joint custody of their two children. But how does she
feel about Cathey personally?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love her to death,'' Campbell said. ``I argued with her
... She could have thrown me out of there, but she knew I needed to
have her hear me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the only judge in the county who handles both criminal and
family law cases on a daily basis, Cathey's courtroom is always
bustling.
</P>
<P>
   She hands out chocolates to the defense, the prosecution, the
tired moms slumped on the spectator benches. She stocks stuffed
animals for the kids to take home.
</P>
<P>
   She kneads her hands constantly to relieve the pain of carpal
tunnel syndrome. Two operations last year left red scars etched
from her elbows down her forearms.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor ordered her to write less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I could stop brushing my teeth and not work the curling
iron, but how am I supposed to not write?''
</P>
<P>
   It seems implausible that a woman as self-reliant as Cathey has
the patience to deal with the endless stream of people who need
her. But she does.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she eats a sub sandwich and fries during a midday break,
visitors stop in to ask advice. A janitor complains he got locked
inside a corridor between two buildings. Another man apologizes for
being late and launches into the particulars of his case.
</P>
<P>
   Cathey grasps his hand, pats his shoulder and tells him to go
get lunch. Did she know his name?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord only knows,'' she said when he was out of earshot. ``He's
charged with something or other.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she believe every sad story she hears? Is every hand pat,
hug and compassionate nod completely heartfelt?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, she says. It's her job to help people through the
court system, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot have a personal relationship with these people,'' she
said. ``The job of a judge is to sit in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   And because she maintains her distance, only occasionally does
she she get truly mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman said to me, `Honey. I can't work because I have
children','' Cathey recalled a woman saying to her when Cathey was
serving as the first female public defender in Los Angeles. ``I
wanted to climb over the table and punch her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no tolerance for a lack of responsibility. People need
to own up and do what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, that's what she did under the most difficult
circumstances. Cathey hardly had time to mourn after her husband
died, what with children needing scrapes bandaged and shoes tied
and breakfast and lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, she needed to earn a living. She figured
there were two fields where she could earn enough to support her
family: law and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   She took an aptitude test that enabled her to enroll in law
school without an undergraduate degree and began her studies at the
San Fernando Valley College of Law, which is now part of the
University of LaVerne in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   She went to class at night while her mother watched the kids,
and she studied while they napped.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of only a handful of women in the law school. One
professor fondly called her his ``single mother,'' a play on words
at a time when single motherhood and law school rarely coincided.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me was an advantage, although it sounds
terrible to say it,'' she says. ``Everyone thought, `Oh, the poor
little widow. How can I help?'''
</P>
<P>
   When Cathey's youngest son had to undergo a hernia operation,
Cathey took her first-year torts and contracts exams in the
hospital with a nurse supervising.
</P>
<P>
   Then chickenpox struck. In succession over a period of several
weeks, four of Cathey's six children came home covered with red,
itchy spots. When the last two didn't come down with it, she made
them drink from No. 4's cup to get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did 5 and 6 by myself. Ha!'' she says, punctuating her
sentence with the short burst of staccato laughter that erupts when
she finds something she's said particularly funny.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through law school, 5-year-old Robert needed to spend six
months in bed to heal a degenerative bone disease in his hip.
</P>
<P>
   So the family fashioned a board with wheels and took turns
pulling him back and forth to school, even trick-or-treating. At
dinnertime, they'd prop him on a coffee table so he could eat with
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally came time for Cathey to take the bar exam, three
days of testing that would allow her to practice law, she wasn't
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pass,'' she said. ``I had six children waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her early jobs was as an assistant district attorney in
rural Colusa County, an area with a housing shortage so severe that
she and the kids camped out for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a ball!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the transition from easygoing housewife to a steely,
resolved supermom didn't come without a price, Cathey admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should have been more patient,'' she said. ``I think
I should have read to them more. I should have stopped worrying
about who spilled the milk and walked in it with them and stopped
and smelled the flowers and had more fun with them and appreciated
them more.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son John remembered the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like childhood ended that day,'' said John, now 42 and
an engineer. ``We had to help with the brothers and sisters and
changing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was very tender before it happened. After, she
hardened quickly to keep from getting walked all over.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems only fitting that a fighter like Judge Cathey would
choose to date a man like Art Aragon, a bail bondsman and a retired
boxer known as Los Angeles' original ``Golden Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   They met in court years ago. Cathey can sometimes convince him
to bring his pet parrot to court when he meets her for lunch.
Another day, he stopped by with his face swollen and purple _ from
liposuction. Cathey put a bag of frozen peas on his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting married,'' he says, winking at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so! Ha!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cathey does have a wish list of things she most definitely wants
to do. She wants to go to Ireland. She wants to ride in a blimp.
She wants a great-grandchild. She wants to see the Indianapolis 500
and Olympic gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Her judge's salary is $107,000, but she lives alone in a
two-bedroom Van Nuys condo. She drives an '89 American-made car.
She wears matching permanent-press pants and tops in bright pastels
so she doesn't have to waste time ironing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past the trappings of a fancy house,'' she said. ``I'm not
pleasured by material things.''
</P>
<P>
   She spends every other weekend in Las Vegas, visiting her mother
in a nursing home. She dotes on her 15 grandchildren, something she
was not able to do with her own.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's death was a ``staggering burden,'' and she will
miss him forever. If he hadn't died, would she have become the
woman she is today? Would she have gone to law school and become a
judge?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that,'' she said.
</P>

success is producing six swell kids who had kids of their own.''

<P>
   People who know Cathey say listening to other people's problems
is her calling. In fact, it is more like a role, a part she has
agreed to play as matriarch of a large family and the star in the
theater of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an exhaustion that comes with it,'' she said. ``But if
I didn't like it, I suppose I wouldn't do it.''

<P>
   With the summer season now in full swing in most parts of the
country and youngsters spending more of their waking hours out of
doors often skimpily attired, biting insects are finding easy
targets for the blood they need to reproduce. And parents once
again are challenged to find the best way to protect their children
from annoying and possibly dangerous bites from such critters as
gnats, mosquitoes, biting flies, chiggers and ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Product choices abound and continue to multiply. But all are not
equally safe or effective.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Contemporary Pediatrics, a medical
magazine for physicians, Dr. Adelaide A. Hebert, a professor of
dermatology and pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical
School in Houston, and Dr. Soni Carlton, now an intern at the
university's Galveston branch, discuss the pros and cons of
products currently available and the safest ways to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must always keep in mind that children are not just
small adults; what may be safe for a grown-up is not necessarily
safe for a child. A child's skin surface area relative to body size
is far greater than an adult's and a child's skin is thinner, so
any substance applied to and absorbed through the skin can have
much more of an impact on a child.
</P>
<P>
   This troublesome fact collides with the need to reapply
repellents every few hours, since they are rubbed off by clothing
and other objects and are lost to evaporation, wind, sweat, heat
and water. Also, the new products that combine repellents with
sunscreen require frequent reapplication to maintain the
sunscreen's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The leading and still the most effective all-purpose repellent
is one of the oldest products around: DEET, the popular name for
the chemical N,N-diethyl-m-toluamine, used as a repellent since
1957. It is sold in concentrations of 4 percent to 100 percent as
sprays, aerosols, gels, liquids, sticks and treated towels.
</P>
<P>
   However, products used on children should not contain more than
10 percent DEET, the lowest effective dose. In high concentrations,
which are most effective as repellents, DEET can be highly toxic to
children. The Texas physicians noted that 13 youngsters under age 8
are known to have developed encephalopathy, suffering seizures and
convulsions, after using too much DEET. Three children died, but
the others recovered completely. Most of these incidents followed
repeated applications of products containing 10 percent or 20
percent DEET.
</P>
<P>
   DEET products can be applied directly to the skin, but it is
safer with children to apply it to their clothing (it may, however,
damage plastics, vinyl, spandex, rayon and acetate). The problem
is, mosquitoes will bite any exposed skin that is not treated; DEET
on the nose will not protect the cheeks or forehead. Avoid putting
DEET near a child's eyes and mouth, on any cuts or abrasions, or on
the hands of small children.
</P>
<P>
   Citronella, a natural substance, is another time-honored
repellent. It is the active ingredient in Avon's Skin-So-Soft, the
bath oil that has acquired a sizable market as a repellent. Its
protection is short-lived, however, and although safer than DEET,
it is not as effective a repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Another natural repellent said to be particularly effective in
warding off mosquitoes is soybean oil. Two percent soybean oil is
the active ingredient in Bite Blocker, which also contains a
sunscreen. But Dr. Hebert said this product tends to sting the skin
and has an unpleasant odor, which would discourage its use.
Although rubbing the skin with kitchen soybean oil has not yet been
formally tested as a repellent, it would be safe for children and
may be worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are more concerned about ticks than mosquitoes,
since some ticks _ the deer tick in particular _ carry the agent
that causes Lyme disease. Permethrin, found in the tick repellents
Permanone and Duranon, is highly effective, far better than DEET,
Dr. Hebert said. It not only repels ticks; it kills them on
contact.
</P>
<P>
   But while permethrin is the active ingredient in products put on
skin to treat scabies and lice, it has not been tested for safety
as a repellent applied to skin. Therefore, experts insist that
permethrin repellent should never be applied directly to a child's
skin. Instead, it should be sprayed only on clothing and shoes and
equipment like tents, sleeping bags and netting. It will remain
effective through several washings, the physicians wrote. Dr.
Hebert said Permanone, which is generally not sold in pharmacies
and supermarkets, can usually be found in hardware, garden supply
and sporting goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   For the most complete protection against ticks, Drs. Hebert and
Carlton suggested applying a DEET-containing product to skin and a
permethrin product to a child's clothing. To minimize exposure,
repellent should be washed off with soap and water when the child
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Clever manufacturers have come up with a way to kill two bugs
with one stone. Several now make products that combine an insect
repellent with a sunscreen. However, according to a study published
last year in the journal The Lancet, the presence of DEET, found in
several combination products, can undermine the effectiveness of
the sunscreen, reducing its SPF (sun protection factor) rating by
about a third. Check the label before you buy. If you choose a
combination product with DEET, it would be best to buy one with a
high SPF _ 30 or more _ since you may be getting less than the
stated sun protection.
</P>
<P>
   Also, keep in mind that it would not be safe to reapply a
DEET-containing product to a child's skin every two hours, as may
be needed to get adequate sun protection. The Texas doctors suggest
instead using a combination product made with citronella as the
repellent. Or you can try adding soybean oil to your child's
favorite sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   One final point: It is also worth remembering that no insect
repellent is very effective against stinging insects like bees,
yellow jackets and other wasps and fire ants. Nor do black flies,
which are biters, seem to have much respect for repellents
currently on the market. (Dr. Hebert said that DEET does repel
black flies, but you can't prove it by my experience.) Avoiding
such insects is the best defense.
</P>
<P>
   Children should be taught not to disturb stinging insects and
especially not to flail wildly at them; these insects use their
stingers for defense, not procreation; they sting when they feel
threatened. If your child is stung, consult a doctor to prescribe a
steroid or to remove a stinger that was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Black flies are seasonal biters, usually attacking in late
spring in cooler regions like New England and the Upper Midwest. If
you can't avoid black fly territory during the biting season,
covering up with loose-fitting clothing is probably the best
defense, followed by small amounts of repellents containing
2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, an ingredient found in OFF! and 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as my family discovered on a June camping trip in Minnesota,
staying immersed in water works, too.

A SEMIPRO FOOTBALL PLAYER GIVES HIS LIFE FOR HIS DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The day they buried Big Roy, eight of his
teammates from the Dallas Avengers carried his oversized coffin.
</P>
<P>
   They buried him in a cream-colored suit, with a Black-and-Mild
cigar in his pocket and a sweat towel at his side. One at a time,
Roy's teammates laid their big hands on top of his, the way they
did in the huddle, then they swooped their hands in the air and
shouted ``Avengers!''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Lee Woods Jr. died on April 25, with seven minutes and 34
seconds left in the second quarter. He was 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people have heard of Big Roy or his dream. This is
Dallas Cowboys country. Nobody pays much attention to a
semiprofessional team that travels around Texas and Oklahoma
playing games on hot days in high school stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league football is nothing like the farm teams of
major-league baseball. The Avengers are not affiliated with an NFL
team. Their first season was sponsored by the Mid-City
Chrysler-Plymouth body shop. Their home field was a rectangle of
grass behind Nichols Junior High in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   None of these guys is groomed or recruited, and none is paid.
They work full-time jobs, have children and wives, and play in
anonymity. Some play because they love the game. Most play because
this is their last chance at professional ball.
</P>
<P>
   All of his life, Roy dreamed of playing in the NFL. He jumped
off the track that leads to pro ball years ago _ he quit high
school and gave up on college _ but he never gave up on his dream.
He believed a scout might come to a game, though few ever did, and
he still believed, even at 30, that he could make it to the big
time. He died trying.
</P>
<P>
   `MAN, I FEEL WEIRD': The Avengers lumbered from the locker room
across the parking lot and onto their home field to face the Big
Spring Warriors. They were 1-5 going into the seventh game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The first plays were sloppy _ a wide receiver dropped a 50-yard
pass, another guy tripped _ but the Avengers were winning 8-0 by
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A bad punt gave the Warriors the ball. Big Roy usually played on
the offensive line, but this game he was all over the field. He
played like he knew it would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   He slammed into Warrior linemen in a clash of helmets. He
hunched over the line and taunted them with mock introductions and
banter: ``Hello, my name is Roy. Nothing personal but I'm coming
after you. I'll be coming after you all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody doubted Big Roy when he volunteered to play defense and
keep the Warriors out of the end zone. ``Let's stop them,'' he
barked.
</P>
<P>
   With seven minutes and 34 seconds left in the second quarter,
the Warriors called a time out. It happened then: Big Roy's heart
beat out of control. It started beating fast, faster, so fast that
the bottom chamber filled with blood. When his brain demanded
blood, and none came, Roy collapsed. He landed flat on his back,
and he looked up. ``Man, I feel weird'' was the last thing he said.
</P>
<P>
   A fullback shouted toward the stands: ``Call 911!''
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics rushed down to the field, Roy's teammates prayed on
the sideline. ``Lord, let him be OK.'' Roy was big, but he was
healthy. He weighed 300 pounds, stood probably 6 foot 3 or 6 foot
4, but he wasn't fat, it was muscle. He didn't drink or smoke, and
he ate right. ``Please let him be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams decided to call the game. The Avengers followed
the ambulance. Quarterback Tony Naves was entering the emergency
room when a teammate stopped him. ``He's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A LIFELONG DREAM: It was Roy's best friend on the team, Darril
``Scooter'' Warren, who drove from the hospital in Arlington west
to south Dallas to tell Roy Sr. He stopped at a house with sheets
on the windows and a broken air conditioner on the porch. Roy's
father was home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't hear him right. I say, `OK, I'll be right
there. What hospital he at? I'll go to the hospital. He'll be all
right.' Then I thought about it. He hugged me. Scooter never hugs
me. He always shakes my hand. He said Roy is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Scooter called Roy's sister, Rose. She was expecting Roy to come
to her house after the game. His birthday was four days away, and
she planned a barbecue. She was putting ribs on the grill when the
telephone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy always wanted to be somebody,'' Rose said. As soon as he
was able to wrap his fingers around a football, Roy Jr. had one in
his hands. ```Daddy, you just wait. You gonna be so proud of me
when I make it big.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12 or 13, his sisters were his teammates, Linda his
receiver, Rose his offensive line. They were a few years behind
him, and they did whatever he did. Rose wore the red helmet, he
wore the gray, and after plays, he inspected his for flecks of red
paint. That meant he hit her good.
</P>
<P>
   Roy thought he was tough in his 13 1/2-sized shoes and his
XXX-large jersey and pants. Rose looks at his Spruce High photos.
He thought football players should look tough, so the boy with the
high cheeks and the lazy left eye and the thick neck doesn't smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, bless his heart,'' Roy's daddy said. ``He did all he
could to be somebody, to get somewhere in life.''

low-lying coastal areas. But it would be trivial compared with the

ARLINGTON, Texas: in life.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football. Football. Football. How many times did his ex-wife,
Arvillia Johnson, go to bed hearing him talk about the game? ``I
just knew that Roy Junior was going to be on TV. I think as old as
Roy Junior was he was not going to quit. I think he would have went
till he was 50.''
</P>
<P>
   How many games had she seen when they were married? She sat in
the bleachers, hot and mostly empty, with a baby on her lap and
watched him play.
</P>
<P>
   Brionne, who's now 8, and Isaac, who is 6, thought their daddy
could do no wrong. Little Isaac misses him so much he dropped to
his knees at the grave and started digging with little hands.
``Mama, mama, he's not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Football didn't break up their marriage, Arvillia said. They
grew apart. She kept the children; he came for them on weekends.
Roy filled the bedroom closet of his apartment with their clothes,
and stuffed all of his things into a coat closet.

<P>
   Roy always looked sharp and smelled nice. He was not the most
handsome man, but Arvillia said his personality was what people
loved, not his looks. They stayed friends after the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Roy dropped out of the 11th grade to cook at a Grandy's, and
nobody can remember why. Maybe it was to %a{n money. His daddy was
a contract worker who mowed grass, laid brick and built fences, and
Roy told Arvillia he didn't want to live like that. He had a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he could reach the NFL if he went through the
football leagues overseas. Rose typed his resume, and he promised
he'd send a jersey when he tried out. He never got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   IN MEMORY OF BIG ROY: They buried Big Roy beside a creek, in the
back corner of a cemetery, where the paved road ends. He wanted to
be buried beside his mama.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Woods was 47 when she died. She was working at a
hospital, cleaning, when she bumped her leg on a file cabinet.
Nobody knew she had a blood clot. She was in the bathroom when she
hollered out to Roy _ ``Junior!'' He rushed in, and she was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Big Roy had started a new job, selling used cars, one week
before he died. His sister Rose couldn't find any insurance papers
at his apartment, so the team paid for the burial.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates cried the day they buried him. They cried so hard
that Roy's family felt sorry for them. ``Those white men sure loved
Roy,'' his daddy said.
</P>
<P>
   They won together and lost together. Remember the game where the
referee clocked the time wrong and stopped them a minute-and-a-half
short? What about the one they lost 28-0? Or the game where 15
players showed up, and they faced a squad twice their size?
</P>
<P>
   They got to know each other in the rented van on road trips.
They stayed up late in motels talking about plays and game plans.
They talked about kids and jobs over interstate buffets. They
prayed together. They dreamed the same dream.
</P>
<P>
   Big Roy could have played in the NFL, said Tony, the
quarterback. Roy was that good. He knew how to save Tony from
sacks, he knew who to shove and which way to push to make a hole
big enough so Tony could run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   If Roy had heart problems, he never told his team or his family.
The Avengers didn't have a team doctor, and they didn't require a
physical, so no one knew about Roy's enlarged heart.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players didn't see the paramedics use paddles to try
to restart Big Roy's heart. The team had called for an ambulance
three or four times before that game, but every time, the guy had
come out OK.
</P>
<P>
   Big Roy didn't feel any pain. That's how it happens, doctors
say. It takes months, maybe years, for the heart to enlarge. Roy
had high blood pressure, which tightened his arteries and put more
pressure on his heart.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what triggered his heart beating too fast. It's
like a car engine that floods; there's so much blood so fast the
heart can't complete the cycle. Doctors say it can happen anywhere,
doing anything. Most people with enlarged hearts don't know they
have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his teammates cried because they saw themselves in that
casket.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Marcus Stewart bought life insurance for his family.
Tony thought about all the times his wife _ and his parents _ said,
``Aren't you getting too old for this?'' Tony is 28. Big Roy was
30. Tony has kids, so did Roy. Tony is healthy, and if a scout
called tomorrow, he'd go. Roy would have gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain football to people who don't play,'' Tony
said. ``It can be like an addiction _ that's how my wife would put
it. Once you start playing and understand the intricacies of
football, it becomes like a life.''
</P>
<P>
   After they buried Big Roy, the Avengers decided he would want
them to play. ``We went out and played in his memory, and we played
like he was there with us,'' said John, the team owner. ``We drove
six hours and played 38 guys _ 15 of us _ and we totally destroyed
them. It felt like he was there with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The last game of the season, a 40-foot field goal was spiraling
right off the goal post when it veered at the last minute and
sailed through _ like a dream.

<P>
   If you come to the Texas Back Institute looking to be
mollycoddled, you've come to the wrong place. The largest of the
country's new breed of comprehensive treatment centers for back
care, fat with cutting-edge technology and highly trained
specialists, the Dallas-based Institute seems the ideal place to
indulge America's credo -- fix me, bill me, and send me on my way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Americans give short shrift to back pain. No, they
care deeply, spending an estimated $50 billion a year on surgery,
drugs and rehab for their back pain, which doesn't sound like
nearly enough to anyone who has had passing acquaintance with the
molten-jolt sensations back-pain sufferers are privy to.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hochschuler is perfectly positioned to take advantage of
this windfall. Chairman of the Texas Back Institute, Hochschuler is
a spine surgeon. But Hochschuler, an affable fellow with a special
kinship with his patients (``I have a back problem, and my patients
are thrilled to hear it''), sees surgery as a last resort, and not
an infallible one. ``Surgery isn't going to make you 100 percent
better,'' states Hochschuler. ``Doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both to his patients and through seminars, videotapes
and books such as ``Back in Shape'' (Houghton Mifflin) and ``Treat
Your Back Without Surgery'' (Hunter House), Hochschuler tirelessly
trumpets a simple message.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to rely on the quick fix, but what they really
have to do is take ownership,'' he says. ``Back pain is a major
health problem. But most of it could be prevented if people took
responsibility for their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Hochschuler would be just as happy if you read his
books and left him alone. Many of his fellow back experts agree,
and they aren't adopting this tack because they want to play more
golf. ``With all the research, we're coming back to the same old
thing every time,'' says Roger Minkow, a Petaluma, Calif., back
specialist and former co-medical director of the San Francisco
Spine Center. ``When it comes to preventing or treating back
problems, it's exercise and lifestyle changes that are going to
make the major difference for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently four out of five people suffer some kind of back pain
at some point in their lives. The back is partly to blame. The
spine is highly complex, an anatomical marvel that is the
centerpiece of movement. But, for reasons only God and back
specialists can understand, the back's heyday is short. After about
20 years, the back begins eagerly hustling toward infirmity --
muscles stiffen; bones weaken; discs harden, bulge, fissure and
burst.
</P>
<P>
   And no one escapes. In a study published in the New England
Journal of Medicine in 1994, researchers found that two-thirds of a
test group of healthy adults with no back pain had abnormalities in
their spinal discs. This explains, in part, why three three nurse
clinicians manning the Texas Back Institute's toll-free hotline,
(800-247-BACK) field some 3,000 calls a month, many of them from
frantic weepy folk convinced their lives are now confined to
hospital gelatin and bedsores.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that, for many of these callers, picking up
the phone is the first thing they've ever done for their backs.
Don't fear the back's inherent de composition, says Hochschuler.
Address it. ``Back pain rarely occurs out of the blue,'' says
Hochschuler. ``Usually, when people develop back pain it's an
accumulation of insults that has led to their back problem. Bending
wrong, lifting wrong, not keeping in shape -- it all adds up. If
you address these things, there's a good chance you can prevent
back pain entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are willing to do what they can, they can avoid all
the medical practitioners,'' says Minkow. ``Unless they're one of
the unfortunate 5 percent that's going to actually need surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are plenty of things you can do to help your back
exercise tops the list. But, as experts point out, it's not just
about exercising the back. Yes, there are terrific strengthening
and stretching exercises that specifically target the back, and
they're important, which is why you'll find plenty of them
diagrammed in books such as Hochschuler's.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all you need. Shoring up the back means taking
care of the back's supporting cast -- namely almost everything from
head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that old song, 'The hip bone's connected to the leg
bone'?'' says Hochschuler. ``Well, the spine connects to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that strong legs -- hamstrings, quadriceps and glutes
-- help take pressure off the back. Ditto for strong abdominal
muscles --weak stomach muscles pull you forward, a disalignment
that puts strain on the spine (witness the aching backs of pregnant
women and potbellied men).
</P>
<P>
   Whole-body flexibility and aerobic conditioning are critical,
too: flexibility because tight muscles don't flex to life's
strains; aerobic conditioning because exercise on the move helps
your body deliver critical nutrients to the spine and builds a
degree of muscle strength.
</P>
<P>
   Spine types can discourse for hours on the physiology. Here's
what concerns the rest of us: ``How much time does a solid
preventive back program take?'' says Minkow. ``Three hours a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, prescribing specific exercises and sports is
difficult. ``Problem is, not all back problems are the same,'' says
Hochschuler. ``Some exercises feel good for some people, and bad
for others. The key point is, if an exercise hurts, stop doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochschuler and Minkow do offer some general guidelines to shore
up and protect your back. As a rule, twisting, bending sports can
be a problem; witness the conga line of golfers, racquetball,
softball and tennis players that marches through their offices.
Golf is particularly bad (``About the worst thing you can do,''
says Hochschuler). Not that these sports are out. It's just that
some kind of exercise program has to be sandwiched between weekends
so your back can handle the game.
</P>
<P>
   You also might consider some changes when you play. Hochschuler
has his golfers warm up before they start whacking balls, asks them
to bend at the knees when picking balls up and often has them
modify their swing, not much of a sacrifice given the state of most
golfers' games.
</P>
<P>
   Though cycling is generally great for backs (taking the weight
off the spine while strengthening the legs), Minkow has cyclists
with back problems raise their handlebars (``You don't want the
handlebars any lower than the seat'').
</P>
<P>
   Swimming also is good for the back. Again, the spine is freed of
the effects of gravity, and the back and critical support muscles
are strengthened. But swimmers with back problems, says
Hochschuler, should consider avoiding the butterfly stroke (it
requires hyperextension of both the back and the neck). Freestyle
can be a problem, too, constantly turning the head to breathe can
strain the neck and spine (a solution: Wear a mask and snorkel --
or try water aerobics).
</P>
<P>
   Even running, despite its inherent pounding, can work.
Hochschuler just asks his runners to buy shoes with good support
and cushioning and to avoid doing sudden stressful changes such as
upping the distance and speed of workouts simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is detail. Mostly, your aim is simple. ``The
important thing is to do something regularly,'' says Minkow. ``And
if it's a sport you like, odds are better that you will.''
</P>
<P>
   But sports don't strengthen and stretch like weight training and
stretching do, so both disciplines are critical to a healthy back.
Whole books have been written on both topics. Your best bet: Find a
good one and try the stretches and lifts they recommend -- allowing
Hochschuler's ``no pain'' dictum to be your guiding light.
</P>
<P>
   Weight training merits an additional word. Left untended, our
muscles weaken and our bones lose density, bad news for a piece of
anatomy built on these two blocks. Weight training targets both
slides in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   But done improperly it also can level the best of backs
lickety-split. Consider this: Perform a bent-over barbell row
(bending at the waist and pulling the barbell up to your chest)
with 60 pounds. The leverage places roughly 600 pounds of pressure
square on your low back.
</P>
<P>
   Minkow recommends avoiding overhead free-weight lifts such as
the clean and jerk, as they heavily compress an unsupported spine
(overhead lifts are okay on a well-designed machine with a bench
that supports your spine). In the interest of long-term back
health. He also advises skipping heavy weights altogether. If you
can't lift a weight 10 times, says Minkow, it's too heavy for your
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, when it comes to preventing back pain the
most important muscle may be your mind. ``No doubt, back pain can
put the fear of God in you,'' says Hochschuler. ``But most back
pain is not dangerous. And, if you stay disciplined, you can work
your way out of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   My children were delighted; I was appalled! There, standing
knee-deep in snow in my front yard was a herd of deer.
</P>
<P>
   They were munching away at the tips of my maple tree and nosing
around my junipers. In summer, I see them in early morning milling
around the Austin roses and lettuces. They once nibbled the tops
off every pea vine and tramped through the bean beds.
</P>
<P>
   Deer populations continue to grow, unhindered by any predator
except mankind and a few coyotes, causing untold damage to
landscapes in suburban and rural settings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any community blessed with some woodlands and open fields
is likely to have a hungry population of deer. The same can be said
for arboreta and park systems, which often have to battle deer to
save valuable plant life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a massive overpopulation of deer,'' said John O'Lear,
landscape architect with the Forest Preserve District of Cook
County, Ill. ``Spring ephemerals such as trillium, bloodroot, and
especially wild hyacinths, are being decimated in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Public gardens, horticultural and botanical research
institutions, natural areas preservationists and concerned
individuals have been focusing on developing systems for keeping
deer away from prized specimens, methods that could work at your
yard.
</P>
<P>
   If you are dealing with deer damage, educate yourself about
their habits, recommends a Cornell University spokesman. A variety
of deer control methods are discussed in the helpful brochure,
``Reducing Deer Damage to Home Gardens and Landscape Plantings''.
It is available by writing to the Department of Natural Resources,
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.
</P>
<P>
   Deer are selective feeders. They move along traditional routes
-- through tiny deer trails that slip through woodland openings and
over gaps in fences -- eating as they go.
</P>
<P>
   While they tend to follow familiar routes, they are capable of
learning to stay away from your yard if the way is fenced or made
impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the yard or garden with an 8-foot wooden fence deer
can't jump is one surefire deterrent. But not everyone wants to go
to this expense.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative that has worked well for deer-plagued Holden
Arboretum in Kirtland, Ohio is a nearly invisible mesh barrier
carried by Benner's Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was developed by Dr. David Benner, retired professor
of ornamental horticulture, who searched long and hard for ways to
keep deer from destroying his rare plant collection. After many
unsuccessful efforts, he devised a fine polypropylene mesh fence
almost 8 feet high that he used to enclose his entire yard.
Although nearly invisible from a distance, it should be hung with
12-inch long white streamers for two months to warn deer not to try
to trespass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use the 8-foot high fence around vegetable gardens or
to edge woodlands,'' said Benner, of Benner's Gardens. ``Shorter
fencing about 5 feet high can be adequate for surrounding smaller
beds like foundation plantings.''
</P>
<P>
   Benner's Gardens, in New Hope, Pa.(1-800-753-4660), also has
deer-barriers for driveways -- deerproof gates or in-ground grids
you can drive over but deer won't walk across.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy recommended by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources is to surround gardens with a polytape electric
fence. This is a single strand of bright plastic ribbon interwoven
with wire that transmits a shock when touched. Set the polywire
about 2 1/2 feet above the ground, a height deer could easily jump.
But they don't. They investigate it first -- nosing it and getting
a shock that teaches them to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   If fencing is not an option for you, you can try to avoid damage
by planting species deer find less palatable. Deer prefer to nibble
on well fertilized and new plantings with tender young growth, but
when the pickings are lean, they can eat almost anything. Fruit
trees, flower buds and evergreens tend to be among their favorites.
Look at the woods and fields near you for species that are thriving
without major deer damage. You can also ask your local cooperative
extension agent for his recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Repellents can discourage browsing, although they need
re-application at least every three weeks or after a heavy rain. If
the repellents wear off, even for just one night, deer may return
and cause untold damage.
</P>
<P>
   At Holden Arboretum, the most effective products have been
Bobex, Hinder (which can be used on edible crops), and Deeraway
(with an unappealing favor and smell). You also can purchase coyote
and other predator urines, using natural territory markers to
frighten deer away.
</P>
<P>
   Deer pose another problem, in addition to their feeding. During
mating season, from September to December, bucks mark their
territories by rubbing off tree bark. Because this can be enough to
kill small trees, wrap their trunks in 4-foot tall cylinders such
as plastic fencing or trunk guards to protect vulnerable bark. &QL;

 c.1998 Child  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time my husband and I moved, our youngest child,
Laura, was only 4 months old. As long as we soothed her cries with
gentle words, she couldn't have cared less where we lived.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with her big sister, 1-year-old Danielle. She hated the
whole process, had tantrums anytime we looked at a prospective home
and complained that she saw no reason why we had to move, even
though we explained it to her. But when we found a house on three
wooded acres, the excitement of exploring the expansive landscape
captured her sense of adventure, and her resistance slowly melted
away.
</P>
<P>
   For the first month, Danielle seemed unfazed by her new
surroundings. Then, as we were about to congratulate ourselves on
how well she'd adapted, her mood changed: She began sobbing, for no
apparent reason, at the most unpredictable moments. When pressed,
she burst out, ``I hate this house! I want to go home.'' Stunned,
we tried pinpointing what upset her. Talking about it seemed to
help alleviate her concerns. And gradually she returned to her old
self.
</P>
<P>
   About two years later, we moved again. This time it was
3-year-old Laura who had trouble adjusting. It was the strain of
change they were responding to, however belated their reactions
seemed to be, and we hadn't prepared them well enough for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's across town or across the country, moving ranks
right up there behind divorce and parental death in terms of stress
on kids,'' says Thomas Olkowski, a clinical psychologist in Denver
and co-author of ``Moving With Children.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot of them on the move. According to the U.S.
Census Bureau, of the 41 million Americans who move every year, 10
million are children under age 14. For kids, who often don't
understand why they have to move and who have little control over
the situation, moving can be a traumatic experience. There are ways
to make it easier, however.
</P>
<P>
   While you may not be able to anticipate every twist and turn,
here are steps to help pave the way:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``We're Moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Spare your child unnecessary anxiety: Don't break the news about
a move until you have concrete details about the date and location.
How you tell your child depends on her age. Too much notice invites
the incessant question ``Is today the day we're moving?'' Ann
Deaton, the director of psychology at Children's Hospital in
Richmond, Va., and co-author of ``Moving Survival Kit,'' recommends
giving preschoolers no more than two or three weeks' warning.
``Kids under 5 have a limited sense of time, so waiting for
something to happen can be hard,'' she explains. Help them by
circling the move date on the calendar and marking off the days as
they go by.
</P>
<P>
   Give school-age children, who have a better sense of time, at
least one month's notice before a move. Three months is appropriate
for an 8- to 12-year-old who may want time to break the news to her
friends. However, Deaton warns, more than that is a long time for a
youngster to deal with the anticipation of change.
</P>
<P>
   Older children may worry about losing contact with their
friends, says Olkowski. Help gather the addresses and phone numbers
of your child's friends, and encourage correspondence by
distributing pre-addressed postcards to the other children.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to your child's questions can help ease anxiety. ``At
any age, your children want to be reassured that they will be safe,
and they want to know what to expect,'' says Deaton. Preschoolers
will ask concrete questions that need specific answers, as Jean
Currie of Huntington, N.Y., learned. Her daughter, Jessica, was 3
when the family moved from New York City to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told her all about the new house -- she even took a trip
with us to see it,'' Currie relates. ``But we never defined who was
moving. One day, she asked, ``Mommy, will I be going, too?' We
hadn't realized -- she was worried! Quickly, we explained that all
of us were moving together.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the move, we thought it was wonderful the way that
Jessica was adjusting to our new home,'' Currie continues. ``But
two weeks later, she asked, `When are we going back?' Then we
realized why she had responded so well: She thought it was just a
trip! You can't underestimate the need to define everything
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   2. House Hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Asking a friend to watch your children as you house-hunt
eliminates the stress of having your attention divided, Deaton
notes. It will be easier on toddlers and preschoolers as well, who
often have difficulty understanding how much things cost or what
might be wrong with the roof. According to Deaton: ``Kids may
decide on the spot which bedroom will be theirs in a house you know
won't work, and your negative response can confuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   Children over the age of 8 may actually benefit from
accompanying you, however. ``Voicing their input helps them feel
like an important part of the move,'' remarks Jill Schneiderman, an
early childhood specialist at Work/Family Directions in Boston, a
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've chosen a new home, show the kids pictures not only
of the house but also of the neighborhood, schools and playgrounds.
If possible, take your kids on a walking tour -- the more familiar
they are with the area, the easier the adjustment will be.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pack It Up, Ship It Out.
</P>
<P>
   Enlist your children's help in packing, no matter how young they
are. Toddlers as young as 2 years old can help gather their toys.
Put your preschooler in charge of packing her favorite books. Older
kids will probably want to sort through and pack a lot of their own
belongings. Provide your child with a ``premove kit,'' suggests
Olkowski. The kit -- which might contain packing supplies like
markers and stickers to decorate boxes, sandwich bags for loose
items and rubber bands to secure such things as baseball cards --
lets your child participate in a fun and useful way.
</P>
<P>
   After all the anticipation, moving day itself can be almost a
relief. If you have movers, let one parent direct the furniture
arranging while the other concentrates on the kids' needs. Doing
the move yourself? Either use off-site child care or have someone
present at the move just to watch your children.
</P>
<P>
   Set up the kids' bedrooms first, advises Robert Butterworth, a
Los Angeles-based clinical psychologist. For children ages 2 to 8,
arrange their furniture as it was in the old house. ``You're
already changing their house and environment,'' comments
Butterworth. ``They need a little familiarity, especially for
sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk through your old house one last time with your child. Sally
Malech, mom of 2-year-old Asher in West Hartford, Conn., found that
when her family moved down the street, her son kept asking to go
``home.'' ``I finally walked through the empty house with him and
pointed out that his toys and bed were no longer there,'' Malech
says. ``He was reluctant to go in, but it really provided
tremendous closure for him. Now, every time we walk by he says,
`That's not our house. That's our old house.'''
</P>
<P>
   4. Life After the Move.
</P>
<P>
   In those first few days after a move, concentrate on listening
to your child's concerns, says Butterworth. Keeping an upbeat
attitude can defuse some of his fears. A picnic dinner on the
living room floor, complete with tablecloth, candles and take-out
food, will give him a sense of celebration and give you a
much-needed break.
</P>
<P>
   Walk around the new neighborhood together and point out
landmarks. Back at home, draw a map showing the location of the
playground, grocery store, library and school. Make sure your child
knows or carries his new phone number and address with him.
</P>
<P>
   Your child may regress in some way after the move. For example,
it's common, says Schneiderman, for a potty-trained child to start
having accidents. Your toddler may suddenly have difficulty
sleeping through the night. Older kids may develop behavioral
problems in school. You may be tempted to smooth over a rough
transition by offering your child rewards for good behavior, but
sticking to the routines that he's used to actually makes it easier
to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular discussion time with you so that your child can talk
about how he feels may help ease his anxiety,'' says Butterworth.
If this behavior continues for more than a month, however, you
should contact your pediatrician or family doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of kids will adjust within six to 18 months. ``Most
moves turn out OK, given enough time,'' notes Olkowski. ``Even a
move under the worst conditions can turn out to be a learning and
growing experience for the whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, my daughters, now 8 and 4, will move once again --
to a house eight blocks away from where we now live. They've begun
packing already, and while they consider themselves little pros at
this, I'm not taking any chances -- I've been preparing them for
weeks. Still, the other day I realized I may have fortified them a
little too well. As I was explaining that we would be saying
good-bye to our old house but would live close enough to visit it,
Danielle turned to me and said, ``Mom, don't worry so much --
you're going to be fine.''

 c.1998  Spirit 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you come to the Texas Back Institute looking to be
mollycoddled, you've come to the wrong place. The largest of the
country's new breed of comprehensive treatment centers for back
care, fat with cutting-edge technology and highly trained
specialists, the Dallas-based Institute seems the ideal place to
indulge America's credo -- fix me, bill me, and send me on my way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Americans give short shrift to back pain. No, they
care deeply, spending an estimated $50 billion a year on surgery,
drugs and rehab for their back pain, which doesn't sound like
nearly enough to anyone who has had passing acquaintance with the
molten-jolt sensations back-pain sufferers are privy to.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hochschuler is perfectly positioned to take advantage of
this windfall. Chairman of the Texas Back Institute, Hochschuler is
a spine surgeon. But Hochschuler, an affable fellow with a special
kinship with his patients (``I have a back problem, and my patients
are thrilled to hear it''), sees surgery as a last resort, and not
an infallible one. ``Surgery isn't going to make you 100 percent
better,'' states Hochschuler. ``Doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both to his patients and through seminars, videotapes
and books such as ``Back in Shape'' (Houghton Mifflin) and ``Treat
Your Back Without Surgery'' (Hunter House), Hochschuler tirelessly
trumpets a simple message.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to rely on the quick fix, but what they really
have to do is take ownership,'' he says. ``Back pain is a major
health problem. But most of it could be prevented if people took
responsibility for their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Hochschuler would be just as happy if you read his
books and left him alone. Many of his fellow back experts agree,
and they aren't adopting this tack because they want to play more
golf. ``With all the research, we're coming back to the same old
thing every time,'' says Roger Minkow, a Petaluma, Calif., back
specialist and former co-medical director of the San Francisco
Spine Center. ``When it comes to preventing or treating back
problems, it's exercise and lifestyle changes that are going to
make the major difference for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently four out of five people suffer some kind of back pain
at some point in their lives. The back is partly to blame. The
spine is highly complex, an anatomical marvel that is the
centerpiece of movement. But, for reasons only God and back
specialists can understand, the back's heyday is short. After about
20 years, the back begins eagerly hustling toward infirmity --
muscles stiffen; bones weaken; discs harden, bulge, fissure and
burst.
</P>
<P>
   And no one escapes. In a study published in the New England
Journal of Medicine in 1994, researchers found that two-thirds of a
test group of healthy adults with no back pain had abnormalities in
their spinal discs. This explains, in part, why three three nurse
clinicians manning the Texas Back Institute's toll-free hotline,
(800-247-BACK) field some 3,000 calls a month, many of them from
frantic weepy folk convinced their lives are now confined to
hospital gelatin and bedsores.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that, for many of these callers, picking up
the phone is the first thing they've ever done for their backs.
Don't fear the back's inherent de composition, says Hochschuler.
Address it. ``Back pain rarely occurs out of the blue,'' says
Hochschuler. ``Usually, when people develop back pain it's an
accumulation of insults that has led to their back problem. Bending
wrong, lifting wrong, not keeping in shape -- it all adds up. If
you address these things, there's a good chance you can prevent
back pain entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are willing to do what they can, they can avoid all
the medical practitioners,'' says Minkow. ``Unless they're one of
the unfortunate 5 percent that's going to actually need surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are plenty of things you can do to help your back
exercise tops the list. But, as experts point out, it's not just
about exercising the back. Yes, there are terrific strengthening
and stretching exercises that specifically target the back, and
they're important, which is why you'll find plenty of them
diagrammed in books such as Hochschuler's.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all you need. Shoring up the back means taking
care of the back's supporting cast -- namely almost everything from
head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that old song, 'The hip bone's connected to the leg
bone'?'' says Hochschuler. ``Well, the spine connects to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that strong legs -- hamstrings, quadriceps and glutes
-- help take pressure off the back. Ditto for strong abdominal
muscles --weak stomach muscles pull you forward, a disalignment
that puts strain on the spine (witness the aching backs of pregnant
women and potbellied men).
</P>
<P>
   Whole-body flexibility and aerobic conditioning are critical,
too: flexibility because tight muscles don't flex to life's
strains; aerobic conditioning because exercise on the move helps
your body deliver critical nutrients to the spine and builds a
degree of muscle strength.
</P>
<P>
   Spine types can discourse for hours on the physiology. Here's
what concerns the rest of us: ``How much time does a solid
preventive back program take?'' says Minkow. ``Three hours a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, prescribing specific exercises and sports is
difficult. ``Problem is, not all back problems are the same,'' says
Hochschuler. ``Some exercises feel good for some people, and bad
for others. The key point is, if an exercise hurts, stop doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochschuler and Minkow do offer some general guidelines to shore
up and protect your back. As a rule, twisting, bending sports can
be a problem; witness the conga line of golfers, racquetball,
softball and tennis players that marches through their offices.
Golf is particularly bad (``About the worst thing you can do,''
says Hochschuler). Not that these sports are out. It's just that
some kind of exercise program has to be sandwiched between weekends
so your back can handle the game.
</P>
<P>
   You also might consider some changes when you play. Hochschuler
has his golfers warm up before they start whacking balls, asks them
to bend at the knees when picking balls up and often has them
modify their swing, not much of a sacrifice given the state of most
golfers' games.
</P>
<P>
   Though cycling is generally great for backs (taking the weight
off the spine while strengthening the legs), Minkow has cyclists
with back problems raise their handlebars (``You don't want the
handlebars any lower than the seat'').
</P>
<P>
   Swimming also is good for the back. Again, the spine is freed of
the effects of gravity, and the back and critical support muscles
are strengthened. But swimmers with back problems, says
Hochschuler, should consider avoiding the butterfly stroke (it
requires hyperextension of both the back and the neck). Freestyle
can be a problem, too, constantly turning the head to breathe can
strain the neck and spine (a solution: Wear a mask and snorkel --
or try water aerobics).
</P>
<P>
   Even running, despite its inherent pounding, can work.
Hochschuler just asks his runners to buy shoes with good support
and cushioning and to avoid doing sudden stressful changes such as
upping the distance and speed of workouts simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is detail. Mostly, your aim is simple. ``The
important thing is to do something regularly,'' says Minkow. ``And
if it's a sport you like, odds are better that you will.''
</P>
<P>
   But sports don't strengthen and stretch like weight training and
stretching do, so both disciplines are critical to a healthy back.
Whole books have been written on both topics. Your best bet: Find a
good one and try the stretches and lifts they recommend -- allowing
Hochschuler's ``no pain'' dictum to be your guiding light.
</P>
<P>
   Weight training merits an additional word. Left untended, our
muscles weaken and our bones lose density, bad news for a piece of
anatomy built on these two blocks. Weight training targets both
slides in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   But done improperly it also can level the best of backs
lickety-split. Consider this: Perform a bent-over barbell row
(bending at the waist and pulling the barbell up to your chest)
with 60 pounds. The leverage places roughly 600 pounds of pressure
square on your low back.
</P>
<P>
   Minkow recommends avoiding overhead free-weight lifts such as
the clean and jerk, as they heavily compress an unsupported spine
(overhead lifts are okay on a well-designed machine with a bench
that supports your spine). In the interest of long-term back
health. He also advises skipping heavy weights altogether. If you
can't lift a weight 10 times, says Minkow, it's too heavy for your
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, when it comes to preventing back pain the
most important muscle may be your mind. ``No doubt, back pain can
put the fear of God in you,'' says Hochschuler. ``But most back
pain is not dangerous. And, if you stay disciplined, you can work
your way out of it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   My children were delighted; I was appalled! There, standing
knee-deep in snow in my front yard was a herd of deer.
</P>
<P>
   They were munching away at the tips of my maple tree and nosing
around my junipers. In summer, I see them in early morning milling
around the Austin roses and lettuces. They once nibbled the tops
off every pea vine and tramped through the bean beds.
</P>
<P>
   Deer populations continue to grow, unhindered by any predator
except mankind and a few coyotes, causing untold damage to
landscapes in suburban and rural settings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any community blessed with some woodlands and open fields
is likely to have a hungry population of deer. The same can be said
for arboreta and park systems, which often have to battle deer to
save valuable plant life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a massive overpopulation of deer,'' said John O'Lear,
landscape architect with the Forest Preserve District of Cook
County, Ill. ``Spring ephemerals such as trillium, bloodroot, and
especially wild hyacinths, are being decimated in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Public gardens, horticultural and botanical research
institutions, natural areas preservationists and concerned
individuals have been focusing on developing systems for keeping
deer away from prized specimens, methods that could work at your
yard.
</P>
<P>
   If you are dealing with deer damage, educate yourself about
their habits, recommends a Cornell University spokesman. A variety
of deer control methods are discussed in the helpful brochure,
``Reducing Deer Damage to Home Gardens and Landscape Plantings''.
It is available by writing to the Department of Natural Resources,
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.
</P>
<P>
   Deer are selective feeders. They move along traditional routes
-- through tiny deer trails that slip through woodland openings and
over gaps in fences -- eating as they go.
</P>
<P>
   While they tend to follow familiar routes, they are capable of
learning to stay away from your yard if the way is fenced or made
impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the yard or garden with an 8-foot wooden fence deer
can't jump is one surefire deterrent. But not everyone wants to go
to this expense.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative that has worked well for deer-plagued Holden
Arboretum in Kirtland, Ohio is a nearly invisible mesh barrier
carried by Benner's Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was developed by Dr. David Benner, retired professor
of ornamental horticulture, who searched long and hard for ways to
keep deer from destroying his rare plant collection. After many
unsuccessful efforts, he devised a fine polypropylene mesh fence
almost 8 feet high that he used to enclose his entire yard.
Although nearly invisible from a distance, it should be hung with
12-inch long white streamers for two months to warn deer not to try
to trespass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use the 8-foot high fence around vegetable gardens or
to edge woodlands,'' said Benner, of Benner's Gardens. ``Shorter
fencing about 5 feet high can be adequate for surrounding smaller
beds like foundation plantings.''
</P>
<P>
   Benner's Gardens, in New Hope, Pa.(1-800-753-4660), also has
deer-barriers for driveways -- deerproof gates or in-ground grids
you can drive over but deer won't walk across.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy recommended by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources is to surround gardens with a polytape electric
fence. This is a single strand of bright plastic ribbon interwoven
with wire that transmits a shock when touched. Set the polywire
about 2 1/2 feet above the ground, a height deer could easily jump.
But they don't. They investigate it first -- nosing it and getting
a shock that teaches them to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   If fencing is not an option for you, you can try to avoid damage
by planting species deer find less palatable. Deer prefer to nibble
on well fertilized and new plantings with tender young growth, but
when the pickings are lean, they can eat almost anything. Fruit
trees, flower buds and evergreens tend to be among their favorites.
Look at the woods and fields near you for species that are thriving
without major deer damage. You can also ask your local cooperative
extension agent for his recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Repellents can discourage browsing, although they need
re-application at least every three weeks or after a heavy rain. If
the repellents wear off, even for just one night, deer may return
and cause untold damage.
</P>
<P>
   At Holden Arboretum, the most effective products have been
Bobex, Hinder (which can be used on edible crops), and Deeraway
(with an unappealing favor and smell). You also can purchase coyote
and other predator urines, using natural territory markers to
frighten deer away.
</P>
<P>
   Deer pose another problem, in addition to their feeding. During
mating season, from September to December, bucks mark their
territories by rubbing off tree bark. Because this can be enough to
kill small trees, wrap their trunks in 4-foot tall cylinders such
as plastic fencing or trunk guards to protect vulnerable bark. &QL;

 By LIZA N. BURBY  
 c.1998 Child  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time my husband and I moved, our youngest child,
Laura, was only 4 months old. As long as we soothed her cries with
gentle words, she couldn't have cared less where we lived.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with her big sister, 1-year-old Danielle. She hated the
whole process, had tantrums anytime we looked at a prospective home
and complained that she saw no reason why we had to move, even
though we explained it to her. But when we found a house on three
wooded acres, the excitement of exploring the expansive landscape
captured her sense of adventure, and her resistance slowly melted
away.
</P>
<P>
   For the first month, Danielle seemed unfazed by her new
surroundings. Then, as we were about to congratulate ourselves on
how well she'd adapted, her mood changed: She began sobbing, for no
apparent reason, at the most unpredictable moments. When pressed,
she burst out, ``I hate this house! I want to go home.'' Stunned,
we tried pinpointing what upset her. Talking about it seemed to
help alleviate her concerns. And gradually she returned to her old
self.
</P>
<P>
   About two years later, we moved again. This time it was
3-year-old Laura who had trouble adjusting. It was the strain of
change they were responding to, however belated their reactions
seemed to be, and we hadn't prepared them well enough for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's across town or across the country, moving ranks
right up there behind divorce and parental death in terms of stress
on kids,'' says Thomas Olkowski, a clinical psychologist in Denver
and co-author of ``Moving With Children.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot of them on the move. According to the U.S.
Census Bureau, of the 41 million Americans who move every year, 10
million are children under age 14. For kids, who often don't
understand why they have to move and who have little control over
the situation, moving can be a traumatic experience. There are ways
to make it easier, however.
</P>
<P>
   While you may not be able to anticipate every twist and turn,
here are steps to help pave the way:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``We're Moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Spare your child unnecessary anxiety: Don't break the news about
a move until you have concrete details about the date and location.
How you tell your child depends on her age. Too much notice invites
the incessant question ``Is today the day we're moving?'' Ann
Deaton, the director of psychology at Children's Hospital in
Richmond, Va., and co-author of ``Moving Survival Kit,'' recommends
giving preschoolers no more than two or three weeks' warning.
``Kids under 5 have a limited sense of time, so waiting for
something to happen can be hard,'' she explains. Help them by
circling the move date on the calendar and marking off the days as
they go by.
</P>
<P>
   Give school-age children, who have a better sense of time, at
least one month's notice before a move. Three months is appropriate
for an 8- to 12-year-old who may want time to break the news to her
friends. However, Deaton warns, more than that is a long time for a
youngster to deal with the anticipation of change.
</P>
<P>
   Older children may worry about losing contact with their
friends, says Olkowski. Help gather the addresses and phone numbers
of your child's friends, and encourage correspondence by
distributing pre-addressed postcards to the other children.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to your child's questions can help ease anxiety. ``At
any age, your children want to be reassured that they will be safe,
and they want to know what to expect,'' says Deaton. Preschoolers
will ask concrete questions that need specific answers, as Jean
Currie of Huntington, N.Y., learned. Her daughter, Jessica, was 3
when the family moved from New York City to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told her all about the new house -- she even took a trip
with us to see it,'' Currie relates. ``But we never defined who was
moving. One day, she asked, ``Mommy, will I be going, too?' We
hadn't realized -- she was worried! Quickly, we explained that all
of us were moving together.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the move, we thought it was wonderful the way that
Jessica was adjusting to our new home,'' Currie continues. ``But
two weeks later, she asked, `When are we going back?' Then we
realized why she had responded so well: She thought it was just a
trip! You can't underestimate the need to define everything
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   2. House Hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Asking a friend to watch your children as you house-hunt
eliminates the stress of having your attention divided, Deaton
notes. It will be easier on toddlers and preschoolers as well, who
often have difficulty understanding how much things cost or what
might be wrong with the roof. According to Deaton: ``Kids may
decide on the spot which bedroom will be theirs in a house you know
won't work, and your negative response can confuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   Children over the age of 8 may actually benefit from
accompanying you, however. ``Voicing their input helps them feel
like an important part of the move,'' remarks Jill Schneiderman, an
early childhood specialist at Work/Family Directions in Boston, a
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've chosen a new home, show the kids pictures not only
of the house but also of the neighborhood, schools and playgrounds.
If possible, take your kids on a walking tour -- the more familiar
they are with the area, the easier the adjustment will be.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pack It Up, Ship It Out.
</P>
<P>
   Enlist your children's help in packing, no matter how young they
are. Toddlers as young as 2 years old can help gather their toys.
Put your preschooler in charge of packing her favorite books. Older
kids will probably want to sort through and pack a lot of their own
belongings. Provide your child with a ``premove kit,'' suggests
Olkowski. The kit -- which might contain packing supplies like
markers and stickers to decorate boxes, sandwich bags for loose
items and rubber bands to secure such things as baseball cards --
lets your child participate in a fun and useful way.
</P>
<P>
   After all the anticipation, moving day itself can be almost a
relief. If you have movers, let one parent direct the furniture
arranging while the other concentrates on the kids' needs. Doing
the move yourself? Either use off-site child care or have someone
present at the move just to watch your children.
</P>
<P>
   Set up the kids' bedrooms first, advises Robert Butterworth, a
Los Angeles-based clinical psychologist. For children ages 2 to 8,
arrange their furniture as it was in the old house. ``You're
already changing their house and environment,'' comments
Butterworth. ``They need a little familiarity, especially for
sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk through your old house one last time with your child. Sally
Malech, mom of 2-year-old Asher in West Hartford, Conn., found that
when her family moved down the street, her son kept asking to go
``home.'' ``I finally walked through the empty house with him and
pointed out that his toys and bed were no longer there,'' Malech
says. ``He was reluctant to go in, but it really provided
tremendous closure for him. Now, every time we walk by he says,
`That's not our house. That's our old house.'''
</P>
<P>
   4. Life After the Move.
</P>
<P>
   In those first few days after a move, concentrate on listening
to your child's concerns, says Butterworth. Keeping an upbeat
attitude can defuse some of his fears. A picnic dinner on the
living room floor, complete with tablecloth, candles and take-out
food, will give him a sense of celebration and give you a
much-needed break.
</P>
<P>
   Walk around the new neighborhood together and point out
landmarks. Back at home, draw a map showing the location of the
playground, grocery store, library and school. Make sure your child
knows or carries his new phone number and address with him.
</P>
<P>
   Your child may regress in some way after the move. For example,
it's common, says Schneiderman, for a potty-trained child to start
having accidents. Your toddler may suddenly have difficulty
sleeping through the night. Older kids may develop behavioral
problems in school. You may be tempted to smooth over a rough
transition by offering your child rewards for good behavior, but
sticking to the routines that he's used to actually makes it easier
to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular discussion time with you so that your child can talk
about how he feels may help ease his anxiety,'' says Butterworth.
If this behavior continues for more than a month, however, you
should contact your pediatrician or family doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of kids will adjust within six to 18 months. ``Most
moves turn out OK, given enough time,'' notes Olkowski. ``Even a
move under the worst conditions can turn out to be a learning and
growing experience for the whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, my daughters, now 8 and 4, will move once again --
to a house eight blocks away from where we now live. They've begun
packing already, and while they consider themselves little pros at
this, I'm not taking any chances -- I've been preparing them for
weeks. Still, the other day I realized I may have fortified them a
little too well. As I was explaining that we would be saying
good-bye to our old house but would live close enough to visit it,
Danielle turned to me and said, ``Mom, don't worry so much --
you're going to be fine.''

SIGNING THE DECLARATION, THEN FADING INTO HISTORY

   Who was the associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court who fled
to North Carolina to avoid arrest for unpaid debts that arose from
his land speculation? None other than one of the 56 signers of our
Declaration of Independence _ James Wilson of Pennsylvania
(1742-1798). Wilson was a member of the very first U.S. Supreme
Court when he skipped out on his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wrote an influential pamphlet published in 1774 in which
he denied that the British Parliament had the legal authority to
make laws for the American colonies. Wilson also helped draft the
Pennsylvania Constitution and fought to get it adopted. When he
died, he was still a justice of the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the lesser-known delegates from the colonies who
signed that great document, the Declaration of Independence, offer
an interesting peek into that period of our history.
</P>
<P>
   Historian David Freeman Hawke, in his book, ``A Transaction of
Free Men: The Birth and Course of the Declaration of
Independence,'' relates an anecdote that shows the concern the
delegates had _ signing the great document might have been a death
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Harrison (1726-1791) of Virginia was a stout man and
when he took up the pen to sign the vellum copy of the Declaration,
he said to the slender Elbridge Gerry (1744-1814) of Massachusetts:
``I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are
all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my
body I shall die in a few minutes, but from the lightness of your
body, you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morris (1734-1806), also of Pennsylvania, was a very
successful shipping merchant. Elected to be a delegate of the
Continental Congress, Morris voted against the Declaration of
Independence in July 1776 _ on the grounds that it was premature.
He changed his mind and signed it in August.
</P>
<P>
   Morris raised and borrowed money to finance George Washington's
Revolutionary forces. His efforts were so successful that he was
called the ``financier of the Revolution.'' In 1781, Congress
appointed Morris as superintendent of finance, which gave him
dictatorial powers over the nation's economy. He resigned that
position two years later.
</P>
<P>
   As politically powerful as Morris was, his personal land
speculation brought him financial ruin. Land values in the areas
west of the colonies plummeted. He couldn't pay his creditors.
Morris was arrested and confined in the Philadelphia debtors'
prison, ``Prune Street,'' for three years until he was released
under the federal bankruptcy law in 1801. He lived out his last
years supported by his wife's small annuity.
</P>
<P>
   George Read (1733-1798) of Delaware at first also refused to
vote for and sign the Declaration but did so after it was adopted.
But Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution, due to
Read's tireless efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McKean's (1734-1817) vote for the Declaration cancelled
Read's nay vote, but it left Delaware without a majority vote.
McKean sent a messenger for Caesar Rodney (1728-1784), Delaware's
third delegate, and he arrived in time to put the state on record
as supporting the document.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney, by the way, disputed that the Declaration of
Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. He insisted that no one
signed it on that date.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Hopkinson (1737-1791) of New Jersey was a composer who
wrote the first known piece of American secular music, a song
called ``My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free.'' He also wrote what
many musicologists consider to be the first American opera, ``The
Temple of Minerva.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of those who signed the Declaration were born outside the
colonies: in England (Button Gwinnett and Robert Morris); in Wales
(Francis Lewis); in Ireland (James Smith, George Taylor and Matthew
Thorton); and in Scotland (James Wilson and John Witherspoon).
</P>
<P>
   William Whipple (1730-1785) of New Hampshire was a sea captain
at 21 years of age, running rum to Africa and returning to
Portsmouth with slaves. He quit the sea at the age of 29. Whipple
was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1776 and
served the Congress for three years. Being a man of action, he took
lengthy sabbaticals from Congress in order to lead the New
Hampshire militia against the British as a brigadier general. He
led his troops to major victories in the battles of Stillwater and
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett (1732-1777) of Georgia barely had time to sign the
Declaration before he was killed in a duel with American general
Lachlan McIntosh over who would command the revolutionary troops
from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Wolcott (1726-1797) of Connecticut, when returning from a
trip to New York, stole and transported a lead statue of King
George III in a wagon. George III was melted down for musket balls.
And as a brigadier general, Wolcott lead 14 regiments of militia
from his state to New York to help reinforce the Revolutionary Army
on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Rush (1745-1813) of Pennsylvania was a doctor and the
first professor of chemistry in the colonies. In 1786 in
Philadelphia, he established the first free medical clinic and
founded the first American anti-slavery society.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Edward Smith points out in his biography, ``John Marshall:
Definer of a Nation,'' the impact George Wythe (1726-1806) of
Virginia had on Marshall's legal thinking. Marshall, arguably the
greatest jurist in American history, learned the depth and breadth
of the law and its social consequences in classes that Chancellor
Wythe taught at the College of William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Wythe considered the college ``a training ground for republican
citizenship.'' Indeed it was. He not only taught the future Chief
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, he taught future presidents _
Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe _ as well as the statesman Henry
Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Wythe died under mysterious circumstances in his 80th year. The
National Archives and Records Administration suggests that he was
poisoned by his grandnephew and heir, George Wythe Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining true to his long-held aversion to slavery, Wythe's
will freed his slaves upon his death.

GARTH STEIN TAKES AN UNEXPECTED PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not too long ago, Garth Stein won an Academy Award for his short
film ``The Lunch Date.'' Making it in the movie business requires a
combination of luck and talent. I believe the only harder industry
to crack is the book biz.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stein has made it to the printed page, too. His first novel,
``Raven Stole the Moon,'' (Pocket Books, $22) may not win any
prestigious awards, but it serves notice that Stein is a rare
talent whether on the screen or in books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies and books both require creativity, but I'm learning
fast how different they are, too,'' Stein said recently when
reached by phone at his home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do a film, there's opening night in the movie theater
or broadcast night on TV, and then you get feedback instantly. The
viewers loved it, the critics have this to say about it, you work
hard on the project for a long time, and then there's the immediate
response. With books, it's more trickle-down. I'm constantly
looking in the paper and doing searches online to see if there are
any reviews of `Raven Stole the Moon,' any hints that someone has
read it and is responding to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Stein always planned to become an author. Life has a
habit of introducing unexpected career turns, and Stein eventually
found himself eking out a living producing documentaries.
Eventually, ``The Lunch Date'' earned him the highest film-industry
award. Being a contrary (if pleasant) sort, this encouraged Stein
to finally write a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed teachers who stressed, `Write about what
you know,''' Stein said. ``Well, I'm only one-eighth Tlinget
Indian, but I knew the legends and beliefs. There aren't many
Tlinget authors on the market, so I thought the subject matter
might be a little unique.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is that. Deftly, Stein tells the tale of Jenna
Rosen, a mother returning to Wrangell, Alaska, where two years
earlier her young son disappeared. Herself a descendent of the
Tlingets, Jenna's attempt to find out what really happened to her
child is colored by ancestral spiritual tenets she had never fully
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those passages where it's obvious fledgling writer Stein
is straining a bit too much to impress, ``Raven Stole the Moon'' is
entertaining reading. Stein's already good, and as he writes more,
he'll only get better.

IDEA IS TO STOP CHILDREN FROM LIGHTING UP 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With a little luck, the political sideshow over
lawyers' fees, which muscled its way onto center stage in Texas'
tobacco drama, will be resolved before Attorney General Dan Morales
and Gov. George W. Bush become merely names in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes rose with recent reports that the antagonists may be at
least nearing a truce, if a small army of (what else?) lawyers
involved in negotiations can ever agree on all the devilish
details.
</P>
<P>
   The fee fight, unfortunately, has obscured the bottom line of
the lawsuit settlement with cigarette makers, and I don't mean the
25-year, $15.3 billion agreed payout to the state. You can't hide
$15.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The real bottom line is health care.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said he sued the tobacco companies two years ago for two
main reasons _ to recover public health-care costs associated with
smoking and to attack the industry for marketing its
health-damaging products to children.
</P>
<P>
   And he has urged the Legislature to spend the tobacco payments,
especially the $1.2 billion anticipated the first year, on
anti-smoking and other health-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the settlement becomes final by the time lawmakers
convene in January, the Legislature's chief budget writers have
agreed to sponsor Morales' priorities for the first year's
settlement proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for the tobacco jackpot, nevertheless, will be
keen. Politicians already are scrambling to propose alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Keeton Rylander, the Republican nominee for state
comptroller, advocates using part of the tobacco money for a
teacher pay raise. And John Sharp, the Democratic candidate for
lieutenant governor, wants to spend some of the funds to build new
classrooms for the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be more opportunistic, although worthy, spending
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Health-care advocates may have their hands full trying to snag a
lion's share of the tobacco money, particularly since Morales, who
is stepping down in January, won't be lobbying as an incumbent
officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, in the long run, than the tobacco money the
Legislature may use to treat cancer and other smoking-related
illnesses will be any funds set aside to discourage young Texans
from beginning to smoke in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Educating youths about the dangers of tobacco is a difficult
task, and money alone can't guarantee any appreciable success. But
youth is where the focus must be because most smokers start smoking
as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   And smoking has been increasing among Texas teens. In 1996, the
most recent data available, 55 percent of all secondary students in
the state reported having used a tobacco product during their
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Morales negotiated Texas' agreement with cigarette
makers, the Legislature already had taken steps to crack down on
teen smoking. One key feature of a new law, which went into effect
in January, provides that people younger than 18 caught smoking or
possessing tobacco products can have their driver's licenses
suspended for as long as six months.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials hope that penalty, which may be the first of
its kind in the nation, will be a strong deterrent to teen smoking,
at least stronger than lectures and television ads have proved to
be in some other states.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the driver's license sanction will largely
depend on how often it is used and how strongly the law against
teen smoking is enforced. And it is too early to know either of
those factors.
</P>
<P>
   The same law also provides for tobacco education courses for
young smokers and an ad campaign. Ad campaigns, even when adquately
funded, aren't a sure way to change people's behavior, particularly
the behavior of teen-agers, most of whom seem to think they will
live forever and resist sermons.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas ad campaign isn't anywhere near being adequately
funded. The Texas Department of Health has only $300,000 this year
for the entire anti-tobacco public awareness program.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few spots on radio and television, warning
teens of the driver's license suspension penalty. And the health
department plans to convey the same message on six donated
billboards _ that's right, only six _ in the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   That compares to hundreds of tobacco industry billboards that
have promoted smoking throughout teen-agers' lives. Those
billboards are finally coming down under the lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has asked the Legislature to set aside $200 million of
the first-year tobacco proceeds for an anti-smoking and tobacco
awareness campaign aimed primarily at young people. Such a large
figure boggles the minds of underfunded health officials. Let us
hope, if they actually get it, that the sum doesn't boggle their
imaginations, because more creativity may be needed to curb teen
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   What good would the much-ballyhooed anti-tobacco effort of today
_ including Texas' impressive tobacco settlement _ have really
accomplished if significantly fewer people aren't smoking 10 or 20
years from now?

ANTONIO BANDERAS TAKES A STAB AT `ZORRO'

 Includes a color slide of Antonio Banderas in a scene from ``The
Mask of Zorro.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ask any of his fans _ Antonio Banderas was born to play Zorro.
 &HT;    ``I probably should just follow the remarks of the people who
believe that,'' Banderas says with a laugh. ``Maybe in three or
four years, when I'm really removed from the film, I can be a
better judge.
 &HT;    ``I suppose it may work, me as Zorro,'' he allows. ``People
don't give you gifts for no reason. If someone thought I was right
to play Zorro, then I respect that and say, `Thank you,' because
here I am.''
 &HT;    Directed by Martin Campbell, ``The Mask of Zorro'' opens
nationwide on July 17. It's a fresh spin on the oft-told tale,
picking up decades after the old-Mexican saga normally ends. In
this version, an aging Zorro (Anthony Hopkins), escaping after 20
years' imprisonment, takes a young thief (Banderas) under his wing
and grooms him to assume the mask and the legend.
 &HT;    Complicating matters are Catherine Zeta Jones as Hopkins'
daughter and Banderas' love interest, and two hissable villains,
the corrupt Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) and his henchman,
Capt. Harrison Love (Matt Letscher).
 &HT;    ``These five people, really, are the engine of the movie,''
Banderas says, relaxing at Los Angeles' posh Four Seasons Hotel.
``Even with all the adventure you see, you're always with these
interesting characters, and it's always about how the adventure
affects them.''
 &HT;    Banderas steps into some intimidating boots in donning Zorro's
mask. Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Tyrone Power, Alain Delon and even
George Hamilton swashbuckled through earlier big-screen
incarnations, while Guy Williams achieved stardom in the 1960s
television series, ``Zorro,'' which aired on Spain's lone station
during Banderas' youth.
 &HT;    ``All of them brought something new to the Zorro legend,'' the
38-year-old actor says. ``Our movie has bits and pieces of the
styles of all the films those gentlemen made.
 &HT;    ```Mask of Zorro' is a comedy, a drama, a romance and an epic at
the end,'' he says. ``I think the balance and that combination of
styles make our movie special.''
 &HT;    Though ``Zorro'' features A-list talent on screen and bears the
golden touch of a producer named Spielberg, Banderas isn't sure if
audiences accustomed to special-effects-laden spectacles will turn
out for an old-fashioned adventure in which the ultimate weapon is
a fine Toledo blade.
 &HT;    ``That's a mystery,'' Banderas says. ``Children, especially, may
not know what to make of it. I can speak for myself here, because
my stepson is 12 now, and he's pretty much into lasers, computers
and movies with spaceships.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how kids who like what he does, and there are
lots of them, will relate to a guy with a sword, to a film where
characters get around on horses, where there are no special
effects,'' he admits.
 &HT;    ``Will people go? I don't know. I hope so,'' he says. ``We'll
all find out on July 17. We'll see if Zorro is a character who can
help close out the end of a century of movies.''
 &HT;    If Zorro is a fusion of Spanish culture and American show
business, Banderas may be the right man for the job. Born in
Malaga, the actor first performed in Spanish theater productions
and later in three dozen Spanish feature films, including three of
director Pedro Almodovar's best, ``Labyrinth of Passion'' (1982),
``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' (1988) and ``Tie Me
Up! Tie Me Down!'' (1990).
 &HT;    Banderas' ambitions always reached beyond Spain, however. In
1992 he came to America to co-star in ``The Mambo Kings'' as a
Cuban musician, a role for which he learned to speak English
phonetically.
 &HT;    Since then, Banderas has popped up in his share of hits and
flops, including ``Philadelphia'' (1993), ``Interview with the
Vampire'' (1994), ``Assassins'' (1995), ``Evita'' (1996) and ``Two
Much'' (1996), the last of which is best remembered _ if it is
remembered at all _ as the film during which Banderas met and fell
in love with Melanie Griffith. They married the next year.
 &HT;    ``I feel lucky and, against what some people might think, I feel
that I opened my range of possibilities when I came to America,''
Banderas says. ``I'd done 34 movies in Spain, and was getting
trapped into playing the same characters again and again.
 &HT;    ``When I got here, I got a new start,'' he says. ``I went from
action movie to horror movie, from musicals to psychological
thrillers and comedies. I've done every style of movie, which is
more than some really big superstars get to do.
 &HT;    ``I know I've gotten to do more here than I ever would've been
able to do in Europe,'' he concludes, ``and I feel very good about
that.''
 &HT;    Next up for Banderas are two more distinctly different projects.
In ``The 13th Warrior,'' a late-fall release, Banderas stars as an
Arab who reluctantly joins Vikings heading to northern Europe to
fight an unknown enemy.
 &HT;    Stretching in another direction, he will make his directing
debut with ``Crazy in Alabama,'' a black comedy in which he appears
with his wife.
 &HT;    ``Directing comes naturally to me,'' Banderas says offhandedly.
``After acting in so many films, I suddenly felt the need to go
behind the camera so I could tell people how I see the world, how I
see events, how I'd put together a movie as a director, a
storyteller.
 &HT;    ``It has been a good experience for me, very revealing from so
many aspects.''
 &HT;    Not every novice director would want his wife in the cast of his
first venture, but Banderas says that the experience only made him
appreciate her more.
 &HT;    ``I did, I did,'' he says, laughing. ``I loved having Melanie on
the set, and I felt more than love. I felt admiration.
 &HT;    ``Melanie is a gorgeous actress,'' he adds, ``and she gave me a
lot in the movie. She's beautiful to watch working, and I hope that
will come across on the screen.''
 &HT;    When Banderas and Griffith first hooked up, it was the stuff of
tabloid dreams. ``LATIN LOVER DUMPS WIFE FOR DON JOHNSON'S TWO-TIME
EX,'' the tabloids raved.
 &HT;    At the time, Banderas kept up a stoic front, smiling for the
cameras and ignoring the insinuations. Now, happily married and the
father of a child with Griffith, the Spaniard is willing to admit
that the feeding frenzy caused great pain for himself and for
Griffith.
 &HT;    ``It hurt us personally and professionally,'' says Banderas, who
splits his time between homes in Los Angeles and Spain.
``Fortunately, we are a bit away from all that.
 &HT;    ``Once in a while somebody has to say something about us,'' he
adds with a touch of bitterness, ``so they'll invent some news and
just throw it in there. But it's not traumatic _ I don't care
anymore.
 &HT;    ``We had to pay a price to be together and we did it,'' he says
flatly. ``Now, because we don't do anything strange or scandalous,
because we have a close family, they're getting bored with us.''
 &HT;    After whetting his musical chops in ``Evita,'' the adaptation of
the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, Banderas has been
lobbying for the lead in the long-delayed film version of Webber's
Broadway hit, ``Phantom of the Opera.'' Also in the works is a film
biography of the Cuban baseball star Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez, now with the New York Yankees, which would co-star Cuba
Gooding Jr.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Banderas aims to slow his professional pace.
 &HT;    ``I want to balance my life, my family and my work,'' he says.
``Also, in 1995 I had six movies out almost at the same time, and I
thought I was completely overexposed.
 &HT;    ``I was following the same pattern I did in Spain,'' he says,
``and that doesn't work here. I reflected on that, and now I'm
working less and, I think, doing better work.''

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Matt Dillon with Cameron Diaz and Lin
Shaye in a scene from ``There's Something About Mary.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There's something rather goofy and endearing about Matt Dillon.
 &HT;    You have to get past the caginess inevitably engendered by a
decade in Hollywood. Heaven knows, you have to get past the dark,
brooding good looks and the haunted, deep-set eyes.
 &HT;    But behind them lurks ... a Chevy Chase fan?
 &HT;    ``Anything with Chevy Chase, I'm there,'' Dillon says, relaxing
in Beverly Hills' swank Four Seasons Hotel. ``I love all those
`Vacation' movies. Years from now, people will look back on the
movies of Chevy and finally show some respect. These are comedy
classics.''
 &HT;    Dillon is thinking a lot about comedy these days, because his
latest film, ``There's Something About Mary,'' opening July 15, is
a freewheeling farce from the Farrelly brothers, writers/directors
of ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' (1994) and ``Kingpin'' (1996).
 &HT;    It was the offbeat script that sold him on the project, he says.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know where it was going,'' the actor says. ``Finally,
it was a script with a few surprises. I also think it's one of
those movies that's a little gross. People are just going to have a
good time and laugh.''
 &HT;    ``A little gross'' may be understating it. In one scene _
disgusting or hilarious, depending on your sense of humor _ Cameron
Diaz, Dillon's co-star and real-life girlfriend, unwittingly ends
up using some bodily fluids as hair gel.
 &HT;    ``I do have one of those sick senses of humor,'' Dillon says,
``so this stuff just ... ''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``You just have to go with it,'' he says. ``This was one of the
funniest scripts I've ever read.''
 &HT;    Dillon is best known for dramatic roles, but he says he loves
comedy _ and, indeed, he turned in an underappreciated performance
as a vain Hollywood idol in last year's ``In &AMP; Out.''
 &HT;    ``I think comedy is the hardest thing to write,'' he says. ``I
don't get offered a lot of comedies, which is a shame, because I
think I'm fairly good at it.''
 &HT;    Dillon also welcomed the chance to make a film with Diaz.
 &HT;    ``There's no denying that we have screen chemistry,'' he says.
``You can't fake what we have up there. You can't reproduce it with
other people _ it's real. You know, we like each other a little
bit.''
 &HT;    Ever since Dillon and Diaz met two years ago, he says, they've
been looking for a project they could do together.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure everybody expected that we would do a big, sweeping
romance or some serious drama,'' he says. ``We love the idea that
we went in the opposite direction and did this off-the-wall
thing.''
 &HT;   Dillon knows off-the-wall. Earlier this year, he shocked
audiences with ``Wild Things,'' a twisty, erotic thriller in which
he played an unethical high-school guidance counselor enmeshed in a
complex fraud scheme _ and steamy group sex _ with two of his
students, played by Neve Campbell and Denise Richards.
 &HT;    ``People are still talking about the sex scene with me, Neve and
Denise,'' Dillon says, shaking his head.
 &HT;    Campbell and Richards reportedly made it through their
eight-hour threesome scene with the aid of a shot of tequila
apiece.
 &HT;    ``Hey, I didn't drink,'' Dillon says, rolling his eyes.
``Generally, I don't think it's a good idea to drink on the job.
 &HT;    ``It really was a tough gig,'' he adds with a laugh. ``All those
hours of pure sleaze.''
 &HT;    Dillon scorns critics who questioned ``Wild Things'' for its
highly charged sex scenes.
 &HT;    ``You know what? I'm glad I did a movie with just pure, raw sex
scenes'' he says defiantly. ``In a lot of movies these days,
people's sex drives are played down. It used to be there was more
sexuality in films. I think films are much too tame now.
 &HT;    ``I guess we're just reacting to the times,'' he adds, ``but I
still wish we could loosen up a bit.''
 &HT;    Dillon grew up in New York's affluent Westchester County, where
he lived a typical teen-age life, playing football and listening to
music. He was discovered in a junior-high-school hallway by a
visiting talent scout.
 &HT;    ``I was cutting a class,'' he recalls, ``and these two guys
approached me in the school hallway and asked, `Do you want to
audition for a movie?' I thought it was some scam.''
 &HT;    It wasn't. Dillon made his movie debut in Jonathan Kaplan's
``Over the Edge'' (1979), and soon was Hollywood's teen-idol flavor
of the month. One magazine proclaimed him ``a breathing tribute to
the American gene pool.''
 &HT;    Dillon became a latter-day James Dean, brooding his way through
teen films such as ``My Bodyguard'' (1980), ``The Outsiders''
(1983) and ``Rumble Fish'' (1983).
 &HT;    ``People always ask if I missed my teen years,'' he says. ``I
don't think I missed anything. Do I wish I went to high school and
then some college, as opposed to going off and making films? The
answer is no. I think my life is much richer and more interesting.
If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing.''
 &HT;    The same applies to his post-teen career, which has mixed
occasional hits such as ``Drugstore Cowboy'' (1989) with copious
flops, from ``Rebel'' (1985) to ``Mr. Wonderful'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``What has kept me sane is that I look at this business with a
sense of humor,'' he says. ``Hollywood is really a pretty funny
place.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it's hard to keep your perspective,'' he adds,
``because you can get caught up in all the hype and the fame.
Bottom line: This is a tough racket, but I just try to have fun
with it.''
 &HT;    Currently, his idea of fun is a script he's working on, one
which he hopes to direct and star in.
 &HT;    ``I don't really want to go into the details, but I will say
it's a fairly ambitious project,'' he says evasively. ``I guess
when you write your first script and direct your first movie,
you're suppose to think small, but mine is an international type of
story with a lot of guys.''
 &HT;    Why not entrust it to a more experienced director, then, the way
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck gave ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997) to Gus
Van Sant, or perhaps find someone else to star, as Robert Redford
did with ``Ordinary People'' (1980)?
 &HT;    ``I just can't give it to anyone else,'' Dillon says. ``Plus I
don't want to drive some other guy crazy. My second problem is that
I wrote one of the parts with myself in mind. Now, what am I going
to do but do both?''
 &HT;    Diaz won't appear, though.
 &HT;    ``There really isn't a part for her,'' Dillon says regretfully.
 &HT;    Besides, he says, the two usually don't mix business and
pleasure. And, no, though they're both actors, they aren't
competitive with one another.
 &HT;    ``Sure, jealousy is part of human nature,'' he says, ``but it's
an immature emotion that you should just acknowledge and then let
go. It's when you hang onto it that you get in trouble.
 &HT;    ``I wondered if the business would add extra stress,'' Dillon
admits. ``But there is the whole other side: It's an advantage to
date someone who understands exactly what's going on in your life.
 &HT;    ``Listen, the most difficult thing about being in a relationship
with someone in the film business is that you both have crazy
schedules,'' he says. ``That's complicated. But there is also
someone right there who can sympathize and empathize when you tell

 &HT;    Even on those days, though, Dillon says he still loves his work:

 FRANCES McDORMAND TAKES A SHINE TO MADELINE

 Includes a color slide of Frances McDormand and numerous little
girls in a scene from ``Madeline.'' 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The last time most of us saw Frances McDormand, she was
reasoning with a man who was feeding a body into a wood chipper.
 &HT;    Those who passed through Dublin during May and June may have
caught her going stark, staring mad at the Gate Theatre.
 &HT;    Is this someone you'd trust with little girls?
 &HT;    Actually, the real Frances McDormand is nothing like the very
pregnant Sheriff Marge Gunderson, the role that won her a Best
Actress Oscar in ``Fargo'' (1996) and included the wood-chipper
scene. And she doesn't much resemble Blanche DuBois in Tennessee
Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' which she was playing in
Dublin.
 &HT;    Actually, she's a sharp, funny and very fast-talking woman whom
you'd have no problem entrusting with your little girl _ which is
good, because on July 10 she's opening in theaters everywhere as
the saintly, if occasionally exasperated, Miss Clavel in the film
adaptation of the children's classic, ``Madeline.''
 &HT;    Yes, that Miss Clavel, who lives ``in an old house in Paris all
covered with vines'' and oversees ``12 little girls in two straight
lines.''
 &HT;    ```Madeline' came at the perfect time,'' McDormand says
brightly, speaking on a car telephone somewhere in London. ``I had
committed to doing `Streetcar' in Dublin and the stage play
`Oedipus' in New York this fall. Since I was spending the majority
of my time working in the theater, I was hoping to do another film.
 &HT;    ```Madeline' was perfect because it was a character I really
wanted to play,'' she adds. ``I love Miss Clavel. I've been reading
the books to my son for two years, acting the part out every time I
read it, and the chance to do it on film was wonderful.''
 &HT;    Besides which, the filming required her to spend three months in
Paris _ hardly an imposition.
 &HT;    ``Oh, the food!'' she exclaims unabashedly.
 &HT;    McDormand's exuberant, chatty demeanor comes as a surprise.
She's so well known for intelligent, intense dramatic performances
_ from Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning'' (1988) and Ken Loach's
``Hidden Agenda'' (1990) to ``Paradise Road'' (1997) _ that one
expects the actress to be as serious and self-contained as the
parts she plays.
 &HT;    By rights, perhaps she should be. Born in Illinois, she was the
youngest of a minister's three children. Her father's duties
required the family to move every few years, except for a
seven-year stretch in Pennsylvania when Fran, as her friends call
her, was in high school.
 &HT;    ``We moved around, but I had a really solid family,'' she says.
``And the denomination my father was involved with emphasized
community outreach. Outside of having a congregation, my dad was
very involved with youth organizations and food banks.''
 &HT;    This doubtless explains McDormand's own sense of commitment to
helping those less fortunate. For the past 13 years she has been
involved with the 52nd Street Project in New York, a theater-based
recreational program for underprivileged kids.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I'm sure that's the values my parents gave me,'' she says,
``making sure I gave some back and didn't just take.''
 &HT;    The other big influence on McDormand was books. Even as a child
she was an avid reader. One of the things she enjoyed most about
doing ``Streetcar'' was the chance to spend three months in
Ireland, with its strong literary tradition.
 &HT;    ``The Irish have a cultural relationship with literature,'' she
says. ``Everybody reads books there, and everybody can recite
poetry. Writers are given cultural tax exemptions in Ireland. They
are seen as something that needs to be fostered!''
 &HT;    Every day during her stay, the actress would take a commuter
train from outside Dublin, where she, her husband and their son
were living, to the theater.
 &HT;    ``And everybody on the train was reading,'' she marvels. ``Sure,
some had magazines and newspapers, but the majority were reading
books.''
 &HT;    That love of the written word is something she finds sadly
lacking in the United States.
 &HT;    ``I can't tell you the number of kids in the projects who reach
the age of 14 and cannot read,'' she says sadly. ``To me, the idea
of not being able to read or not having a love of books is ... ''
 &HT;    Her voice trails off.
 &HT;    ``We're known for movies, not for literature,'' she continues.
``I think the electronic and media age is attached to the American
culture: television, film, video.''
 &HT;    McDormand discovered acting in high school, when she performed a
scene from ``Macbeth'' in English class. She studied drama at
Bethany College, a small school in West Virginia _ she was the only
theater major in her class _ before heading to the Yale School of
Drama for graduate study.
 &HT;    Then it was on to New York, where she roomed for awhile with
another struggling thespian, Holly Hunter.
 &HT;    Her first professional job took her to Trinidad, where she
performed in a production organized by the poet Derek Walcott. Her
second was an independent movie called ``Blood Simple'' (1984),
which put its director/producer team of Ethan and Joel Coen on the
map.
 &HT;    The part had actually been written with Hunter in mind, but when
the actress couldn't wriggle out of a prior theatrical commitment,
the brothers cast McDormand instead.
 &HT;    More than her performance clicked: Soon thereafter, McDormand
and Joel Coen were married. Their son, Pedro, is now 3 years old.
 &HT;    Pedro was one reason McDormand wanted to do ``Madeline.''
Another big thrill was appearing in a ``Sesame Street'' video with
Big Bird last year.
 &HT;    ``It was one of the best things that came out of getting the
Academy Award,'' she says with a laugh. ``I was a nervous wreck. I
kept forgetting my lines because I was working with Big Bird. He's
such an icon! It was all too much for me.''
 &HT;    Unlike many actors, who break into the movies and never look
back, McDormand relishes the stage and was pleased to be able to
return after a five-year absence, caused in part by the adoption of
Pedro and in part by the demands of her husband's film career.
 &HT;    She admits to some worries prior to ``Streetcar,'' however.
 &HT;    ``One was the stamina: being able to get through two and a half
hours, six evenings a week,'' she says. ``The other was my voice. I
haven't been the most conscientious of actors _ I don't do vocal
exercises and I do smoke. I had some trouble with my voice every
now and again, but never to the point that I wasn't able.''
 &HT;    Audience response to the Dublin production was varied but always
gratifying, McDormand says. Overall she considers it a great
success, and a great experience for her.
 &HT;    The same goes for ``Madeline,'' her token journey away from the
weird worlds she normally inhabits professionally.
 &HT;    But devotees of her intense characterizations should take heart.
She isn't considering Julie Andrews as a role model. In August, she
begins rehearsals for her next project: ``Oedipus,'' on the New
York stage.
 &HT;    Expect murders, incest, wars, eye-gouging and a lot of anguished
soliloquies.
 &HT;    And not a pigtail in sight.

KEVIN NEWMAN SAYS `GOOD MORNING'

 Includes a color slide of Kevin Newman on the set of ``Good Morning
America.'' 
 By JILL GERSTON  
 c.1998 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kevin Newman was called into the office of David Westin,
the president of ABC News, in March, he thought he was going to be
admonished for some gaffe he might have made as the news anchor of
``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was offered the plum assignment of co-host for the
network's morning show. He took over with Lisa McRee on May 4, when
``Good Morning America'' introduced a citified set and new theme
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the host is very different from being the news anchor,''
Newman says. ``You have to reveal yourself, because there is almost
no script _ it's all out of your head. It's all about how
comfortable you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the high-profile job has sent his anxiety level
``way up there.'' On camera the 38-year-old Newman appears totally
at ease. More important to viewers, who are finicky about whom they
share their morning coffee with, he seems like a regular guy,
someone you'd see standing in line at The Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very unassuming in a lot of ways,'' says Shelley Lewis,
the executive producer of ``Good Morning America.'' ``He doesn't
see himself as some big star.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-night news buffs became acquainted with Newman when he
served as the anchor of ABC's overnight news programs, ``World News
Now'' and ``World News This Morning,'' from 1994 to 1996. His next
stint was as a correspondent for ``World News Tonight'' and
co-anchor of ``Good Morning America Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Newman's star-making turn came in August 1997, when the
Princess of Wales died in a Paris car crash. For four nonstop
hours, Newman held the fort as anchor for ABC's coverage of that
breaking news story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a holiday weekend, so the A-string folks weren't as
close as I was to be called in,'' says Newman, who was at home in
New Jersey with his family when the call came. ``As we began
chasing the story, it was apparent it was much more serious than a
car accident. I assumed that someone else would be brought in to
take over, but they hung with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no random decision, Lewis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin never loses his place or his cool during a breaking news
story,'' she says. ``He has that key gift for live television of
being very organized in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Toronto, Newman graduated from the University of Western
Ontario and began his career ``carrying coffee cups'' in the
newsroom of a regional Canadian television station. He eventually
became the parliamentary correspondent for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation and the anchor of ``Midday,'' a show
similar to ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he left that star post for ABC and a low-profile
job as a news anchor in the wee hours of the morning. Some
observers, particularly in Canada, found his decision baffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television in Canada was becoming a shrinking thing,'' he
explains. ``There were more challenges here.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman has found a challenge with ``Good Morning America,''
whose declining ratings have put it far behind NBC's ``Today''
show.
</P>
<P>
   By giving ``Good Morning America'' a new pair of anchors, a new
set, new music and looser pacing, the network is trying to
reinvigorate a program that had become somewhat predictable with
longtime hosts Joan Lunden and Charles Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel we're like `Star Trek, the Next Generation,'''
Newman says, citing a show that is famous for having taken awhile
to find its footing after a complete cast change before becoming a
smash hit.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the network expected an instant turnaround in ratings,
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Don't worry, it's a marathon,''' he says, ``and I
take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting his newest post, Newman says, he discussed it
with his wife Cathy and their children, 12-year-old Alex and
8-year-old Erica.
</P>
<P>
   ``With most other promotions it has been, `Thanks, great, when
do I start?,' but this is a very public job that, as Charlie Gibson
told me, is all-consuming,'' he says. ``I wasn't sure I wanted that
for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   His family urged him to grab ABC's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They focused me on how I felt about the challenge,'' he says.
``Ultimately, I thought, `I don't want anybody else taking it. It's
too good a job.'''

ROME'S RELIGIOUS SITES MAKE FOR A SPELLBINDING PILGRIMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ I knelt last month inside the Mamertine prison, the
dungeon in the heart of Rome believed to be the spot where Peter
and Paul were imprisoned before they were executed almost two
millennia ago.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the dark, dank prison dating from the fourth century
B.C. is filled with pilgrims snapping photos.
</P>
<P>
   But I was lucky. I was alone.
</P>
<P>
   I had arrived at the prison adjacent to the Roman Forum when it
was just reopening for afternoon visitors. Only a young couple from
England and I were waiting to enter.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple left, I made my way down spiraling steps to the
darkened cell. It reminded me of a larger version of my family's
storm cellar where I often took refuge when I was growing up in
North Texas' tornado belt.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no Texas storm cellar. It has been a place of
pilgrimage since the early days of Christianity. I spontaneously
knelt at the small altar, and the spirits of vanished martyrs
seemed to wash over me in the place where Peter and Paul prayed in
the cavelike cell almost 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place of peace, below the noise and frenzy of the
streets of Rome. I visited the prison after completing an interview
in connection with the ``Religion and Media 2000'' conference I was
attending.
</P>
<P>
   The Carcero Mamertino really is two cells underneath the Church
of St. Joseph of the Carpenters, it says in ``Rome: The Eternal
City,'' by Loretta Santini.
</P>
<P>
   One cell is the true Mamertine prison where famous historical
personalities were executed. The second cell _ which I visited _
was also called the Tullianum, because it was built by the Roman
Servius Tilius. Now both cells are called the Mamertine.
</P>
<P>
   Church tradition says St. Peter performed a miracle by causing
water to gush from a wall of the prison to quench the thirst of
prisoners and also to baptize converts, including fellow prisoners
and two jailers. A small spring is next to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   While imprisoned there, Paul is believed to have written some of
his most impassioned letters to the early Christian church.
</P>
<P>
   Unafraid of dying, he sent a message from his prison cell: ``I
have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept
the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul's fascinating adventures included shipwrecks,
imprisonment and taunts from crowds as he traveled to Athens,
Jerusalem, Corinth, Ephesus, Cyprus and many other parts of the
Roman world to spread the faith.
</P>
<P>
   Rome is truly a place of pilgrimage, even though to many it
ranks behind Jerusalem, Bethlehem and other spots in Israel, where
Jesus walked in the flesh. But Rome is a Holy Land, too.
</P>
<P>
   And it outdoes Jerusalem in its masterpieces of religious art.
</P>
<P>
   An unforgettable experience for me and about 70 clergy, religion
writers, editors, publishers and television executives was a
private tour of the Sistine Chapel inside the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   We were amazed by Michelangelo's recently restored paintings on
the ceiling and walls of the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   And we were stunned into silence when we were ushered into the
Cappella Paolina, a room near the Sistine not always seen by
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the Paulinian Chapel are two of Michelangelo's last
frescoes _ the ``Conversion of St. Paul'' and the ``Crucifixion of
St. Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking of the two works is the artist's
depiction of St. Peter being crucified upside down. Even though
nails are being driven into his feet, Peter glares defiantly at his
executioners.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo's painting of Paul's conversion shows the apostle
being struck blind by a dazzling light coming from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Words from St. Paul are displayed in Latin high on the chapel
wall. The words, ``Mihi Enim Zivre Christus Est, Et Mori Lucrum''
were in a letter to the Phillipian church and are another example
of Paul's courage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps written inside the dark Mamertine jail, Paul's words
declare: ``For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.''

SAN ANTONIO COUNCIL LINKS `LIVING WAGE' TO TAX INCENTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Companies hoping to get a tax break from the city
of San Antonio will have to pay the majority of their workers at
least $9.27 per hour under a ``living wage'' ordinance approved by
the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   After much debate and jostling among elected officials and
business leaders, the council voted 7-4 Thursday to link the living
wage to the city's principal economic development tool.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ordinance, companies will have to pay seven of every
10 of their workers at least $9.27 per hour to qualify for tax
breaks in this South Texas city of more than 1 million people. The
U.S. minimum wage is $5.15 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio is the first major city in Texas to include a wage
criteria in its tax phase-in guidelines, according to the San
Antonio Economic Development Foundation, which vigorously opposed
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Metro Alliance and Communities Organized for Public
Service hailed the decision as a major victory for city workers and
a big step toward reversing the perception of San Antonio as a
low-wage city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, we thank those council people who had the courage to
stay with us,'' said Sister Gabriella Lohan, a Metro Alliance
executive committee member. ``Unfortunately, some business leaders
were afraid of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce executives argued for a
lower wage level, contending that a higher minimum could hurt the
city's ability to attract jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The higher wage represents the average hourly earnings in the
San Antonio Metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Howard Peak, who voted against the measure, said the new
standard was too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can wish for wings, but our butts are going to hit the
ground when we try to fly. I think we need to be more realistic,''
Peak said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new abatement rules, durable manufacturing companies
would have to pay $10.13 per hour, while all other jobs, such as
aviation, technology, hotels, and warehouses would have to pay at
least $9.27 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year of their abatement period, companies would
have to pay only 80 percent of the new wage standards. The idea is
to give them time to ``ramp-up'' and train new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Debra Guerrero's amendment to set the number of
jobs for the new wage standard at 70 percent was seen as crucial in
deciding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular issue becomes a balance between trying to
continue to attract economic development and jobs to this city and
making sure it benefits a whole host of people and provides a
higher standard of living,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Hernandez, president of the Economic Development
Foundation, said the living wage could create a disincentive for
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be effectively eliminating the only financial
incentive tool if we mandate a high minimum wage to this critical
program,'' Hernandez said.

CHINCH BUGS THRIVE IN HOT, DRY WEATHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Large areas of my lawn are yellowish and stunted. Is this
caused by an insect or disease?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A: I suspect chinch bugs may be your problem. Hot, dry summer
conditions are an invitation to these insects, and the typically
hot and dry areas of the lawn near the drive and street are
especially vulnerable. Chinch bugs suck the sap from grass blades
and make them wilt, then die. Irregular, yellowish patches appear,
or the grass turns yellow, then brown. If you try to pull the
affected grass and it remains attached to the roots, then it is
likely that chinch bugs are at work. To be sure, push a bottomless
can into the affected lawn, fill with water, wait a few minutes
and, if they are present, the chinch bugs will soon be swimming
around in the water. The insects are about an 1/8-inch long.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage chinch bugs, water the lawn deeply during hot, dry
spells. There are insecticides such as Dursban that can be used,
but use chemicals as a last resort. Milky white grubs also damage
lawns, but these soil insects, the babies of the June bug beetle,
eat the roots of the grass, and if you tug on the blades the grass
pulls up like a carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In my quest for unusual, hardy perennials, I came across a
wormwood plant. I planted it about two feet from a mock orange. I
later heard that wormwood is disliked by most other plants and my
mock orange likely will not thrive because of this. Can you tell me
if this is true? If so, I'll relocate the wormwood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A: Wormwood is a common name given to various members of the
genus Artemisia, and I'm not sure which you have, but I have never
heard any local gardeners complain that wormwood discourages the
growth of surrounding plants. I would welcome any knowledge
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   There are artemisias, or wormwoods, that struggle in our heat
and humidity. Artemisia schmidtiana, `Silver Mound,' is one. But I
use Southernwood, A. arbrotanum, as a billowy, evergreen border
around old roses, irises, rudbeckias and purple coneflowers and
have never experienced any problems. I do have to cut it back a
couple of times each year. I also grow and enjoy`Powis
Castle'artemisia. This finely cut, silver-gray perennial is a great
foliage accent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give reasons why it is not a good idea to empty the
cat's litter box into my flower beds? I have a lot of kalanchoes,
but the leaves of the large plants are turning yellow and brown.
Should I cut these off? Does one usually cut the stems off after
the flowers are gone?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cat feces and/or cat litter are always listed as materials
that should not be added to compost piles because they attract
rodents and other animals. The same would hold true, of course, in
adding them to a flower bed. These materials also smell and would
be unsightly in a flower bed, unless buried. In addition, it is
unadvisable to use the feces/litter due to possible harmful
pathogens. I would think, too, that continuous dumping in the same
place would create a soil imbalance. I would remove damaged
kalanchoe leaves and monitor the watering. Water well, then allow
the soil to dry before watering again. Overwatering and
underwatering can cause leaves to yellow. Remove the spent flower
stems to tidy the plants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q: What conditions does my hoya need?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several species of hoya. One, Hoya carnosa, or wax
plant, likes strong indirect light or morning sun and afternoon
shade and a well-draining soil. Night temperatures in the 60s and
day temperatures 70 and up are ideal.
</P>
<P>
   If you grow the plant indoors, do not overwater; instead, keep
the soil barely moist during the growing period. Keep the humidity
level at about 50 percent. You may want to rest the plant on a tray
of moist pebbles. Apply a balanced fertilizer such as a 10-10-10
every two months during that period. If the plant is grown
outdoors, you will likely need to water and fertilize more often.
Keep the soil moist. In both cases, let the plant rest in winter.
Stop fertilizing and slow watering.
</P>
<P>
   The wax plant produces clusters of waxy, fragrant, star-shaped
flowers that are borne each year on the same short spurs, so do not
remove these or you'll lose the next round of blooms. The succulent
young stems become woody as the plant ages, and the hoya is
suitable for hanging baskets or training on a short trellis.

TROUBLING SIDE EFFECTS ARE LINKED TO EFFECTIVE AIDS DRUG THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ Imagine lying on your death bed exhausted
and wasted, just a shell of your former self. Suddenly, a new
therapy lets you gain weight and strength. You resume your daily
activities, if not return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a year later, you learn that your miracle new therapy
unexpectedly produces bizarre side effects. Your body changes shape
in peculiar ways and blood tests indicate you cannot properly
metabolize fat, perhaps increasing your risk of a fatal heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Do you stop the very therapy that has brought you back to life?
Or do you continue it, trading your new found well-being for
unknown long-term risks?
</P>
<P>
   What if you are in the early stages of the disease and feel
fine? What if national guidelines suggest you should start the
therapy? Do you accept the unknown risks? Or demand another
therapy?
</P>
<P>
   Troubling questions like these have filled medical history when
promising new therapies have gone sour. The questions come up now
in a dramatic way in AIDS because of a recently recognized
constellation of findings known as the lipodystrophy syndrome. It
produces a different pattern from the wasting syndrome long known
as a part of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the lipodystrophy syndrome, the face, arms, and legs become
thin. The skin becomes dry, the lips cracked. Weight drops. Veins
stick out as cords, and although normal, may be mistaken for
varicose veins.
</P>
<P>
   While fat disappears from some areas, for unknown reasons it
redistributes to build up in others. The back of the neck resembles
a buffalo hump. Breasts enlarge. A woman may have to buy a bra that
is two sizes larger than the last one. The abdomen swells producing
a sometimes painful pot belly that is dubbed ``a protease paunch.''
A woman may look pregnant when she is not. Exercise may not work it
off.
</P>
<P>
   Several published reports have linked the syndrome to the drug
cocktails that contain one of the powerful protease inhibitor drugs
that were introduced in the last two and a half years. Many
discussions at the 12th World AIDS Conference that ended here last
week focused on the syndrome as experts from several countries
reported new cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David A. Cooper, of Sydney, Australia, an international
leader in AIDS research, and Dr. Andrew Carr expanded on their
earlier published findings that 74 out of 116 or about 64 percent
of patients taking protease inhibitors developed the syndrome,
compared to 1 out of 132 who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Two other published reports from France and Hong Kong put the
incidence at about 25 percent and others have reported lower
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The wide variation in incidence figures was attributed to
different factors. One factor is the tendency of many doctors to
deny existence of the side effects, Cooper said. A second factor is
variations in research methods. Researchers who have asked the
patients directly about the problem in a questionnaire have
reported higher rates than researchers who reported only their
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are as likely as anyone to deny a troubling new problem.
Like patients, doctors can become as frustrated when they have no
effective therapy to offer and as enthusiastic as patients when a
new therapy suddenly offers dramatic improvement. That development
contributed to the euphoric mood at the AIDS meeting in Vancouver
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As devastating as the disfigurement may be to some people, the
cosmetic changes may be the least worrisome part of the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are worried about more serious, even potentially fatal,
changes in fat metabolism. A small but growing number of studies
find that many individuals who are taking the drug cocktail have
high levels of cholesterol and lipids in the blood and other
metabolic changes that may increase the risk of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has warned about a possible
link between the protease inhibitors and diabetes, though a causal
link has not been established.
</P>
<P>
   The warning about diabetes was particularly arresting because at
the AIDS meeting two years ago, an exuberant speaker said that the
then-new protease inhibitors had made AIDS ``a chronic manageable
disease just like diabetes.'' At the meeting here, speakers played
on the twist in meaning due to development of diabetes as a
possible complication of the drug and repeated the statement to
caution against further hubris.
</P>
<P>
   Although changes in body shape may not be life threatening, they
greatly concern patients. Doctors from Spain and other countries
reported that patients have stopped taking protease inhibitors
because of psychological problems resulting from the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people have stopped the drugs or switched
to different combinations because drug therapies are not routinely
monitored in practice. Some AIDS doctors estimated that at least
one-third of people who started drug cocktails have stopped them
after two years because of side-effects or inability to adhere to
the rigid regimen of taking up to 20 pills a day.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The lipodystrophy syndrome has caught AIDS experts by surprise.
There were disturbing warning signs in early scientific reports of
increased blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose.
But they were disregarded amid the excitement over the dramatic
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Now the side effects have become ``a very large problem,'' said
Cooper, who was one of the first to raise a yellow flag about the
lipodystrophy syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the percentage of individuals who develop the
syndrome may vary with the different drugs within the class of
protease inhibitors and that it was not known whether newer drugs
in the pipeline will also cause the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drug cocktails are helping tens of thousands of
infected people live longer and better, there is uncertainty about
their long-term safety. The uneasiness creates a problem for
doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hirschel, who treats many AIDS patients in Geneva
and was conference chairman, said doctors and patients must weigh
the disfigurement and the unknown longer-term risks of protease
inhibitors against the possibility of a steady decline in the
patient's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that ``many of the patients in Sydney were about to
check out, and the drugs saved their lives.'' Thus, he said he was
reluctant to switch drugs among people with advanced AIDS. But ``in
asymptomatic infection, the risk-benefit ratio is not known,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald P. Kotler's team from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center, in New York City, doubted a link between the lipodystrophy
syndrome and protease inhibitors, saying that the syndrome occurred
before the widespread use of drug cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   But if so, doctors would have reported the syndrome earlier,
many other AIDS experts said in disagreeing with Kotler's report.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS researchers did agree on the need to expand and standardize
studies of the side-effects of the drug cocktails to make it easier
to compare findings to try to answer such important questions about
whether the fat deposits creating buffalo humps are permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Medical journal articles sometimes pay little attention to side
effects. For example, in the July 1 issue of Journal of the
American Medical Association, Dr. Roy M. Gulick of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, in New York City, did not include
such data in a report that stressed the long-term effectiveness of
a cocktail including the protease inhibitor, indinavir.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference that the AMA held here and partly paid for
by indinavir's manufacturer, Merck, Gulick said few side effects
were seen in the study. But Gulick said findings from triglyceride
tests were not available and that he did not test for cholesterol
because he began the study before the lipodystrophy problem arose.
</P>
<P>
   Merck said the incidence of high triglyceride levels was
comparable in other studies of the drug except for one in which it
was inexplicably high. In it, 26 of 352 recipients, or 7.4 percent,
had high triglyceride levels compared with none of 105 in a group
that did not receive it.
</P>
<P>
   American and European doctors plan to begin trials later this
year to test drug combinations that exclude protease inhibitors to
determine if they could become first line therapy, replacing those
combinations that include protease inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even if newer combinations work, participants said the side
effects of protease inhibitors highlight the need for new and safer
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the side effects of AIDS drugs are leading metabolic
researchers to begin studying them to see if they can shed light on
the way heart disease developed.
</P>
<P>
   Drug cocktail users who develop high blood levels of cholesterol
and triglycerides may be advised to take additional drugs to lower
their risk of a heart attack. If so, the extra pills would add to
the complexity of their daily pill burden.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Keith Henry of St. Paul, Minn., said it was unclear
whether such therapies will be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Krista Dong, of Brown University in Providence, R.I., found
that changes in body shape was a common side-effect among women
taking such drugs. Of 116 women in Dr. Dong's study, 21 expressed
concern over the change in their body. The changes were noted as
early as six weeks, but most were observed at about a year. Ninety
percent reported an increase in abdominal girth and 70 percent in
breast size. ``Regular aerobic exercise had minimal effect on body
shape,'' Dr. Dong said.

 &HT;    Rogers touched Ohio fans
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Bob Batz

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON _ When Roy Rogers died Monday, memories of the ``King of
the Cowboys'' came galloping back across the years to Tim Spiller,
Lana Rhoads and other residents of Ohio's Miami Valley who were
fans of the actor's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1950s and 1960s, Roy Rogers was a symbol for kids who
wanted a cowboy hero, and he was always there for us on the radio,
the television and in the movie theater,'' says Spiller, 42, of
Dayton, a longtime admirer of the singing cowboy and a collector of
TV-related memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads, 54, of Brookville, liked the fact that Rogers was always
the good guy. ``I never met Roy, but I wrote him a letter when I
was 12 and, as I recall, it was pretty gushy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's death won't affect the Roy Rogers Festival that's
held every June in Portsmouth, Ohio, where Rogers lived for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for the whole world, but the festival will
go on because people want it that way,'' festival chairwoman Nancy
Horsley said Monday. This year's festival, held June 4-6, attracted
about 3,000 people to the small Ohio River city.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made at least two visits to the Dayton area. In 1950, the
actor, his wife Dale Evans and his horse Trigger, performed with a
Western variety show at Hobart Arena in Troy. Six years later,
Rogers competed in the Grand American Trap Shoot in Vandalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't win any prizes, but Roy was a very good shot,'' said
Dayton Daily News columnist Jim Nichols, who covered the trapshoot
for the newspaper that year.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' death probably won't boost prices of Roy Rogers
memorabilia, Spiller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff is already more popular than that of any other
cowboy star, including Hopalong Cassidy and Gene Autry,'' he said.
``The hottest items include lamps, lunch boxes and cap guns. A
double-holster Roy Rogers toy gun set brings $200 to $1,500, and a
dome-shaped Roy Rogers Chuckwagon lunch box that's in good
condition is worth $200 to $300.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Johnson of Cincinnati, whose personal collection of Roy
Rogers memorabilia consists of thousands of items, agreed. ``They
are in demand because so many 40- and 50-year-olds had those things
when they were kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was born Leonard Franklin Slye (some references say Sly)
in Cincinnati on Nov. 5, 1911. When Leonard was a year old, his
parents, Andy and Mattie Slye, packed their four children and all
of their belongings onto a houseboat and made the 100-mile trip up
the Ohio River to Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   When they got there, they tied the boat at the foot of Mill
Street and lived aboard the boat until they were displaced by the
1913 flood (the same flood that devastated Dayton). After Andy used
the houseboat to rescue Portsmouth residents stranded by the
floodwaters, he pulled the craft ashore and built a foundation
under it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1919, the Slyes relocated to 20 rock-strewn acres at Duck
Run, a hilly, wooded rural area a few miles north of Portsmouth,
where they lived until moving to California in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, while singing with a Western band and using the
name Dick Weston, Rogers signed his first movie contract with
Republic Studios. After changing his name _ he chose Rogers because
he was a fan of Will Rogers, and added Roy after someone suggested
Leroy _ he made the first of his 87 films, Under Western Stars, in
1938. His is career was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers never lost sight of his Portsmouth-area roots, Horsley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy came back to visit many times over the years and he always
had a good time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Portsmouth responded by starting the Roy Rogers Festival in 1983
and erecting a small display of Roy Rogers memorabilia at the
downtown post office.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, 58, met the actor in 1981 at the home of Cleda
Willoughby, Rogers' sister. Willoughby died three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy threw an arm around me, and it was honey this and honey
that. He was a sweet, caring person,'' she said.

IT'S GREENEST MONTH IN HOSPITALS, BUT DON'T PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is New Year's week at your local hospital, where
July 1 marks a beginning just as fraught with symbolism and
expectation as Jan. 1 is elsewhere. Medical schools end in June and
hospital training programs start in July; last week everyone in
them lurched a step forward.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, thousands of medical workers at hospitals across
the United States _ from new interns to seventh-year surgical
fellows _ have been at their present jobs for less than the blink
of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Should you try very hard not to get sick this month?
</P>
<P>
   Three studies over the last 10 years say not to worry. One found
that hospital charts were sloppier in the summer, and another that
some hospital stays were a little more expensive, but none found
any evidence that more medical errors occur in July and August,
that patients stay any longer in the hospital, or that death rates
are any higher.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the atmosphere in a hospital in July can be quite heady
and invigorating, as full of good intentions and valiant
resolutions as any shiny New Year's morning. Residents and
supervisors alike are on their best behavior. Rules are enunciated,
examples are set, routines are still new enough that everyone pays
more attention to what they are doing _ and also considerably more
attention to what their trainees are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, July might actually be the best month to get
sick?
</P>
<P>
   The studies don't comment on that and, frankly, I would have a
hard time supporting it myself. Out of training now for many years,
I still get a little chill of memory down my spine every July 1,
followed by a surge of deep gratitude to the laws of the universe
that time will never cycle me backward to work in a hospital as a
July intern again.
</P>
<P>
   I did my time in the early 1980s, just before a wave of reform
swept through hospital training programs and eased the work
schedules a little. Back then, we were on duty in the hospital
every third night. As the year wore on, we became efficient enough
to get a little sleep during those nights, but not during July.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are unquestionably dangerous places year-round, but I
think the studies are probably right _ no ``July phenomenon'' put
our patients at unusual risk while we were still getting used to
what we were doing. This is powerful testament to the fact that
terror, adrenaline and very good intentions can sometimes
compensate for inexperience and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   But while our patients survived the month, my colleagues and I
emerged somewhat the worse for wear _ a different kind of July
phenomenon at work.
</P>
<P>
   On the night before my single day off that month, I made the
last train out of Penn Station to eastern Long Island _ and woke up
in a pitch-black railroad car at midnight at the end of the line,
scaring a conductor out of his skin. I nodded at him, turned over
and went back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   On one of her free July evenings, my friend Nancy went out for
dinner with friends, excused herself to go to the ladies' room, and
never came back. Forty-five minutes later they found her snoozing
in a stall.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a true July classic, Arthur was chatting with his mother
on the phone one night, when his doorbell began to ring. He put the
phone down and went to answer it. At the door was his mother. He
had fallen asleep on the phone; she thought an intruder must have
gotten into his apartment, and took a taxi over to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   No lasting damage was done to any of us, but July still gets us
all in the gut.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by accident or design, hospitals seem to be configured
cannily enough to protect patients from a July phenomenon.
Reconfigurations in medical training are now starting to protect
doctors, too. The kind of brain-numbing fatigue that sent us all to
sleep far from our beds is less common than it was. The month is a
little less dramatic all around.
</P>
<P>
   However, like the restaurant sous-chef who knows that his
kitchen is now entirely up to code but continues to take his meals
elsewhere, I don't yet have it in me to wholeheartedly endorse a
July in the hospital for anyone.
</P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the earth's temperature heats up as mainstream scientists
predict it will over the next century, the average level of the
world's oceans could rise by about a foot and a half by 2100, and
somewhat more after that, as glaciers partly melt and the heating
makes sea water expand, inundating many low-lying coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be trivial compared with the melting or collapse of
the huge West Antarctic ice sheet, the Godzilla of rising seas.
That would let loose so much water into the oceans that they would
rise by a truly catastrophic 16 to 20 feet. There, among other
things, would go most of Florida and a sizable chunk of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Could that really happen?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been unable to point with confidence to any
instance in which it has happened in the past, in any sort of
climate that compares with today's or with the climate that is
expected in the decades and centuries ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, natural forces have caused the earth's temperature
to vary widely. All the planet's permanent ice virtually
disappeared during the super-high temperatures of the Cretaceous
period, which ended some 65 million years ago. The extent to which
it may have melted periodically since permanent ice became
re-established as early as 15 million to 20 million years ago has
been unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study by investigators in Sweden and the United States
has turned up what is described as evidence that the West Antarctic
ice sheet, or part of it, did indeed collapse at least once during
an ancient interglacial period, or interval of warmth between ice
ages. The world is in another such interglacial period now, and
many scientists believe its warmth will be intensified by emissions
of heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden and the
California Institute of Technology, led by Dr. Reed P. Scherer,
analyzed sediments recovered from the area beneath the West
Antarctic ice and determined that they contained the remains of
tiny marine algae called diatoms, along with a chemical tracer
called beryllium-10.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they report in the current issue of the journal
Science, these clues ``provide evidence that marine conditions
prevailed deep within the West Antarctic interior'' at some time
within the last two million years. This, they wrote, suggests that
the West Antarctic ice sheet had collapsed to some degree at least
once within the same period. The researchers nominate an unusually
long interglacial interval about 400,000 years ago as the most
likely time for the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer had made similar findings earlier on the basis of
diatoms alone, but the findings were criticized on the ground that
the diatoms could have got into the sediment samples by other means
than melting of the ice. That is true of the new study as well,
said Dr. Lloyd Burckle, a micropaleontologist who works with
diatoms at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the new evidence, while not conclusive, was
strong. Collapse of the ice sheet is the best explanation for the
placement of the diatoms and the beryllium-10, said Dr. Richard
Alley, a paleoclimatologist at Pennsylvania State University.
Scherer's ``original result was correct and he has strengthened
it,'' Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the finding, he said, is that it
``strengthens the possibility'' that the West Antarctic ice sheet
could collapse in the future; having done so once, it could do so
again.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the ice sheet is so vulnerable is that alone among
the world's big ice sheets (including a much larger one in East
Antarctica), it lies largely below sea level. That means it is more
open to melting as warming ocean waters lap at its margins; by
comparison, warmer air melts the ice much more slowly. The ice
sheet's margins consist of vast, floating ice shelves as big as
Spain. If these were to melt, they would not cause the sea level to
rise, since they are already floating on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But they are fed by large, moving rivers of ice that flow from
the interior of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and scientists
believe that the removal of the shelves could allow the rivers to
flow faster, as if a cork were removed from a bottle. This could
deplete the interior reservoir of the West Antarctic ice sheet
itself, which does not float but is instead grounded on an
archipelago below sea level. If the flow of the moving ice streams
did speed up, it might deplete the ice faster than freezing
precipitation could replace it, leading to a net outflow of fresh
water into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   How long this might take is a critical question. The Scherer
study does not shed any light on it. ``He can't demonstrate that it
went in a hurry, just that it went,'' Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   But few if any experts believe that the ice sheet is likely to
collapse in anything less than a few centuries in response to
global warming, whether natural or caused by human activity.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists advising the United Nations predict an average
surface warming of about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 if
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are not
reduced. That amount of warming compares with a warming of 5 to 9
degrees since the depths of the last ice age.
</P>
<P>
   With the predicted warming, which would continue beyond the 21st
century by present calculations, it would probably take 500 to 700
years for the West Antarctic ice sheet to disintegrate fully,
producing the rise in sea level of up to 20 feet, according to a
review of research on the subject by Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a
senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, published in
the journal Nature in May. Alley said he considered this a
reasonable assessment.
</P>
<P>
   But the die could be cast much earlier, Oppenheimer calculated.
The climate could warm enough by the end of the next century to
make an eventual collapse of the ice sheet inevitable, he said. He
called the latest Scherer study ``critically important'' because it
suggests that the ice sheet disintegrated in global temperatures
that could not have been much higher than current levels.
</P>
<P>
   There are many uncertainties in all this, as Oppenheimer pointed
out. Not least, global warming is expected to result in more
precipitation, as more water evaporates from the oceans. This is
likely to build up the ice sheets more rapidly as precipitation
falls and freezes. It is far from clear how the tug-of-war between
increased buildup of ice on one hand and an accelerated flow of the
ice streams on the other would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Two other new pieces of research, published in the current issue
of Nature, suggest that the speed of the ice streams' flow would be
dictated by the underlying geology of Antarctica. The ice streams
flow along relatively narrow basins made slippery by a combination
of fine sedimentary particles and melted ice water. Several things
can slow the flow, including rough protuberances sticking up
through the slippery path and friction along the sides of the flow
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Alley, who is a co-author of one of the Nature
papers, if the underlying topography contains many sedimentary
basins along which more rapidly flowing ice can escape, the ice
sheet would deplete faster. But ``if the ice streams can't get
somewhere because the geology is wrong,'' he said, ``that
essentially buys us time because the ice can't change and move as
rapidly.'' The primary authors of the Nature papers are Robin E.
Bell of the Lamont-Doherty observatory and Sridhar Anandakrishnan
of Pennsylvania State.
</P>
<P>
   However fast the ice streams might flow if the floating shelves
that cork it up were removed, Oppenheimer said, present knowledge
suggests that the streams would probably flow not like water or
wine out of a bottle but rather like stubborn ketchup.

STRANGERS IN THEIR HOMELAND, FRANCE SEEKS WORLD CUP GLORY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France is the home team in this World Cup, and yet much
of that team is seldom at home. Like French wines and designs,
French soccer players are a popular export as the twentieth century
draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Look in any direction. East to Italy, where Zinedine Zidane is
the creative spark and Didier Deschamps the defensive heart of
Juventus' midfield. South to Spain, where Christian Karembeu scored
crucial goals for Real Madrid in its run to the European club
championship in May. West to England, where Arsenal's French coach
Arsene Wenger and his French and foreign recruits won last season's
Premier League title and FA Cup. Or much further west to the United
States, where the world's only superpower went out of its way in
May to expedite the naturalization of a defender named David Regis
who wasn't considered good enough for France's national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``France figured out how to modernize its system of player
development in the '70s and '80s,'' said Wenger, ``and now it is
reaping the rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   But can France, the nation that essentially created the World
Cup in 1930, finally reap the ultimate reward on the field? It has
been to the semifinals on three other occasions, losing to Brazil
in 1958; to Germany in 1982 and again in 1986. This time, their
semifinal opponent is a titan-killer, Croatia, which is competing
in its first World Cup and fresh off a 3-0 victory over the Germans
in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the grudge match that Zidane and his teammates were
anticipating, this semifinal will be an introduction. Croatia and
France never have played, but that does not change the French
objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have equaled what the previous generations have done; now
we need to do better than the previous generations,'' Zidane said.
``I know that winning this World Cup would be the greatest feeling
I ever could have in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Zidane, 26, is the best French player of his generation, and if
his talent is hardly typical, his career choices and personal
history are. Born in Marseille, he left home for Cannes at age 13
for a soccer boarding school where he was given a solid base in
soccer tactics and technique. Zidane's innate touch and
determination did the rest, and after several seasons in the French
first division, he left for Italy and a large contract with
Juventus of Turin in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow Frenchman, national team captain Didier Deschamps,
was already there. The ruling in 1995 that ushered in an era of
American-style free agency in Europe has led to an exodus from
France, where taxes are high and television and gate receipts too
low to compete consistently with offers from Spanish, Italian and
English teams. Though some Frenchmen with high profiles have
returned _ defender Laurent Blanc from Barcelona to Marseille _
they are exceptions, and nine of the 11 players who started against
Italy in the quarterfinals are under contract with clubs outside
the country.
</P>
<P>
   This talent drain has hardly done wonders for the prestige of
the French domestic league, nor for Jacquet's telephone bills or
peace of mind. ``I've been in Italy more than I've been in
France,'' he said recently. The slender, self-made son of a
butcher, Jacquet was not supposed to be France's supreme leader for
the most important soccer tournament in its history.
</P>
<P>
   It took a stunning collapse to give him the opportunity. With
two qualifying matches remaining before the 1994 World Cup finals,
France needed only to defeat a relatively weak Israeli team or draw
with Bulgaria to secure its spot for the United States. The fact
that both matches were at home only made qualification appear even
more certain, and before hosting Israel, French newspapers reported
that coach Gerard Houillier already was discussing a lengthy
contract extension. Champagne was waiting in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But Houillier's team proceeded to surrender a 2-1 lead against
Israel in the final 10 minutes and lose. Against Bulgaria, the
score was tied at 1 when, with only seconds remaining, Emil
Kostadinov scored off a counterattack. Those two
stranger-than-fiction failures cost Houillier and the president of
the French soccer federation, Jean-Fournet Fayard, their jobs and
presumably some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet, who had spent nine largely successful seasons coaching
Bordeaux in the 1980s, was named Houillier's interim replacement,
but he would soon become a fixture as France embarked on a
record-setting, 30-match unbeaten streak with a new group of
players, including Youri Djorkaeff, Karembeu and the gifted
playmaker Zidane. The streak ended against Denmark in September
1996, but it ended unofficially in the semifinals of the European
Championships two months earlier when the Czech Republic won on
penalty kicks after a scoreless draw that was an accurate
reflection of France's defensive-minded approach to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   That conservative approach earned Jacquet some vocal enemies at
home, but what mattered more to Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of
France's far right wing party, the National Front, was that
Jacquet's team did not look French.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit artificial to bring players from abroad and call it
the French team,'' Le Pen said during the championships.
</P>
<P>
   That comment drew quick condemnation from various quarters and a
quick clarification from Le Pen's party, which said he meant only
to complain that foreign players had been naturalized quickly to
make them eligible. This proved wildly inaccurate, but what is true
is that France's rainbow soccer coalition reflects both recent
immigration patterns and the far-flung places _ French Guiana, New
Caledonia and the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique _
that remain French territories or ``departements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team gives you a sense of the socio-cultural mix that is
France today,'' said goalkeeper Bernard Lama, who was born in
Guiana and did not come to mainland France until he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Desailly, the powerful AC Milan defender, was born in
Ghana; Karembeu in New Caledonia. Lilian Thuram, Trezeguet and
Zidane were all born on the French mainland, but Thuram's mother is
from Guadeloupe; Trezeguet's parents from Argentina and Zidane's
from Algeria (they are Kabyles). Djorkaeff's mother is Armenian and
his father Jean of Polish and Kalmuck descent.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Djorkaeff also played soccer for France, which is proof
that diversity is hardly new on this national team. Platini, after
all, was the son of Italian immigrants, and Raymond Kopa, another
all-time French great, was of Polish descent. For the most part,
France's team, like the nation it represents, has been more melting
pot than mosaic over the years. The only member of the current
group to break ranks has been Karembeu, who advocates independence
for New Caledonia and has left little mystery about where his
allegiance lies.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen was not the last Frenchman to bemoan the team's racial
mix. ``I receive incredibly nasty letters that reproach me for
having a team of blacks and foreigners who don't know how to sing
La Marseillaise,'' Jacquet told the newspaper Le Monde last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacquet and his team, often criticized in a critical nation,
have managed to become immensely popular figures in the last four
weeks. Booed by the fans in Marseille during introductions before
the opening match against South Africa, Jacquet has been cheered
ever since. The lost generation has come home, and it defends like
no other team on earth. Though Jacquet's team, so offensive against
weaker opposition in group play, has again stopped scoring goals
because of its lack of a proven striker, the sound of nitpicking
has been overwhelmed by the sound automobile horns sounding off
late into the night in cities all over the country after the
victories over Paraguay and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more noise in the streets if the Croatians are the
next victims, and though Brazil or the Netherlands would be waiting
in the final, France, a nation with a remarkably rich past, already
has history on its side. The last major soccer event it hosted was
the 1984 European Championships. It won.

   &UR; Isle of Islay &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will be in Scotland in November and want to visit the Isle
of Islay to trace our genealogy. Can you give us information about
weather, ferry crossings, rooms and genealogical research? _
Susette Graham, Fairport, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Islay (pronounced EYE-lah), at the southern end of the Inner
Hebrides, is about 235 square miles, making it one of the larger of
the Hebrides, the 500-island archipelago off western Scotland. It
is known for single-malt whiskey, and you can visit any of six
distilleries. The capital, Bowmore, has the Round Church (1767),
designed so the devil wouldn't have a corner to hide in. The
eighth-century cross at Kildalton Chapel, northeast of Port Ellen,
is a prime example of Celtic crosses.

Board, (44-1496) 810254, fax 810363, suggests being ready for chill
and rain that month.
</P>
<P>
   For genealogical research, contact Eleanor McNab at the Islay
Family History Society, Highfield, High Street, Bowmore, Isle of
Islay, PA43 7JE, (44-1496) 840675, fax 810743. She needs the
earliest accurate documentation of an ancestor on Islay. Its
population has dropped from 14,000 in 1831 to 3,200 today, she
said, because of an exodus to Canada and the United States in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the island, you can take a ferry from Kennacraig on
the Kintyre Peninsula, about a two-and-a-half-hour drive from
Glasgow, to Port Askaig or Port Ellen (the prettier of the two
ports). In winter there are two crossings daily. The crossing to
Port Ellen takes about 2 hours 10 minutes; to Port Askaig, 2 hours.
Round-trip fares are $17.50 (at $1.71 to a pound) for passengers in
the summer high season, lower after October. Call Caledonian
MacBrayne, (44-1496) 302209.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry also takes cars, but you probably won't need one to
explore the island. Strathclyde Passenger Transport operates buses
that link all the major towns on the island. A one-day fare card
costs $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging choices on the island include the following inns and
hotels, most of which are family run and all of which are open
year-round (rates are double, with full breakfast):
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Inn, Bowmore, (44-1496) 810330, fax 810990. Four rooms
with bath; $94.
</P>
<P>
   Lochside Hotel, Shore Street, Bowmore, (44-1496) 810244, fax

LONGING FOR FARAWAY PLACES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On one recent journey I visited Sedona, Ariz., and San Diego.
And for a reason that struck me only in retrospect, they made a
perfect combination.
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot and I are forever debating _ on friendly terms, of
course _ the merits of spending time in familiar destinations vs.
exploring the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Each has its rewards:
</P>
<P>
   There is a comfort level in returning to a favorite haunt.
Logistics are simplified: You already know the way to restaurants,
shops, scenic attractions and recreational pursuits. And chances
are you've formed friendships and eagerly anticipate a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet one of the main joys of travel _ from the initial
planning phase to arrival, even to subsequent discussions with
family and neighbors back home _ is the thrill of discovering new
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular trip, Sedona represented first-time
excitement; I had fantasized about seeing those beautiful,
brilliant red rocks up close, and they didn't disappoint. By
contrast, ever since my first among dozens of visits to San Diego
as a baseball and football reporter before becoming travel editor,
it's occupied a soft spot in my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I found myself focusing on other places that have
inspired me to want to return.
</P>
<P>
   I've made an arbitrary list of 10 destinations I aim to visit
again. And 10 to which I yearn to travel. I've made a promise to
myself, too, that as time permits, I'll find a way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOND MEMORIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Oregon coast. I hope I never erase the image of a spectacular
sunset over the Pacific Ocean from a balcony at the Channel House
Inn in Depoe Bay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington, D.C. As a 16-year-old, I rode the train _ I even
remember its name, the Crescent _ from Bay St. Louis, Miss., to
Washington, and spent a week touring every landmark. I've returned
many times, but there was always another purpose, always a reason
to hurry. I covet the luxury of lingering again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Estes Park, Colo. When the toughest decision involves whether
to spy for wildlife in Rocky Mountain National Park, take an
idyllic stroll amid wondrous scenery or languish in a rocking chair
on the patio of your private cabin beside a babbling brook, you
know you're in God's country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kauai, Hawaii. The Garden Island's beauty and tranquility
first captivated me 20 years ago, and witnessing the destruction
inflicted by Hurricane Iniki in this decade brought tears. Now,
Kauai is recovered.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York City. There was a time I never imagined I'd write
those words. I've been to the Big Apple maybe 50 times and _ hush,
don't tell the tourism bureau _ dreaded every visit. But I
recognize now that my frustration occurred largely because the New
York I knew revolved around ballparks and arenas and reporting
deadlines. While I treasure my evenings spent in ``The House That
Ruth Built,'' there was precious little time to soak in countless
other enticements. I'm primed to play Joe Tourist on Broadway, at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, at the Statue of Liberty. Hmmm,
wonder when the Yankees are playing. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Big Sur, Calif. All factors considered _ the setting,
accommodations, cuisine and service _ the Post Ranch Inn is my idea
of Hotel Heaven. I couldn't afford it the first time I visited; I
can't afford it now. But when I win the lottery ...
</P>
<P>
   _ South Bend, Ind. I'm not Catholic. I'm not even a Notre Dame
fan. But nothing invigorates me _ or makes me feel young again if
only for an instant _ more than a genuine college atmosphere. Spend
an autumn Saturday afternoon here, and you'll never forget the
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco. Anyone who has been there understands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seaside, Fla. Not because of ``The Truman Show.'' I've yet to
see the movie. But what a picture-perfect village! Perhaps Seaside
is artificial, perhaps not. My brief forays haven't uncovered its
real personality. I figure I may need a month there to find out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alaska. Sorry I can't be more definitive. From Ketchikan to
Fairbanks _ with ample time to get reacquainted with Denali
National Park _ this state is filled with wonders. Besides, what
better excuse to take a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WISH LIST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Vermont. A country inn. Autumn leaves. Whistling wind. A
fireplace. Especially if Larry, Darryl and Darryl stop by.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minnesota's lakes. I've spent many happy days in Minneapolis,
but haven't ventured into the countryside. Friends say this land of
a thousand lakes is marvelous. And it's long past time I learned to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yellowstone National Park. I know, shame on me. In truth, I
did visit as a child. The sight of that 25-foot bear _ or was it 50
feet? _ picking at the garbage outside our cabin still torments me.
I'm ready for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cooperstown, N.Y. I've seen about 3,000 major-league baseball
games. I'm on the Hall of Fame selection committee. And yet I've
never visited the sport's shrine. This is a beautiful part of the
country, too. When pitcher Nolan Ryan is inducted ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Cape Cod, Mass. But only if I can stay in the clapboard house
of my dreams beside the ocean. Maybe for three months. Just long
enough to finish the mystery novel swirling about in my head.
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington state wine region. I figure I owe it to myself to
trace the roots of some of my favorite beverages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Williamsburg, Va. I've yet to meet a person who wasn't touched
by a visit here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue Ridge Parkway. I never imagined I would enjoy a leisurely
drive along the Natchez Trace Parkway as much as I did last year.
This looms as the perfect follow-up. All-American Road honors don't
come by chance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Augusta, Ga. But only in early April. As a sportswriter, I
covered Olympics, Super Bowls, World Series and other major
championships, but one regret is never seeing the Masters. Wonder
if Tiger Woods needs a caddy.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. John. Yes, I know, it's in the Caribbean. The Virgin
Islands. The U.S. Virgin Islands. I've watched in dismay as
overzealous natives tugging at my shirtsleeves and begging for
quarters spoiled the fun on neighboring St. Thomas. I'm told St.
John is unspoiled and romantic. I figure it's my duty to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts merely scratch the surface. But this is, after
all, America. And no surface is grander.

WHISTLE-BLOWER WINS CASE AGAINST FEDERAL LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has upheld a federal worker's claim that his
employers unfairly retaliated against him for reporting safety
violations at a nuclear weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Lappa, a 19-year employee of the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory who reported the safety violations in the
plutonium laboratory, deserves $15,000 in compensatory damages,
OSHA regional administrator Frank Strasheim ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Strasheim's two-page ruling also ordered Lawrence Livermore
officials to pay Lappa's legal and other costs, and to expunge
``negative references'' from his personnel files dating from June
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is ``a hands-down, 100 percent victory,'' Lappa's
lawyer, Tom Carpenter of the Government Accountability Project's
office in Seattle. He noted that federal law prohibits officials at
nuclear weapons facilities from retaliating against whistle-blowers
who report wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly found in David's favor and ordered the laboratory
to remedy the violation,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not decided whether to appeal the OSHA ruling,
Lawrence Livermore spokesman David Schwoegler said. The laboratory,
a part of the Department of Energy, is located in Livermore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schwoegler acknowledged that safety violations had occurred in
the plutonium building. But they never threatened public safety, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA issued the ruling June 29 in the form of a letter from
Strasheim to lab director Bruce Tarter. The Accountability Project
announced the ruling last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, while serving on an internal committee
investigating the plutonium lab, Lappa accused the employees of
deliberately allowing the violations. Lappa refused to sign the lab
committee's report on the grounds that it did not adequately
discuss deliberate safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   He accused employees of deliberately allowing excess amounts of
plutonium to concentrate into small spaces. The condition is
technically known as ``overmass.'' He claimed the employees
violated the rules in order to meet work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, excessive concentration of plutonium could trigger a
``criticality event,'' causing a fire or, at worst, a small nuclear
blast.
</P>
<P>
   Schwoegler said even a small nuclear blast ``was technically
impossible under the conditions that existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwoegler said lab officials have responded to the violations
by launching an intensive training program for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take plutonium handling very seriously,'' Schwoegler said.
Plutonium is the prime fissionable component in most nuclear
weapons.

SHOES THAT WALKED THE EARTH 8,000 YEARS AGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the longest chapters in the history of fashion has
emerged from an unlikely hiding place _ a cave overlooking the
Missouri River in Calloway County, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   From an ancient garbage dump in the cave, archeologists have
retrieved a number of discarded shoes that range in age from 800 to
8,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes include sandals and slip-ons in a variety of styles.
Their design follows no particular pattern from century to century.
``Things came in style, went out of style, like what happens
today,'' said Michael J. O'Brien, an archeologist at the University
of Missouri who has studied the shoes. His findings are published
in the current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the shoes are woven from the leaves of a yucca-like
plant known as rattlesnake master because it is supposed to be an
antidote to snake venom. The two youngest items in the collection,
however, are moccasins made of deerskin.
</P>
<P>
   Though these materials are perishable, the shoes survived
because of the dry and constant conditions in the cave, known as
the Arnold Research Cave.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes were excavated many years ago but dated only recently.
Previous methods of carbon-based dating required that a large
sample of the material be analyzed. O'Brien was unwilling to cut
large pieces from the shoes and decided to wait for a better dating
method to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Because of renewed interest in the Shroud of Turin, a cloth said
by its devotees to be the original winding sheet that bound the
body of Jesus, scientists at the University of Arizona developed a
carbon-based dating method that required only a few threads of the
original material, the maximum that church authorities would allow
to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and a colleague who is a textile expert, Jenna Kuttruff
of Louisiana State University, had the shoes sent off to be dated
by the new method. The footwear turned out to be much older than
they had expected and to cover a much larger expanse of time.
Sagebrush bark shoes found in Oregon are even older, dating back
9,000 years, but the Arnold Research Cave shoes include the oldest
ones found east of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kuttruff said she planned to grow some rattlesnake master in
order to weave some shoes for herself. It was probably a day's work
to make a pair of such shoes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arnold Research Cave was first inhabited about 11,000 years
ago. For most of its occupancy, its inhabitants seem to have been
hunters and gatherers, according to the evidence of the many animal
bones found there. There are signs that at the end of the
occupancy, about 1,000 years ago, the cave dwellers had started to
grow squash.
</P>
<P>
   Besides shoes, the only other fabric found in the cave came from
bags, including one with a squarish shape and a braided top.
</P>
<P>
   Could the inhabitants have worn just shoes and shoulder bags?
``I think not,'' Dr. Kuttruff said. Clothes may be absent from the
remains, she said, because their fabrics were more likely to be
reused until they wore out, whereas shoes were more likely to be
abandoned. And, some of the fabrics worn by American Indians,
including feathers and rabbit fur, are very perishable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Missouri cave collection contains only odd shoes, no pairs.
There are left shoes, right shoes and shoes that fit either foot.
Many show signs of wear at the heel or toe, just like modern shoes.
Some have been repaired, and one has scorch marks suggesting that
its wearer got too close to a fire. Several are padded with the
contemporary equivalent of today's foot pads _ wads of grass.
</P>
<P>
   There is something special in the relationship between people
and their shoes. No other item of clothing must mold itself more
closely to the wearer, or can punish so agonizingly if it fails to
fit. Perhaps shoes were the first item of clothing that had to be
acquired when human beings first learned to walk upright.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, however, noted that the foot grows calluses to protect
itself, enabling people to cross rugged terrain _ although shoes
are useful against frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,300-year-old ice man retrieved in 1994 from the Italian
Alps was wearing shoes of calfskin, much repaired and stuffed with
grasses for insulation. European settlers noted that the American
Indian tribes they met wore leather shoes, Dr. Kuttruff said.

A CIVIL WAR REGIMENT RESTORED TO GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 12)  
 (JT)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a young civil-rights worker in Mississippi
during the 1960s, Frank Smith Jr. developed an interest in the
little-known story of the black soldiers who fought for the Union
during the Civil War. As a City Councilman in recent years in
Washington's Shaw neighborhood _ named after Robert Gould Shaw, the
white commander of a black Civil War regiment, portrayed in the
1989 movie ``Glory'' _ Smith has pushed to bring that slice of
history to broader public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Out of his efforts has arisen the African-American Civil War
Memorial, which will be formally unveiled in the heart of the Shaw
district, about 20 blocks north of downtown Washington, on
Saturday, July 18.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is near the intersection of Vermont Avenue and U
Street, N.W., outside the U Street Metro station. Using the same
basic concept as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, it features a
bronze statue of black soldiers in front of three low semicircular
granite walls covered with stainless-steel plaques listing 208,943
names _ all of the black soldiers who served in the war between the
states plus the 7,000 white officers they served under. The
pie-shaped site, about a block long, was designed by Paul Devrouax
and the landscape architect Edward Dunson; the sculpture, called
``Spirit of Freedom,'' is by Ed Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The project will eventually include a heritage center, adjacent
to the memorial in the Masonic Temple Lodge on U Street. It is
intended to complement the memorial with historical displays and
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the $2.5 million project, Smith took advantage of the
memorial's site outside the Metro stop. With the help of other
local officials, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of
Columbia's representative in Congress, he persuaded the District
and the U.S. Transportation Department each to provide $1 million.
The remainder came from foundations and private donations.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing to build the memorial, Smith said he was partly
inspired by ``Glory,'' which told the story of the 54th
Massachusetts Regiment. Saturday's unveiling will come on the 135th
anniversary of the regiment's doomed assault on Fort Wagner, S.C.,
when most of the regiment was wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The 54th was only one of 166 regiments raised for the United
States Colored Troops, as they were officially known. Indeed, Smith
said, a significant proportion of all able-bodied black males ended
up fighting for the Union.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their sacrifice in the cause of the Union and ending
slavery, the black soldiers and sailors won little public
recognition after the war. The African-American Civil War Memorial
Freedom Foundation, set up by Smith to build the memorial, cites an
incident immediately following the Confederacy's surrender at
Appomattox, when 200,000 Union soldiers _ but not one of the black
regiments _ were invited to a victory march down Pennsylvania
Avenue in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a grave oversight in American history that very
little is known about the heroic contribution of these brave
soldiers in ending slavery and keeping this country united under
one flag,'' Smith said. ``This is an effort to build a focal point
here in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling will be preceded by several days of related
events. On Wednesday, the African-American Civil War Memorial
Freedom Foundation will be host to a symposium and reception for
descendants of United States Colored Troops and Sailors at the
Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill, 400 New Jersey Ave., N.W.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16 at 8:30 a.m. there will be a memorial service at
Arlington National Cemetery, and at 5 p.m. at Capitol Hill there
will be a commemorative program titled ``Their Time Has Finally
Come'' celebrating the troops.
</P>
<P>
   A symposium about the abolitionist movement and the Civil War,
with John Hope Franklin, chairman of the Presidential Commission on
Race, among others, will be held July 17 at 10 a.m. at Howard
University's Blackburn Center (2400 Sixth Street, N.W.). At 2 p.m.
the National Park Service, which will operate the memorial, will
hold a ceremony at Ford's Theater (511 10th St., N.W.) to thank the
volunteers who helped create the data base with the names of all
the black soldiers who served in the Civil War. Seating is limited
for some events. For information, call (202) 667-2667 or toll-free
(888) 648-8728. More information about the memorial is available on
the Web at www.afroamcivilwarmemorial.org.

   EASTER ISLAND, Chile _ On the sacred slopes of Rano Raraku, a
Polynesian Mount Olympus, the impassive faces on huge statues
carved out of soft volcanic stone look across fields tinted dusty
pink by the ripening tall grass and far out to the blue waters of
the Pacific Ocean. The vista encompasses the entire world that
could have been known to the creators of the enigmatic statues, the
most distinctive expressions of an ancient society coping with life
in isolation on the most remote inhabited island on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Down on Easter Island's south coast, also in view of Rano
Raraku, 15 more of these gray monoliths, called moais (pronounced
MOY-eyes), have been reassembled and restored to their original
upright positions in a single row on a stone platform.
Archeologists consider the site, Tongariki, one of the greatest
religious monuments of early Polynesian culture in the South
Pacific. It is certainly the most impressive accomplishment of
recent restorations here.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere one looks on this speck of land no more than 64
square miles in size, about three times the size of Manhattan,
another moai stands silhouetted against the sky or lies in pasture
grass or remains in its quarry, incomplete or too large to have
been moved by its over-reaching builders. A comprehensive survey by
archeologists from Chile and the United States has counted nearly
900 of these statues, with a few more pockets of land still
unmapped.
</P>
<P>
   The statues have long haunted the imaginations of explorers,
anthropologists and other visitors. Whatever the sculptors
intended, the moais are seen as the lithic embodiment of obsession
and mystery. In a time more attuned to ecology, they have also been
invoked, rightly or wrongly, as a metaphor for the fate of a
society that self-destructs through the heedless use of its limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Early this century, the English ethnographer Katherine Routledge
spent more than a year studying the Easter Island culture and its
remarkable sculpture. ``The shadows of the departed builders still
possess the land,'' she wrote. ``The whole air vibrates with a vast
purpose and energy which has been and is no more.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, each statue stands 14 feet and weighs 14 tons,
though one measures 32 feet and 89 tons. The motif is unvarying: an
elongated head with long ears, a prominent nose and pursed lips and
a shortened torso with hands placed across the abdomen, fingertips
just meeting. Coral eyeballs have been restored to only a few of
the heads. The vacant eye sockets seem to render all the others
blind to the present and unrevealing of the vision that drove the
islanders to a frenzy of statue building between 1,000 and 400
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists at last are making progress in recovering the
history of Rapa Nui, which is the local culture's name for the
island, the people themselves and their indigenous language. They
also are gaining a better understanding of the motivations,
practices and economic foundations of the statue builders. But the
place is in danger of losing its alluring air of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All outsiders think the island is so simple and
straightforward,'' said Dr. Jo Anne Van Tilburg, an archeologist at
the University of California at Los Angeles and writer of ``Easter
Island: Archaeology, Ecology, and Culture'' (Smithsonian
Institution Press, 1994). ``The remains are so visible there on the
surface, and the place is so small. But I've been working there 15
years and I have more questions now than answers.''
</P>
<P>
   One evening, after a day among the ruins, Dr. Jose Miguel
Ramirez, an archeologist and head of the National Park of Rapa Nui,
ticked off some of the most intractable mysteries. ``We're not sure
when the island was first settled, where exactly the people came
from, or whether they maintained any contacts with their homelands
after they arrived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But scholars have disproved some of the more fanciful
conjecture. ``This is not the tip a sunken continent like Atlantis,
and has nothing to do with aliens from outer space,'' Ramirez said
emphatically. ``We know it was human beings who came here and
erected these statues.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, scholars say they have laid to rest the notion, made
popular in the 1950s by the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl, that
the original people were Indians from South America. He thought he
saw similarities between Pre-Columbian Peruvian and Easter Island
architecture. To make his point that such contact was possible, he
sailed westward from Peru in a reed raft named the Kon-Tiki.
</P>
<P>
   Linguistic, cultural, and genetic evidence, most anthropologists
agree, shows that the people of Rapa Nui were Polynesians. Their
language is Polynesian, though it has changed so radically as to
indicate an early separation from the home culture and centuries of
isolation. The few surviving examples of ancient writing are in a
script that has yet to be deciphered. The statues and other
artifacts bear a Polynesian imprint, and, in 1994, the DNA from 12
Easter Island skeletons was found to be Polynesian.
</P>
<P>
   THE SETTLERS
</P>
<P>
   POLYNESIANS FOUND ISLE NEXT TO NOWHERE
</P>
<P>
   The first settlers apparently arrived from the west by canoe
sometime between A.D. 400 and 750. This was a time of epic voyages
of Pacific settlement. The migrating Polynesians, originally from
Southeast Asia, had reached Tahiti and the Marquesas islands by 300
before going on to discover and occupy Hawaii and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Easter Island, though, must have put the Polynesian
navigators to their severest test. They would have had to paddle
against prevailing winds and currents, traveling far to the south
and east of their usual routes and then somehow coming to an island
that is next to nowhere: 1,400 miles southeast of Pitcairn Island,
the nearest inhabited land, and 2,340 miles west of Chile, Easter
Island's proprietor since 1888.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely this could have happened entirely by accident,''
said Dr. Ben Finney, an anthropology professor at the University of
Hawaii who specializes in Polynesian exploration.

CAMPAIGN FEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It turns out President Clinton is still a Democrat,
no matter what you thought.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for the coming campaign season, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he ignored his fellow Democrats and campaigned
for re-election as a pseudo-Republican happy to work with a
GOP-controlled Congress. He pledged in his second inauguaral
address to build a bipartisan ``vital center'' in politics, and GOP
leaders promised a new era of cooperation as well.
</P>
<P>
   So much for good intentions. This idealistic view of a pacifist
government could not survive the reality of the genuine
philosophical differences between the two parties. Apart from last
year's balanced budget agreement, the president and Congress have
agreed on little, and confrontation is more common than comity.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton had an epiphany. He is now going all-out on behalf of
his party's congressional candidates, in hopes of returning the
House of Representatives to Democratic control.
</P>
<P>
   He has already proved his sudden devotion to the party cause by
fiendish fund-raising the past six months. And he is even going to
cut short his Martha's Vineyard vacation next month to allow time
for extra fund-raising and touting the virtues of his party's local
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   With the politics of anger replaced by a sense of contentment
among the voters, this year's November election is expected to be a
boring exercise that favors the status quo and political
incumbents. That means trouble for the Democratic dream of picking
up the 11 seats needed to replace Speaker Newt Gingrich with
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the GOP 10-seat majority is so firm the Democrats
have no hope of winning control there, but it would send a potent
signal if they could increase their numbers a little and thus their
margin for preventing a veto override.
</P>
<P>
   The lame-duck president's discovery that it is in his interest
to have a Democratic-controlled Congress is oddly belated. Surely
he would like to end the GOP majority's investigation subpoena
power, which has been used lavishly to harass him. And surely he
understands that if Gephardt achieves his long-time goal of
becoming speaker, he will be less likely to run against Vice
President Al Gore for president in 2000 than if he is frustrated in
a minority role.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's conversion, if that's what it can be called, is
welcomed by most in his party. Even liberals who were angry at what
they considered his desertion of traditional Democratic principles
recognize his usefulness as a campaigner this year.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential coattails may not matter much as a general rule,
but Clinton is looking good these days and the Democrats need all
the help they can get. His habit of issuing narrow administrative
orders to advance public policy without congressional approval
seems to be popular. And even if the Republicans make morality
their central issue, his personal weaknesses are unlikely to drag
down candidates who can impress constituents with their own
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the party's best fund-raiser and attention-getter.
His energetic efforts have already virtually eliminated the
Democratic National Committee's $15 million debt, which was
partially created by returning $3 million in dubious foreign
contributions. In addition, Clinton and Gore have raised more than
$25 million for other candidates by starring in at least 40
big-ticket party events this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's successful China trip has at least temporarily
silenced GOP critics who contended he was too soft in his dealings
with that country. A public backlash against Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, who has suffered several setbacks in the Lewinsky
matter and whose Whitewater and travel office probes have petered
out, is actually helping Democratic fund-raising. And congressional
investigations into various alleged administration wrongdoings have
generated little public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the president's approval ratings have remained
astonishingly high.
</P>
<P>
   His move to build party unity is in sharp contrast to the chaos
in the GOP, as right-wing conservatives and mainstream
conservatives duke it out for control of the philosophical agenda.
The party needs the religious right to activate its primary base
but is in danger of ultimately offending more people than it
pleases with narrow, intolerant social litmus tests that most
voters reject.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Gingrich tried a kinder, gentler approach toward
political combat in his new book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way.''
But he swiftly reverted to his customary nastiness and doctrinaire
pronouncements after the book didn't sell well and right-wing
activists threatened to desert the party. Since then, the GOP
congressional leadership has been pandering to the right wing with
pious posturing, lecturing the rest of us about how to behave in
our private lives.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it makes sense for Clinton to take the
offensive, to try to protect both himself and Gore _ and to show
the Democratic Party that despite his adventures in GOP-land he
remembers his roots after all. His name isn't on the ballot this
year, his personal reputation is already shot and he's got little
to lose.

EASTER ISLAND, Chile: Polynesian exploration. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next year, a team of Hawaiians skilled in traditional Pacific
island navigation plan an attempt to duplicate the voyage in a
replica of a 62-foot-long, twin-hulled Polynesian canoe. In
previous expeditions, the same team established that early
sea-going Polynesians had the boats and navigational skills for
purposeful exploration and widespread settlement of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Finney, an adviser to the group, known as the Polynesian
Voyaging Society, said the expedition would start from Mangareva,
an atoll northwest of Pitcairn. Mangareva is considered one of the
more likely departure points for the original voyage of discovery;
the Marquesas are another candidate. If the winds are favorable,
Finney said, the journey might be completed in 17 days, but it
would probably take much longer to wait for favorable breaks in the
prevailing winds.
</P>
<P>
   THE REASONS
</P>
<P>
   FEATS OF BRAVERY, THEN STRANDED ALONE
</P>
<P>
   The Polynesians probably sought out Easter Island for the same
reasons they crossed much of the rest of the Pacific, Finney said.
It was not necessarily overcrowding that drove them forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voyages may have been celebrations of technology,'' the
anthropologist said. ``The people had developed the world's best
ocean-going technology for the tropics. They were proud of it and
wanted to test it to the fullest. And then there was their
hierarchical social structure. Only the oldest sons could hope to
become chiefs. So like the younger sons of Europe who went off on
the Crusades or to the New World, the younger sons of Polynesia
organized expeditions to find a new island, where guess who would
then become chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they reached Easter Island, however, the people probably
found themselves stranded. Scholars can find no evidence of two-way
communication between the island and the rest of Polynesia. The
settlers, it seems, were stripping the island of trees, especially
the hardwoods used in canoe buildings. Without canoes, they had no
way back, and were utterly alone until Jacob Roggeveen, a Dutch
mariner, reached the island on Easter Sunday in 1722.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the culture's glory days had passed. Recent excavations
led by University of Chile archeologists have uncovered old
agricultural fields, seeds and roots of former woodlands, house
foundations, ceremonial sites, as well as the fallen statues. An
analysis of the findings indicates that the island population grew
steadily from 1000 to the 1500s, when it apparently peaked at
9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first statues were probably erected soon after the
island's settlement, archeologists have found that the people went
on a building spree between 1400 and 1600. Nearly all of the
statues were quarried and carved at the summit of Rano Raraku, a
satellite cone of one of the three volcanoes that formed the
island. Toward the end, the sculptors were producing bigger and
bigger statues, as if they were desperately appealing for greater
divine intercession in times of mounting trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Most archeologists view the statues as the central
manifestations of ancestral worship. The island was ruled by a
religious aristocracy with the power to enlist a large labor force
to create the statues as representations of their forebears, the
chiefs who were also gods in Polynesian culture. Nearly all the
statues faced not to the sea, but inland, toward fields requiring
the blessing of fertility and some of the sacred places.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Van Tilburg explained that the moai is an icon exemplifying
the fundamental Polynesian concern with genealogy, generation,
status, and respect. It served as ``a cultural motivator and
modifier of group behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, the UCLA archeologist wrote: ``The originators of
moai design were absolute masters of the components of traditional
art as communication and use of line to convey emotion, and
understood the social function of the form they had created.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DECLINE
</P>
<P>
   STATUE CULT PREY TO MAN AND NATURE
</P>
<P>
   By the 17th century, the old order of statue builders was
disintegrating. Tribes organized into warring confederacies.
Rebelling against the religious elite, they toppled and often
decapitated the symbols of their influence, the statues. Famine may
have led to some cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   With the waning of the moai cult, the people replaced it with a
``birdman'' cult. A warrior from each tribe would meet at the
ceremonial site of Orongo on a cliff overlooking tiny offshore
islands. The young warriors would race out to the outermost island
to bring back the first egg of the nesting season from the sooty
terns. The winner, according to a tradition that existed into the
last century, became the birdman and the island's ruler for the
next year, an incarnation of Makemake, the culture's creator god
who was born in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the culture is usually attributed to a
combination of overpopulation, overuse of the land, and the cutting
of all trees for firewood and log rollers for moving the statues.
Dr. William S. Ayres, an archeologist at the University of Oregon
who has studied the island agriculture, has found evidence that
many of the large fields were abandoned in the 1600s and the people
increasingly had to subsist on the produce of small household
gardens. Their numbers diminished.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the struggle to live on an island denuded of
vegetation, Ayres said, one of his graduate students, Joan Wozniak,
looked under the rocky landscape and detected evidence that the
people had resorted to a kind of lithic mulch gardening. They used
rocks as mulch to keep moisture in the soil. Under the rocks, she
found a thoroughly mixed soil typical of intensive gardening and
traces of rotted tubers, even part of an ancient hoe.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ayres and Dr. Van Tilburg think that the people may not
have been entirely to blame for the culture's sad decline. Storms
and cyclical climate changes could have had a hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong possibility that an isolated island like that
could have been at the mercy of nature, with no help in reach,''
Dr. Van Tilburg said. ``It's one of the biggest mysteries of the
island, and we haven't begun to investigate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of the island's monuments was begun in the 1960s
primarily by Ayres and Dr. William Mulloy of the University of
Wyoming, who had been a member of the Heyerdahl expedition. Several
of the toppled statues were put back on their stone platforms,
called ahu, and the stone dwellings were reconstructed at Orongo.
</P>
<P>
   In the most ambitious project, Dr. Claudio Cristino, a Chilean
archeologist, directed the restoration of the 15 imposing moais at
Tongariki, completed in 1994. A Japanese company provided a crane
for lifting the heavy stones into place.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESENT
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO PRESERVE, AND SAVE, A CULTURE
</P>
<P>
   While some restorations continue, much of the concern has now
shifted to preservation of the monuments and the culture itself.
The island has revived from the Peruvian slave raids and disease in
the late 19th century that almost wiped out the culture, leaving
only 111 people in 1877. ``We were almost extinct,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   The people face a new threat because of the island's new-found
prominence. The signs of increasing tourism abound in Hanga Roa,
the only town, inviting visitors into auto-rental agencies, small
hotels, curio shops, a pizza parlor, and a disco. Few children are
learning the Rapa Nui language, threatening it with extinction in a
generation or two.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the changes, many of the island's 2,000 people are
demanding that Chile grant them more control of their affairs, the
land, and the archeological sites. Their demands for autonomy are
boldly displayed on a large sign outside the Roman Catholic church
here. Inside, the celebration of Mass reflects merging cultures.
The service follows the familiar Christian ritual, but the guitars,
drums and lilting voices in song echo the sounds of Polynesia. At
the altar, the statue of a saint is carved in the traditional
elongated style of the moai.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying not only to preserve but to rescue the Rapa Nui
culture,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially concerned for the moais. They and the entire
island have been declared a world heritage site by Unesco. The most
prominent statues are in the national park, which encompasses 40
percent of the land. Still, they are endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most immediate problem is to conserve these statues from
people and cattle,'' Ramirez said, referring to increased tourist
traffic and free-ranging livestock.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the Chilean government to enact a strict management
plan for the park and estimates it would take at least $1 million
to develop trails and facilities for visitors to the sites. When an
international group of scientists visited here last month, Ramirez
appealed to them for assistance in calling world attention to the
island's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres, the Oregon archeologist, said the Chileans had generally
done a good job managing the archeological treasures. ``But they
have limited funds,'' he added. ``Such a remarkable achievement by
the Easter Island culture is of interest and importance to the
whole world, and should be treated accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Van Tilburg said that in her years of work on the island she
has seen the weathering effects on the statues. ``All of us must
find a way to preserve the statues, if not all of them, at least
some,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Dr. Van Tilburg has produced 5,000 detailed
drawings and measurements of what the statues look like as the most
complete documentation of the mystery of Easter Island and a legacy
to future archeologists who will surely still be puzzling over the
fate of a people who once lived alone in the vast emptiness of the
sea.

   If barbecues are your dieting downfall, take a notebook along
with the potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   Self-monitoring _ systematically recording your every bite _ has
long been established as a useful technique in weight loss. To find
out how effective it is, two researchers decided to test it in the
toughest time of the year, the year-end holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the July issue of the journal Health Psychology,
Raymond Baker of OSF-St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Ill.,
and Daniel S. Kirschenbaum of the Center for Behavioral Medicine in
Chicago reported following 38 subjects _ mostly women in a
long-term behavioral program for treatment of obesity _ through 10
weeks that included Thanksgiving to New Year's feasts.
</P>
<P>
   Before the study period, the participants had lost an average of
21 pounds over 50 weeks. After that, things went downhill for
almost everybody: Three-quarters of the dieters gained weight
during holiday weeks. The only exceptions were the 25 percent who
were identified as the most rigorous self-monitors, those keeping
track of just about every crumb, who actually lost additional
weight at holiday time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take nearly perfect self-monitoring to buffer the
effects of certain high-risk situational challenges,'' the authors
wrote. _ JOHN O'NEIL
</P>
<P>
   Kids and Smoking
</P>
<P>
   Every day as many as 3,000 youngsters begin smoking, with the
average teen smoker picking up the habit at age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics like these have proved alarming to researchers who,
writing in an upcoming issue of the journal Health Education and
Behavior, called for anti-smoking programs to begin ``at least as
early as primary grades and to target the influence of parental
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine Jackson and her colleagues at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, looked at smoking in 401 students
while they were in fifth, sixth and seventh grades. More than half
had tried smoking by seventh grade, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with children who never smoked, those who did were more
likely to have a parent who smoked, have best friends who smoked,
believe cigarettes were easily available, and doubt that their
parents monitored their smoking or would punish them for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interventions need to focus as much on countering the
influence of parent smoking as on countering the influence of peer
smoking,'' Dr. Jackson said. _ LINDA VILLAROSA

 &HT;    New Yorker delivers on poet Dickey
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the New Yorker ($3), a fascinating excerpt from Christopher
Dickey's upcoming memoir, ``Summer of Deliverance,'' eloquently
describes the troubled relationship with his famous father, James
Dickey, and their eventual reconciliation. The poet promoted
himself as a two-fisted intellectual who excelled in sports, combat
and literature. In reality, his son writes, he was a weaver of
lies, an alcoholic and a tyrant. The turning point in the family's
life was the summer that ``Deliverance'' was filmed in North
Georgia, says Dickey, now a Newsweek foreign correspondent. ``And
after that nothing good was the same.'' Dickey recounts the tension
on the set between his father and the actors. In the end, it was a
battle of egos between Dickey and Burt Reynolds, and Reynolds won.
Dickey was asked to stay off the set.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL ADMIRER: So much for sexual harassment. In a
Mirabella ($3) essay, a former Time correspondent confesses that
she was ``quite willing to let myself be ravished'' by President
Clinton after an encounter on Air Force One. Nina Burleigh
describes her experience during a game of hearts with Clinton and
aide Bruce Lindsey last year. ``The president's foot lightly, and
presumably accidentally, brushed mine once under the table,''
Burleigh writes. ``His hand touched my wrist while he was dealing
the cards. When I got up and shook his hand at the end of the game,
his eyes wandered over to my bike-wrecked, naked legs. And slowly
it dawned on me as I walked away: He found me attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh, now a New York free-lance journalist, said she did not
feel harassed or pressured by the president. ``If he had asked me
to continue the game of hearts back in his room at the Jasper
Holiday Inn, I would have been happy to go there and see what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG ONE: This summer, World War II is coming to a theater
near you. The big movie, of course, is Steven Spielberg's ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' but six other films are also in the works,
including Terrence Malick's version of James Jones' ``The Thin Red
Line.'' In its cover package, ``War Is Hell,'' Newsweek ($2.95)
explores how ``Saving Private Ryan'' will change the image of World
War II commonly depicted in John Wayne patriotic films. In
Spielberg's film, as in war, says one of the men who fought at
Normandy, ``good guys get killed, too.''
</P>
<P>
   UNHEALTHY PLANS: Managed care was once touted as the cure-all
for the nation's health insurance ills. Now, says Time ($2.95),
after five years of horror stories and the refusal of some HMOs to
pay for Viagra, Americans are pressuring politicians to come up
with new plans. Time correspondent Karen Tumulty looks at proposals
by Democrats and Republicans. In a more lighthearted article, Time
visits America's secret capitals, including Dalton, Ga. (the carpet
capital) and Albertville, Ala. (the fire hydrant capital).
</P>
<P>
   UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT: Greedy players, fickle owners and the
increased commercialization of sports are taking its toll on fan
loyalty, says U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95). No one expects
die-hard fans to quit watching, but there are signs of a shifting
allegiance away from big-money sports. Minor-league baseball, for
example, has the highest attendance levels since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   TRAILER TRASH: Have you noticed that movie trailers seem to show
more about the film than you want to know? Well, it's not your
imagination. Entertainment Weekly ($2.95) explains why audiences
are becoming increasingly irate at previews that reveal too many
surprises. ``Everything is quick cut a la MTV,'' says trailer maker
Gary Kanew. ``Because of this rat-a-tat-tat formula, trailers show
more.''

 &HT;    A brief look at the life of Roy Rogers
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Rogers
</P>
<P>
   1911 - 1998
</P>
<P>
   -- Born: Leonard Slye, Nov. 5, 1911 in Cincinnati. Legend has it
his home stood where second base at Riverfront Stadium now rests.
</P>
<P>
   -- Early days: After the Depression forced the family to move to
California in 1930, Rogers worked as a peach picker and a truck
driver. In the mid-30's, he formed the cowboy singing group the
Pioneer Trio, renamed Sons of the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Music: The trio, fronted by Rogers' distinctive yodel,
scored hits with ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' and ``Cool Water.'' He is
generally considered one of America's best cowboy singers, but his
musical career quickly became overshadowed by his film and
television work.
</P>
<P>
   -- His movies: Rogers made more than 30 films, including
``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' (1935), ``Under Western Stars'' (1936),
``King of the Cowboys'' (1943), ``The Cowboy and Senorita'' (1944),
``The Yellow Rose of Texas'' (1944), ``My Pal Trigger'' (1946)
</P>
<P>
   -- Family: Rogers married his film co-star, Dale Evans in 1947,
fourteen months after his first wife, Arlene, died. They had nine
children _ two by Roy's previous marriage, one by Dale's, one of
their own, four by adoption and one by foster parenthood. Their
only biological child, Robin, was born retarded and died shortly
before her second birthday in 1952. Dale wrote a book about the
experience, called ``Angel Unaware,'' which became a bestseller.
Rogers is survived by Evans, five children, 15 grandchildren and 33
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   -- What About Trigger?: Rogers's horse Trigger appeared in all
his films and TV shows. Trigger died in 1965, at age 33. He was
stuffed and remained a fixture at Rogers' museum in Apple Valley.
</P>
<P>
   -- Honors: In 1988, Rogers was elected to the Country Music Hall
of Fame. In 1991, he participated in the recording of ``Tribute,''
a CD honoring his music from stars such as Clint Black, Lorrie
Morgan and Riders in the Sky.

 &HT;    History of Roy Rogers on big and small screens
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROY ROGERS ON TV ...
</P>
<P>
   American Movie Classics is saddling up two Roy Rogers programs
for Wednesday night. The documentary ``Roy Rogers: King of the
Cowboys'' will air at 6:30 p.m. EDT followed at 7:30 p.m. EDT by
the 1950 film ``Trail of Robin Hood,'' in which Rogers and other
Western stars (including Rex Allen and Monte Hale) help Jack Holt
(playing himself) get Christmas trees to needy families in time for
the holidays. Both shows repeat starting at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ... AND HIS SMALL-SCREEN LEGACY
</P>
<P>
   From 1951-57, Rogers produced 101 episodes of ``The Roy Rogers
Show,'' an early forerunner of TV's great Western era. The show
featured Rogers and Dale Evans as themselves in modern-day Western
stories. Rogers, of course, rode Trigger and Evans rode Buttermilk.
Their sidekick Pat Brady drove a Jeep they called Nellybelle. And,
not to be forgotten, was Bullet, a fast-on-his-paws German
shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Evans later starred in ``The Roy Rogers and Dale
Evans Show'' (1962-63), a variety series also featuring the Sons of
the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable early TV Westerns in the Rogers' vein included:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Lone Ranger'' (1949-57): Clayton Moore and John Hart
played the masked hero, created for radio in 1933, with the late
Jay Silverheels as sidekick Tonto. Their theme song: Rossini's
``William Tell Overture.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Hopalong Cassidy'' (1949-51): William Boyd, who died in
1972, played the black-clad good guy (he rode a white horse) and
edited some of his 66 movies into 30- and 60-minute TV shows. Some
52 new episodes were made for the final TV season.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Gene Autry Show'' (1950-56): Autry is the great movie
cowboy who rode his horse Champion on this series for six years,
singing ``Back in the Saddle Again'' and seeing pal Pat Buttram get
into silly situations.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Annie Oakley'' (1953-56): Autrey discovered Gail Davis and
cast her as the sharp-shooting rancher. She did most of her own
stunt work, including hanging off her running horse Target while
demonstrating her shooting prowress. Davis died in 1997 of cancer
in California.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Sky King'' (1953-54): Kirby Grant played Schuyler J. King,
owner of the Flying Crown Ranch and pilot of a twin Cessna dubbed
The Songbird. He used to plane to rescue the meek and seek out
evildoers.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin'' (1954-59). Call him the
testosterone Lassie. On this show, the German shepherd Rin Tin Tin
and his human pal Rusty (Lee Aaker), were sole survivors of an
Indian raid taken in by the 101st Cavalry. Rusty was commissioned a
corporal; Rin Tin Tin was made a private.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, ``Gunsmoke'' debuted. And the Western lore introduced
to the small screen by Rogers, Evans and others really took off.
Over the next four years, audiences were introduced to ``The Life
and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' with Hugh O'Brien, ``Zane Grey Theater''
with Dick Powell, ``Wagon Train,'' ``Have Gun Will Travel,''
``Cheyenne,'' ``Rawhide,'' ``Sugarfoot,'' ``Maverick,'' ``The
Restless Gun,'' ``The Texan,'' ``Wanted: Dead or Alive,'' ``Tales
of Wells Fargo'' and, of course, ``Bonanza.''

ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN MERELY ...
BOOKSTORE CLERKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In New York City, they wait tables.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, they tend bar.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, N.Y., they sell books.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a monologue along with your purchase at a bookstore
here, don't be alarmed. Alas, poor Yorick, it's just another
aspiring actor.
</P>
<P>
   And if these thespians-turned-booksellers in their 20s and 30s
happen to be developing a character during play rehearsals, beware.
It could be a three-act ordeal at the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to be an actress if you're trying to sell a book you
don't really like,'' said Kathleen Carey, manager of the children's
section, Little Book House, at Book House. ``Being able to play a
role went a long way when I was just starting out at Waldenbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey, who has a degree in elementary education, recently
shuttled to New York City to perform an experimental theater work,
``Bruised Reeds,'' in a SoHo art gallery. She's been squeezing in
roles since graduating from high school. At the same time, she
started working in bookstores and the two jobs have complemented
each other ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all flirt with the idea of trying to make a living
as an actor, but I'm happy working in a bookstore and juggling work
with acting,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sense of shared lunacy among the hard-core theater
corps at bookstores. They've been there, done that. They run lines
together. Discuss insights into characters. Trade bad puns. Traffic
in insider analogies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this typical theater person's sense of humor,'' said
David M. Girard, formerly of Lauriat's Bookstore by way of Barnes &AMP;
Noble and B. Dalton. ``Our jokes are very dry and cynical, a little
sick. We like trying out characters. Then another person works off
that. It's like an improv scene. It keeps things interesting at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Girard now works at Dorian Group Ltd., a classical recording
company in nearby Troy. He said he missed the theatricality of
Lauriat's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I switch dialects a lot at work,'' said Amanda Ennis,
assistant manager of Lauriat's Bookstore at Crossgates Mall here.
``I was raised in Alabama, so I do a Southern drawl. But I also let
the `Fargo' lady from Minnesota dialect slip out. It's a
minute-to-minute situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ennis' boss lends an empathetic ear. That's because he's
infected with the stage bug, too. ``If someone gets cast, we help
each other out and switch schedules so that person can rehearse,''
said Patrick White, manager at Lauriat's, where the staff has done
play readings and Ennis' window displays look like stage sets.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not register as a dramatic development, this bit of
regional quirkiness can be seen in the ever-shifting schedules of
bookstore employees, especially at actor-saturated Lauriat's. They
need time off to audition, to rehearse and to perform. Those not
currently in a production pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   White was drawn to the stage from the written word. He was
inspired to begin acting as a high school student after reading the
plays of Tennessee Williams and Sam Shepard. He's been a voracious
reader of drama ever since. His job feeds the habit. ``Working in a
bookstore is like being a kid in a candy shop for me,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Albany Civic Theater production of Terrence McNally's
``Love! Valour! Compassion!'' could have passed as a bookseller's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the Albany Civic Theater show, Girard was cast as Bobby
Brahms, the lover of dancer Gregory Mitchell, played by White.
Carey was assistant director for the show and acted as a stand-in
for a performance after White broke his toe and was detained at a
hospital emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you could say the Albany theater community is very
small,'' said John A. Nickles, another member of the Lauriat's
staff and an actor in local community theater. ``The nice thing is
that our manager (White) is a theater person and he'll work around
our rehearsal schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles started acting as a youngster. He pursued playwriting at
Purdue University, where he got a master's degree in English
literature and wrote a play called ``Judas'' that was given a
showcase performance at the Albany Civic Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles' mall job produced an unexpected collaboration. Warren
Raboy, who works at a deli in Crossgates, has written a play,
``Scenes From A Wicked World,'' that Nickles hopes to direct in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   White, who graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts
in New York City, spent several years acting in showcase
productions and auditioning in the city for stage and film parts.
His success was modest, although recurring roles in soap operas
earned him union memberships in Screen Actors Guild and Actor's
Equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoided waiting tables in New York as long as I could,''
White said. He worked as an overnight bellhop at the
Waldorf-Astoria for a time. Eventually, White took a job as a
waiter at Hamburger Harry's near Times Square and was in the
company of many theater people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, you wait tables for the tips because rents are
high and you can't support yourself in a job like a bookstore,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   When he moved back to Albany in 1994, White waited tables before
he took his father's advice and applied for a bookstore job. He
joined the staff of Lauriat's, eventually getting promoted to
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked reading and hanging out in bookstores and my
dad said it would be a perfect job for me,'' White said. ``The
bookstore is a great place to research characters. You're always
around people, too, so you can pick up on a lot of stuff you can
use in roles.''
</P>
<P>
   All the world's a stage. It just happens to be arranged in
narrow aisles that are lined with shelves of books for these
dramatis personae.

 &HT;    Mutual fund titans on way to help investors
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mutual fund pioneer John C. Bogle Sr. will headline an
investment and personal finance conference Sept. 26 sponsored by
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group and originator of the first
index mutual fund, will join other money managers and experts to
show 5,000 members of the public how to improve their financial and
investing skills.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper and the Georgia Society of the Institute of
Certified Financial Planners are partners in providing a full day
of hands-on seminars on topics ranging from family finances to
advanced investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conference will give our readers dynamic and robust
presentations of trends and opportunities from very savvy people
who are almost never available to the public in one place, at one
time,'' said Roger Kintzel, publisher of the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Other headliners include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Don Phillips, the 36-year-old chief executive officer and
president of Morningstar. The Chicago firm is a major tracker and
analyst of mutual funds. Phillips has made a name with his
outspoken criticism of funds that skimp on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Phillips and Bogle were ranked among the four most
powerful people in the mutual fund industry by Smart Money, a
personal finance magazine published by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nationally syndicated columnist Kathy Kristof, author of
``Kathy Kristof's Complete Book of Dollars and Sense,'' a personal
finance guidebook. She writes frequently for these and other
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Donald Ratajczak, the nationally respected economist and
forecaster who heads the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique opportunity for Atlantans to learn from some
of the best minds, both locally and nationally,'' said Michael
Smith, the president of the Georgia group of certified financial
planners.
</P>
<P>
   The conference will be held in the Georgia World Congress
Center. Attendance will be limited to 5,000. You can register for
the conference by calling 404-653-0419. For more information, visit
our Web site: http://www.accessatlanta
</P>
<P>
   .com/business/money&AMP;more/
</P>
<P>
   Seminars will cover 20 topics dealing with investment tools and
strategies, retirement and family-oriented financial topics.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of investment strategies, for example, there will be
sessions on building sturdy portfolios in an uncertain market,
tax-efficient investing, global investing and techniques for
picking hometown investments.
</P>
<P>
   Also, an exhibit hall will be staffed by financial service
companies and by nonprofit organizations. An ``Ask the Adviser''
room, where attendees can discuss individual issues with certified
financial planners, also will be open all day.

 &HT;    Asia is still muddying the waters when it comes to profit
outlook
 &HT;    By Tom Walke--
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asia's worsening economic situation guarantees U.S. corporate
profit growth will suffer well into the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, will affect Wall Street, since earnings growth is
regarded by analysts as the prime mover of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the impact isn't clear, but First Call, which
tracks analysts' earnings estimates, counts a ``greater than
normal'' number of advance announcements from companies on
second-quarter expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A greater percentage'' than usual have been negative,
according to First Call Research Director Charles ``Chuck'' Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's worrisome, coupled as it is with an acceleration of
downward revisions in the last couple of weeks of the quarter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell if the April-June quarter will be a
carbon copy of the first. But Hill said the consensus forecast is
for year-over-year growth of 3.2 percent. The first quarter showed
a 3.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, first-quarter profit growth has been as high as
15.1 percent (1997) and 23.3 percent (1995).
</P>
<P>
   The drop in demand from Asian markets and the restraining
effects of a surging dollar are already hurting companies with
operations there, as well as exporters who count on foreign buyers
for a large share of sales and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a record-setting increase in inventory buildup of
$105.7 billion in the robust first quarter put more pressure on
companies.
</P>
<P>
   They must now find a way to sell all those goods stored in
warehouses and on store shelves in the face of falling import
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's problems have created a two-tier market for U.S.
investors: those stocks directly affected, and those immune to
Asia's problems or that benefit from side effects such as low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Cases in point include Coca-Cola, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
Merrill Lynch analysts trimmed second-quarter estimates for the
beverage company and its ratings for the two computer firms because
of the changes in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Other casualties that will suffer from Asian market weakness
include producers of heavy machinery, and of basic materials such
as chemicals, paper, steel and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, banks and insurance companies generally have
benefited from the decline of U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions are some money center banks such as Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan, big creditors to Asian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners include retailers, benefiting from cheaper Asian
products, and travel-related businesses such as luxury hotels and
airlines. Home building also has been stimulated by falling
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is a ``wild card,'' according to Hill. It could go either
way depending on the price, which fell to as low as $12 a barrel in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At those prices, oil companies cut back, drying up business for
the drillers and equipment providers, and crimping earnings growth.

 &HT;    WORLDS APART: Japan will have big hand in shaping Wall Street's
fortunes
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Asian miracle'' is suddenly less miraculous, if not
downright threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Japan _ in recession _ and the rest of Asia _ in some cases in
worse shape _ will have a big say in how much the U.S. economy
weakens in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   That means Asia will help decide which way the U.S. stock market
goes: up, down or sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is expected to be affected, too, but not as seriously. In
fact, some analysts believe European growth will surpass that of
the United States by as early as the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say right now that Europe is the ld Ratajczak.
</P>
<P>
   That represents products not sold, sales not gained and profits
not earned by U.S. manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   At Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, economist David A. Wyss said he
expects Asia ``will subtract about half a percentage point from
real GDP (gross domestic product) growth in both 1998 and 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strong headwind for the U.S. economy to fight
against, but it is not insurmountable,'' Wyss added.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact from Asia won't be known for months, but some
early returns are in:
</P>
<P>
   -- Orders for big-ticket U.S.-made durable goods dropped 2.6
percent in May, the biggest decline in five months, as the Asian
crisis hit home.
</P>
<P>
   -- The strong dollar hurts exports and stimulates imports,
fueling record U.S. trade deficits of $13.2 billion in March and
$14.5 billion in April.
</P>
<P>
   -- U.S. exports declined 3 percent in the first quarter as
shipments to the Pacific Rim weakened, the biggest drop since the
third quarter of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   -- On the plus side, the deflationary impact of Asian imports is
thought by some analysts to have been a factor in the Federal
Reserve's decision not to raise short-term interest rates this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's role in the Far East explains why tns have put constant
pressure on that nation's government to reform its economy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the falling yen
reflects economic weakness ``and can only be remedied by restoring
economic strength to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the solution to Japan's problems won't be easy
or quick. The Japanese economy shrank 1.3 percent in the first
quarter, putting it in its second recession in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Japan took several steps. The government announced a
plan to deal with its banking crisis, and officials indicated they
are ready to use a permanent tax cut to help boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still uncertain, even assuming Asia's full cooperation in rescue
efforts, is how much the financial crisis will hurt the U.S.
economy. Most analysts look for it to restrain, but not stop the
U.S. economy in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this year at a spectacular (5.4 percent) growth
rate in the first quarter. We may be lucky to be growing at 1
percent or 1.5 per16.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite 20.7
percent _ increases some forecasters thought would represent gains
for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those gains were in the first quarter. Since then,
the major stock averages have experienced corrections as modest as
5 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 averages, but 10 percent to 12 percent for technology
and smaller stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections occurred because the market could not withstand
a renewed barrage of earnings warnings and bad news from Asia,
accompanied by a sharp rise in the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most mainstream analysts regard the chances of a bear
market _ a decline of 20 percent _ as minimal at best.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario for most analysts is another correction
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Robbins, market strategist for Robinson-Humphrey in
Atlanta, assigns ``a below average probability'' to a correction of
as much as 11 percent. He continues to stand by his mid-April
forecast that the Dow has a 50-50 chance of reaching 9,875 this
year. That would be 923 points above the Dow's second-quarter
close.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, one of the most
accurate forecasters of recent years, has reiterated her bullish
outlook based on the strength of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   She said there are important forces that offset the effects of
Asian's problems on the United States. For the most part, she
contends weak growth in Asia is a ``moderate negative'' for U.S.
economic growth and for corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's look for ``a flat second half,
then modest gains in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forecast is that the S&AMP;P 500 index will end 1998 around
the current level, then work its way modestly higher in the first
half of next year,'' said Vice President Arnold Kaufman.

WHAT DOES A FEMALE REALLY WANT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movie posters for ``Godzilla'' read: ``Size does matter.''
Hey, wipe the scales from your eyes, you overstuffed iguana! Size
is not the point: points are the point. Titillators and claspers
are the point. So are hooks, knobs and grooves, cerci, epiprocts
and paraprocts. How about something that unfolds blade by blade,
like a Swiss Army knife _ or the phallus of a male oriental
cockroach? If big is the best you can do, darling 'Zilla, no wonder
you've been a box office snore.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the phylogenetic scale, in all creatures where a
female's eggs are fertilized internally, the male's phallus must
perform pretty much the same task: penetration and ejaculation.
Yet, as comparative biologists have found, the penis and its
accessory parts are often far more complex and embellished than
utilitarian design would seem to require. The organ of the male cat
is stippled with spines, that of some male monkeys is flanged as
though with wings, while the human penis has its foreskin and the
distinctive bulbed glans beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Among insects, male reproductive organs differ so dramatically
from one species to another that entomologists rely on the
particulars of the cerci, epiprocts and other bits of arthropod
genitalia to distinguish between species that otherwise look alike.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long debated the reasons for such ornateness of
penile shape, or morphology. By one prevailing theory, male organs
are diversely proportioned for much the same reason that keys are:
to keep strangers out of the house. In this scenario, the male
penis serves as a barrier against cross-copulations between members
of two different species, an act that would either be a sterile
waste of reproductive energy, or would result in the birth of
genetically weak offspring. Thus, the males of a species must all
have uniquely shaped keys to match the genital locks of their
corresponding females. Charles Darwin himself believed that the
evolution of reproductive organs was driven by such practical
concerns as the maintenance of species purity.
</P>
<P>
   But now a researcher from Sweden has published results strongly
suggesting that here, at least, the great man was wrong. In a
detailed study of insect genitalia and its association with insect
sexual practices, Goran Arnqvist of the University of Umea offers
evidence supporting another theory for the divine absurdity of
phallic diversity. His results, which appear in the current issue
of the journal Nature, indicate that male reproductive organs are
the pelvic equivalent of peacock feathers _ the fruit of sexual
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual selection stands with natural selection as a mighty
engine of evolutionary change. But while natural selection favors
practical traits that help an animal survive in its habitat, like a
fur coat to weather winter or a long tongue to pick out ants from
an anthill, sexual selection favors traits that, for whatever
reason, lend a male an advantage in the harsh competition for
access to a female's eggs. The most familiar example of sexual
selection in action is the peacock's gorgeous, awkward plumage,
which does nothing to help the bird escape a predator, but which
does plenty to attract a peahen's eye and persuade her, ``Mate with
me, not with that drip over there.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arnqvist demonstrates in his new report, the hand of sexual
selection does not stop at molding the properties necessary for
attraction and courtship. Because females of many species mate with
multiple partners, he says, it is not enough that a male have the
wherewithal to solicit a copulation. He must also possess features
that keep his sperm in the race once mating has occurred. And what
better way to fight the spermic fight than through modifications of
the vehicle that delivers it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Darwin saw sexual selection as the force whereby
certain males are more attractive to females than are other males,
and so they gain more matings, leading to the evolution of things
like bright plumage,'' Arnqvist said in a telephone interview.
``The thing that Darwin did not realize, but that has become
apparent to us in recent years, is that sexual selection can
operate in different way, not just on the level of mating, but on
the level of fertilization as well. That's where the variance in
genital morphology comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnqvist proposes that nearly every fillip, flange and blade
somehow plays a role in assuring its owner's fertilization success.
He proved his thesis by comparing two groups of closely related
insects that differed in their mating systems. One group consisted
of species that were polyandrous, in which the female copulates
with many males, while the other was of species that were
monandrous, in which the female mates only once in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering the right mix of representative insects was a grueling
task, not the least difficulty being that monandry is rare among
insects, as it is elsewhere in the animal kingdom. ``It was a huge
amount of work finding good examples,'' Arnqvist said. ``I talked
with hundreds of researchers all over the world and read I don't
know how many thousands of papers.'' Eventually, he managed to find
species from four different insect orders: mayflies; butterflies
and moths; flies and mosquitoes, and beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Arnqvist then worked with detailed illustrations of the male
genitalia of his exemplary species. That information, at least, was
comparatively easy to find, thanks to the historic importance of
male genitals to standard insect taxonomy research. Using a new and
rigorous method for assessing structural complexity called
geometric morphometrics, he then gauged the genital complexity of
his various species at 19 different contrast points. He asked how
different those traits were from one species to the next. He also
measured and analyzed other body parts, like wings and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Arnqvist reasoned that if the lock-and-key hypothesis of genital
morphology was true, then there should be more variation in genital
shapes among the monandrous group of species than among the
polygamous ones: if a female only has one shot at mating, and if it
is essential that she finds just the right species key for that
event, then the pressure would be on to vary the phallic details in
no uncertain terms between two closely related species.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, sexual selection is what drives genital
diversity, then the variety would be greatest among those species
where the females philander, and the males must perpetually evolve
new and improved genital ploys to prevail in the post-mating
contest.
</P>
<P>
   The results were startlingly clear-cut. In his group of
polyandrous species, the genitals of the males were more than twice
as divergent as they were among related species where females mate
only once. For 18 out of 19 of the contrast points, he said, the
male genitals of the polyandrous group displayed greater
variability than they did in the monandrous group. At the same
time, the other, nonsexual body parts he analyzed showed little or
no variability between a closely related pair of, say, moths or
fruit flies. Hence the variability of the insects in the
polyandrous group was specific, focused on the region where the
force of sexual selection might be expected to work with greatest
monomania _ viz., below the belt.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But what are all these parts and bits doing to give a male a
reproductive leg up, as it were? In a few examples, the function of
a genital detail is easy to see. The male damselfly, has little
brushes at the end of his penis that can scrape out from a female's
genital tract any contending sperm that got there first. Other
insects have hooks on their phalluses that clasp a struggling
female into position until the job is through. The spines of a
cat's penis are thought to act as titillators, which help
accelerate ovulation by stimulating the female's vaginal tract.
</P>
<P>
   For most genital structures, though, the purpose can only be
guessed at. Some components may convey promotional information
about the male's merits _ his size, health and vigor. Still others
may have arisen arbitrarily, the consequence of female taste for
novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't always have to be a reason for female choice,
but once it starts, once this component of male genitalia has been
preferred over that one, it can have a runaway effect on
evolution,'' said Darryl T. Gwynne of the University of Toronto in
Mississauga, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new
report.
</P>
<P>
   Arnqvist's report offers the most rigorous evidence yet that
sexual selection explains the evolution of genital diversity in
insects, but other researchers think they see a similar mechanism
at work in an order closer to our hearts: the primates. Most
famously, they have noted that the testes of a chimpanzee are much
larger than those of the gorilla, even though a male gorilla has
maybe five times the body mass of a chimpanzee. That discrepancy is
thought to arise because female chimpanzees are promiscuous, while
female gorillas tend to mate solely with the silverback male in
whose harem they live. Thus, chimpanzee testicles must be large to
generate abundant quantities of competitive sperm. The male gorilla
has relatively less need for big testicles, and more need for big
body size, to give him the chance of fighting other males and
assuming haremship in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are humans immune to the competitive squeeze. Writing in
the journal Human Nature, Raven Rowanchilde of the department of
sociology at the University of Toronto, has speculated that sexual
selection explains the variety of penile modifications and
accouterments seen among different human societies. She proposes
that the men of many cultures alter their penises, in sometimes
painful fashion, to augment their appeal as mates.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia and New Guinea, a number of traditional peoples
practice subincision, in which a cut is made to the underside of
the penis that makes the organ look wider without, apparently,
affecting its capacity to perform. According to anthropologists who
study these groups, the women consider intercourse with a
subincised man to be superior to sex with a non-incised partner.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 cultures of Southeast Asia, men ritually insert objects
like bells, balls, pins, rings, or marbles made of ground shells
under the skin of the genitals. The To Saloe-maoge women of
Sulawesi may even demand to know the number of penile marbles a man
possesses before they will consider a proposal of marriage. The
Dyak men of Borneo use a palang, a smooth bar with rounded ends
made of bone or metal, to transect the head of the phallus; Dyak
women, according to anthropologists, say that sex without a palang
is like rice, ``but with it, it tastes like rice spiced with
salt.'' At which a squeamish Western fellow might be tempted to
sigh, ``Whatever happened to candlelight and romance?''

WB LAUNCHING `INVASION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Harve Bennett, who has Hollywood staying power to
rival anyone, began his show-business career in radio on a show
called ``Quiz Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the 66-year-old Emmy-Award-winning producer sees it, his
latest _ and most cutting-edge project _ is a return to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   As executive producer of ``Invasion America,'' a prime-time
animated/computer-generated drama, which premieres tonight on the
WB (KTLA, Channel 5), Bennett said that he feels as if he were back
in radio days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a radio director, but I grew up and radio
disappeared,'' Bennett said. ``In animation, it's like you are a
radio writer and director. It's an illustrated version of a radio
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The first season, or book as Bennett calls it, will air at 8
tonight as a 90-minute presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The series follows the life of teen-ager David Carter,
half-human, half from another planet (Tyrus) and his growth to
manhood while trying to protect himself from goons from his
father's planet. His father, Cale, meanwhile is trying to win back
his power on Tyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The finale will take Carter to his life's first plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of Book One,'' he said, ``he will have climbed a
foothill, but still has a mountain to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB network is extremely high on the series, which is also
executive-produced by Steven Spielberg. And, Bennett feels that the
story can sustain a five-year arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has to be a stopping point,'' he said. ``Sooner
or later you have to beat the bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who has been a network programmer and producer and
feature-film writer (most notably the ``Star Trek'' movies), has
found new ways to do audience research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his two ``uncredited creative consultants,''
(daughters Callie, 13, and Samantha, 9), he has found a wealth of
information from fans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered a world I was illiterate to, and that's the
cyberworld,'' he said. ``I have been running around to fully
understand that universe. When we did the `Star Trek' movies
throughout the '80s, there was a network called fanzines. They were
the same people, just doing it slower and through the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that he is enjoying his latest project, and in
addition to executive producer, he has compiled another impressive
title for his resume _ voice-over artist. Bennett supplies the
voice for the president of the United States in ``Invasion
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to cross the hall from the control room to the
recording studio to be with my fellow actors,'' he said. ``The
first time I did, they all sang `Hail to the Chief,' which makes a
man feel pretty tall.''

   AIRPORT-CARGO _ ATLANTA _ Hartsfield International Airport
officials are set to hand over the keys this month to the first
tenants in a major $34.5 million expansion of international air
cargo operations. Gateway Cargo Service will occupy the first of
three 104,000-square-foot buildings on the south side of the
airport. Two more buildings are under construction, and a fourth
will be bid out later. When the total project is completed, it will
add more than 400,000 square feet, doubling the current space of
352,000 square feet now operating on the north side of the runways.

   NEW-AIRPORT _ AUSTIN, Texas _ On a cool, windy day in late
October, a FedEx jumbo jet took off into the overcast Austin sky en
route to Japan, carrying only two human passengers. The rest of the
plane housed 80,000 pounds of food belonging to its exotic cargo _
156 Texas-bred ostriches. It marked the first time live cargo left
from an Austin airport, and the only time a local airport has had
enough room to land the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, one of FedEx's
largest airplanes. ``We could never have done anything like that at
(Robert Mueller Municipal Airport),'' said Jamy Kazanoff,

SCIENCE WATCH: GENE ORACLE HAS ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The book of evolution, as recorded in the genomes of living
things, is not a comprehensive history of life on earth, complete
with names, dates and places. It is more like an oracle, providing
rich but cryptic answers if asked the right questions.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask, for example, ``Where did malaria originate?'' By
analyzing the DNA of a particular gene in the various species of
malaria parasites that infect apes and monkeys, Ananias Escalante
and colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta have been able to draw up the gene's family tree.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the tree, marking the earliest ancestor of today's
malarial parasites, shows that malaria originated among the monkeys
of Africa, placing its center of origin in that continent and not
in Southeast Asia as is widely believed. The finding is reported in
the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more adventurous question, is ``Where is the site of
the original human population expansion from which the rest of the
globe was peopled?'' Two biologists at the University of Oxford in
England, David Reich and David Goldstein, posed that question and
got the same answer as to the first: Africa. By analyzing genetic
variations in aboriginal populations from throughout the world,
they found the marks of an early, pre-agricultural expansion only
among Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing their luck, they then asked, ``When did this population
expansion occur?'' But the great Delphic DNA oracle, perhaps
fearing the next question would be something quite impossible, like
``And just why were we expelled from the Garden of Eden?''
retreated into gnomic vagueness: Between 49,000 and 640,000 years
ago, it told them. Thanks, we knew that already.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists do not give up so easily. The next question put
to the oracle, also reported in the current Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, came at the Garden of Eden problem
from another direction. ``When did sex begin?'' was the poser from
a group led by Anna-Karin Fridolfsson of the Swedish University of
Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of the question is that the sex chromosomes, denoted X
and Y in humans and other mammals, are thought originally to have
been just like one another except that the Y carried the
sex-determining gene and the X did not. At first the two
chromosomes formed a twin-like pair, as do the other pairs of
chromosomes, which are known as autosomes (human cells have 22
pairs of autosomes and the X and Y pair). But in the course of
evolution the X and Y stopped exchanging genetic material with each
other, as the autosomes do at each generation, and thus followed
such different evolutionary paths that they can now be told apart
just by their shapes, an X and a Y.
</P>
<P>
   The sex mechanism in mammals is known to be extremely ancient _
so ancient, some biologists believed, that it might even have
predated the split between mammals and birds. If so, the sex
chromosomes of birds and of mammals should share a common
chromosomal ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Fridolfsson's team has found evidence that the sex chromosomes
of birds are indeed descended from an ancestral pair of autosomes.
But the pair was different from the autosomal pair that led to the
X and Y chromosomes in mammals. The evolution of the sex
chromosomes has thus occurred independently in birds and in
mammals.

YOUNG ADVENTURERS HEAD TO ECUADOR IN SEARCH OF INCAN TREASURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ David Ultan and Adam Ballachey were both 29,
struggling to launch careers as documentary filmmakers and working
as house painters when they got The Call.
</P>
<P>
   It was an invitation for the young Berkeley residents to drop
their paintbrushes and take up their cameras, to become cinematic
explorers in a quest that would bring 21st-century technology to
bear on 15th-century Ecuadorean legend, that would cross the paths
of Silicon Valley scientists with long-dead Incan kings and
treasure hunters looking for gold.
</P>
<P>
   Lots and lots of gold.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from Bill Kurtis, a television journalist and host
of ``The New Explorers'' on the A&AMP;E network. He had seen their
pitch for an hour-long segment called ``Search for Inca Gold,'' and
he liked it. So much so that he gave the green light without having
seen any footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill called, we were both on ladders with paintbrushes in
our hands,'' Ultan says. ``I had to lie: `Yes, I'm in my office.
...' We about fell off our ladders.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ballachey, it was the boost they needed: ``Suddenly, after
shopping this project around all this time, we were credentialed,
we were in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, after two reconnaissance trips to
Ecuador and floppy discs full of research, the two friends and
their scientific team are about to culminate work on the project,
one that will, at the very least, break ground in archaeology. And
one that could, given the best possible outcome, catapult them into
the history books.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, they will go to Quito and fly over the
Andes, carrying recently declassified ground-penetrating radar
developed by Dr. Roger Vickers at Stanford Research Institute. They
will attempt to find traces of the vanished Incan people _ and
their enormous caches of gold. It's a mystery that has lured
treasure hunters and archaeologists to the region, called the
Llanganati, for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-square-mile area of the Andes north of Quito is an
unforgiving land, where heavy rain, earthquakes and jagged cliffs
have claimed the lives of countless treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees on this: An Inca general familiar with this
area took this army and these tons of gold and disappeared,'' says
Ballachey. ``The question is: Did he go into these mountains, and
where did he hide the gold? The radar will be looking for evidence
of Inca infrastructure or pathways that could have led these 15,000
people into this remote area. If they find it, it will raise the
level of discussion to a whole new level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultan is anxious to get started. ``At the very least, it's a
good yarn and a great adventure,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ballachey and Ultan, friends since childhood, fellow
anthropology majors at California State University, are a study in
opposites. Ballachey, son of a judge, is sharp-witted. Fair and
mercurial, Ballachey is both photographer and journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Ultan is the son of an artist, a painter himself and the protege
of ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman. Dark and stocky, the
good-natured, bilingual Ultan is the team's negotiator and
organizer; he's nailed the delicate meetings required by the
Ecuadorean government before the expedition could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the task of convincing a developing country in a cold
war with its neighbors,'' Ballachey says wryly, ``that we should be
able to bring what amounts to a spy plane into the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultan nods: ``We had more than 100 meetings, with everyone from
the secretary of state on. They never asked us for a bribe, did
everything by the book. We now have a stack of papers giving us
permission. We just had to let them come along and promise to give
them our findings.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: any gold, or any evidence of the gold. This is not
a mission that will make millionaires of the team, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine, I get calls from treasure hunters all the
time who want to use my technology,'' says Vickers, 60, whose title
is director of the Geoscience and Engineering Center at the
Stanford Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have no interest in that. David was the first person to
approach me about a project where I could see that the treasure was
not the most important thing to them, but the archaeology.''
</P>
<P>
   The only wealth that might be generated from the trip will come
from demand for Ballachey and Ultan's documentary, should it record
some historic discovery; or from future treasure hunts, should this
one prove successful. (The team is forming a company for other
explorations.)

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1532, the Spanish conquistadors, led by Francisco Pizarro, a
54-year-old illiterate soldier, entered the lowlands of northern
Peru near Cajamarca, capital of the Incan empire. The empire was at
its peak, covering more than 2,500 miles and boasting beautiful
cities and temples filled with golden artifacts. The Incas, who
called themselves Children of the Sun, were led by the young
Emperor Atahualpa.
</P>
<P>
   With visions of gold, but only 183 soldiers compared with tens
of thousands in the Incan army, Pizarro knew treachery was the only
way to conquer. He asked to meet with Atahualpa, who welcomed him
with pomp and ceremony. Atahualpa was surprised by a vicious attack
on his unarmed attendants _ Pizarro himself pulled the emperor from
his gilded throne _ and thousands of Incas were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now a captive, Atahualpa offered as ransom storage rooms full of
gold and silver, and sent word to neighboring cities to collect the
booty. But after four months, with the ransom only partly
collected, the Spaniards murdered Atahualpa. When word of
Atahualpa's death reached the ends of the empire, the stream of
gold headed for Cajamarca was halted.
</P>
<P>
   One of Atahualpa's generals, named Ruminahui, fled into the
mountains north of Quito with 15,000 soldiers, taking along what
historical accounts estimate as ``70,000 man-loads'' of gold.
Although the pursuing Spaniards tortured and burned alive many
Incas, the gold's location was never revealed.
</P>
<P>
   And what's 70,000 man-loads of gold worth today? Ballachey and
Ultan look uncomfortable. ``That's between two and four, uh ...
billion dollars,'' Ultan stammers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think these mountains are full of treasure
hunters?'' Ballachey says. ``A lot of people think that's worth
dying for.''

Q&AMP;A: HIGH ON COFFEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is caffeine a stimulant?
</P>
<P>
   A. Caffeine is not a direct stimulant; instead, it blocks the
action of another chemical, naturally present in the human body,
that has a calming effect on the activity of cells, especially
those in the brain and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine, found in tea, coffee and cocoa, is one of a class of
chemicals called methylxanthines that temporarily occupy the same
cell receptors as adenosine, a chemical produced by the body's
energy metabolism. Adenosine is a neuromodulator, a substance that
normally acts as a brake on nerve cell activity by keeping cells
from staying excited too long. When adenosine's action is blocked
by caffeine, nerve cells are more active.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine enters the brain very rapidly and stays active for
several hours, but its effects drop off more quickly than those of
some other stimulants. The time needed for caffeine concentrations
in the bloodstream to drop by half is about three to six hours in a
healthy adult, as compared with about 10 hours for methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Navy scientists have studied caffeine's short-term stimulation
for possible use in military campaigns to counteract the effects of
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The Operational Clinical Research Center of the Naval Aerospace
Medical Research Laboratory reviewed the literature on the known
effects of caffeine and concluded that ``there is a consistent and
convincing scientific data that indicates the effectiveness of
caffeine in counteracting the increased sleepiness and decreased
alertness associated with sleep loss.''

RURAL RACONTEUR BAILEY WHITE SPINS HER FIRST NOVEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CAROL RUST 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Meeting Bailey White is like having a tall glass of
iced tea with a favorite cousin.
</P>
<P>
   You feel like as if you already know the author and National
Public Radio commentator. You know her mama and the reason her mama
kept a 1958 Porsche speedster parked on the front porch during the
last years of her life. You've heard her read a story about her
cousin Mandon, who lives in Virginia and dreams of one day
reuniting the family's collection of Chippendale chairs scattered
among relatives in a half-dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   You recall the day Uncle Jimbuddy cut off his finger and
couldn't find it in time for doctors to reattach it to his hand,
although it turned up later in a bucket of iced oysters that had
been sitting in his wood shop.
</P>
<P>
   You feel like you've walked the rows of White's garden and know
she planted 20 rose bushes two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You even know her polite dog, that, at least in the story,
refused to sleep in White's bed the night his owner saw ``Silence
of the Lambs'' because he'd been raised to stay off the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The unpretentious writer and schoolteacher-on-sabbatical who
lives in southwest Georgia expresses herself in such a personal,
homespun manner that readers cannot help but feel a pea-shelling
camaraderie with her.
</P>
<P>
   They're not surprised to learn that the wiry slip of a woman
travels on book tours with just two outfits so she doesn't have to
trust her luggage to the airlines, and that she's a bit intimidated
by snooty waiters in ritzy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   She's been reading her short essays about everyday Southern life
on NPR since 1991 in a crackly voice that conjures up an image of a
little old lady in a sunbonnet instead of a petite woman who has
bobbed brown hair and wears bluejeans and a long-sleeved,
white-cotton shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, ``Quite a Year for Plums'' (Knopf, $22), was
released in June. Her two previous books, ``Mama Makes Up Her
Mind'' (Vintage Books, $11) and ``Sleeping at the Starlite Motel''
(Vintage, $12), were anthologies of previously aired essays.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled together the first book, published in 1993, at the
suggestion of a friend. ``Sleeping at the Starlite Motel'' came two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of writing a novel was somewhat wilting, she said,
mostly because ``I had signed a contract to do the book and I was
worried that I'd said I'd do something I couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first book I ever wrote,'' she said. ``The other
books were just things I got out of my file folders. Everything had
already been read over the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Her darkly funny slice of Southern life knits together an odd
collection of humanity that features Roger, a plant pathologist who
lectures farmers about tomato spotted wilt virus, thrips and other
enemies of the peanut; and the local women, mostly schoolteachers,
who are preoccupied with his well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled into this group is a devoted collector of electric
desk fans; a maniacal printer committed to preserving near-extinct
typefaces; a wildlife artist who nearly smothers in the
black-and-white feathers of a pair of Dominique hens she's
painting; and a gawky ornithologist tracking the red cockaded
woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   Della, the wildlife artist, finds that the only way to alleviate
her ``painter's block'' with the Dominique hens is by discarding
household items at the dump. Most are accompanied by a personal
note, such as: ``This fan works but it makes a little clicking
sound and will not oscillate.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger is intrigued with the notes and the way Della carefully
places items at the dump, just in case someone else can use them.
Their odd romance is perfect for such odd characters.
</P>
<P>
   Is White happy with the reviews for ``Quite a Year for Plums?''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know. She doesn't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not reading any reviews, and I don't want you to tell
me,'' she said flatly. ``I told my friends, `Don't tell me if
they're good, and don't tell me if they're bad.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't make me write anything better or do anything
different,'' she said. ``I'd rather just not know.''
</P>
<P>
   White smiles tentatively and ducks her head in embarrassment
when presented with praise. She's used to readers feeling like they
know her, and she appreciates the attention, but she doesn't really
know what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to focus her attention on others. Everywhere she goes,
she is listening to what people have to say. She rarely uses a tape
recorder and takes notes only occasionally, when she wants to be
sure to get something right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a notebook with me that I scribble some things down on
sometimes, like in the bathroom at the airport the other day,'' she
said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Two women had just seen the movie ``The Horse Whisperer'' and
were talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them said, `I start to cry before the crying part even
gets there because I know it's coming.' I knew that feeling so
well. If you see a horse running in slow motion, you just feel the
tears well up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her trademark is documenting Southern eccentricities,
she doesn't believe they're unique to the South. ``I do not agree
that craziness runs in Southern families,'' she said. ``Families
everywhere are that way. I don't know why the South has gotten a
reputation for being that way unless it's that Southern writers
write about it and Northern writers don't as much. I see the same
thing everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White's characters orbit around themes of horticulture and
wildlife. She chose the first because that's what she happened to
be doing when she started the book two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I was interested in myself,'' she said. ``Right
about the time I started writing this book, I stopped teaching
school, which meant I had a whole lot more time. So I mainly did
two things: wrote this book and gardened. It was easy and natural
to write about people and gardens because I'm familiar with those
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Research topics for the book included desk fans, peanut
diseases, camellias and birds _ ``I nearly wore out a Peterson's
Guide,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   White, who has taught mostly first-graders for 21 years in
public schools, has a large garden instead of a family, she said.
She calls herself a ``spinster,'' shrugging off the word's negative
connotations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spinster is an unmarried woman, and that's what I am, an
unmarried woman,'' said White, who is in her mid-40s. ``I happen to
like the term.''
</P>
<P>
   First grade is her favorite, she said. ``That's before students
become so wise. And they go so far in that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In second and third grade, they know how to read _ they just
learn to read a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``In first grade, they come in and don't even know the alphabet,
and when they leave they can read. That's why it's an exciting
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also kind of frightening, because it's a huge
responsibility, and I've always worried they won't be ready for
second grade.''
</P>
<P>
   She's taken a two-year leave from teaching to write her book,
but wants to get back into the classroom. It has provided material
for her essays more than once.
</P>
<P>
   In the essay ``Maritime Disasters from Mama Makes Up Her Mind,''
for example, she writes about different methods of teaching
reading. During the years, she has taught her students more old sea
chanteys than stories about Dick and Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a man overboard or a good sinking ship, and I can
teach a half-witted gorilla to read,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she feels guilty about using the Titanic as source
material, as if she were desecrating a grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I remind myself that in my whole career the Titanic and I
will teach over a thousand children how to read _ close to the
number of people who lost their lives on that black night. Surely,
for the sake of literacy, the spirits of those poor souls will
forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   White's mother frequently starred in her comic essays and never
minded, White said. ``I think she considered herself a fictional
character.''
</P>
<P>
   She used bits and pieces of people she knows in real life to
fashion the characters in ``Quite a Year for Plums.''
</P>
<P>
   For Louise, who's convinced she's communicating with spacemen,
she used the personality trait of insanity contained in a single
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone specifically like that, but I've known
people who were crazy in spots. In most situations, they appear to
be totally normal people, but in one particularly area, they're
just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   White would like to write another novel, she said, but she wants
to keep it a secret until it's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great luxury would be to write a book without having a
contract,'' she said. ``The other scary thing is that they pay you
in advance, and you haven't done this work yet, and it paralyzed me
with worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What if I get some crippling disease and can't
write the book? I had to pay income tax on (the advance), and I
thought, `if I pay the income tax, I can't even give them the money
back,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her doubts, she continues writing because the
inspiration keeps presenting itself. She is keeping a log of her
book tour so the two-month jaunt won't be an anonymous whirlwind of
places and names when it's over in late July, she said. She keeps
from becoming exhausted by staying organized and limiting her
appearances. She rarely grants interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Fans feel as if they know her because of the personal subjects
she writes about, she said. She knows how they feel because she
does it herself, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that way about people I listen to on the radio, when I
meet them, I'm always surprised that they don't look right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind is such a strange thing. You can hear somebody and,
just without thinking, get ideas about how tall they are and what
color their hair is.
</P>
<P>

POWERBOOKS GIVE MACINTOSH CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest gathering of Apple Macintosh fans on the East Coast
begins Wednesday in New York, and they have several reasons to be
optimistic after more than a year of darkness and turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Led by co-founder Steve Jobs, Apple appears to have stabilized
its management team, cut costs, made some money, halted a
precipitous decline in market share, outlined (at last) a clear
path for its Mac operating system, and streamlined and
reinvigorated its product lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The company is not out of the woods yet, of course. Apple's
decision last year to kill the Macintosh clone market may have
boosted Apple's financial prospects, but it was of no benefit to
consumers and it contributed to the overall decline in market share
for the Macintosh operating system. (Even the Palm Pilot operating
system and Windows 3.1 outsold the Mac OS last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the most recent customer-loyalty survey by the research
group ZD Market Intelligence, which measures the percentage of
computer owners who say they would buy the same brand again,
determined that Apple had lost its perennial perch in first place.
Apple slid to third, behind Gateway and the surprisingly strong
Hewlett-Packard. Apple's decline was most pronounced in the
home-computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, having the third-highest level of customer satisfaction
among more than 200 computer companies is an admirable achievement.
Apple executives say the company has a plan to win back the
affection, and dollars, of the home and small-business market.
Perhaps their strategy will be revealed this week at the Macworld
conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best reasons for optimism among the Macintosh
faithful is the new Macintosh Powerbook G3, which comes in a
variety of configurations and prices ranging from $2,300 to more
than $6,000. Along with the Jetsons-style iMac that is to go on
sale next month, the Powerbook G3 is tangible evidence that Apple
has regained its flair as a leader in innovative computer design.
</P>
<P>
   Big and beautiful, the Powerbook G3 is perhaps the first
portable computer that warrants being called sensual. With its
not-so-subtle curves and a mixture of textures, including one that
feels vaguely like rubber and evokes flesh, the Macintosh Powerbook
G3 is the most distinctive notebook on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But visual and tactile appeal are not the Powerbook G3's only
strengths. It also has brains. In the case of the top models in the
new Powerbook G3 line there is enough processing power to persuade
some Macintosh users to consider it as a replacement for their
desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   Apple boasts that its Power PC G3 RISC-based notebooks will
outperform any Intel Pentium II-based notebooks, and many Pentium
desktop computers as well. Reviewers confirm that in most cases the
Powerbooks clobber the competition.
</P>
<P>
   We tested an upper-middle-of-the-line model, which was built
around a 250-MHz Power PC chip, a 13.3-inch active matrix XGA color
display, 32 megabytes of SDRAM memory, 4MB of special graphics
memory, a 4-gigabyte hard disk drive, removable CD-ROM and diskette
drives, a 56K internal modem, and a lithium-ion battery. It was
built in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   All of the new Powerbooks are substantially larger than the
earlier Powerbooks they replaced _ at least an inch deeper and
wider. (The new Powerbook G3 is not to be confused with Apple's old
Powerbook G3, which was smaller, less powerful and less
distinctively styled. Why Apple chose to recycle the name is one of
the company's many mysteries.) The weight, between 7.5 and 8 pounds
when fully tricked out, remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   The size and weight disqualify the Powerbook G3 as a good choice
for road warriors who plan to lug the computer around all day and
work while sitting in coach. (Is there such a thing as shoulder
tunnel syndrome?)
</P>
<P>
   It just will not fit on a standard airline fold-down tray. So
put a pillow on your lap and make it a true laptop, upgrade
yourself to first class _ if you can afford the $6,000 version, it
deserves to be shown off up front anyway _ or put the computer away
and relax.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Powerbook's formidable size means it is
more acceptable as a desktop-computer replacement. The keyboard is
quite nice, with good key touch and spacing. And then there is the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the dismal, 12.1-inch, passive-matrix screen of the
cheapest, 233-MHz Powerbook, unless your budget has no flexibility.
The larger screens of the Powerbook line, including the 13.3-inch
model we tested and the practically cinematic 14.1-inch model, are
very impressive and worth the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering a larger viewing area, they come with added
video memory and a graphics accelerator, and a superior resolution
of 1,024 by 768 pixels (XGA). Powerbooks with the larger screens
also have higher-resolution S-video output, which allows
computer-generated graphics to be sent to S-video-equipped TV sets,
VCRs and camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   The Powerbooks are most impressive at the high end of the line,
including the 250-MHz and 292-MHz models. Both of these have faster
internal data pathways (an 83-MHz system bus, in geek parlance) and
a further booster rocket called a 1MB backside cache, features that
are lacking on the slower Powerbook.
</P>
<P>
   But as strong as the new Powerbook G3 models are, they are
unlikely on their own merits to entice longtime Windows users to
convert to the superior Macintosh operating system. Apple could
score more points, and increase the chances of winning back
customers who have defected to the Microsoft monopoly, by including
Windows emulation software as standard equipment on its Powerbooks.
</P>
<P>
   So Apple now has a strong lineup on the top decks of its product
line, with its G3-based desktop and Powerbook machines. Now it
faces the tough challenge of winning back customers at the low end,
where it lacks compelling products. On Wednesday, Apple will begin
the campaign to promote the G3-based iMac, which the company calls
the most revolutionary Macintosh since, well, the Macintosh itself.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and strong thunderstorms will erupt Tuesday
near a warm front from the Great Lakes to the upper Ohio Valley as
sultry breezes from the south are lifted by a vigorous jet stream
disturbance. Winds changing speed and direction with height will
impart rotation to some of the thunderstorms, heightening the risk
for damaging winds, hail and isolated tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty thunderstorms will also develop from Minnesota through
lower Michigan, while ample clouds and afternoon showers develop in
the interior Northeast. Farther south, a few thunderstorms will
tease the parched Florida peninsula, though no widespread rainfall
is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will explode to the south of a cold front
in the torrid conditions of the late afternoon from Missouri to
central Kansas. Sweltering heat will prevail over the lower
Mississippi Valley and southern Plains as sprawling high pressure
aloft supports bright sunshine. High temperatures will reach 100
degrees in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   High humidity levels associated with the nascent summer monsoon
season will encourage showers and thunderstorms in the Southwest.
Drenching rains will occur in some areas, raising the risk for
flooding in low-lying areas. Meanwhile, high pressure will provide
partial sunshine and seasonable temperatures to the northern
Rockies. The West Coast will be mainly sunny and warm with the
exception of morning coastal clouds and lonely afternoon
thunderstorms over the mountains of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: the Monsoon Begins
</P>
<P>
   The monsoon officially began in southeast Arizona on Friday, and
true to form, a thunderstorm rolled over Tucson on Sunday dumping
nearly an inch of rain. A monsoon is simply a seasonal wind. In the
deserts of the Southwest, the wind blows from the southeast during
the summer monsoon, directing humid air from the Gulfs of Mexico
and California. Technically, climatologists in Arizona define the
start of the summer monsoon as the first 24-hour period when the
dewpoint remains above 55 degrees. The average start of the monsoon
is July 5, and it usually concludes around September 15.

RATCHETING UP THE PERISCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 12.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anticipating tension among the heirs to Frank Sinatra's estate,
Joshua Hammer wrote in Newsweek about Ol' Blue Eyes' will, ``It's
certain to  &UR; ratchet up &LR;  the family feud even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   A puzzled Marie Balandis of Houston writes: ``My dictionary
defines  &UR; ratchet &LR;  as a noun meaning `a pawl, click or detent for
holding or propelling a ratchet wheel.' Will be looking for your
column on  &UR; ratchet &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, and you need a newer dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Every mechanic knows that a  &UR; ratchet &LR;  is a toothed wheel or bar
used to prevent a gizmo from moving backward. That sawlike catch is
what gives us all confidence in elevators and the courage to jack
up a car to change a tire. But this word (from the Old German
 &UR; roccho &LR; , ``spindle'') has been reborn with new senses.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; ratchet effect &LR;  has seized economics, and  &UR; to ratchet up &LR;  _
``to move upward in increments'' _ is a verb phrase that has thrust
aside the previously voguish  &UR; escalate &LR; . ( &UR; Raise &LR;  was long ago
lowered, and  &UR; increase &LR;  has shrunk.)
</P>
<P>
   Professor James Duesenberry of Harvard launched  &UR; ratchet effect &LR; 
in a 1948 doctoral thesis that became a seminal macroeconomic book
the next year: ``Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer
Behavior.'' He took the  &UR; ratchet &LR;  to be a device that enables
something to move easily up but prevents it from moving easily all
the way down, and applied that metaphor to the way we spend our
money. In 1979, Daedalus magazine described the theory as beginning
``with the common wisdom that prices go up more freely than they go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. I asked Professor William Doyle
of the University of Dallas to simplify Duesenberry's theory for
me, and it boils down to this: ``It's easier for a household to
adapt its expenditures to an increase in income than to a decrease
in income. When income increases, consumption spending increases;
but when income falls, consumers who have come to view their
standard of living as `normal' are very reluctant to decrease
consumption spending.'' That's the  &UR; ratchet effect &LR; : when you've
been up there, you tend to spend as if you're still there _ even
when you can no longer afford it. Reached in Boston, the emeritus
Duesenberry recalls: ``I think the  &UR; ratchet &LR;  I was familiar with
was a car jack. I thought about the  &UR; ratchet &LR;  on a car jack and
thought of it as an analogy to what was happening. It's an
asymmetrical response.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Merriam-Webster, the editor of Barron's magazine,
Robert Bleiberg, first used the phrasal verb  &UR; ratchet up &LR;  on April
10, 1972: ``In a striking reversal of policy, the Fed in recent
weeks has  &UR; ratcheted upward &LR;  the repo (a collateralized short-term
loan) rate to 4 percent.'' Five years later, Britain's Margaret
Thatcher, on her way to becoming prime minister, latched on to the
image: ``Britain is no longer in the politics of the pendulum, but
of the  &UR; ratchet &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Economists still love the saw-toothed image, but came to use it
in a broader sense. ``If you build in wages and other benefits
based upon an exaggerated Consumer Price Index,'' warned Paul
Volcker when he was Fed chairman in 1981, ``you  &UR; ratchet up &LR; 
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it calibrates any rise. ``Tension in the border war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea,'' reported Agence France-Presse a few months
ago, `` &UR; ratcheted up &LR;  a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Kelly, in his column enlivening the weekly National
Journal, dreamed up ways that Democrats would continue to try to
embarrass Republicans with anti-tobacco bills, concluding: ``The
pain level  &UR; ratchets up &LR; , and sooner or later, the theory goes, the
GOP caves.''
</P>
<P>
   Needed: a phrase meaning ``to lower by degrees, to decrease in
increments.''  &UR; Ratchet down &LR;  may be justified mechanically, but it
doesn't do it metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW BOAT TO JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the ability of dour business executives to
come up with colorful word pictures. A system allowing interest
rates to rise or fall only within a narrow range was called  &UR; the
snake in the tunnel &LR; ; a stock rally doomed to be short-lived is  &UR; a
dead-cat bounce &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Japan has the  &UR; Gososendan-hoshiki &LR; . To break it down,  &UR; Goso &LR; 
means ``shipped with protection'';  &UR; sen &LR;  is ``ship'';  &UR; dan &LR;  is
``group.''  &UR; Hoshiki &LR;  is ``system.'' English translation: ``the
convoy system.''
</P>
<P>
   When Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin decided to intervene in the
currency markets to support the yen, he had just been assured that
Tokyo would take action against the convoys. Last month, David
Wessel wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Japanese officials
promised ``that Japan finally will abandon what is called the
`convoy system,' which essentially involves strong companies
bailing out weak ones _ often under pressure from regulators _ so
that everyone stays afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivid metaphor. A  &UR; convoy &LR;  is a group, usually of ships,
organized to move in a way that best protects the whole group. In
World War II ``action in the North Atlantic,'' Allied convoys
supplying Britain were assembled to ward off Nazi submarines, and
it became a truism that ``a convoy moves as slowly as its slowest
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current Japanese trope, the  &UR; Gososendan-hoshiki &LR;  consists
of strong and weak banks; the strong banks hold afloat the weak
ones. By breaking up the convoy, central bankers around the world
hope to allow the Japanese banks weakened by bad loans to sink and
the strong to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The hero-villain metaphor has been reversed; in this case, the
good guys are the U-boat commanders busting up the self-protective
convoys and picking off the laggards.  &UR; Ratchet up &LR;  that periscope.
Fire Vun! &QL;

BRIGHT ARRIVAL AT KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 12)  
 (JT)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The all-new Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport has
already garnered critics' praise for its architecture. The people
who built this international terminal for the owner airlines, Air
France, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa and Korean Air, and those who
work in it, seem in love with it. They stop frequently to point to
views through certain windows, particular pieces of design, giant
new gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   The departure area is dazzling in its light and loftiness. The
interior balcony offers good people-watching. But how will the
terminal work for passengers at the airport where, as the signs all
over Kennedy say, ``America Greets the World''?
</P>
<P>
   It is usually true that departing passengers see the best of an
international airport, according to William Bodouva, the principal
architect. Arrivals enter on the lower level _ the equivalent of
steerage.
</P>
<P>
   Since the departure level is dictated by the height of the
airplane door, Bodouva said, getting people aboard without climbing
is possible only from an upper level. The baggage removed from the
plane is handled at ground level and so, then, are its owners.
</P>
<P>
   At Terminal 1 passengers still arrive downstairs in the
so-called sterile security-sealed lower corridor. But they do not
set foot on U.S. soil in a windowless wooden-walled corridor with
no light at the end, as has been the case at the old International
Arrivals Building.
</P>
<P>
   The inbound concourse leading to the Immigration and Customs
area at Terminal 1 has a moving sidewalk along one wall, and
windows along the other with a view over runways and the aircraft
parking area. The ceiling is undeniably low _ ``the sterile
corridor is always a squeeze, but we softened it a little,''
Bodouva said, referring to electric-light coves cut into the
ceiling. Then, when passengers turn left toward Immigration
control, the overhead opens into a vast skylight.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration area has 34 booths leading to four luggage
carousels and space for a fifth. This area and the Customs staff at
five channels are designed to handle 2,200 passengers an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidental with the opening of Terminal 1 came a new amenity
for all three New York area airports: On June 15, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey hired a staff of 235 customer
service agents, suited them up in red jackets or vests and sent
them to the airports, turning a formerly seasonal program into a
year-round project. Five of Kennedy's 82 permanent multi-lingual
greeters are assigned to Terminal 1 seven days a week on two
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew E. Kreek Jr., Kennedy's manager of landside services,
said these helpers had instructions to approach people in
difficulty and to be sure they found what they needed. They are
available to direct people to taxi lines and provide guidance on
fares. Seventy percent of the customer service people speak a
second language, commanding among them at least 30 languages,
including French, German and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   All terminals at Kennedy but Tower Air's are being redesignated
by numbers. Terminal 1, built on 36 acres formerly used by Eastern
Airlines, is the first major terminal an arriving driver meets
coming off the Van Wyck Expressway; the last ones on the outbound
swing, used by American, are now identified as Terminals 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 1 cost $445 million, according to Dieter Bergt, the
chief operating officer. Ground was broken in September 1995,
although the old Eastern terminal was not yet completely
demolished. Terminal 4, formerly International Arrivals, has lost
some of its tenants and is also being renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 1 has 96 check-in positions and 32 ticketing positions
on four islands on the departure level. Each island bears the logo
of one of the four tenant-owner lines. But Bergt said the computer
systems allowed any airline to use any counter in case passenger
lines backed up. Air Afrique, Olympic Airways, Royal Air Maroc,
Singapore Airlines and Turkish Airlines are moving into the new
terminal, too, and others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Shore, the project manager for the Terminal 1 Group
Association, particularly admires the features that give the new
terminal the ability to serve several functions in tight quarters.
She pointed to the design of 6 of the 11 plane-entrance ramps,
called lofting bridges. Departing travelers and arriving
international passengers may not be mixed, and this usually
requires using separate gates, or walled-off walkways in the
interior. The adjustable end of the lofting bridges is on the
terminal side: the plane can stay in the same place during its
turnaround, and at the terminal end the gate is lowered to
disembark passengers at the lower level or raised for embarkation
at the upper level.
</P>
<P>
   On a humbler scale, the ATM situation at Terminal 1 is not
optimal. There are to be only two cash machines, according to Kevin
Corrigan, a spokesman for Airport Aviation Professionals. This
organization served as adviser on concessions to the Terminal 1
Group Association. Both machines are provided by American Express.
The one that was working June 22 charges users $1.50 a pop to get
at their bank accounts. It is inside the security barrier, near the
American Express money exchange counters and, naturally, the
stores. The other is on the ground floor, outside the security
barrier, where arriving passengers are met.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal has lots of phones, including a good number on
pedestals in the meet-and-greet area, where they are so often
needed. The wall installations on the departure level, oddly, are
all at wheelchair height, which makes the keypads hard to read for
those who dial standing up.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,000-square-foot duty-free shop, where one may not enter
without a boarding pass, is run by International Shoppes. Because
Terminal 1 is used only by international passengers, this store is
able to hand the merchandise, including cigarettes and liquor, to
the buyers right in the store. The shop emphasizes California
wines, and has a good selection of American whiskies.
</P>
<P>
   Also beyond the barrier are two small bars and snack bars,
Brooklyn Brewery Pub and Napa Valley Wine Bar, and some stores. One
that has just opened is an H.Stern jeweler..
</P>
<P>
   First- and business-class passengers can use spiffy private
lounges run by the individual airlines. The walls facing out are
almost entirely glass, with varying views, some distant, some of
waiting planes. There are plenty of easy chairs, tables with phones
and modem outlets, phone booths or communications carrels, meeting
rooms, and a couple of windowless rooms with recliners for naps.
The host airlines, which serve countries where smoking is
apparently unabated, have encapsulated smoking rooms within their
lounges. V.I.P. rooms, useful for those who crave privacy (rock
stars perhaps), are available on request.
</P>
<P>
   Three lounges have showers: Air France, Lufthansa and Korean
Air. Attendants will fetch towels from well-stocked linen closets.
Japan Airlines has no shower, but provides high-tech bidets with
adjustable water temperature. In addition to the usual coffee,
snacks and alcoholic drinks, Lufthansa and Air France will serve
dinner at tables in the lounge to first-class passengers taking
late-evening flights who want to go straight to sleep once on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Air France has transferred its children's playroom, with a
wooden plane suitable for small children to climb aboard, a fabric
tunnel for floor crawling and other games, from its former terminal
to the corridor near its lounge. To reach the lounge or the
playroom, passengers must go through security. The children's area
may be used by Air France economy passengers, too.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a play area for children of all departing
passengers out in the open on the departure level. It was still
being put together on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   The food court area on the balcony outside the security barrier
is also still being finished, although a self-service counter was
open, selling coffee and small sandwiches and cakes. It's hard to
discern what it will be like when the Greenwich Village Bistro and
the like are up and running, but in spacious unfinished condition,
the balcony revived two vivid memories. One was the Golden Door at
Newark Airport in the 1950s, a restaurant whose name reminded
visitors that America was the place of opportunity, and whose
splendid food endowed the portal itself with romance. Another
feeling, from an even earlier era, overcame me as I stood at the
balcony edge looking over the concourse: the sense one got in the
old Pennsylvania Station _ of purposeful people under a high, high
roof going someplace exciting.

   VIETNAM-POW _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The anthem stopped playing
on that June Sunday in 1994 and Jay Casenelli snapped his salute.
All around him admired the POW medal with the bronze eagle that had
just been pinned on his chest. ``I'll share this with some
ghosts,'' he told them. As it turns out, Jay Casenelli is himself a
ghost. Nothing about his war story is true _ not a date, not a
detail, not a word. He flew no helicopter, endured no beating and
suffered no imprisonment in a wooden cage in Southeast Asia. In
fact, Casenelli spent the Vietnam war years well out of the reach
of the Viet Cong gunfire, in Hazlehurst, Ga., and Marathon in the
Florida Keys. ``It is very disheartening,'' said Col. Dave Presley,
the Army officer who had helped Casenelli get his POW medal. ``It
looks like he scammed a lot of people.'' (Moffett, Palm Beach
Post.)

BRAZIL COACH SEES MATCH WITH DUTCH AS `LION EATING LION'  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ There was a time when the Dutch were called
the Brazilians of Europe. Their aggressive offense did not help
them against West Germany in the 1974 World Cup final or against
Argentina in the 1978 final, but now comes their chance against the
Brazilians of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch meet the four-time champions here Tuesday night in one
semifinal of a World Cup that has three semifinalists that have
never won the tournament. France and Croatia meet Wednesday night
in St. Denis.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and the Netherlands go back a ways. Only six teams have
ever won the World Cup in its 14 sessions, and the Netherlands has
often been regarded as the best football power to never win it.
</P>
<P>
   It charmed soccer fans around the world in the '70s with its
concept of Total Football, as originated by Rinus Michels, the
creative Dutch coach. Michels, now 70 years old, was taken to the
hospital here after Saturday's 2-1 victory over Argentina, and was
in stable condition Monday after being diagnosed as having suffered
a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Under Michels, the Dutch came close twice, eliminating Brazil in
1974. Conversely, Brazil eliminated them in the 1994 World Cup in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the teams that have presented the best football in the
Cup so far,'' said Mario Zagallo, the coach of Brazil, who was also
the head coach in 1974. ``This will be lion eating lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil came into the tournament as the favorite, and have really
not done anything wrong, except to lose to Norway in a first-round
game after they had already won their group.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams come into the semifinal with personnel shortages.
Cafu, the powerful Brazilian defender, received his second yellow
card of the second round during Brazil's quarterfinal victory
against Denmark for delaying play.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement will be Ze Carlos, who is popular among his
teammates for his imitations of various forms of wildlife. Zagallo
said, ``I told Ze Carlos that since he can imitate dogs, parrots
and owls, now he'll imitate Cafu.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch are more severely short-handed, because Arthur Numan,
a starting defender, was tossed out of Saturday's victory as a
result of his second yellow card of the game. The man who would
have replaced him, Winston Bogarde, broke his right fibula during
normal running drills on Sunday. Guus Hiddink, the coach, has not
said who will start in their place. Several other major Dutch
players, Clarence Seedorf and Aaron Winter, missed the Argentina
game because of injuries but are likely to be available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch still like to attack. Their midfielders can drill long
and accurate passes, like the one that Frank DeBoer lofted to
Dennis Bergkamp, who volleyed the winning goal late against
Argentina. Philip Cocu, listed as a midfielder, has been known to
enter striker territory.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Davids, fiery as his nickname, ``Pit Bull,'' knocked off
Yugoslavia in the 93d minute, just before the end of regulation
time, and has been covering the gaps in the defense as his
teammates rush forward.
</P>
<P>
   None of the previous Dutch success may matter much against
Brazil, which has more firepower than any other nation. Ronaldo,
who came into this tournament as the hugely-promoted star of an
equipment company, with billboards everywhere, has been fine.
However, Rivaldo has been the silky offensive star so far, and
Cesar Sampaio has roamed far up front to score important goals, and
Roberto Carlos, the mobile midfielder, has often been the best
player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian goalkeepers are often seen as mere accessories, and
Taffarel fits into that pattern. The Dutch goalkeeper, the lanky
Edwin Van Der Sar, may have given his team a new personality as
fiery as the bright orange outfits its supporters wear.
</P>
<P>
   They call him the ``Ice Rabbit'' back home, but Van Der Sar's
aggressive posture helped the Dutch into the semifinals. He says he
prepares for big games by staring out the window, but Van Der Sar
was far from reflective last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dutch down a man because of an expulsion, Ariel Ortega
of Argentina took a flop near the goal, trying to draw the
official's sympathy. Totally out of character, Van Der Sar came
running up to berate Ortega, who leaped up and head-butted him,
earning a red-card expulsion. With the teams even again, DeBoer and
Bergkamp collaborated on their gorgeous goal. It was a throwback to
Total Football, and it united the Brazilians of two continents for
another round.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: GOING ASTRAY ON HIGH-PROFILE REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How could it have happened? How could experienced producers at a
major network have turned out such a mishmash of a report on so
sensitive a subject, little short of the charge of an American war
crime?
</P>
<P>
   After an independent investigation found that last month's CNN
report of U.S. use of lethal nerve gas in Laos in 1970 was not
supported by the evidence, retractions and apologies were properly
made by CNN and by its partner, Time magazine, which may be having
second thoughts about the virtues of journalistic synergy.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN producers who patched together the now exposed expose
were dismissed; the senior executive producer of the new
news-magazine series ``Newsstand: CNN and Time,'' which had come on
with the usual beating of drums, resigned, and Peter Arnett, a
stellar CNN correspondent, who had done some of the program's
interviewing, was reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   All the blemished parties must hope that the episode will go the
way of other quickly forgotten journalistic embarrassments,
allowing them to get back to business as usual. But in business as
usual can be found the elements that propelled them into folly.
</P>
<P>
   It began in hype. With the introduction of ``Newsstand'' last
month, CNN was striving to distinguish itself from the cable-news
clutter that fills the channels and scatters their ratings. And by
associating itself with Time, CNN was acknowledging that the
credentials of print would add potency to its own so-so reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The new series and its initial program _ ``Valley of Death,'' it
was called, in true pulp spirit _ represented a big Time Warner
commitment, both financially and as a show of cable-news muscle.
The pressures were on, the juices were running, and it is easy to
imagine producers being incited to excesses in the interests of a
smashing debut.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism has never been a hype-free line of work, and
television, with its affinities to show business, lays on the
hoopla with particular zest. By now, the reasonably sophisticated
fan takes the standard news-magazine promises of revelations,
breakthroughs and near-miracles with a resigned skepticism; if the
evening's crime story or health story or scandal tends toward
sensationalism, so what's new?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the ``Newsstand'' producers, their subject was
too hot to be accepted with the usual shrug. American veterans, the
Pentagon and Washington's reputation were involved. But any show of
restraint, any muting of the charges would have weakened the punch
of opening night. What sort of expose would it be, hedged in with
maybes?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in The New York Times over the weekend, the
producers _ April Oliver and her immediate superior, Jack Smith _
said they had pressed for an hour of air time instead of the 18
minutes they were allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists, often compelled to pack too much information into
too few minutes, will sympathize, yet an elementary part of the job
is being fair and accurate whatever the constraints of time. In
defending the 18-minute version, Ms. Oliver suggested that she was
sparing her audience from a confusion overload. That excuse can be
applied to many of the thinly reported documentaries that fill the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, particularly in regard to the severely
criticized use of sources: Is this the best they could do after an
eight-month investigation? (That's enough without getting into what
the conservative Bill Kristol called the producers' politically
driven motives, an imputation that makes one wonder about his
motives.)
</P>
<P>
   The lure of the subject, American use of poison gas, was further
stimulated by pictures of the Laos raid. They were grabbers,
lending the semblance of documentary verisimilitude to the report.
Such is the camera's power. The pictures provided the smoky,
somewhat sinister drama that television relishes, but they added
nothing to the assertion that nerve gas had been used or that
defectors had been the targets.
</P>
<P>
   There is no novelty in news-magazine producers' relying on
pictures to bolster stories that are short on substance. How were
they to know that this time out, they would be subject to
line-by-line, frame-by-frame scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the presence of Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize
correspondent who found himself working on a story in which by his
own account he had not been deeply involved. He told Reuters:
``Looking at it in retrospect, maybe I could have asked more
questions about the story than I did. But I came into it very
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Arnett's role or predilection, the notion of hauling in
a star correspondent to add credibility does not defy common
practice. Will this affair do anything to stop news magazines from
using high-profile reporters as display pieces for reports to which
they contribute little but their reassuring presences? Don't count
on it. This is show business, where television's news stars earn
their outsize salaries on the backs of producers. It's a continuing
invitation to irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   None of television's bad habits can pardon the producers'
performance in their ``Valley of Death,'' but the scene was set.
Whether the experience will do anything to reduce the hype, the
mindlessly punchy use of pictures, the empty celebration of star
performers to which television news is prone, remains to be seen.
There is no reason for optimism.

   ATLANTA _ Public health officials have identified another case
of E. coli linked to White Water park, bringing the total number of
children infected with the bacteria to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which involves a Gwinnett County, Ga. child, was the
result of exposure on June 17 at the popular Atlanta area water
park, said Peter Lee, a Georgia Department of Human Resources
spokesman. Lee said he had no information about the age of the
child, who did not require hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cases have been linked to exposure June 11-12,
although public officials are now looking at a second wave of
infections tied to June 17.
</P>
<P>
   No more tests that determine the genetic fingerprints of E. coli
O157:H7 have been completed, although public health officials
expect results by mid- to late-week.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Georgia Division of Public Health has conducted 11
genetic tests and all 11 have been linked to White Water, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also said public health officials were still ``looking at a
couple more cases'' that might be linked to the water park.
</P>
<P>
   Of those children who required hospitalization, a critically ill
4-year-old, who has been hospitalized for two weeks, appears to be
getting better, Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's condition was upgraded from critical to serious
Monday, according to Scottish Rite spokeswoman Kim Lathbury. The
hospital will not release the child's name because of patient
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Another child who also has been hospitalized for two weeks, a
2-year-old girl, remains in critical condition at Scottish Rite.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the last remaining E. coli patient at Egleston
Children's Hospital, a 2-year-old boy, has been upgraded to good
condition, said hospital spokeswoman Julie Sullivan.

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN CAPITAL MURDER TRIAL OF FORMER AIR FORCE
CADET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ A few blocks from the German restaurants
and refreshing spas that make this central Texas town a summertime
tourist haven, lawyers at the Comal County Courthouse on Monday
began the tedious process of selecting a jury to hear the capital
murder case against a former Air Force Academy cadet.
</P>
<P>
   David Graham, 21, is accused of killing Adrianne Jones, a
16-year-old Mansfield girl, in order to please his jealous fiancee
and atone for having a brief sexual relationship with Jones. But
about 500 potential jurors were told nothing specific about the
case, only that this is a murder trial moved from Fort Worth's
Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   No mention was made of former Naval Academy midshipman Diane
Zamora, Graham's former girlfriend, who earlier this year received
a life sentence for her role in the 1995 killing of Jones.
</P>
<P>
   According to Graham's confession in the case, he invited Jones
to go for a drive Dec. 4, 1995. With Zamora hiding in the trunk,
Graham drove to a remote location where, he said, Zamora struck the
first blow by hitting Jones in the head with a barbell weight.
Jones fled the car and collapsed in a field, but Graham said in his
statement that he followed her and shot her twice with his 9 mm
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The murder remained unsolved until the couple entered their
respective academies and Zamora confessed the crime to her new
friends at the Naval Academy, who turned her in.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones had gone out voluntarily with Graham on the night
she was slain, she was kept against her will, resulting in a
kidnapping allegation that allowed prosecutors to obtain the most
serious possible indictment _ capital murder. Yet, at the request
of the victim's family, the state is not seeking the death penalty
for Graham. Life in prison is the only possible punishment if he is
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they had never heard of the widely publicized case,
potential jurors couldn't help but notice Monday that Graham's
trial attracted media attention from around the state and nation.
The three- or four-week trial, which is to begin next week, is
expected to involve the same evidence as Zamora's trial last
February in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, &UR;  &LR; wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a dark suit, sat
silently before potential jurors, flashing an occasional smile
during the day's brief proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase of the winnowing process, Comal County
residents offered reasons why they should not be interrogated in
detail about potential jury service. That depth of questioning
begins Tuesday, with much of the questioning centered on the
jurors' exposure to media coverage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Don Leonard, urging them to keep an open mind about
Graham, told panelists he wanted them to ``set aside what you may
have heard'' and prepare to decide his case solely on evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Dan Cogdell acknowledged it would be difficult
to win acquittal for Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime there's a case with a confession and a case where the
co-defendant has been convicted on the front page of every
newspaper in the country, it would be folly not to think it was a
difficult case,'' Cogdell said. ``How difficult, time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County prosecutor Mike Parrish, who successfully
prosecuted Zamora, said the pressure is on him to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more difficult for us because everybody expects
David Graham to be convicted. Everybody knows the evidence against
Diane Zamora,'' Parrish said, referring to the couple's confessions
and the discovery of the murder weapon hidden in Graham's attic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story here will be if David Graham gets off lighter
than capital murder or gets found not guilty,'' he said.

CATASTROPHIC MELTING OF ICE SHEET IS POSSIBLE, STUDIES HINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Repeating to remove graphic note; no other changes.)  
(nk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the earth's temperature heats up as mainstream scientists
predict it will over the next century, the average level of the
world's oceans could rise by about a foot and a half by 2100, and
somewhat more after that, as glaciers partly melt and the heating
makes sea water expand, inundating many low-lying coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be trivial compared with the melting or collapse of
the huge West Antarctic ice sheet, the Godzilla of rising seas.
That would let loose so much water into the oceans that they would
rise by a truly catastrophic 16 to 20 feet. There, among other
things, would go most of Florida and a sizable chunk of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Could that really happen?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been unable to point with confidence to any
instance in which it has happened in the past, in any sort of
climate that compares with today's or with the climate that is
expected in the decades and centuries ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, natural forces have caused the earth's temperature
to vary widely. All the planet's permanent ice virtually
disappeared during the super-high temperatures of the Cretaceous
period, which ended some 65 million years ago. The extent to which
it may have melted periodically since permanent ice became
re-established as early as 15 million to 20 million years ago has
been unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study by investigators in Sweden and the United States
has turned up what is described as evidence that the West Antarctic
ice sheet, or part of it, did indeed collapse at least once during
an ancient interglacial period, or interval of warmth between ice
ages. The world is in another such interglacial period now, and
many scientists believe its warmth will be intensified by emissions
of heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden and the
California Institute of Technology, led by Dr. Reed P. Scherer,
analyzed sediments recovered from the area beneath the West
Antarctic ice and determined that they contained the remains of
tiny marine algae called diatoms, along with a chemical tracer
called beryllium-10.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they report in the current issue of the journal
Science, these clues ``provide evidence that marine conditions
prevailed deep within the West Antarctic interior'' at some time
within the last two million years. This, they wrote, suggests that
the West Antarctic ice sheet had collapsed to some degree at least
once within the same period. The researchers nominate an unusually
long interglacial interval about 400,000 years ago as the most
likely time for the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer had made similar findings earlier on the basis of
diatoms alone, but the findings were criticized on the ground that
the diatoms could have got into the sediment samples by other means
than melting of the ice. That is true of the new study as well,
said Dr. Lloyd Burckle, a micropaleontologist who works with
diatoms at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the new evidence, while not conclusive, was
strong. Collapse of the ice sheet is the best explanation for the
placement of the diatoms and the beryllium-10, said Dr. Richard
Alley, a paleoclimatologist at Pennsylvania State University.
Scherer's ``original result was correct and he has strengthened
it,'' Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the finding, he said, is that it
``strengthens the possibility'' that the West Antarctic ice sheet
could collapse in the future; having done so once, it could do so
again.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the ice sheet is so vulnerable is that alone among
the world's big ice sheets (including a much larger one in East
Antarctica), it lies largely below sea level. That means it is more
open to melting as warming ocean waters lap at its margins; by
comparison, warmer air melts the ice much more slowly. The ice
sheet's margins consist of vast, floating ice shelves as big as
Spain. If these were to melt, they would not cause the sea level to
rise, since they are already floating on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But they are fed by large, moving rivers of ice that flow from
the interior of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and scientists
believe that the removal of the shelves could allow the rivers to
flow faster, as if a cork were removed from a bottle. This could
deplete the interior reservoir of the West Antarctic ice sheet
itself, which does not float but is instead grounded on an
archipelago below sea level. If the flow of the moving ice streams
did speed up, it might deplete the ice faster than freezing
precipitation could replace it, leading to a net outflow of fresh
water into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   How long this might take is a critical question. The Scherer
study does not shed any light on it. ``He can't demonstrate that it
went in a hurry, just that it went,'' Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   But few if any experts believe that the ice sheet is likely to
collapse in anything less than a few centuries in response to
global warming, whether natural or caused by human activity.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists advising the United Nations predict an average
surface warming of about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 if
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are not
reduced. That amount of warming compares with a warming of 5 to 9
degrees since the depths of the last ice age.
</P>
<P>
   With the predicted warming, which would continue beyond the 21st
century by present calculations, it would probably take 500 to 700
years for the West Antarctic ice sheet to disintegrate fully,
producing the rise in sea level of up to 20 feet, according to a
review of research on the subject by Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a
senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, published in
the journal Nature in May. Alley said he considered this a
reasonable assessment.
</P>
<P>
   But the die could be cast much earlier, Oppenheimer calculated.
The climate could warm enough by the end of the next century to
make an eventual collapse of the ice sheet inevitable, he said. He
called the latest Scherer study ``critically important'' because it
suggests that the ice sheet disintegrated in global temperatures
that could not have been much higher than current levels.
</P>
<P>
   There are many uncertainties in all this, as Oppenheimer pointed
out. Not least, global warming is expected to result in more
precipitation, as more water evaporates from the oceans. This is
likely to build up the ice sheets more rapidly as precipitation
falls and freezes. It is far from clear how the tug-of-war between
increased buildup of ice on one hand and an accelerated flow of the
ice streams on the other would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Two other new pieces of research, published in the current issue
of Nature, suggest that the speed of the ice streams' flow would be
dictated by the underlying geology of Antarctica. The ice streams
flow along relatively narrow basins made slippery by a combination
of fine sedimentary particles and melted ice water. Several things
can slow the flow, including rough protuberances sticking up
through the slippery path and friction along the sides of the flow
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Alley, who is a co-author of one of the Nature
papers, if the underlying topography contains many sedimentary
basins along which more rapidly flowing ice can escape, the ice
sheet would deplete faster. But ``if the ice streams can't get
somewhere because the geology is wrong,'' he said, ``that
essentially buys us time because the ice can't change and move as
rapidly.'' The primary authors of the Nature papers are Robin E.
Bell of the Lamont-Doherty observatory and Sridhar Anandakrishnan
of Pennsylvania State.
</P>
<P>
   However fast the ice streams might flow if the floating shelves
that cork it up were removed, Oppenheimer said, present knowledge
suggests that the streams would probably flow not like water or
wine out of a bottle but rather like stubborn ketchup.

SID LUCKMAN, STAR FOR THE BEARS, DIES AT 81  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM N. WALLACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sid Luckman, the Columbia University star and quarterback of the
great Chicago Bears teams of the 1940s who helped trigger a
revolution in how the game of football was played, died Sunday at
Aventura (Fla.) Hospital and Medical Center. Luckman, who lived in
Aventura, was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman, playing for George Halas, the owner and coach of the
Bears, turned the modern T-formation into a formidable weapon and
was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Zuppke, the great Illinois coach, once said of Luckman, ``He
was the smartest football player I ever saw, and that goes for
college or pro.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers followed Luckman from the time he was a
much-publicized schoolboy at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up in Flatbush,'' Luckman once told a reporter,
``we played football, stickball and baseball all the time, right
out there on the city streets. Football was my favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckman, highly recruited out of high school, spurned about 40
college offers to play at Columbia. He had planned to attend Navy,
but was attracted by the dynamic Lou Little, the Lions' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Navy was playing Columbia at Baker Field and Rip Miller, the
Navy athletic director, who was personally recruiting Luckman,
first took him into the Navy locker room and then the Columbia
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I met Lou Little, I knew I wanted to play for
him,'' Luckman once recalled. ``Columbia had no athletic
scholarships then, so I had to work my way through _ painting walls
and washing dishes in the fraternity house for room and meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckman's all-America efforts for mediocre Columbia teams caught
the eyes of the Bears' Halas, who had a plan that changed football
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman was in the right place at the right time as the Bears
introduced a modern version of the &QC; T-formation offense, which
promoted passing and put emphasis on speed and deception in place
of brute strength. The T-formation had existed years before Luckman
came onto the scene, but it was the versatile quarterback who gave
it such a thunderous impact on the game. He was not a speedy
athlete, but he made up for it with his sense for the game.
</P>
<P>
   A single-wing tailback in college, Luckman had no initial
interest in playing professionally. ``I'd taken a lot of punishment
and I knew how rough the pro game could be,'' he said. He had just
married Estelle Morgolin, his high school sweetheart, and planned
to join his brother in the family trucking business.
</P>
<P>
   But Halas was persistent. He had traded a player named Edgar
(Eggs) Manske to Pittsburgh to gain the National Football League's
second draft choice for 1939. He wanted Luckman. Halas coaxed an
invitation to the Luckmans' tiny apartment, and Estelle made dinner
for all of them. During the meal, Halas offered a $5,500 salary and
produced a contract that Luckman signed.
</P>
<P>
   He was worth it. After one apprentice season of playing more as
a pass-throwing halfback than as a quarterback, Luckman had learned
the intricate footwork and faking of the T-formation. He blossomed
and so did the Bears. In 1940, they won the NFL championship by
routing the Washington Redskins, 73-0, in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the greatest team ever assembled in the era of
one-platoon football. It took World War II to break up the Monsters
of the Midway. And Luckman was the field general throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman was ``another coach on the field,'' Halas said. The
quarterback had more than 350 plays of the Bears' complex offense
cataloged in his rapid-fire mind. That offense became the standard
for pro and college football in the next decade. In fact, when
Luckman quit playing pro ball, he helped install the T-formation at
Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Holy Cross and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman played for three other championship Chicago teams, in
1941, 1943 and 1946. Three times he led the league in touchdown
passes, in 1943, 1945 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, when Luckman was leading the Bears to an 8-1-1 record,
Chicago went to New York for a regular-season game. It was deemed
Sid Luckman Day at the Polo Grounds. The New York fans presented
him with a $1,000 war bond and Luckman, who had grown up a Giants
fan in Brooklyn, proceeded to put on a one-man show for the
hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   He threw for 453 yards against the Giants in a 56-7 rout, the
worst loss in Giants history at the time. It was the first time a
quarterback had thrown for more than 400 yards in a game. In that
game, he also threw a record seven touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best all-around football player that New York City
ever developed,'' said the former track star and sports
broadcaster, Marty Glickman. Glickman was a member of the Madison
High football team that played Luckman's Erasmus team twice for the
city title, winning once. In 1995, the football field at Erasmus
was renamed in Luckman's honor.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman took to stardom gracefully. He was a gentle, modest and
thoughtful man who was immensely popular. In one game during the
Bears' heyday, the 250-pound guard Ray Bray confessed to Luckman in
the huddle that he would cherish the chance to score a touchdown.
The Bears were a yard short of the goal line at the time. Luckman
called on Bray to carry the ball a la William (The Refrigerator)
Perry. Bray was ground into the dirt still a yard short of the goal
line.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman was gracious to his teammate. ``Get back where you
belong, chum,'' he said mildly and then handed the ball to one of
his powerful backs for the score.
</P>
<P>
   Five times Luckman was voted to the All-Pro team in competition
with such stars as Sammy Baugh of the Redskins, Paul Christman of
the Chicago Cardinals and Bob Waterfield of the Los Angeles Rams.
He also was chosen most valuable player of the 1943 season.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 seasons with the Bears, Luckman retired in 1950 but
remained close to the Bears and Halas, who called him ``Son'' for
many years. ``He was like a second father to me,'' Luckman said of
Halas.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman had earlier launched a successful business career in
Chicago. He had a long association with the packaging industry and
a firm called Cellu-Craft Products, which he later headed.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son and two daughters. His wife died in
1981.

   NEW YORK _ At the New Amsterdam Theater near Times Square, not
only does the show (``The Lion King'') go on, but so do six South
Africans in the 52-member cast. The South Africans, including
Tsidii Le Loka, who plays the wise baboon Rafiki, and five members
of the ensemble received a waiver from Actors' Equity to appear in
the cast when the show opened last November. But their waiver was
to expire on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Disney Theatrical Productions argued that they
provided a unique service, and Equity agreed, the actors may remain
in the New York production indefinitely. Chanting and singing, the
performers speak several African dialects, some difficult to learn;
and under the agreement, the actors are offering master classes to
find performers who could play their roles in the future.

   Late in 1476 or early 1477, William Caxton, England's earliest
typographer, printed a book about a group of pilgrims. About 300
years later, the book was bought for 6 pounds (about $10 today but
considerably more then) by the fourth Earl Fitzwilliam's family,
where it has remained ever since. On Wednesday, that first edition
of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales'' will be auctioned at Christie's
in London, where it is expected to fetch as much as $1.1 million.
Although a dozen copies of the volume survive, this first edition
is the last in private hands.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With librettos by A.R. Gurney, Terrence McNally and
Wendy Wasserstein and scores by Michael Torke, Robert Beaser and
Deborah Drattell, three one-act operas have been jointly
commissioned by the New York City Opera, the Glimmerglass Opera and
the ``Great Performances'' series, produced by WNET in New York.
Plans call for the operas to be presented as a triple bill under
the title ``Central Park'' because their unifying element will be
the park. The work, directed by Mark Lamos, will be first seen next
summer at the Glimmerglass Opera, in Cooperstown, N.Y., followed by
six performances at the New York City Opera, when it will be
televised on PBS.

   NEW YORK _ Cuba Gooding (the actor's father) and the Main
Ingredient begin the eighth year of free Concerts in the Park,
Tuesday night at 7 in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. This evening of
soulful style is just the appetizer for a summer of classic soul,
rhythm and blues and Latin music not only in Fort Greene Park on
Tuesdays but also in Sternberg/Lindsay Park in Williamsburg on
Wednesdays and in Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Thursdays
through the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the scene shifts to Linden Park in East New York on
Tuesdays and Sunset Park in Greenwood on Wednesdays. Attractions in
the series include the Persuasions, the Delfonics, Clarence

 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the summer season now in full swing in most parts of the
country and youngsters spending more of their waking hours out of
doors often skimpily attired, biting insects are finding easy
targets for the blood they need to reproduce. And parents once
again are challenged to find the best way to protect their children
from annoying and possibly dangerous bites from such critters as
gnats, mosquitoes, biting flies, chiggers and ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Product choices abound and continue to multiply. But all are not
equally safe or effective.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Contemporary Pediatrics, a medical
magazine for physicians, Dr. Adelaide A. Hebert, a professor of
dermatology and pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical
School in Houston, and Dr. Soni Carlton, now an intern at the
university's Galveston branch, discuss the pros and cons of
products currently available and the safest ways to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must always keep in mind that children are not just
small adults; what may be safe for a grown-up is not necessarily
safe for a child. A child's skin surface area relative to body size
is far greater than an adult's and a child's skin is thinner, so
any substance applied to and absorbed through the skin can have
much more of an impact on a child.
</P>
<P>
   This troublesome fact collides with the need to reapply
repellents every few hours, since they are rubbed off by clothing
and other objects and are lost to evaporation, wind, sweat, heat
and water. Also, the new products that combine repellents with
sunscreen require frequent reapplication to maintain the
sunscreen's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The leading and still the most effective all-purpose repellent
is one of the oldest products around: DEET, the popular name for
the chemical N,N-diethyl-m-toluamine, used as a repellent since
1957. It is sold in concentrations of 4 percent to 100 percent as
sprays, aerosols, gels, liquids, sticks and treated towels.
</P>
<P>
   However, products used on children should not contain more than
10 percent DEET, the lowest effective dose. In high concentrations,
which are most effective as repellents, DEET can be highly toxic to
children. The Texas physicians noted that 13 youngsters under age 8
are known to have developed encephalopathy, suffering seizures and
convulsions, after using too much DEET. Three children died, but
the others recovered completely. Most of these incidents followed
repeated applications of products containing 10 percent or 20
percent DEET.
</P>
<P>
   DEET products can be applied directly to the skin, but it is
safer with children to apply it to their clothing (it may, however,
damage plastics, vinyl, spandex, rayon and acetate). The problem
is, mosquitoes will bite any exposed skin that is not treated; DEET
on the nose will not protect the cheeks or forehead. Avoid putting
DEET near a child's eyes and mouth, on any cuts or abrasions, or on
the hands of small children.
</P>
<P>
   Citronella, a natural substance, is another time-honored
repellent. It is the active ingredient in Avon's Skin-So-Soft, the
bath oil that has acquired a sizable market as a repellent. Its
protection is short-lived, however, and although safer than DEET,
it is not as effective a repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Another natural repellent said to be particularly effective in
warding off mosquitoes is soybean oil. Two percent soybean oil is
the active ingredient in Bite Blocker, which also contains a
sunscreen. But Dr. Hebert said this product tends to sting the skin
and has an unpleasant odor, which would discourage its use.
Although rubbing the skin with kitchen soybean oil has not yet been
formally tested as a repellent, it would be safe for children and
may be worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are more concerned about ticks than mosquitoes,
since some ticks _ the deer tick in particular _ carry the agent
that causes Lyme disease. Permethrin, found in the tick repellents
Permanone and Duranon, is highly effective, far better than DEET,
Dr. Hebert said. It not only repels ticks; it kills them on
contact.
</P>
<P>
   But while permethrin is the active ingredient in products put on
skin to treat scabies and lice, it has not been tested for safety
as a repellent applied to skin. Therefore, experts insist that
permethrin repellent should never be applied directly to a child's
skin. Instead, it should be sprayed only on clothing and shoes and
equipment like tents, sleeping bags and netting. It will remain
effective through several washings, the physicians wrote. Dr.
Hebert said Permanone, which is generally not sold in pharmacies
and supermarkets, can usually be found in hardware, garden supply
and sporting goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   For the most complete protection against ticks, Drs. Hebert and
Carlton suggested applying a DEET-containing product to skin and a
permethrin product to a child's clothing. To minimize exposure,
repellent should be washed off with soap and water when the child
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Clever manufacturers have come up with a way to kill two bugs
with one stone. Several now make products that combine an insect
repellent with a sunscreen. However, according to a study published
last year in the journal The Lancet, the presence of DEET, found in
several combination products, can undermine the effectiveness of
the sunscreen, reducing its SPF (sun protection factor) rating by
about a third. Check the label before you buy. If you choose a
combination product with DEET, it would be best to buy one with a
high SPF _ 30 or more _ since you may be getting less than the
stated sun protection.
</P>
<P>
   Also, keep in mind that it would not be safe to reapply a
DEET-containing product to a child's skin every two hours, as may
be needed to get adequate sun protection. The Texas doctors suggest
instead using a combination product made with citronella as the
repellent. Or you can try adding soybean oil to your child's
favorite sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   One final point: It is also worth remembering that no insect
repellent is very effective against stinging insects like bees,
yellow jackets and other wasps and fire ants. Nor do black flies,
which are biters, seem to have much respect for repellents
currently on the market. (Dr. Hebert said that DEET does repel
black flies, but you can't prove it by my experience.) Avoiding
such insects is the best defense.
</P>
<P>
   Children should be taught not to disturb stinging insects and
especially not to flail wildly at them; these insects use their
stingers for defense, not procreation; they sting when they feel
threatened. If your child is stung, consult a doctor to prescribe a
steroid or to remove a stinger that was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Black flies are seasonal biters, usually attacking in late
spring in cooler regions like New England and the Upper Midwest. If
you can't avoid black fly territory during the biting season,
covering up with loose-fitting clothing is probably the best
defense, followed by small amounts of repellents containing
2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, an ingredient found in OFF! and 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as my family discovered on a June camping trip in Minnesota,
staying immersed in water works, too.

FEW CAN AFFORD THE JAGUAR XJR, BUT IT'S A FINE MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone can afford a car like the $67,400 Jaguar XJR sedan.
But after a few minutes behind the wheel of this baby, some of you
just might start running some numbers though your head to see if
you could somehow pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you don't really need that bigger house, fancy motor
home, or sleek new sailboat after all _ especially with the XJR
beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, everyone has to have a car, so why not make it a nice
one _ a really nice one that costs just slightly more than the most
expensive Lexus, but has oh, so much more curb appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, the XJR has a lot more than curb appeal, however. The
British have redesigned the XJ sedan line for 1998, retaining the
distinctive exterior that appeared in 1995, but completely
replacing the mechanical components and interior.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical components include the all-new 4.0-liter V-8
engines that replace last year's inline-six and V-12 of the former
XJ6, XJR and XJ12.
</P>
<P>
   Base, extended-length and uplevel Vanden Plas models get the
normally aspirated V-8 with 290 horsepower and 290 foot-pounds of
torque, with list prices beginning at $54,750.
</P>
<P>
   Our top-of-the-line XJR came with a supercharged version of the
V-8, rated at a whopping 370 horsepower and 387 foot-pounds of
torque. That's enough power to propel the XJR from zero to 60 mph
in 5.4 seconds, which Jaguar says makes the vehicle the fastest
production automatic-transmission sedan sold in North America.
(Lexus makes the same claim for its new GS 400 sedan. I haven't put
them side by side to see who's telling the truth but my money is on
the Jag.)
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea about how powerful this car is: Flooring the
gas pedal gives you the feel of a jet racing down the runway toward
takeoff _ not just any jet, but the supersonic Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The speedometer goes to 170 mph, but top speed is electronically
limited to 155 mph, just 5 mph more than the XJ8. But the big
difference in the engines is noticeable at lower speeds, when
you're in a passing situation. On the freeway when you're ready to
change lanes, you merely point the XJR toward an open spot just
ahead of you and goose the pedal; nothing is going to catch you
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   XJ8 models get a Jaguar-built five-speed automatic transmission.
But to handle the extra power of the XJR's engine, Jag uses a
five-speed Mercedes-Benz automatic in this model.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the mechanical and electrical components of the
new XJ cars is supposed to be much improved, thanks to the efforts
of Ford Motor Co., which now owns Jaguar. One of Jag's biggest
problems in the past was a really poor-quality electrical system,
but the new system was redesigned by Ford to have fewer splices and
much higher reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned interior is elegant by anyone's standards, with
generous use of Connolly leather on seating surfaces and a highly
polished bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dash, console and doors
of the XJR (other models get walnut trim).
</P>
<P>
   Seats are comfortable _ especially the well-padded front buckets
with 12-way power adjustments. The rear seat is roomy enough for
three full-size adults, with ample leg and head room despite the
low-profile roof of the XJ series.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything was perfect with the interior ergonomics,
however. Every time I put the key in the ignition, my hand bumped
the windshield wiper switch into the ``on'' position; the parking
brake lever sticks out to the right of the driver's right leg, and
pressed into my leg rather uncomfortably while I drove; and the
transmission was difficult to get all the way into ``park'' on
first try. To remove the key from the ignition, I had to push on
the transmission lever a second time to jiggle it all the way into
park.
</P>
<P>
   These are rather minor annoyances but they shouldn't be there in
a car that costs this much.
</P>
<P>
   Although the XJ is almost entirely new for 1998, Jaguar wisely
retained most of the exterior styling from the previous generation,
including the signature grille and four-headlight arrangement. The
beautiful jaguar hood ornament still reigns over the front end.
</P>
<P>
   Design differences in the XJR from the XJ8 include 18-inch
five-spoke wheels with ultra-low-profile tires and a distinctive
mesh radiator grille that dates to the classic Jags of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology abounds. The XJR comes with automatic traction
control, four-wheel antilock brakes, speed-sensitive
rack-and-pinion power steering, front and side air bags for the two
front occupants, and a Harman Kardon 240-watt AM/FM/cassette audio
system with trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is smooth and virtually bump-free, thanks in part to
the front double-wishbone suspension. The interior is whisper-quiet
at highway speeds because of generous use of sound-deadening
materials throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   Road handling isn't as good as that of a good sports car, but
for a two-ton sedan, it's more than adequate. The vehicle is fun to
drive on curves, holding the road very well.
</P>
<P>
   Standard amenities include automatic air-conditioning, power
tilt-and-slide sun roof, tilt-and-telescopic steering column,
memory system for seat and mirror positions, front and rear fog
lights, engine-immobilizing security system, automatic headlights
and a built-in garage-door opener.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy estimates are amazingly high for such a
powerful engine: 16 miles per gallon in the city and 21 on the
highway. Still, the car carries a $1,000 U.S. gas-guzzler tax built
into the list price. The tank holds 21.4 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker on our test car, which came with no options (it
didn't need any), was $67,980, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   NEW GRAND CHEROKEE: Chrysler Corp. Last week rolled out the
redesigned Jeep sport-utility for 1999, with a new exterior look,
more luxurious interior and lots of new features, including a spare
tire that now is tucked out of sight under the rear cargo area
instead of taking up room in the cargo compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior is less angular, but it still looks like a Grand
Cherokee, with the distinctive grille and stance of the previous
model. The interior is roomier than before, and the body overall is
four inches longer, two inches higher and one-and-a-half inches
wider. Step-in height has been reduced by an inch.
</P>
<P>
   The inline six-cylinder engine has been revised, raising
horsepower from 185 to 195. An all-new V-8 engine will be standard
in Limited models and optional on the Laredo version; it's a
4.7-liter V-8 with 235 horsepower, up from 220 hp in the current
5.2-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler will begin building the new Grand Cherokee later this
month; the vehicles will go on sale in late August. No prices have
been announced yet, but they are expected to remain competitive
with other sport-utilities in this class, including the
Mercedes-Benz M-class.

`AFFLUENZA': WELL-INTENTIONED BUT HEAVY HANDED 
</HEADLINE>

 By WALTER GOODMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The PBS audience was introduced to the dire syndrome of
``affluenza'' last year in an earnestly intentioned yet lightly
delivered documentary that made a case against greed, surfeit,
waste and related ills. Tuesday night brings a sequel, an earnestly
intentioned, earnestly delivered documentary that is heavy-handed
enough to send viewers rushing to the shopping mall to waste some
money.
</P>
<P>
   One of the program's producers, Vivia Boe, announces that ``in
many ways, the American Revolution was a rebellion against
materialism, and seeking independence from stuff is entirely within
the spirit of Independence Day.'' John De Graaf, another producer
of ``Escape From Affluenza,'' announces that consumers are tired of
trying to keep up with the Joneses. It's the sort of hot air that
ought to be recycled for home heating.
</P>
<P>
   It's a case of high-minded messages being drummed in so
relentlessly, so humorlessly and with such an air of
self-satisfaction that you want to hang the messengers, all of whom
have given up the rat race and are devoting themselves to good
works like helping the needy, buying little and wasting nothing.
Some of them run operations like the Money Masters Program for
youngsters and the New Road Map Foundation for the frugally
inclined and the Northwest Earth Institute, which combats, among
other ailments, stress and ``resource exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, alas, is that virtue alone does not invigorating
television make, unless you are entranced by the pleasures of
composting. So while wishing well the apostles of simple, frugal,
environmentally conscientious living celebrated here, and while
admiring anyone who chooses to read to the blind instead of making
a million dollars on Wall Street, I confess I was relieved by the
hour's end just to get away from these people.

   The workings of Heathrow Airport in London must be more
interesting than ``Airport,'' the three-part series that begins
Thursday night on PBS with attention to the doings of the official
airport photographer, the unsuccessful efforts of a couple of
customs officers to catch suspected drug traffickers, the training
sessions for flight attendants and incidental activities.

   Unless you are excited by the sight of a photographer in pursuit
of Melanie Griffith and Joan Collins speeding through the

as stimulating as a made-for-cable infomercial.

 &HT;    Almost 10 years later, letters to sick boy keep coming
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee

<TEXT>
<P>
   A nun in New York had six bags of cards hand-made by children,
ready to send to the young boy with an inoperable brain tumor who
wanted to hold the world record for the most get-well cards
received.
</P>
<P>

the world record _ at 33 million cards _ back in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly a decade since Craig Shergold, then a
9-year-old boy in England, embarked on the world record campaign
with assistance from Atlanta-based Children's Wish Foundation. And
it's about time that it stopped, foundation officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite as chaotic as the early days, but it's still
the same situation,'' said Christy Chappelear Andrews, public
relations director for the Children's Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Well-meaning cards still stream in. Some are addressed to
``Craig Sherwood,'' ``Craig Sherford'' and other similar names.
Cards also have gone to other organizations, and some people send
business cards, the result of chain letters run amok.
</P>
<P>
   After Shergold was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1989, the
foundation added Shergold's goal to its list of wishes and helped
him receive 16 million get-well cards in 1990, the first time
Shergold set the world record. It also brought him to the attention
of Virginia billionaire John Kluge, who financed an operation at
the University of Virginia Medical Center to remove most of the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   When Shergold set the world record for the second time, he and
his family asked that people stop sending the cards. Many still
haven't gotten the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the cards I wouldn't be here today,''
Shergold said. ``The cards give me so much spiritual upliftment.
They make me so happy. But I just wish it would stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now healthy and attending college in England, 19-year-old
Shergold remains the world record holder for the most get-well
cards received. According to the 1993 Guinness Book of Records, the
next closest competitor is Jarrod Booth of Salt Spring Island,
British Columbia, Canada, who collected 205,120 Christmas cards in
February 1990. The Guinness Book of World Records, after updating
the number of cards that continued rolling in, retired the category
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone tried to top that, the post office would go
bananas,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the category was closed, volunteers at the Children's
Wish Foundation stopped counting at 100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the volunteers' jobs are far from done. They come in twice a
week for six hours at a time, and in a warehouse behind the
foundation's headquarters, they sort through the stacks of mail,
open and divide the cards according to paper quality and send them
to a recycling center.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Wish Foundation is the only organization
authorized by the Shergold family to receive and open the mail, but
cards also keep coming to the Phoenix-based Make a Wish Foundation
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Brain Tumor Foundation for Children, a non-profit
organization based in Georgia, has been fielding telephone calls
from well-wishers checking the address before they send a batch of
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Allman, the executive director of the Brain Tumor
Foundation for Children, told the nun to send the children's
hand-made cards to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last month, she has had to tell nearly 20
well-wishers, including the Chicago Bulls, that the chain letter _
which now also circulates as a forwarded e-mail _ is no longer
relevant.

 &HT;    Visitors at Botancial Garden say stinky flower doesn't smell
that bad
 &HT;    Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As bad smells go, you've had worse elevator rides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the buildup, the celebrated stinking flower of Atlanta _
the gigantic Amorphophallus titanum, blooming at the Atlanta
Botanical Garden _ didn't rank with the rankest scents you've ever
whiffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smells a little like dirty socks,'' said John Allison, who
dropped by to see the bloom Monday with his wife, Joan. ``We
expected rotting human flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   What many had feared would be an assault on their nostrils
turned out to be a feast for their eyes and titillation to the
other senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question I get most frequently is `What does the stalk
feel like?' '' said Carolyn White, the security officer who'd been
assigned to guard the flower since it bloomed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them the guy that waters it said it feels like
sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garden's titan blossom is only the seventh produced in this
country. The flower is native to Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   At more than 5 feet tall, Atlanta's bloom may be the largest
ever in the United States. Garden officials think so, anyway. This
week, T-shirts will go on sale with a picture of the flower and
this boast: ``Our Amorphophallus titanum is bigger than yours.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the parking lot was jammed to overflowing on a day
when the Garden normally is closed. Four TV crews showed up, along
with hundreds of paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   The bloom peaked Sunday, and its main stalk will topple any day.
Garden curator of tropical plants Ron Gagliardo, said the bloom
will stay on display through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it topples, we may cut it open and put a mirror above it
so people can see the smaller blooms inside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the plant has become an overnight scentsation.

 &HT;    Lovitz joins ``Newsradio'''s cast
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, former ``Saturday Night Live'' funnyman Jon Lovitz
will join the cast of NBC's ``NewsRadio'' this fall, playing a new
character to replace the late Phil Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this for Phil,'' Lovitz told Variety. ``There's
nothing more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman was shot to death in his California home earlier this
year, apparently by his wife, who then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to Phil, he called Jon 'the most
naturally funny' person he'd ever met,'' said ``NewsRadio'' creator
Paul Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a creative standpoint, there was never any question about
Jon Lovitz being our first choice,'' added Brad Grey, executive
producer and chairman of Brillstein Grey Entertainment, which makes
``NewsRadio'' for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Lovitz, who earlier this year starred in an ABC pilot that did
not get picked up for fall, will likely portray a character in the
``NewsRadio'' newsroom who was an old friend of Bill McNeal, the
role played by Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers are reportedly considering having McNeal
pass away as an explanation for his absence.

 &HT;    As Lycos surges, sky seems to be limit for Net stocks
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lycos, known for its search engine of the same name
(http://www.lycos.com), announced a 2-for-1 stock split Monday and
then saw its stock soar, following a pattern set by other Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos jumped $20.50 to $99.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and other Internet stocks already
at records got a further boost from the Lycos announcement.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no ceiling for Internet stocks lately, with
most of the excitement coming from investor optimism that media
companies will buy them, fueled _ many analysts think _ by NBC's
investment last month in Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic rises in Internet stocks over the past month, with
many hitting all-time highs, left Wall Street analysts looking on
in wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet stocks are obviously making moves that are not
based on anybody doing arithmetic,'' said Robert Herwick, president
of Herwick Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the meteoric rise of these stock prices, (the Web
companies) are still small companies compared to the giants who
might want to acquire them,'' said Jeff Sadler, an analyst with
Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the speculation has been centered on rumors that Web
navigation companies such as Lycos, Netscape and Excite were prime
targets for acquisition by major media companies. AT&AMP;T (which plans
to merge with Tele-Communications Inc.), Time Warner and CBS are
some of the traditional media companies looking for new
distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler compares the current Web stock frenzy to the early days
of the biotechnology industry. ``In the early stages of biotech,
everybody's stock went up. Some were delivering on their promises,
and others weren't. Then came the retractions. This is not unusual
in the early stages of emerging companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos is certainly one portal (trade jargon for a search
engine) that needs a partner and is likely to (be acquired) next,''
predicts Forrester Research analyst Chris Charron. ``Lycos has the
traffic and the strong technology to be an attractive partner. The
investors believe there is media support for this space. Companies
are looking to buy in. Compared to the price of Yahoo!, Lycos may
look attractive. ``
</P>
<P>
   The Lycos stock split is payable to shareholders of record Aug.

   A grizzled old man was eating in a truck stop when three Hell's
Angels bikers walked in. The first walked up to the old man, pushed
his cigarette into the old man's pie and then took a seat at the
counter. The second walked up to the old man, spit into the old
man's milk and then he took a seat at the counter. The third walked
up to the old man, turned over the old man's plate, and then he
took a seat at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word of protest, the old man quietly left the diner.
Shortly thereafter, one of the bikers said to the waitress, `Humph,
not much of a man, was he?`

bricks shy of a load, or two pickles shy of a barrel. To prove it,
sometimes they offer Junior his choice between a nickel and a dime.
He always takes the nickel, they say, because it's bigger. One day
after Junior grabbed the nickel, Tim got him off to one side and
said, `Junior, those boys are making fun of you. They think you
don't know the dime is worth more than the nickel. Are you grabbing
the nickel because it's bigger, or what?` Junior said, `Well, if I
took the dime, they'd quit doing it!`

   I was riding home on the No. 3 train during rush hour when a
mother, babe-in-arms, and a little boy with a bag of potato chips
came into the car. The little boy bounced down next to me and
continued working on the chips. The mother was standing.
</P>
<P>
   I am aged and not inhibited about offering gentle criticism. I
asked the boy whether he didn't think his mother would like to sit.
Without missing a chip, he bellowed: ``Ma, do you want to sit?''
</P>
<P>
   She said ``no'' just as he added, ``cause there's a woman here
who wants to give you her seat.''

   The 60ish man was slightly paunchy but nattily dressed as he
stepped onto the 66th Street crosstown bus. After several tries, he
still couldn't get his Metrocard properly placed in the slot. Trudy
Linfield was sitting behind the driver and enjoyed this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Driver: ``You have terrible technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger: ``I have to hear that from you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know New York is a tough town,'' writes Richard Donsky, but
this sign in Soho struck him as extreme: ``Unauthorized Parkers:
License plates will be removed, air will be taken out of tires.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you define a New Yorker? Susan Welsher Jereski was in a
restaurant recently sitting next to two women discussing their
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   One said she had a terrace. The other sniffed: ``I wouldn't want
a terrace. I'm not the outdoorsy type.''
</P>
<P>
   The young businessman, busy at his laptop, smelling faintly of
gin, was sprawled over three seats during the rush hour on the E
train. To his left were reference books; to his right, a briefcase
and papers.
</P>
<P>
   As I indicated I would like a seat, he pointed to an elderly
lady, snoozing and occupying two seats and asked, ``Why don't you
sit over there?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him this was a subway and not his office; he gathered his
things and moved over, muttering, ``You should have some common
courtesy when you see people working.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, my eyes wandered to his laptop display which
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York subways are full of jackasses. This 40-45 year
old man just disrupted my work by demanding to sit next to me. What
a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   I took out my notebook and started writing my version of this
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The man continued typing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The bozo's taken out a notebook and I think he's writing about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been interesting to see where this would have
gone, but I had to get off. Still, he made my day. I'm 58.

   Dominick Coviello was in a Kmart looking for a good buy in
litter for his ferrets and discovered a brand he had not seen
before. The shape of the bucket was unusual; it held 25 rather than
22 pounds and the price was $1 less than that of the smaller
amount.
</P>
<P>
   He was so pleased with his find that he tried to share it with a
fellow shopper whom he presumed was also in search of a best buy.
Did he get any appreciation? No.
</P>
<P>
   The other litter shopper wasn't interested: ``I'm a little more
concerned with quality,'' he said.

   My mother, a psychoanalyst, received a message on her answering
machine that was intended for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, thinking he was leaving a message for ``John,''
announced that he was going to be on television that night and
named the time and channel.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was distressed because he did not leave a return phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited about being on television,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what did you do?'' I asked.

<P>
   To which she replied: ``What could I do, I went home and
watched.''

   Madeline Greenberg was waiting her turn at her favorite hot-dog
vendor on First Avenue and 34th Street when the young man in front
of her asked for mayo on his large spicy sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The vendor picked up a plastic bottle and squirted the pale
dressing along the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenberg couldn't help it. She looked at the customer and
said: `You're not from New York, are you?''

<P>
   The man laughed and admitted that he was from California.

   The day Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was on the
East Side of Manhattan, Julia Koenig and Cara Eckert were walking

   They were behind a couple who Ms. Koenig defined as ``clearly
tourists, maps hanging out of their pockets, cameras hung around
their necks and walking much more slowly than the natives.''

   The husband said to the wife: ``What do you think all the cement
barriers and wooden horses along the sidewalk are for?''

 By GAIL BENSINGER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran _ The great 14th century lyric poet Hafez, who has
touched the emotions of ordinary people for 600 years, never
strayed far from his home in this ``city of roses and
nightingales.'' His petal-strewn tomb sits in the middle of a park
filled with flowers and hordes of schoolchildren, all of them eager
to practice their English on foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   When we tell them where we are from, the Farsi word ``Amrika''
whips around each clump of laughing girls, clad like flocks of
crows in miniature black chadors, and rambunctious boys in plaid
shirts and sneakers. Eyes widen, giggles increase, queries quickly
outstrip the limited English these kids have learned so far.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks this spring, I joined a group of San Francisco Bay
Area residents on a journey that few Americans have experienced in
the last two decades of problematic U.S.-Iran relations. By the end
of the trip, we agreed that we have rarely, if ever, been made to
feel so welcome as Americans anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran and the United States have not had formal ties since the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led a successful revolution that ousted
the U.S.-backed shah and installed the Middle East's first Islamic
government. Nonetheless, last year's election of President Mohammad
Khatami, considered a moderate by Iranian standards, has brought
the suggestion of a thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised CNN interview early this year, Khatami welcomed
exchanges by Iranian and U.S. scholars and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government imposes no travel restrictions for Americans
going to Iran, although the required visas are difficult to come by
except through travel agencies with arrangements that have been
authorized by Iran's tourism ministry.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the number of American tourists has barely reached a
trickle. Yet everywhere we went in this huge and fascinating
country, we were approached by Iranians eager to meet foreigners
and astonishingly frank in their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   A teenager in Isfahan asked whether it was true boys and girls
in America go to the beach together. A Shiraz college student
described her computer studies, complaining that her university's
equipment was far from state-of-the-art. A 25-year-old in the
picturesque village of Abyaneh told us he performed in an
unsanctioned rock band, playing an electric guitar he had bought on
the black market. ``You can get anything in Tehran,'' he reported.
A one-time U.S. bus driver who returned to Yazd to help his ailing
father run a spice stall said he longed to return to California.
</P>
<P>
   We were impressed by the openness that people displayed despite
the strict rules of behavior in this theocratic state.
</P>
<P>
   There still is plenty of evidence that, not very long ago,
Americans were anything but welcome. In Tehran and other cities,
anti-American graffiti _ much of it fading with age _ is evident
everywhere, even if Iranians seem to ignore it as they go about
their business. The former U.S. embassy compound, where American
hostages were held captive for more than a year, is now a school
for the Revolutionary Guards.
</P>
<P>
   We were taken by the embassy compound for a look, but all we
could see was a wall, still covered with incendiary
English-language slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Iran has a long history of welcoming foreigners. One look
at the map suggests why: For millennia, it has served as a
crossroads. The Greeks and Romans came from the west, Silk Road
merchants trekked from China and India to the markets of the Near
East and Europe. The marauding hordes of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane
conquered ancient Persia and got civilized in the process. The
Ottoman Turks, the Arabs and the Russians took up residence.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all one-sided, either. In the sixth century B.C.,
Cyrus the Great founded the first great Persian kingdom, the
Achaemenian Empire, which expanded into what is modern-day India,
Libya and Egypt. The Sassanians brought Persia glory in the
pre-Islamic era, as did the Safavids in the 16th and 17th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   If all this makes for confusing history, it makes for terrific
sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Persepolis, near Shiraz, is the formidable stone heart of the
empire that prospered under Cyrus and his two brilliant
descendants, Darius and Xerxes. Designed to awe the peoples
absorbed into the Achaemenian kingdom, it continues to impress
visitors today.
</P>
<P>
   A town-sized stone platform, set in the midst of a plain far
from the source of the building materials, is approached by a huge
stairway. The remnants of towering columns as big around as
redwoods and astonishing statues of birds and beasts are still in
place, despite the depredations of time, of Alexander the Great,
who set his conquered enemy's capital on fire in 331 B.C., and even
of the zealots of the Islamic revolution who tried to knock down
these glorious behemoths with tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most magnificent sight here is the Parade of
Nations, a 300-foot bas-relief of life-sized subjects from each
corner of the empire marching up the stairs while offering tributes
to the king.
</P>
<P>
   An hour-long bus ride away is the site of Pasargadae, Cyrus'
first capital, now just a scattering of stone building foundations
and the remains of statues. My favorite was the bottom half of a
figure with one human leg and one fish tail.
</P>
<P>
   Near the textile-producing city of Kerman, Bam is like a giant
medieval sand castle come to life. The basic building material, as
it still is through much of Iran, was sun-baked brick covered with
mud, giving Bam the appearance of arising from the desert that
surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   Bam is now under restoration by Iranian archaeologists. Just
inside the gate, a set of steep stairs ends at a look-out point
that reveals labyrinthine paths through the houses and bazaars,
mosques and schools and stables, all leading up to the garrison
that housed soldiers who protected the citizenry from bandits and
invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran, surprisingly, is one of the least interesting tourist
destinations. The capital is a bustling, crowded, polluted, ugly
city located at the edge of a spectacular mountain range. Few
remnants of the old elegance have survived in the overcrowded
capital, and most architecture is undistinguished at best.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tehran is home to a number of wonderful museums,
including the Archaeological Museum, the Carpet Museum with
magnificent hand-made rugs and ``cartoons'' of patterns for the
weavers that are charming works of art in their own right, the Reza
Abbasi Museum with wonderful Persian miniatures, and the Glass and
Ceramics Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewels _ the underpinnings of the national currency _
are housed below the Bank Melli in a high-security vault that makes
evident the conviction of successive royal rulers that ``more is
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiraz, the loveliest city on our itinerary, has a refreshing
municipal garden with formal beds and paths winding through the
welcome shade offered by mature trees. It also has a wonderful
mosque, the domeless Friday mosque, topped with a wide band of
elegant tilework calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   Isfahan, a city in the throes of modernization, is located
astride the Zayande, one of Iran's few rivers, which is
crisscrossed by a series of graceful bridges. The city offers an
agglomeration of Islamic monuments dotted around the Imam Square,
an elegant polo-field-sized lawn where horse-drawn buggies vie for
the tourist trade. A number of distinct mosques, which offer a
range from the grand to the intimate, ring the plaza.

FREEDOM AND THE FIG LEAF IN U.S. ARTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   History proves that freedom of expression does not come easily
to even the greatest artists _ from the Beatles to Michelangelo,
from Mahler to Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, so soon after Independence Day 1998, artists fear the
chill of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than 10 days ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the
National Endowment for the Arts must consider public values in the
process of awarding grants.
</P>
<P>
   Is this tragedy or justice? With Independence Day sentiments
still fresh in mind, we offer a select list of controversial and
censored works. You decide.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ Blessing'' (c. 1500) _ The navel in this Giovanni
Bellini work was painted over in the 19th-century Victorian period
after it was deemed to render Christ too human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Judgment'' (1533-1541) _ Michelangelo's painting on the
east wall of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican drew criticism even
before it was finished. In 1564, an artist was hired, by order of
the Council of Trent, to paint clothing over the nude figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Armory Show (1913) _ When the infamous show of modern art
traveled to Chicago, professors of the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago told their students to stay away. A group of students
went anyway and became so outraged at Matisse's ``Blue Nude'' that
they threw stale bread rolls at it _ then hung Matisse in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fountain'' (1917) _ Under the pseudonym of ``R. Mutt,'' Marcel
Duchamp submitted a sculpture titled ``Fountain'' _ actually
nothing more than a urinal with a signature on it _ to an open show
produced by a group of avant-garde artists. The group refused to
accept it. (An additional irony: Duchamp was one of the group's
founding members.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mirth and Girth'' (1988) _ A painting of recently deceased
Chicago Mayor Harold Washington wearing women's lingerie was
``arrested'' after being displayed at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago. The painting, by graduating senior David K.
Nelson, represented the African-American hero figure as effeminate,
said the Chicago aldermen who persuaded police to take it away. The
painting was damaged in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doonesbury'' (1989-present day) _ Various newspaper editors
across the country refused at times to run Garry Trudeau's edgy
political comic strip, deeming it in bad taste or a mistreatment of
controversial issues. Problem topics included Alzheimer's disease,
AIDS, allegations of drug use by then-Vice President Dan Quayle
and, in February of this year, sexual allegations against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``X Portfolio'' (1992) _ Conservatives raised a stink about U.S.
government funding exhibits that offended them, including Robert
Mapplethorpe's ``X Portfolio'' (which contained gay themes, nudity
and graphic images).
</P>
<P>
   ``P--- Christ'' (1992-1998) _ Conservatives were angered by
Andres Serrano's photo of a crucifix displayed in a jar of human
urine. (Ironically, Serrano later would anger liberals by taking
pictures of members of the Ku Klux Klan.) This year, ``P---
Christ'' was included in a survey of Serrano's work at the National
Museum of Virginia in Melbourne, Australia, where it was destroyed
by two teen-agers with a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myra'' (1997) _ At Britain's Royal Academy, two angry viewers
threw eggs and ink on a portrait of a well-known British child
killer created from hundreds of imprints of a child's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Age of Innocence, The Last Day of Summer'' and ``Radiant
Identities'' (1998) _ Books by two noted photographers were hidden
from minors in a Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore in Brentwood, Tenn.,
after a controversy that led to three grand jury indictments in
Tennessee and Alabama. The books, by photographers Jock Sturges and
David Hamilton, include pictures of nude children and are
considered by opponents to be child pornography.

   A grizzled old man was eating in a truck stop when three Hell's
Angels bikers walked in. The first walked up to the old man, pushed
his cigarette into the old man's pie and then took a seat at the
counter. The second walked up to the old man, spit into the old
man's milk and then he took a seat at the counter. The third walked
up to the old man, turned over the old man's plate, and then he
took a seat at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word of protest, the old man quietly left the diner.
Shortly thereafter, one of the bikers said to the waitress, `Humph,

   &UR; DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NICKEL AND A DIME &LR;

   There's a little fellow named Junior who hangs out at Tim
Alley's Grocery Store. The owner Tim doesn't know what Junior's
problem is, but the boys like to tease him. They say he is two
bricks shy of a load, or two pickles shy of a barrel. To prove it,
sometimes they offer Junior his choice between a nickel and a dime.
He always takes the nickel, they say, because it's bigger. One day
after Junior grabbed the nickel, Tim got him off to one side and
said, `Junior, those boys are making fun of you. They think you
don't know the dime is worth more than the nickel. Are you grabbing
the nickel because it's bigger, or what?` Junior said, `Well, if I
took the dime, they'd quit doing it!`

lady, snoozing and occupying two seats and asked, ``Why don't you

   Dominick Coviello was in a Kmart looking for a good buy in
litter for his ferrets and discovered a brand he had not seen

22 pounds and the price was $1 less than that of the smaller
amount.

RESTLESS HEART FINDS HARMONY IN REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDAVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - When country supergroup Restless Heart quietly
stopped beating in 1994, most of the members went off to other
musical ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer John Dittrich formed the band Buffalo Club. Guitarist
Greg Jennings joined Vince Gill's backing band.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Paul Gregg, the group's lanky, gregarious bass
player. He went to work at his family's chain of carwashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in, and they'll do a double take,'' Gregg says.
``The guys from Little Texas came through, and they're looking at
me. I just go, `Would you like your tires cleaned?' It's been
really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, always the group's quirkiest soul, says it was easy for
him to move into the business that his dad started. On the other
hand, when the call came for him to rejoin his former bandmates,
that was a tougher decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't miss the stage all that much,'' he admits. ``I worked
really hard at my business and trying to improve the spiritual side
of my life. It had been a fight to spend that many years on the
road. I was a little apprehensive to get back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band was on the road, few groups could touch Restless
Heart. The quintet created crystal harmonies that were almost
frighteningly pure. The guys weren't brothers, but they sure
sounded like it.
</P>
<P>
   They had an unerring sense about what made a good song. From
1986 through 1994, they were a mainstay on radio with tunes such as
the spritely ``Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)'' and the
haunting ``Dancy's Dream,'' a powerful look at a man in spiritual
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   And in the days when crossover was a dirty word, they were
constantly pushing the envelope. ``I'll Still Be Loving You,''
``When She Cries'' and the R&AMP;B-flavored ``Tell Me What You Dream''
all became pop hits without alienating country fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see people like LeAnn Rimes and Trisha Yearwood cross
over, it makes me think,'' Gregg says. ``It's interesting where
country is going and where it's been. It's like it's coming back
around to where it was when we first got in.''
</P>
<P>
   The group started to splinter in 1991. Lead singer Larry Stewart
took his distinctive voice and left for a solo career. The next
year, keyboardist Dave Innis departed.
</P>
<P>
   The group soldiered on, but pressures of the road mounted. It
was tough for Gregg, a married man with two kids. After the disc
``Matters of the Heart'' flopped in '94, the trio called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no perfect marriages, and there ain't no perfect
bands,'' Gregg says. ``But we've never had a situation where we
haven't been able to communicate with each other. That speaks very
highly of this band _ they're a class bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantly, reunion rumors began. They were all gossip
until the guys regrouped two years ago to make a tape for a
terminally ill fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really scary, like, `Been there, done that,' '' Gregg
says. ``But we could tell that there was still something there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, managers, agents and publicists were involved. The
group's old home, RCA Records, signed them to a new deal. It's
almost like the old days. The entire group is back, save for Innis.
Gregg is vague about the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some issues he has to work out,'' he says. ``We didn't
want to make his life miserable; we didn't want ours to be
miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has out a greatest-hits disc that features three
just-recorded songs. The first single, ``No End to This Road,'' is
rapidly moving its way up the chart. It's like the guys _ older and
wiser _ have climbed back aboard a ``Fast-Movin' Train,'' to quote
one of their standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife never understood how I walked away the first time,''
Gregg says. ``I mean, I took my guitars and locked them in the
closet. For four years, I never touched them. The stench about
knocked me over when I took them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg isn't sure how long this phase of Restless Heart will
last. There are no immediate plans past the reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fans have reacted positively. And judging from the
group's new songs, that unmistakable blend of voices is still
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be boastful, but some things just click,''
Gregg says. ``The way our harmonies blend, the way we sing with
each other . . . it's like we never missed a beat. I don't know any
other way to explain it. It's like the planets started to line up,
you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the four join voices for the hushed tones of ``For
Lack of Better Words.'' Gregg is not being boastful. This is one
man who should not spend his days washing cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if the music business would ever come back
around for me,'' he says with a sly chuckle. ``I wanted to make
sure I had something else to fall back on.'' &QL;

   A grizzled old man was eating in a truck stop when three Hell's
Angels bikers walked in. The first walked up to the old man, pushed
his cigarette into the old man's pie and then took a seat at the
counter. The second walked up to the old man, spit into the old
man's milk and then he took a seat at the counter. The third walked
up to the old man, turned over the old man's plate, and then he
took a seat at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word of protest, the old man quietly left the diner.
Shortly thereafter, one of the bikers said to the waitress, `Humph,
not much of a man, was he?`
</P>
<P>
   The waitress replied, `Not much of a truck driver either. He
just backed his truck over three motorcycles.`

</P>
<P>
   Sherlock Holmes and Watson were on a camping and hiking trip.
</P>
<P>
   They had gone to bed and were lying there looking up at the sky.
Holmes said, `Watson, look up. What do you see?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, I see thousands of stars.`
</P>
<P>
   `And what does that mean to you?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, I guess it means we will have another nice day tomorrow.
What does it mean to you, Holmes?`
</P>
<P>
   `To me, it means someone has stolen our tent.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIRTY JOKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man walks into a house of ill repute and tells the
madam that he would like a young woman for the night. The madam
gives him a puzzled look and asks, `Just how old are you, mister?`
</P>
<P>
   `Why,` the old patron says, `I'm 98 years old today!`
</P>
<P>
   `Ninety-eight!` the madam exclaims. `Don't you realize you've
had it?`
</P>
<P>
   `Oh,` he says, `then how much do I owe you?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NICKEL AND A DIME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There's a little fellow named Junior who hangs out at Tim
Alley's Grocery Store. The owner Tim doesn't know what Junior's
problem is, but the boys like to tease him. They say he is two
bricks shy of a load, or two pickles shy of a barrel. To prove it,
sometimes they offer Junior his choice between a nickel and a dime.
He always takes the nickel, they say, because it's bigger. One day
after Junior grabbed the nickel, Tim got him off to one side and
said, `Junior, those boys are making fun of you. They think you
don't know the dime is worth more than the nickel. Are you grabbing
the nickel because it's bigger, or what?` Junior said, `Well, if I
took the dime, they'd quit doing it!`

<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was riding home on the No. 3 train during rush hour when a
mother, babe-in-arms, and a little boy with a bag of potato chips
came into the car. The little boy bounced down next to me and
continued working on the chips. The mother was standing.
</P>
<P>
   I am aged and not inhibited about offering gentle criticism. I
asked the boy whether he didn't think his mother would like to sit.
Without missing a chip, he bellowed: ``Ma, do you want to sit?''
</P>
<P>
   She said ``no'' just as he added, ``cause there's a woman here
who wants to give you her seat.''

   The 60ish man was slightly paunchy but nattily dressed as he
stepped onto the 66th Street crosstown bus. After several tries, he
still couldn't get his Metrocard properly placed in the slot. Trudy
Linfield was sitting behind the driver and enjoyed this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Driver: ``You have terrible technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger: ``I have to hear that from you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know New York is a tough town,'' writes Richard Donsky, but
this sign in Soho struck him as extreme: ``Unauthorized Parkers:
License plates will be removed, air will be taken out of tires.''

<P>
   How do you define a New Yorker? Susan Welsher Jereski was in a
restaurant recently sitting next to two women discussing their
apartments.
</P>

coolest of the cool: ``sub-zero,'' ``dry ice,'' so cool he could
``die of hypothermia.''
</P>
<P>
   What has Will done to become so cool? Well, in the last three
months he has slept with a woman he didn't know very well; he has
spent more than 300 pounds (about $500) on a jacket; he has taken
Ecstasy in a club (not at home as a sociological exercise); he has
eaten in a restaurant that serves polenta and shaved Parmesan, and
he has both grown a goatee and shaved it off again.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rob, the narrator of Hornby's highly acclaimed first novel,
``High Fidelity'' (1995), Will is another one of those
thirtysomething men who give new meaning to Cyril Connolly's phrase
``perpetual adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   At 36, he has never held a job _ he lives off a comfortable
stipend from his father, who penned a treacly novelty song called
``Santa's Super Sleigh'' _ and he congratulates himself on his
ability to stay afloat on the effluvia of modern life: on movies,
pop songs, magazines and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life took up so much time,'' Will thinks, ``so how could one
work and, say, take a bath on the same day? He suspected that one
or two people he knew were making some pretty unsavory shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``About a Boy'' retraces much of the same comic ground
as ``High Fidelity,'' it's an altogether glibber, slicker
production that lacks the earlier novel's idiosyncratic pop and
sizzle. ``Boy'' feels less anchored in a particular place and time,
perhaps because it boasts fewer knowing references to pop culture,
perhaps because it plows ahead stolidly, like a movie script,
without pausing to glance around.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that ``Boy'' isn't a lot of fun to read. It's
just that Hornby's wonderfully antic sense of humor is employed
here in the service of a contrived story line that forces his
engagingly churlish hero to undergo a series of predictably
transformative _ and redemptive _ adventures.
</P>
<P>
   We pretty much know Will's problems _ defensiveness, emotional
detachment and a fear of commitment _ the moment we meet him, and
we can pretty much guess what's going to happen to him a couple of
beats later.
</P>
<P>
   Will, of course, is a kind of fictional descendant of Kingsley
Amis' Lucky Jim and William Boyd's Morgan Leafy, and he's also a
sort of spiffed-up British version of ``Seinfeld's'' George
Costanza.
</P>
<P>
   He not only embodies just about everything that women like
Bridget Jones (not to mention her real-life counterparts) find so
frustrating about single ``eligible'' men _ namely, a carefully
honed talent for wriggling out of commitment, maturity and honor _
but he's also proud of the maneuvers he has developed for avoiding
unnecessary emotional clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Having dated a gorgeous single mother named Angie (who he thinks
would normally be out of his league), Will comes to the conclusion
that ``children democratized beautiful single women'': Children, he
thinks, ``served as a symbolic blemish, like a birthmark or
obesity, which gave him a chance where previously there would have
been none.''
</P>
<P>
   After his affair with Angie ends, Will decides to seek out other
beautiful single mothers at a local meeting of SPAT (Single Parents
_ Alone Together). Will invents a fictional ex-wife for himself
(her name is Paula, he tells himself) and a fictional 2-year-old
son (his name is Ned, not Ted, he continually reminds himself) and
with these lies, he launches himself in the world of single
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Will does not meet a beautiful single mother, however. He meets
a sweet, troubled 12-year-old named Marcus, who needs a father.
Marcus is worried about his mother, who has tried to kill herself,
and he's worried about his own prospects at school, where he is
tormented by his classmates for being a nerd, a weirdo and a geek.
</P>
<P>
   Since Will is basically a 12-year-old himself, he and Marcus
soon form a bond. This is a little more emotional involvement _ a
little more clutter in his life _ than Will is used to, but he
figures he can use his vast knowledge of pop culture, his cool
quotient as it were, to help keep Marcus from being beaten up at
school.
</P>
<P>
   He buys Marcus some hip new sneakers, persuades him to get a
decent haircut and teaches him about Nirvana and Kurt Cobain.
Meanwhile, he meets a woman who apparently likes him because she
thinks Marcus is his son, a development that, needless to say,
leads to all sorts of further complications.
</P>
<P>
   Hornby uses his familiarity with adolescents and adolescent
behavior to get inside the heads of both Will and Marcus and to
give their lives an appealing specificity. In this novel, unlike
``Fidelity,'' however, he tends to spell out needlessly their
states of mind, rather than simply allowing their actions to speak
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He is constantly telling us things like ``Will had spent his
whole life avoiding real stuff'' or having Will say or think things
like: ``You could shut life out. If you didn't answer the door to
it, how was it going to get in?''
</P>
<P>
   This writerly tic has a way of making ``About a Boy'' feel even
more schematic than it really is. Yet if we can see the novel's
conclusion coming far off down the pike, Hornby's sharp
observations and his quirky comedic instincts ensure that our
journey there is entertaining, funny _ and occasionally affecting.

FEW LAW FIRMS REVIEW JUDGES' DISCLOSURE REPORTS, RECORDS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ... Federal judges outnumber U.S. senators 20-to-1.
Yet Senate staffers fielded roughly 450 requests.
</P>
<P>
   Even those statistics understate the vast disparity in
disclosure. Unlike the judiciary's reports, the public viewed those
filed by Congress thousands of times last year on the Internet and
through on-line services such as Lexis-Nexis.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, the courts spokesman, said judges' disclosure reports
(begin itals)should(stop itals) be less accessible than those filed
by legislators because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apples and oranges,'' he said of comparing judges with
senators. ``Is the goal to have 1,600 requests for judges' forms,
just because there are 1,600 requests for members of the House?''
</P>
<P>
   Wright dismissed Seller's arguments. ``Every time they don't
want to do something, they raise security,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the disclosure reports do not divulge judges' home
addresses. (Local telephone directories, on the other hand, list
the addresses of at least three Kansas City judges.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the court system's attitude is apparent at the
judiciary's administrative office in Washington, where the reports
are stored.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Congress and most federal agencies, the office lacks a
public reading room or even a walk-up counter. In fact, workers
there ask visitors to give two weeks' notice and to arrive only
between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think they would try to make some accommodation to
the public,'' said Doug Kendall, one of the few lawyers who have
visited the office. ``It is, after all, a financial disclosure
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers said workers there ``do the best they can'' with a small
staff and tight budget.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the newspaper's findings, judges in western
Missouri voted in May to make lists of their assets available for
anonymous review at the Kansas City courthouse. National court
officials are considering the system for a national model.
</P>
<P>
   But that might be a hard sell to some judges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, judges often grow agitated when warned that someone is
reviewing their reports, said John Howell, a financial disclosure
lawyer for the U.S. Judicial Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Judges routinely telephone to ask, ``Who is this person? Why
have they requested (the reports)?'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a housewife requested a judge's reports, prompting
him to comb a list of all litigants in his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned,'' the judge told Howell. ``Why would she
want to know what my holdings are?''
</P>
<P>
   Howell agreed that the situation was a security risk and urged
the judge to talk to a U.S. marshal. ``We work very closely with
the Marshals Service,'' Howell told the judge, ``and they have
other resources that can assist you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubet, the law professor, was astounded at Howell's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be investigating the background of someone who
requests public information,'' Lubet said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner agreed that the practice was troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of stuff that was supposed to be buried with
J. Edgar Hoover,'' Turner said, referring to the late FBI director.
``Members of the federal judiciary do not appreciate how chilling
and intimidating those kinds of actions can be to ordinary
Americans _ who have done nothing wrong.''

RURAL AREA'S CYBER REVOLUTION CREATES A BOOM WITHOUT URBAN STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUALALA, Calif. _ At their remote seaside cafe on the rugged
Mendocino coast, owners Pat Kelly and Bonnie Simons take turns
pouring coffee, scooping ice cream and _ during the lulls _ solving
the year 2000 computer problem for a $2 million software
development company 115 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the two San Francisco software executives packed
their attache cases and quit the city life, but not their corporate
careers. Now instead of commuting through crowds to the 14th floor
of a high-rise office building, they simply slip behind a blue
curtain that separates the front of the cafe from the office in
back.
</P>
<P>
   There, from a laptop in the tiny town of Gualala, they make a
comfortable living writing technical manuals and programs for the
Forecross Corp., all while realizing their dream of living on
California's beautiful northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can even watch the whales go by while we work,'' Simons
said, sipping fresh coffee from a mug.
</P>
<P>
   Simons and Kelly are among those who have swapped their suits
for sweat shirts, their mega-mainframe systems for portable word
processors and headed to this 80-mile stretch of craggy coastline
to work by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Locals have dubbed the area reaching from Jenner to Mendocino
``Silicon Coast,'' and boast that there are more computer users per
capita here than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Though no scientific data exist, a recent survey by the Coast PC
Users Group found that about 3,600 computers are in use in the
region, an area with about 6,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Another report compiled by the Mendocino Unified School District
showed that more than half the students in grades four through 12
use the Internet at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're just a bunch of country bumpkins out here,
but this is one of the most extraordinarily technical groups of
people anywhere,'' said Marshall Sayegh, 48, a former construction
supervisor who now creates business Web sites and technology links
from his home in Gualala.
</P>
<P>
   It won't take long, he hopes, for the virtual world to rebuild
the real economy along the Northern California coast, which has
declined with the faltering fishing and timber industries and made
residents heavily reliant on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   It all became possible just four years ago, after the Mendocino
Unified School District decided to go into business as the area's
only local-access Internet service provider by making its
cyber-connection publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Students had been able to use the Internet at school after NASA
paid for a dedicated phone line installed directly to the Ames
Research Center in Mountain View, which allowed them to reach the
World Wide Web without getting tangled in expensive long-distance
phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   The grant expired, but interest in Internet access was
flourishing. And though it was enormously expensive and risky,
``everyone saw the power and the potential in it,'' said Mitch
Sprague, an English teacher who spearheaded Mendocino High School's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Mendocino Community Network (mcn.org) has 2,500
subscribers and is the heart of the cyber revolution under way
along the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked in a small room tacked on to a class at the high school
_ its walls still unpainted and the wooden beams exposed _
expensive computer components fill three floor-to-ceiling columns.
</P>
<P>
   From behind the glass-paneled doors that protect them, green
lights blink as modems from Cuffy Cove to Schooner Gulch and miles
all around log on to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stacks of equipment are miles of bundled, intertwined
wires and telephone cords running along the walls, under the desks
and on the floor. The hum of the monitors and the buzz of fans used
to keep the equipment cool drone in the background as staffers on
headsets answer calls and questions from the network of people who
have come to depend on mcn.org as their lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even have students who live in houses without electricity
that are now connected to the Internet,'' teacher Deena Zarlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   They boot up with the help of wind or solar-powered systems,
12-volt batteries or propane generators to access anything and
everything just like their urban peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a tremendous amount of access to experiences,
people and resources that just wasn't possible before,'' said
Zarlin, who lives three miles off a dirt road half a mile from her
nearest neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, sometimes I'm even e-mailing while video
conferencing,'' she said. ``Now that's country living!''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of examples of how the Internet has changed
life in this picturesque, isolated terrain, said Jim Heid, who
hosts ``Point and Click Radio,'' a weekly computer talk show
simultaneously broadcast on the local public radio and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There's the construction worker in Fort Bragg who linked up,
found his true love in cyberspace and is now happily married; the
woman who used the Internet to trace long lost relatives and
arrange a reunion in Europe and the grandmother who gushed with
excitement when talking about sending and receiving e-mail to her
brood scattered across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a camera pointed outside my window that snaps a live
picture every five minutes (and posts it on my Web site), and a lot
of people tell me they check my weather cam before coming to the
coast so they can determine whether or not they need to wear a
sweater,'' Heid said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is business that is really booming, and not just for the
newcomers who bring their computer savvy to Silicon Coast. Internet
commerce has transformed some longtime locals, like Mickie Zekley,
into such successes that they've become hometown heroes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 25 years Zekley eked out a modest living in his
small shop in Mendocino that sells rare and exotic musical
instruments. Offerings at Lark in the Morning include flutes made
of turkey leg bones ($170) and 17th-century monkey grinder organs
from Germany than cost as much as $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Zekley began writing the computer program to
put his catalog on the Internet. Though the chore was difficult, it
has transformed his store into a million-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been phenomenal,'' he said. ``We used to send out
maybe 30 to 50 catalogs a week, now we mail out at least 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And his client list has grown from 2,000 names to more than
180,000, he said.

FEW LAW FIRMS REVIEW JUDGES' DISCLOSURE REPORTS, RECORDS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is complaining that federal judges make it
difficult for lawyers and litigants to see judges' financial
disclosure reports. But critics say recent revelations show that
the problem is worse than imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released federal documents reveal for the first time how
many of the nation's law firms reviewed the reports last year. The
grand total?
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen.
</P>
<P>
   Add in curious individuals and reporters, and the total inches
up to 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tiny,'' said Steven Lubet, a leading judicial ethicist
and a professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. ``I
would have expected more.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, thousands of people last year examined similar
reports filed by members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers blame the disparity on fear. Unlike Congress, the
judicial branch responds to each request by sending written notice
to the judge, reporting exactly who wants to look into those
assets. The warning gives the requester's address, occupation and
even his employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really intimidating,'' said U.S. District Judge Scott
O. Wright of Kansas City, Mo., an advocate for reform.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings prompt some judges to launch investigations into
the requesters and their motives. At times they call in the U.S.
Marshals Service for help.
</P>
<P>
   Critics called the practice troubling and likened it to the
FBI's old and widely condemned practice of investigating political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers interviewed said they would never review the
reports for fear of angering the judge who would decide their
lawsuits. Other lawyers were discouraged by the time-consuming
process involved in getting the reports, which are stored only in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judiciary has managed to hide its disclosures out of
sight,'' said James C. Turner, executive director of the legal
reform group HALT. ``But they are public documents, and the people
have a right to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   The top ranks of the judiciary are looking into making the
reports more widely available. Yet court administrators argue that
wider release of the asset lists could endanger judges, three of
whom have been murdered in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of Congress don't sentence dangerous drug kingpins to
life in prison,'' federal courts spokesman David Sellers said in a
written statement. ``When (judges) put a person behind bars for
life, they sometimes are left with a courtroom full of ruthless and
angry friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers could not cite an instance in which someone used the
lists, which do not divulge judges' addresses, to harm a judge.
Even so, Sellers said that the asset lists could be used
maliciously and that the first instance of harm would be one too
many.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over disclosure erupted in April after The Kansas
City Star published a series of articles that revealed dozens of
financial conflicts among federal judges. The articles also showed
how the court system's restrictions discouraged lawyers and
litigants from reviewing the those asset lists.
</P>
<P>
   The series sparked protest from Congress and became the focus of
a House subcommittee hearing. Two senators suggested posting
judges' assets on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate, court officials said they could not provide
detailed statistics on how often the public reviewed the reports.
</P>
<P>
   So The Star used public-records laws to obtain copies of every
Form AO-10a filed in the last year. The forms, never before
examined outside the judiciary, must be filled out by anyone
reviewing the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the story they revealed was disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2,000 judges filed disclosure reports in 1997. Yet the
judicial branch logged only about 100 requests for the reports. The
requests were made on behalf of 78 individuals and companies, many
of whom reviewed reports filed by several judges.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the requests came from journalists, who
often looked solely at the assets of Supreme Court justices.
Thirty-three of the requesters were individuals, ranging from
congressional researchers to prisoners checking on their trial
judges. The remaining requests came from lawyers or legal
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary's totals pale in comparison with those of other
public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges outnumber U.S. representatives by a 4-to-1 ratio.
Yet House staffers last year released 1,600 copies of the reports
filed by members of Congress. They also published the House reports
in a book distributed nationwide. - MORE -

QUESTIONS ABOUT RESIDENCE OFF-LIMITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Ken Lloyd _ a specialist in organizational behavior _ is a
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. His column moves Mondays
in the ``f'' financial news file. Send your questions to P.O. Box
260057, Encino, Calif. 91426 or by electronic mail to

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. One of the applicants for a position here has
had many residences over the past few years. His job stability has
been fairly good but I am wondering if his other moves are a sign
of problems.
</P>
<P>
   M.R. &QL; 
A. This is literally an applicant on the move, but the fact is that
his personal residences are literally none of your business. All of
your questions should be job-related, and his tendency to
frequently move from one residence to another not only is unrelated
to the job but is not predictive of any aspect of his future
performance on the job. After all, there are plenty of cases of
people who move around frequently and maintain high levels of
performance as well as cases of those who remain in the same
residence for years and years but whose performance resides
somewhere south of horrible.
</P>
<P>
   If your concern is whether he will be able to be at work during
normal working hours on a regular basis, you should ask him that.
If he has any demands, responsibilities, interests or commitments
that could interfere with his ability to be at work during normal
working hours, you can ask him that, too. Job-related questions are
the best predictors of future job performance.
</P>
<P>
   You indicated that this applicant has had fairly good job
stability. If you are trying to find an indicator of future job
stability, numerous studies have shown that past stability is the
predictor. By asking about an applicant's tendency to change
residences, you are actually asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having serious problems getting along with one of the
people who report to me. She has a difficult and abrasive
personality, and she is always ready to complain about whatever I
do. We have met with management to discuss this but nothing has
worked. What do you suggest in this type of situation?
</P>
<P>
   C.W.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your employee is overlooking an important part of her working
relationship with you: reality. The reality is that you are the
manager. It sounds like you have tried to establish a more cordial
and supportive working relationship with this individual but it is
not happening.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that your employee is entirely to blame. In
fact, she may perceive you as a difficult and abrasive person.
Either way, it is time for both of you to focus on the job that
needs to be done, rather than on personality characteristics. You
and this employee need to come to an arrangement regarding the
objectives, standards and performance expectations for her
position, and she should be evaluated strictly on her effectiveness
in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, if her abrasiveness is interfering with her
effectiveness, that should be noted in any formal assessment of her
performance. When she is given feedback, it should be in terms of
specific behaviors and measurable indicators of productivity,
rather than in terms of general descriptors or labels. You should
also provide her with some guidance regarding the kinds of steps
for her to take in order to meet the established standards. She
also needs to understand the reality of the consequences associated
with sub-par performance.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just finished a meeting with my direct supervisor and she
told me that I spend too much time trying to please everyone else
around here and that is ultimately going to hurt my career. Do you
agree and, if so, what can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin that fits
your situation: ``I cannot give you a formula for success, but
here's the formula for failure: Try to please everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   As you advance your career, your responsibilities increasingly
will place you in situations in which it will be impossible to
please all who work with you. You will be making decisions in a
myriad of areas that can be potentially upsetting to others,
whether in terms of your availability, priorities, performance
standards or enforcement of established policies.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that by placing excessive emphasis on pleasing
others, you end up pleasing no one, including yourself. Managers
who try to do so can be labeled as weak, pliable, unfair and even
unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who have a strong need to please others tend to have
a related need to be well-liked. Although there is nothing wrong
with wanting to be liked, it is not a great objective for people
who want to manage. For managers, the more appropriate objectives
are to be effective, professional, ethical and fair. And, by doing
so, such a manager has a very good chance of being well-liked. The
idea of being well-liked is best viewed as a byproduct of
management, rather than as an objective.

SPARE-PARTS BUSINESS KEEPS AIRCRAFT FLYING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star

<P>
   BATES CITY, Mo. _ Where you see the twisted propellers and
dented fuselage of a grounded airplane, Phil White sees a business
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Where you see an 180-acre field littered with junk and debris,
White sees a 30-year inventory of engines, electronics and other
valuable parts.
</P>
<P>
   That's why White is in the aircraft salvage business, and you're
not.
</P>
<P>
   On what was once an idle pasture on the eastern fringe of the
metropolitan area, White Industries is a field of dreams for pilots
and plane owners looking for the hard-to-find part to return their
flying machines to the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't specialize,'' White said. ``We run the entire gamut.
Whatever a pilot is flying, we'll have a part.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of the largest airplane salvage operations in
the United States, said a spokesman for the Airplane Owners and
Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   The salvage yard has 2,000 aircraft in various states of
disassembly, but that's not readily evident to the countless
drivers who whiz by the business as they drive on Interstate 70
near Bates City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   All they have seen, most likely, is (begin itals)one(end itals)
plane _ a weathered Lear jet perched along the northern frontage
road of the highway. That's the only clue that an airplane
graveyard lies a few hundred yards north.
</P>
<P>
   The obscure location doesn't hurt business. White said less than
1 percent of his business comes from walk-in customers. Clients
from around the world make their deals by phone, fax or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company began as a foreign auto-part business that White's
father, Terry White, founded. In the 1960s, it evolved into
aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a pilot, and he saw how hard it was to find parts for a
plane,'' Phil White said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder White operated the company on a 30-acre site on U.S.
40 in east Kansas City, Mo. Increasing vandalism and the need for
more space sent him out to Lafayette County in the early 1980s. The
site includes a 4,600-foot runway for the occasional fly-in
customer and 200,000 square feet of warehouse and office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't start one this size now,'' Phil White said. ``It
would take too long to build up the inventory. We have 30 years of
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the airplanes have had brushes with fame, but with 2,000
of them to keep track of, the facts can get a little hazy.
</P>
<P>
   One plane that crashed years ago in Alaska may have been owned
by Aristotle Onassis; another was used by Elvis Presley. One
appeared in one of the James Bond movies _ `` `Goldfinger,' I
think,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil White began working at the company as a kid. He mowed
grass, swept floors, pulled parts from planes, helped ship parts
and ultimately wound up in sales. In February, his father
``semi-retired'' and chose his son, 34, to run the company as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he still owns it,'' Phil White said. ``He has the final
say.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's 35 employees constantly have feelers out for
troubled aircraft. Each day, they scour Federal Aviation
Administration damage reports, and work the phones with insurance
companies and dealers looking to unload planes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of the planes at the salvage yard have been
involved in fatal accidents. Most planes end up in salvage for more
mundane reasons: Maybe a hangar falls onto a jet; a plane's landing
gear collapses; a pilot school shuts down and has a clearance sale;
or authorities seize a craft involved in illegal activities. White
buys about 190 aircraft a year.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, White had more than 30 planes scattered
throughout the United States that he had bought, but had not been
brought to the salvage yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to find someone to drive it here,'' he said.
``What's difficult is finding someone qualified to take an airplane
apart, especially a damaged aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases White sells whole planes when they can be repaired
for a reasonable cost and still fly. In most cases, the planes the
business acquires are sold for parts.
</P>
<P>
   Once White has the plane, workers typically strip it of the most
valuable components _ the engine and electronic equipment. Then the
customers come calling.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, plane owners in Florida needed a new nose for a
Fokker commuter plane after the original part was damaged. They got
in touch with White, negotiated a price, and for $15,000, White
sawed off the front of one of his Fokker commuter planes and
shipped it south.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the cockpit-less plane sits in a field waiting
until some other part is needed. Many planes at White Industries
share the same fate. They have been beheaded and their cockpits
sold to businesses needing flight simulators.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts fill the shelves of the warehouses. A collection of
plane noses looks like the wardrobe department of a ``Coneheads''
movie. Engine cowlings and wing tips are stacked to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many aircraft taking up space, most of the parts are
left unharvested in planes until a customer comes looking for a
particular item.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could take our phones out of service and do nothing but
inventory all the parts, and it would take a year's time,'' White
said.

ALLOW TIME FOR YOURSELF TO HAVE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Saturday was the Fourth of July _ a time for
barbecues, homemade ice cream and a chance to defrost my freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds crazy, but you'd be surprised how many women will unplug
the deep freeze the next few weeks. It's part of the ritual we
perform each summer before taking our vacations.
</P>
<P>
   I know it doesn't make sense. Most of us already are overwhelmed
by swim meets, baseball games and the extra load at the office as
the census at work dwindles during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   So why do we spend valuable time cleaning our homes when we
won't be there? It's probably the same reason we're usually the
ones who pick, plan and prepare for vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Sure I know at least one guy who stopped his mail and mowed his
lawn before taking a vacation, but he's pretty unusual. A lot of
men think they've done a lot if they got the traveler's checks and
bought the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, I realize that part of the problem is our own.
My husband doesn't care if we leave the house spotless. While he'd
rather not come home to a mess, he reasons that most things can
wait until we return.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of women I know don't see it that way. Not only do the
beds need to be made and the carpets vacuumed, the floors need to
be mopped and the laundry folded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if women don't have permission to have fun,'' said
Connie Russell, a licensed social worker and career development
coach. ``By making sure everything is done, women feel they've
earned the right to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, women are juggling many roles at
work and at home, and we have a difficult time saying no.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's advice is ``to give yourself permission to have fun
without first climbing Mount Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention to what you're doing,'' said Russell, who
admitted she took the time to clean her office before leaving town.
``Ask yourself: ``Is this necessary to do before I go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is. Most of us want to leave a clean house because
we know how busy we'll be at home and work when we're first back.
But maybe you can wait a few weeks to finish those photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   I'd take Russell's advice a step further. Not only should you
say no, you should lower your standards and ask for help,
especially from other family members.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the children will cram far too many toys and
books in their backpacks, let them do it. Not only will they be
sure to pack at least something they want, it's one fewer thing
you'll have to do.
</P>
<P>
   And while I'm at it, I think I'll ask my husband to help too.
The first thing he can do is pull the plug on the freezer.

   LITERATURE
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' by Mark Twain (1884) _
The incorrect grammar and phonetic spelling in Huck's first-person
account drew fire from sanctimonious elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Awakening'' by Kate Chopin (1899) _ It's a woman's sexual
awakening, a forbidden subject then and for a long time afterward.
Redeemed by the women's movement of the 1970s, it is now an
acknowledged classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Carrie'' by Theodore Dreiser (1900) _ This
groundbreaker in the mode of naturalism was widely suppressed
because the titular heroine was not made to suffer for her
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertram Cope's Year'' by Henry Blake Fuller (1919) _ Privately
printed after its original publisher capitulated to pressure and
withdrew it, this was the first novel to treat homosexuality
directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Main Street'' by Sinclair Lewis (1920) _ Especially in the
Midwest, libraries refused entry to a work that presented an
unflattering, exposelike view of small-town American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco Road'' (1932) and ``God's Little Acre'' (1933), both
by Erskine Caldwell _ Frank presentation of the depravity of poor
Southern ``white trash'' caused these books to be both censured and
(some printings) censored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' by John Steinbeck (1939) _ Although this
social protest novel took a Pulitzer Prize, pressure from church
and civic groups provoked bans in Boston and elsewhere, again on
grounds of language and depravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of Hecate County'' by Edmund Wilson (1946) _ These
linking short stories by America's foremost literary critic make up
virtually the only book to have been banned nationally on grounds
of sexual explicitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catcher in the Rye'' by J.D. Salinger (1951) _ Although
widely read in high school and junior high classrooms, this exalted
novel has been a perennial target for would-be censors because of
one four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portnoy's Complaint'' by Philip Roth (1969) _ Many works by
this author (the latest Pulitzer winner) have lived with scandal,
none so much as this much-attacked first-person revelation (to a
psychiatrist) of sexual mystery.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   ``Desire Under the Elms'' by Eugene O'Neill (1924) _ This gloomy
drama of stepson/stepmother incest was raided by police when the
production was moved from Greenwich Village to Manhattan. The
publicity improved attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All God's Chillun Got Wings'' by Eugene O'Neill (1924) _ This
O'Neill opus dealt with interracial marriage. The Ku Klux Klan
threatened the playwright, and city officials tried to shut down
the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Price Glory?'' by Maxwell Anderson (1924) _ The language
of the troops was considered shocking in this realistic depiction
of World War I combat and its emotional toll on the fighting men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cradle Will Rock'' by Marc Blitzstein (1937-1938) _ The
composer/playwright's leftist leanings prompted the WPA to drop the
play as a project. Later, the New York premiere was halted by an
injunction. Cast and audience then trekked more than a mile to an
empty theater where the show went on, sort of. To thwart the
injunction, actors performed from the seats instead of the stage.
The musicians' union honored the injunction, so the only
accompaniment was Blitzstein playing solo piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1967) _ The Fort Worth
Theatre's artistic director wanted to stage Edward Albee's drama,
but the group's board said the language was too vulgar. By 1971,
attitudes had changed and the play was staged by FWT, to widespread
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair,'' Theatre Arlington, 1991. It wasn't the nude scene that
was the problem. The famous tribal rock, anti-war musical was on
the season calendar when the Persian Gulf War erupted. Not wanting
to be thought unpatriotic, the theater substituted another show.
Theater Arlington eventually produced ``Hair'' in l995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'' (1993) _ A wildly unorthodox production at Addison
Centre Theatre north of Dallas was to have been held over. But the
Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein Library, which controls performance rights to
the show, persuaded them not to. Among the things the R&AMP;H office
objected to was the rigging of a hydraulic lift beneath Aunt
Eller's skirt so that she ``grew'' to a height of about 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi'' (1998) _ Terrence McNally's new play about 13
gay men who meet to enact the story of Jesus was canceled by the
Manhattan Theater Club after the theater received death threats.
After a firestorm of protest within the theater community, the
Theater Club reversed its decision.

MEXICAN RANCHER BREEDS FIGHTING BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (TRINCHERAS, Sonora, Mexico) _ The spindly bull calves leave the
womb with their legs wobbly but their hearts strong.
</P>
<P>
   And their spirit bred for generations to put the hurt on human
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the way Dr. Adrian Ortega Fernandez likes it on
his sprawling ranch in the desert of northern Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   This is where he raises ``pura sangre'' _ full blood _ bulls of
Iberian fighting ancestry that are the stars of northern Mexico's
resurgent bullfighting industry.
</P>
<P>
   If bloodlines don't make them mean enough, the cattle disappear
into a patchwork of mesquite thickets, organ pipe cactus and sandy
arroyos, not coming into contact with people for up to a year at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any man could ever tame them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are 3 days old they start charging,'' says the
70-year-old Ortega, the sole producer of fighting bulls in
northwestern Mexico. ``You never turn your back on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Ortega turned his back on a lucrative career
as a surgeon and bought 70 square miles of this wild, sparsely
populated country.
</P>
<P>
   His friends thought he had lost his mind _ especially given that
era's drop in popularity of the traditional blood sport, in which
the matador sticks a sword through the shoulder blades and severs
the aorta of all but the bravest animals.
</P>
<P>
   There's no water, Ortega's friends protested. So he dug wells.
</P>
<P>
   There's no food, they said. So Ortega began growing fields of
alfalfa, barley, sorghum and wheat for his growing herd.
</P>
<P>
   It's too lonely, they said. Ortega acknowledges that his wife
can only put up with living part time at the isolated ranch house,
15 miles from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   But that also has its benefits, Ortega wryly notes: The animal
rights people in the United States haven't been able to find him.
Not that they would be able to change him.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega has long had a passion for bullfighting. Paintings,
photographs and publicity materials from the great Mexican and
Spanish ``plazas de toros'' cover the walls of his house.
</P>
<P>
   In one, he poses with the great Mexican matador Silverio Perez.
In another, Ortega has a panorama of the Astrodome in Houston where
45,000 turned out for a bullfight in 1970. The good old days,
Ortega sighs, before bullfighting was banned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega fought as a novice when he was a student in Nogales,
Sonora, before going off to medical school in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's perfectly positioned to take advantage of the
resurgence of interest in bullfighting in Mexican cities along the
U.S. border, which has led promoters to prolong the seasons in
Tijuana, Mexicali and Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Two competing entrepreneurs in Nogales also are expected to
bring back the ``corridas'' on a regular basis by the beginning of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega said he sold 60 bulls to the bullrings last year. In
fact, Ortega says he has been selling them as fast as he can raise
them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason for that, says Silviano Tanori, a Nogales,
Ariz., matador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through selective breeding, the doctor has put together the
perfect bull for creating art,'' Tanori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a huge investment in going way down south and buying
10 seed bulls and 200 cows from fighting stock which was top of the
line. Then, he has culled the lesser animals out and has produced
some real fighting machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanori found that out the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we were testing the cattle in a pen and I was standing
next to this gate, talking,'' Tanori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, this little bull, no more than 200 pounds, sees me
through a crack and hits the gate like a bolt of lightning. The
gate came off its hinges, crashed into me and gave me bruises all
over my body.''
</P>
<P>
   His cattle have become so wild, Ortega says, that he has given
up hope of ever trying to herd them again. They attack everything
that moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only control I have over them is water. If we have to move
them by vehicle between ranches, I fill a water trough in a corral
and someone sneaks up and closes the gate behind them,'' Ortega
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it takes the craftiest of cowboys to prod the cattle
through a loading chute and into trailers for the trip to ranch
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five head of the cattle recently have been moved to the
mesquite-wood corral near Ortega's house. As visitors move to
within 50 yards, the cattle kick up a huge cloud of dust as they
stampede along the inner corral wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega then walks to a nearby bullring with a shaded spectator
box from which he analyzes his stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them all a rating from one to 10 depending on their
level of bravery,'' Ortega said. ``I've had several 10's and six of
them have been returned here. Their lives were spared by the
matadors because they were deemed to be so brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanori agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fight one of these bulls, the spectators get their
money's worth,'' Tanori said. ``Plus, the matador gets a free
ticket to the primitive world.'' &QL;

MAN CHARGED IN APPARENT RACIAL BEATING OF JASPER NATIVE IN
MASSACHUSETTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Mass.) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case that in some ways mirrors the Jasper, Texas, murder of
James Byrd Jr., a Massachusetts court Monday began action against a
white man accused of beating a black Jasper native now living in
Lawrence, Mass., with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Charles Love, 44, who moved to Lawrence about
15 years ago for better jobs, was beaten by three white men in an
apparently racially motivated attack Saturday. Love remained
hospitalized in stable condition Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Charged in the case was Jeffrey Klier, 43, described by an Essex
County, Mass., district attorney's spokesman as a ``career
criminal.'' Klier, who has 13 previous convictions, was accused of
attempted murder, civil rights violations, assault and battery with
a dangerous weapon and lesser offenses. Bond was set Monday at
$75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence police Detective Jack McDonald said authorities are
seeking two additional suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out about this Sunday,'' Love's aunt, Gloria Mays,
said at her home in Jasper, a town of 8,000 about 140 miles
northeast of Houston. ``I have to be very blunt. We felt anger.
This is happening all over again _ what we went through with the
Byrds.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's wife, Brandy, who is white, said the attack grew out of a
Saturday afternoon disturbance as her family celebrated both the
couple's 20th wedding anniversary and a granddaughter's birthday
with a backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the back yard, but they could see us from the
front,'' she said. ``They were drunk. They would drive around and
around, yelling (racial epithets). They would come around every 15
or 20 minutes. This went on for two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   About 7 p.m., Love accosted the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles just told them to to stop and say their piece,'' his
wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, the men beat him on the head with aluminum
bats, cursing him and calling him derogatory racial names. Mrs.
Love said she sought refuge in her automobile, but one of the
suspects smashed all the windows with a bat and appeared ready to
attack her when officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Although not well-acquainted with the attackers, Mrs. Love said
she had previously seen Klier in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hangs (out) about three houses down the street from us,''
she said. ``He would always say, `Good morning' or `Good afternoon'
when he rode by on his bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Love said her husband, who remodels houses, had no previous
problems with the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles never bothers anyone,'' she said. ``He goes to work,
he comes home. He never goes anywhere unless it's to the store. He
goes to bed at 8 o'clock because he has to drive so far to his job.
Everybody around here knew him; knew he was from Jasper.
</P>

   ``Almost all the couples in this neighborhood are integrated _
black and white, white and Spanish, Cambodian and white. Every
other family you see has dual nationality. People have their
fights, but nothing like this.''

<P>
   Mrs. Love said she and her husband met in Little Rock, Ark.,
where he had worked as a construction worker and she had been
living with friends.
</P>
<P>
   They moved to Lawrence, once a decayed textile mill town revived
as part of former Gov. Michael Dukakis' ``Massachusetts Miracle,''
to rejoin her family.

   They reared four children from her previous marriage and two
adopted children, Mrs. Love said.

MEXICAN RANCHER BREEDS FIGHTING BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (TRINCHERAS, Sonora, Mexico) _ The spindly bull calves leave the
womb with their legs wobbly but their hearts strong.
</P>
<P>
   And their spirit bred for generations to put the hurt on human
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the way Dr. Adrian Ortega Fernandez likes it on
his sprawling ranch in the desert of northern Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   This is where he raises ``pura sangre'' _ full blood _ bulls of
Iberian fighting ancestry that are the stars of northern Mexico's
resurgent bullfighting industry.
</P>
<P>
   If bloodlines don't make them mean enough, the cattle disappear
into a patchwork of mesquite thickets, organ pipe cactus and sandy
arroyos, not coming into contact with people for up to a year at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any man could ever tame them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are 3 days old they start charging,'' says the
70-year-old Ortega, the sole producer of fighting bulls in
northwestern Mexico. ``You never turn your back on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Ortega turned his back on a lucrative career
as a surgeon and bought 70 square miles of this wild, sparsely
populated country.
</P>
<P>
   His friends thought he had lost his mind _ especially given that
era's drop in popularity of the traditional blood sport, in which
the matador sticks a sword through the shoulder blades and severs
the aorta of all but the bravest animals.
</P>
<P>
   There's no water, Ortega's friends protested. So he dug wells.
</P>
<P>
   There's no food, they said. So Ortega began growing fields of
alfalfa, barley, sorghum and wheat for his growing herd.
</P>
<P>
   It's too lonely, they said. Ortega acknowledges that his wife
can only put up with living part time at the isolated ranch house,
15 miles from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   But that also has its benefits, Ortega wryly notes: The animal
rights people in the United States haven't been able to find him.
Not that they would be able to change him.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega has long had a passion for bullfighting. Paintings,
photographs and publicity materials from the great Mexican and
Spanish ``plazas de toros'' cover the walls of his house.
</P>
<P>
   In one, he poses with the great Mexican matador Silverio Perez.
In another, Ortega has a panorama of the Astrodome in Houston where
45,000 turned out for a bullfight in 1970. The good old days,
Ortega sighs, before bullfighting was banned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega fought as a novice when he was a student in Nogales,
Sonora, before going off to medical school in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's perfectly positioned to take advantage of the
resurgence of interest in bullfighting in Mexican cities along the
U.S. border, which has led promoters to prolong the seasons in
Tijuana, Mexicali and Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Two competing entrepreneurs in Nogales also are expected to
bring back the ``corridas'' on a regular basis by the beginning of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega said he sold 60 bulls to the bullrings last year. In
fact, Ortega says he has been selling them as fast as he can raise
them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason for that, says Silviano Tanori, a Nogales,
Ariz., matador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through selective breeding, the doctor has put together the
perfect bull for creating art,'' Tanori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a huge investment in going way down south and buying
10 seed bulls and 200 cows from fighting stock which was top of the
line. Then, he has culled the lesser animals out and has produced
some real fighting machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanori found that out the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we were testing the cattle in a pen and I was standing
next to this gate, talking,'' Tanori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, this little bull, no more than 200 pounds, sees me
through a crack and hits the gate like a bolt of lightning. The
gate came off its hinges, crashed into me and gave me bruises all
over my body.''
</P>
<P>
   His cattle have become so wild, Ortega says, that he has given
up hope of ever trying to herd them again. They attack everything
that moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only control I have over them is water. If we have to move
them by vehicle between ranches, I fill a water trough in a corral
and someone sneaks up and closes the gate behind them,'' Ortega
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it takes the craftiest of cowboys to prod the cattle
through a loading chute and into trailers for the trip to ranch
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five head of the cattle recently have been moved to the
mesquite-wood corral near Ortega's house. As visitors move to
within 50 yards, the cattle kick up a huge cloud of dust as they
stampede along the inner corral wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega then walks to a nearby bullring with a shaded spectator
box from which he analyzes his stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them all a rating from one to 10 depending on their
level of bravery,'' Ortega said. ``I've had several 10's and six of
them have been returned here. Their lives were spared by the
matadors because they were deemed to be so brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanori agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fight one of these bulls, the spectators get their
money's worth,'' Tanori said. ``Plus, the matador gets a free
ticket to the primitive world.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Rogers was always good-guy movie star
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time in the West, movie cowboys wore white hats and
rode golden stallions. When they weren't rounding up rustlers or
saving the ranch from some smoothly crooked banker, they could be
found courting a feisty cowgirl, cutting up with a crusty yet
lovable sidekick or, most likely, strumming a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers wore the white hat in over 90 films. And he wore it
proudly and well, whether galloping through countless B-movie
serials on the Republic backlot or adding some cactus-savvy dash to
an A-list comedy like Bob Hope's ``Son of Paleface.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gene Autry, whom he essentially replaced, or Hopalong
Cassidy or any number of boxoffice buckeroos/singing cowboys who
blossomed in the '40s and '50s, Rogers was a wholesome hero.
Someone little kids could look up to. He didn't drink, smoke or
spit. He was fast with his fists and faster with a gun. And while
he never went looking for a fight, he never backed away from one,
either.
</P>
<P>
   His idea of strong language was an occasional ``aw, shucks.''
His idea of an ideal co-star was a palomino named Trigger who
carried him faithfully through every one of those 90-plus films;
like Roy, a Cincinnatti native, Trigger was originally a
tenderfoot, born in Milwaukee, Wisconson. His idea of a leading
lady was the same on screen as off _ Dale Evans whom he married on
New Year's Eve, 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Roy's adventures, especially in the '40s and '50s, when theater
operators voted him the number one western star 12 years straight,
took place in a kind of weird, time-warped West where airplanes and
stagecoaches co-existed. Where the bad guy might well be dressed in
some sort of vaguely western-looking suit _with, say, a string tie
_ while Roy invariably wore gaudy cowboy garb, right down to
hand-tooled boots, colorful neckerchiefs and a silver-trimmed
holster, to match Trigger's slver-trimmed saddle. In fact, Roy was
into name-brand clothing and accessories long before Gloria
Vanderbilt or Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   The West he inhabited was the antithesis of the West imagined by
such contemporaries as John Ford or Howard Hawks who rooted their
mythologizing, such as it was, in a very different reality. As
times changed, Roy Rogers' West was so squeaky clean that it almost
begged to be defiled. And so it was. In '50s psychological westerns
like ''High Noon,'' ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''The Left-handed Gun.''
In the genre-bending spaghetti weterns of Sergio Leone (''Fistful
of Dollars,''''Once Upon a Time in the West''). In the revisionist
westerns of the late '60s and early '70s (''Little Big Man,'' ''The
Wild Bunch''). Even a jolly romp like ''Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid'' had no place for the simplistic morality of a Roy
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mythic figure of The Cowboy as embodied by Rogers and
his ilk has never entirely left us. We still can glimpse him as the
``good'' badman in John Wayne's last film, ``The Shootist,'' or
Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning ``Unforgiven.'' He finds his inner
Sensitive Male in Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' and is
re-born as the Brat Pack on horseback in ''Young Guns.'' Or he
simply finds new territory to roam _ Han Solo's space-cowboy in the
''Star Wars'' trilogy or Eastwood, again, as an urban gunslinger in
the Dirty Harry movies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone and their endless clones, Roy
Rogers didn't need a billion dollars worth of special effects to
work his heroics. He just needed a horse, a gun and an unerring
sense of what was right.
</P>
<P>
   What's been lost, however, perhaps forever, is Roy's untainted
innocence. His clear-eyed belief in the Code of the West where a
hero always fought fair and was a little shy around ladies. His
legacy reminds us that, not so long ago, it was okay to be a Good
Guy. That, in fact, we were once a nation of Good Guys who saluted
the flag and unquestioningly stood when the national anthem was
played. And though he hadn't made a movie since 1975, his death
somehow makes the trail just a little more lonesome. And a little
less happy.

UNDATED: its decision. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FILM
</P>
<P>
   ``Song of the South'' (1956) _ A Walt Disney feature that
combined animation and live action to tell the B'rer Fox and B'rer
Rabbit stories. It was re-released as recently as 25 years ago, but
the studio pulled it after conceding that it did indeed feature
racial caricatures. It can now only be found on imported cassettes
and laserdiscs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) _ This Stanley Kubrick film
prompted an editorial in The Detroit News that said the combination
of sex and violence was so disturbing that the News could no longer
support the rating affixed to such a movie. The X rating fell into
disrepute after most newspapers stopped accepting ads for X-rated
films in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Tango in Paris'' (1972) _ This groundbreaking X-rated
film starred Marlon Brando and was directed by a major European
talent, Bernardo Bertolucci. Brando was nominated for a Best Actor
Oscar for his performance in ``Tango,'' his first role after ``The
Godfather.'' (In France, Bertolucci was prosecuted as a
pornographer for ``Last Tango.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spook Who Sat by the Door'' (1973) _ Ivan Dixon _ the
lovable Kinchloe from ``Hogan's Heroes'' _ directed an adaptation
of the Sam Greenlee novel about a token African-American CIA hire
who quits and uses agency information to start a revolution. It was
withdrawn from release by the studio after fears were raised that
it might stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Warriors'' (1979) _ One of the most influential, and
unheralded, action pictures of the past 20 years caused riots in
several theaters during its run. Paramount Pictures snatched it out
of theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Temptation of Christ'' (1988) _ Nervousness keeps the
Blockbuster chain from stocking Martin Scorsese's controversial
depiction of Christ's imagining his last days as a man who settles
down and raises a family. The subject made its studio release a
rocky affair as well. Protesters camped at theaters playing ``Last
Temptation,'' freely admitting that they hadn't seen it and had no
interest in seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita'' (1998) _ Director Adrian Lyne's recent remake of
``Lolita,'' starring Jeremy Irons, is a film that every major
studio was afraid to distribute. It will eventually run on Showtime
_ and it will have theatrical distribution as well _ but none of
the major players wanted the taint of appearing to approve child
molestation. This anxiety makes one wonder whether the 1960 version
of Vladimir Nabokov's novel, directed by Stanley Kubrick, would
ever have been made in the current climate.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,'' 1967-1969: Co-hosts Tom
and Dick Smothers, comic brothers with political bite, fought
censorship battles with CBS until the network eventually canceled
the variety show. Among the battles lost: Pete Seeger's performance
on the fall 1967 premiere of ``Waist Deep in the Big Muddy,'' a
song with anti-war overtones; Harry Belafonte singing in front of a
filmed montage of disturbances at the 1968 Democratic convention in
Chicago; and an interview with Dr. Benjamin Spock, who had been
convicted of aiding draft evaders. Eventually, CBS took the
then-unusual step of demanding to pre-screen upcoming shows. (This
is now common practice.) When Tom Smothers failed to deliver one
tape until a day before air time, CBS yanked the show and did not
broadcast it until three weeks later. (On that show, Joan Baez
dedicated a song to her husband, David Harris, then serving a jail
sentence for draft evasion. By then, Tom and Dick Smothers knew
they were gone.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Make Room for Daddy,'' 1950s: In one episode, Danny Thomas had
to refer to Sir Winston Churchill as a member of the British House
of Commons, instead of the usual ``member of Parliament'' because
one of his sponsors was a cigarette company that didn't want to
mention, even almost subliminally, a competing brand on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hallmark Hall of Fame,'' 1953: In the TV production of
George Bernard Shaw's ``Man and Superman,'' mothers are described
as dreadful harpies who sell their daughters in marriage to the
highest bidders. A man from the ad agency ordered the speech
killed. His argument? Mother's Day was a vital holiday in the
greeting-card business, and the show would antagonize every mom in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue,'' 1993: Bowing to ``family'' group protesters, WFAA
in Dallas/Fort Worth passes on the ABC cop drama ``NYPD Blue'' for
language, violence and nudity the station said would be offensive
to viewers. After a year, WFAA relented to protests from another
side _ those who wanted to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew ``Dice'' Clay, 1990: On the ``Arsenio Hall Show,'' the
comic sobbed when explaining ``the abuse'' received about his
comedy character, a bigoted jerk who felt that women were, at best,
``pigs'' and ``chopped meat.'' His ``Saturday Night Live''
appearance prompted ``SNL'' regular Nora Dunn and musical guest
Sinead O'Connor to refuse to perform. Through the criticism, Clay
metamorphosed into a mild-mannered family guy on a sitcom, which
failed. He has since returned to his tough ``Dice'' character, but
fans now see him as a pathetic sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Sacred,'' 1997: ABC was praised for staying with this
controversial drama despite some Catholic organizations calling the
portrayal of the liberal priest ``anti-Catholic,'' not to mention a
program with a political agenda because the executive producers
were Jewish. But when the series shot an episode dealing with a gay
priest with AIDS, ABC refused to air the episode even as the series
went down in ratings flames.

living German/Austrian composers, including Hindemith, Schoenberg
and Richard Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish composers (1933) _ Nazi Germany banned music by composers
of Jewish descent, as well as ``Negro jazz.'' Anything the Nazis
didn't like was labeled as ``Musical Bolshevism,'' which ultimately
included Hindemith, Stravinsky and other modern composers.
Ironically, the Nazis condemned two composers who represented the
ideal of Austro-German music: Mendelssohn and Mahler. The Nazis
went so far as to commission new music to Shakespeare's ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' from two composers of certified pure
Aryan descent, to replace the familiar, beloved but officially
disfavored music by Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner (1940s-present day) _ Richard Wagner is still banned by
the Israeli Philharmonic because of that composer's identification
with the Nazi cause (although he died long before the birth of
Adolf Hitler). The music of Richard Strauss, who held official
positions in the Nazi cultural establishment, was formerly banned
in Israel but has been introduced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Child of Our Time'' (1941) _ This oratorio, by British
composer Michael Tippett, was written in sympathetic response to
the Nazis' persecution of the Jews, but was once banned in Israel
because it quotes African-American spirituals with references to
Jesus.

<P>
   ``Suor Isabella'' (1982) _ It happens in Texas, too. This opera,
by Dallas-based composer Robert X. Rodriguez, is based on a classic
tale of a nun who brings a secret lover into the convent. A
performance by the San Antonio Symphony was canceled under pressure
from the Roman Catholic archbishop of that city.

 &HT;    News of Saks buy not exactly good news for Proffitt shareholders
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The steep price tag on the purchase of Saks Holdings
Inc. by Proffitt's Inc. worried some investors that the acquisitive
retailer is forgetting its bargain-buy strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham-based Proffitt's shares fell as much as 13 percent on
Monday after it agreed to buy retail icon Saks Fifth Avenue for
$2.99 billion in stock and assumed debt. That's about 11 times
Saks's estimated cash flow this year, richer than any of Proffitt's
recent purchases of regional department-store chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real happy about it,'' said John Cabell, portfolio
manager at USAA Investment Management, which owned 53,000 shares as
of March. ``There are a lot of small regional chains that I would
have liked to see them do instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's, the country's fourth-largest department store
operator, announced late Sunday it will swap 0.82 share, valued at
$33.36 at Thursday's closing price, for each Saks share _ a 15
percent premium to Saks's closing price of 29. It will also take on
about $890 million in debt. The transaction is expected to be
completed by the end of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's richest purchases before Saks were Carson Pirie Scott
and Parisian, which operates five stores in metro Atlanta.
Proffitt's operates 230 department stores and four furniture stores
in 24 states. The company had about $3.54 billion in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Saks's mainstay business is its 56 department stores. It also
has eight Saks Fifth Avenue Resort Stores, seven Saks Fifth Avenue
Main Street stores and 40 Off 5th discount stores, including one at
North Georgia Premium Outlets in Dawsonville. Saks generated about
$2.19 billion in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Skittish investors had concerns about bringing together the
disparate personalities of toney Saks _ known for designer clothing
by Bill Blass, Chanel and Georgio Armani _ and Proffitt's chains
that market midpriced brands such as Dockers and Jones New York.
</P>
<P>
   Saks's only metro Atlanta department store is at Phipps Plaza,
where it will share the same roost with new corporate cousin
Parisian. But thanks to an ironclad Saks identity and plans to keep
top management intact, shoppers shouldn't see immediate impacts
from the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, consumers may see differences to the extent that
Proffitt's chains learn the more sophisticated merchandising
strategies of Saks,'' said Arnold Aronson, managing director of
retail strategies at Kurt Salmon Associates and former Saks chief
executive and chairman. ``Saks gives them clout with manufacturers.
There's a new influence that can elevate the company, substantively
and psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks also is highly regarded for catering to its loyal shopper
base, which could rub off on Proffitt's stores, said Brenda
Gilpatrick, an Atlanta-based retail marketing consultant. ``Atlanta
consumers will probably see benefits at Parisian, which could
become a stronger store.''
</P>
<P>
   New merchandising savvy at Proffitt's could manifest itself in
stronger private labels as well, Aronson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit is that Proffitt's, a dominant regional player,
becomes a national company that can better compete against chains
run by rivals like Federated Department Stores Inc., May Department
Stores Co. and Dillard's Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proffitt's had a good name but not national recognition.
People in San Francisco aren't asking, `When is a Parisian coming
here?' '' said Frederick Marx, a retail consultant in Farmington
Hills, Mich. ``Proffitt's has a real growth vehicle now because
they can hitch the name and identity with Saks and cover North
America _ and probably the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's will change its name to Saks Inc. and move its
headquarters from Alcoa, Tenn. to Birmingham, where the Parisian
chain is based. The merged company will be headed by Proffitt's
Chairman and Chief Executive R. Brad Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The Saks Fifth Avenue chain will become a New York-based
subsidiary that will be managed by Saks Chairman and Chief
Executive Philip Miller and Vice Chairman and Chief Operating
Officer Brian Kendrick.
</P>
<P>
   As with previous acquisitions, Proffitt's will integrate the
inventory, distribution and other daily operations. With Saks, the
companies expect to save about $10 million to $12 million this
year, $60 million to $70 million next year and $75 million to $85
million in 2000 on advertising, property and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Saks likely won't add to Proffitt's earnings as much as or as
quickly as previous acquisitions, investors said. The purchase will
add 1 cent to 2 cents a share to earnings by year-end, according to
Proffitt's, which forecast profit of about 96 cents a share for the
fiscal fourth quarter ending Jan. 30, 1999, and $1.66 for the year.
Next year, it will add about 3 cents to 5 cents a share, resulting
in annual earnings of $2.20 a share. Proffitt's will issue also
about 52.5 million shares for the transaction, adding to the 89.7
million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the number crunching, though, is a selling point less
quantifiable but still notable for Proffitt's. ``They have some
bragging rights now because they got the pick of the litter,'' Marx
said. ``Another player is coming out of the South, which shows that
not everything (retail) happens on the coasts.''

POLICE PATCH NEIGHBORHOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Alvin Moses is running out of new bullet holes
around his central Phoenix home, and he credits a new
crime-fighting approach by Phoenix police that targets bad places
as much as bad people.
</P>
<P>
   Life has become a lot more peaceful, he said, since officers
started focusing less on arresting individual thugs and more on
attacking the places from which they dealt drugs and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, these three bullet holes in my house, those in my fence
. . . all were done during a two- or three-year period, which ended
last summer,'' said Moses, 72, standing in front of his home in
west-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police hit those apartments, the trouble pretty much
stopped,'' he said. ``And the shooting pretty much stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police agree so much that they're expanding their use of
a nationally recognized crime-fighting strategy that they credit
with helping reduce crime in Moses' and other troubled
neighborhoods by as much as one-third.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the ``broken windows'' approach, and many law
enforcement experts call it the key to saving crime-ridden
neighborhoods and preserving those threatened with decline.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Phoenix police and other city agencies took tough
action against landlords who owned an apartment complex and a small
mobile home park _ both infamous for harboring criminals _ near
Moses' home.
</P>
<P>
   The police are so happy with the success of the strategy that
they are expanding the program citywide. And Arizona lawmen in in
Mesa, Tempe and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office are studying
the approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix City Council recently approved five more detectives
for full-time ``crime abatement'' duties, which include
investigating ``nuisance'' properties blighting neighborhoods with
slumlike or crime-ridden conditions.
</P>
<P>
   South Mountain Precinct Cmdr. Mike McCort and Lt. Suzy Parra
said that, in many crime-plagued neighborhoods, a few properties,
typically rundown rentals, are host to the majority of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is, you close down the places that are wrecking
neighborhoods, the places with broken windows, couches and old cars
out in front, with crime going on inside and out, and you cut down
on crime throughout the neighborhood,'' Parra said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``broken windows'' phrase comes from a 1982 magazine article
in which criminologists George Kelling and James Q. Wilson argued
that allowing one broken window in a neighborhood home to go
unrepaired meant another would soon be broken. And another. Then an
old couch would appear on a corner, a slum dwelling would
eventually evolve and crime would surely follow.
</P>
<P>
   Stop the broken windows, eliminate the slum properties and crime
decreases, the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the theory in the New York City Police Department
credit that city's dramatic drop in crime during the past five
years to the ``broken windows'' approach. In Phoenix, McCort and
Parra decided to develop a program that would target problem
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Police worked with neighbors to learn which properties were the
centers of trouble. The officers then worked with the properties'
landlords to stop the crime and clean up blight.
</P>
<P>
   If the landlord refused to cooperate, legal action would be
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concept we've proved works, with just one detective and
one officer doing it,'' Parra said. ``Now the idea is to have more
detectives and officers doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Arizona Legislature passed a law that makes
knowingly allowing criminal activity continue on one's property a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that year, Wallace Dossie, 60, was the first
person to plead guilty to ``failing to abate a crime'' at his West
Monroe Street property that Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley
called a crack house.
</P>
<P>
   Police had long known that some properties seemed the center of
a neighborhood's problems, Parra said, but their response had been
saturation patrols, search warrants, ``zero tolerance'' programs
and other traditional policing methods.
</P>
<P>
   But such efforts often simply displaced the problems, McCort
said. And when an individual criminal was identified and arrested,
the activity was not curbed. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE RIGHT TO PERFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With much of Tibetan culture put at risk by actions of the
Chinese government, it may seem petty and impertinent to fret about
the fate of Chinese opera; even more, about one particular corner
of it. But Chinese opera, which has long been the central
manifestation of the performing arts in China, deftly combining
music, drama, poetry, dance, design and acrobatics, is waning. And
Kunqu opera, the revered style that began in Kunshan, near
Shanghai, in the 14th century and gave birth to so many later
varieties, including the dominant Peking opera, appears to be
dying. Really dying, not just wallowing in confusion, as so much of
Western classical music is doing.
</P>
<P>
   That sober reality was hard to credit for a recent visitor to
Shanghai, seeing the remarkable talent, energy, imagination and
love being lavished on rehearsals for the ground-breaking
production of the Kunqu classic ``The Peony Pavilion'' that was to
have formed the crown jewel of the Lincoln Center Festival, which
opens Tuesday evening. As Chen Shi-Zheng, the gifted American
director now at the center of a storm, put the mostly young
performers of the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company through their paces,
the gorgeous costumes arrived bit by bit, handmade in classic
fashion by elderly seamstresses in nearby Suzhou, the site of a
Kunqu museum. Despite the dinginess of the surroundings, on the
fifth floor of a municipal building in the old French quarter of
Shanghai, the process seemed one of growth and vitality.
</P>
<P>
   But it is suddenly easier to comprehend the dire predictions now
that the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has at the last
minute denied the company permission to travel to New York. And it
seems clear that the final, fatal blows to Kunqu are being
delivered by the very people who proclaim themselves its
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precious piece of Chinese culture,'' Ma Bomin, the
director of the bureau, rightly says of ``The Peony Pavilion,''
written by Tang Xianzu in 1598 and considered one of the great
masterpieces of Chinese literature. Yet that epic drama lay mostly
unperformed for centuries, typically represented by an occasional
presentation of one or two of the most famous of its 55 scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the Lincoln Center production, which was to have
presented the work at its full 20-hour length, seemingly for the
first time in at least three centuries, came not from China but
from an American, John Rockwell, when he was the director of the
Lincoln Center Festival. Rockwell, who is now the editor of the
Arts and Leisure section of The New York Times, is expert in
Wagnerian opera, and his curiosity about ``The Peony Pavilion'' led
him to conceive the ``Ming Ring,'' as he called it: a presentation
of the complete work in six parts, over six nights or three days.
He was also fascinated by the possibility of applying Western
methods of early-music research and notions of ``authentic''
interpretation to this repertory, and he enlisted Chen, who has
lived in New York since he left his native China in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Here, whatever its origins, was a prime opportunity to inject
new life into Kunqu by giving it unprecedented international
exposure. The production was to be showcased not only in New York
but also at festivals in Paris, Sydney and Hong Kong, and probably
released on audio and video. And this at a time when another
version of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' directed by Peter Sellars in a
truncated and Westernized form, is traveling the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chen's production has been derailed by Ms. Ma, who deemed it
unworthy to represent Kunqu tradition and, significantly, modern
China to the world. No matter that the largely oral tradition has
itself strayed far from whatever Kunqu may originally have been. It
is as if someone had been able to decree early in this century that
Handel's ``Messiah'' should be performed only as it had emerged
from Victorian England, with bloated chorus and orchestra and
perhaps even a few of Thomas Beecham's bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, one issue was the brief appearance of a prop, a
chamber pot, which was alleged to make China appear backward. Yet
as Chen points out, during the Song dynasty, in which the opera is
set, or even the Ming, in which it was written, a chamber pot would
have been anything but backward.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of four scenes the bureau took issue with in a
recent preview. In another, Chen was accused of injecting
superstition by staging a funeral march for the heroine and burning
effigies, in line with Chinese folk tradition. In the two other
scenes, the material objected to _ the ``pornography'' of the scene
in which Sister Stone tells why, anatomically, she could only be a
virgin, and the mocking treatment of a drunken Tartar general _
came directly from the classic text.
</P>
<P>
   After Chen expressed a willingness to make adjustments, the
bureau's censors took the production back into rehearsal and
demanded changes in six more scenes. Even then, Chen said on Friday
on his return to New York, ``if that would get approval for the
performers to leave, I would have done it.'' But when Ms. Ma walked
out on the rehearsal she attended, it became apparent that no
amount of compromise would suffice to liberate the production.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the real reason for refusing to permit
the company to travel was a fear of defections. Indeed, the last
time this company visited the United States _ Los Angeles, in 1989
_ eight of the 20 members defected. Several are part of the Kunqu
Society in New York. Those who stayed with the company are now the
wise old masters on whom Chen, whose training was largely in other
forms of Chinese opera, relied for the niceties of Kunqu. ``The
practitioners are the real experts,'' he said, dismissing the
``experts'' who found his work wanting.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the New York trip, the bureau obtained signed
affidavits from the performers' families promising that if an
individual did not return, the family would forfeit $12,000, no
small amount by Chinese standards.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate reasons for detaining the production and
however great the loss for Western audiences, the real damage has
occurred in China. Eight months of painstaking rehearsal and the
exquisite work of innumerable craftsmen have evidently gone for
naught, and brilliant young performers have been denied brighter
futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their spirits are totally broken down,'' Chen said. If so, it
is a calamity for those were clearly strong and vibrant spirits,
well suited to the lively characters they were to play.

   In ``The Peony Pavilion,'' Du Liniang, the susceptible teen-age
heroine, finds a dashing lover in a dream and pines to her death
for lack of the reality. But she is resurrected when the embodiment
of that lover, Liu Mengmei, a young scholar, discovers her portrait
and reciprocates her love. Though the work is set in the Song
dynasty (960-1279), its concerns relate at least as much to Tang
Xianzu's era, as Ben Wang, a Kunqu expert in New York, explained in
a captivating series of lectures at the China Institute in
connection with the Lincoln Center Festival. The playwright was
especially intent on espousing freedom and initiative in his
heroine at a time when Neo-Confucianism found young women suited
only to idleness and subservience.
</P>
<P>
   Qian Yi, lovely in a shy and understated way at 22, was to have
played Beautiful Du, as the name can be translated. Zhang Jun, tall
and charismatic at 23, was to have played Mengmei. Both were
members of the last class to have graduated from the Shanghai Kunqu
Opera School: possibly the last class ever. In 1986, they were
among the 60 students accepted from 20,000 applicants for the
eight-year program. When the school recruited for the next class,
recently, there were not enough applicants to form one.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in all forms of Chinese opera has eroded in the last
decade under a wave of American pop culture and Western arts,
including opera. Kunqu, the most refined of the 360 or so types of
Chinese opera, has been especially hard hit. Kunqu melody grows
directly out of the pitch characteristics of Chinese speech, with
its four tones: high, low, rising and falling. And just as speech
is elevated to song, movement is elevated to dance, with special
significance given to curving motion, since, for the Chinese, the
circle represents the perfect union of opposites, the yin and the
yang.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, parents limited by national social policy to
producing a single child are reluctant to consign that child to so
rarefied and uncertain an enterprise. The Shanghai company is one
of six Kunqu troupes surviving in China, and performances are
infrequent and ill attended. The performers are paid less than $100
a month.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Qian and Zhang, obviously the rising stars in the
field, were asked what professional opportunities might await them
after ``The Peony Pavilion,'' neither professed to have any idea.
Both are taking night courses in Chinese cultural administration as
a hedge against unemployment, and Zhang has already made headway as
a pop performer, where prospects are better.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty members of their class have already left the company, but
the rest are an ebullient lot, as adept at belting out choruses as
at tumbling in the battle scenes and even performing acrobatics on
stilts. They work under the continuing tutelage of performers twice
their age, for a generation was lost to Chinese opera during the
Cultural Revolution, when performances were banned. Chen, now 35,
was among the first to emerge after the revolution ended, in 1976.
The members of the company are mostly in their 20s or 50s.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this fragile ecosystem that Ms. Ma took her draconian
action to ``protect'' Kunqu from Chen's incursions. And what did
those incursions finally amount to? Chiefly, attempts to reimagine
the spirit of Kunqu when ``The Peony Pavilion'' was new, before
interpretations and costumes took on their present stiffness.
Within conventions still highly stylized, he wanted a hint of
naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   He also wanted to show the West Chinese folk tradition and, he
said, ``the best of China.'' Thus, not only the hundreds of
glorious costumes but also a magnificent wooden set, modeled after
the famous gardens of Suzhou and the outdoor theater in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   That Chen was able to achieve all of this on a budget of
$500,000 attests to the modest cost of the highest-quality
craftsmanship in China and also to his abilities as producer as
well as director. With cell phone at the ready, he fairly reveled
in detail during those Shanghai rehearsals, fielding crises like
the call from the Shanghai Zoo informing him that it would not
furnish songbirds for the preview performance for fear that the
clangorous Chinese percussion instruments might induce
psychological problems; he would instead have to find birds inured
to street noise.
</P>
<P>
   This splendid production would have established Chen as a star.
On the basis of the Shanghai preview, Le Monde in Paris has already
called it ``one of the major cultural events of the end of the 20th
century.'' No matter; Chen is resourceful enough that he will find
his way another time. One can only wish the same for those
wonderful performers tossed aside back in Shanghai, one of them,
Zhang, wearing the new suit he bought for New York.

FOR KOHL, FACING CRITICAL ELECTION, SWING VOTES ARE IN THE EAST  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany _ Fritz Hahle is one of those bluff party
bosses who burnish the silver lining, however gloomy the cloud that
hovers over his eastern German fief. Two months from a pivotal
national election, Hahle is finding it hard to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl _ Hahle's ultimate boss _ is fighting an
uphill battle for a precedent-setting fifth term. And, with eastern
unemployment stubbornly high _ twice as high as in western Germany
_ and a nationwide malaise settling in over Kohl's 16 years in
office, the German leader and his Christian Democrat party face a
cruel twist of fate. German unity eight years ago was Kohl's
biggest single triumph; now its tribulations could help unseat him,
fundamentally redrawing Germany's political landscape, and Europe's
too, just as the continent confronts the upheavals of globalization
and its own striving for economic unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As things stand, there's not much of a chance,'' Hahle said in
the smoked-glass and steel state parliament building bolted to the
old Communist Party headquarters here. ``People still regard Helmut
Kohl as the chancellor of unity. But many people are also saying:
16 years is enough. That is what is making it difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The view finds its echoes on the streets, in the cafes, and,
most of all, in the jobless lines. ``The people want hope and
Helmut Kohl can't deliver that,'' said Thomas von Danckelmann, an
unemployed heating engineer who plans to vote for the opposition
Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles in eastern Germany are particularly significant,
because the politically volatile eastern states yield the swing
voters that can make or break the narrow margins of success.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 27 election will be the third since unification and
arguably the most important since the end of World War II,
determining how the economic powerhouse of Europe defines its
future and how it exerts its mighty influence _ with or without a
player whose record-breaking stint in office has made Kohl an
immutable center-of-gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be fought in eastern Germany on one basic question:
is the glass half-full, or half-empty? Is reunification a
work-in-progress that will ultimately produce the ``blossoming
landscapes'' that Kohl promised, or has this remarkable experiment
in fusing two Germanys failed?
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Hahle delivered a stunning victory here for Kohl
and his party: of all Germany's 16 federal states, his state _
Saxony _ scored the single, biggest success for the Christian
Democrats, even delivering extra seats in Parliament that bolstered
Kohl's narrow majority.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the calculations are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election, every single vote will count and the
Christian Democrats' credibility is under the microscope,'' said
Werner Patzelt, a professor of political science at Dresden
Technical University. ``If they can't convince people they have
done something, then the election campaign will collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxony is eastern Germany's richest, most populous state. It is
run as a Christian Democratic redoubt by a state premier _ Kurt
Biedenkopf _ whose popularity and seigniorial manner have
encouraged the nickname ``King Kurt,'' and who endures as the
party's political heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Its twin big cities _ Leipzig and Dresden _ have come to
symbolize a blend of entrepreneurial spirit, scientific know-how,
and historic elegance. Tourists flock to the baroque splendors of
the opera and the art galleries. The tower of the Frauenkirche in
Dresden, destroyed by Allied bombing, is being rebuilt below a
sheath of protective plastic. Of the hundreds of billions of
western German aid dollars poured into the east _ often to the
advantage of western investors _ Saxony has received a substantial
chunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Elbe,'' exulted Steffen Heitmann, a prominent
priest who fought to sunder the Iron Curtain in 1989, and is now
state justice minister. ``It was black. It stank. Now there are
fish in it. OK, you can't eat them, or swim in it. But look at
it,'' he said, gesturing towards the river's evening-golden flow
where old, refurbished paddle-steamers ferry visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People now speak ironically of the blossoming landscapes,''
said Heitmann in an interview, ``But they are here _ health care,
hospitals, courts, schools. We must show that.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Saxony labors under the same political blight as
follows Kohl across the land, driving his standing in opinion polls
below that of his Social Democrat challenger, Gerhard Schroeder and
requiring him to recreate the fabled comeback that rescued him from
defeat in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Cemented in history as the titan of German re-unification, no
one doubts Kohl's historical achievement. But, like Britain's John
Major or George Bush in the United States, Kohl is depicted _ even
among his supposed allies _ as the tired tail-end of a long dynasty
that has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Kohl's party was seen as the greatest hope particularly
among the lower-paid in eastern Germany, and that sense endured for
some through the 1994 elections.
</P>

   Lutz Fischer, for instance, had been a driver in a state company
in the former East Germany. Now he runs two vans delivering
ice-cream on a contract from a big ice-cream company. In 1990, he
said, he voted Christian Democrat ``because they made the most
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 1994 elections, he said ``four years seemed a short
time and you couldn't expect them to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is that nothing has changed,'' he said. So
this time he said he will not plan to vote for Kohl though _ like
many eastern Germans _ he was not quite sure whom he would support.
Even some of Kohl's stalwart western German supporters are
hesitating. ``This election is a real dilemma for us,'' said Josi
Kraemer, a prosperous housewife in Bonn. ``Kohl has been there too
long. But who else is there for people like us?''
</P>
<P>
   Younger people, too, sense a disenchantment in many parts of
eastern Germany. In one recent, local vote in Saxony-Anhalt, many
swerved to the extreme right. Some are heading left.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought Helmut Kohl was right to insist on this
rapid reunification, this rapid change,'' said Christian Bernius, a
27-year-old law clerk, who plans to vote Social Democrat. ``In
fact, there was a rapid change on paper, but not in people's heads.
Division is going on longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite Germany's nominal unity, the election campaign
is being fought as two.
</P>
<P>
   In the west, where the bulk of Germany's voters show stable
voting patterns, Christian Democratic strategists are waging a
``red scare'' campaign, accusing Schroeder of working hand-in-glove
with closet Communists in the east.
</P>
<P>
   But in the east, where the challenge is to convince voters that
they never had it so good under communism, the aim is to win back
those who believe reunification _ personified in Kohl _ has made
them second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Democrats have written off the east,'' said
Raimund Grafe, a strategist for the opposition Social Democrats.
And, said Joachim Herz, the former director of the Dresden State
Opera, ``what do you expect to achieve by constantly telling 15
million people that everything they did was wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, though, reflects a demographic and political
reality: Germany's national elections are fought for the hearts and
souls of the big, rich states of the west, where the population is
four times that of the east, and where voters chafe increasingly at
financing the east.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the east, voters are far less entrenched in their
party preferences. While 80 percent of western voters display a
stubborn party loyalty, government statistics show, only about half
the easterners show the same fidelity. And they are far more likely
to follow their pocketbooks than any sense of political obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in mayoral votes in two Saxon towns _ Leipzig
and Goerlitz _ the Christian Democrats were trounced. Last April,
in the small, eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, Kohl's party suffered
its worst-ever post-war defeat, in a state assembly election hat
produced a sizeable and troubling showing of around 13 percent for
the far-right German People's Union. One fifth of the vote,
moreover, went to former Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Christian Democrats in Bonn have taken to
castigating the easterners' seeming proclivity for voting for
extremes, and for displaying little of the gratitude that
westerners expect in return for paying a hated 7.5 percent income
tax surcharge to finance the eastern revival.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate issue in eastern Germany, though, is jobs. At
unification, the communist command economy was rudely dismantled,
the German mark became the currency, and an entire way of
state-sponsored living collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But the paradox here is that the vaunted western investment in
modern and highly automated industries in eastern Germany has
provided none of the guaranteed jobs-for-life of state socialism.
``The more we modernize, the less jobs there are,'' Hahle said
glumly.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern state of Thuringia, for instance, a General
Motors plant producing Opel cars is a triumph of reunification that
was a stop on President Clinton's tour last May.
</P>
<P>
   The sub-text, though, is that the plant, now employing around
2,000 people, replaced an old East German plant that provided five
times as many jobs and produced half as many cars.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern is repeated across the east and the most troubling
aspect is that it has produced an entire sub-class of
50-something-year-olds who may never work again. Roughly one fifth
of the eastern work-force is out of a job _ twice the western
figure. Overall, German unemployment has been stuck at post-war
record highs for months.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what was taken for granted in the old communist east _
the broad social network, free child care, artificial full
employment _ is now glimpsed through the rose-tint of loss,
paradoxically outweighing gains such as freedom and hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, it gives no one in Bonn pause for thought that,
eight years later, there is a nostalgia for the old east which no
one would have thought possible or imaginable in the days of the
German Democratic Republic, when we constantly cursed our fate,''
said Herz, the former director of the Dresden State Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Come September, said Heitmann, the justice minister, ``it will
be a lot'' if the Christian Democrats are able to hang on to the
seats that proved so valuable to Kohl in 1994. ``It could still be
that the east will tip the scales again,'' he said, though he did
not say in which direction.

NUCLEAR REACTOR AT THREE MILE ISLAND IS FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., N.C.)  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa. _ Having a name that most people
equate with nuclear disaster, Three Mile Island might not seem to
be a choice piece of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   But GPU Inc., the New Jersey utility that owns the plant, is
convinced it can do something that no other company in the United
States has done: sell a used nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on its curb appeal,'' said Jim Langenbach,
the site director, sounding a little like a homeowner who has just
added a new coat of paint before an open house. ``Pulling weeds,
picking up trash, planting flowers. The real reality has nothing to
do with that, but it doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years have passed since warning sirens blared, schools
closed and more than 100,000 residents fled central Pennsylvania,
afraid of radiation poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   While the fear has faded, employees here say that when people
find out where they work, they still are asked whether they glow in
the dark. And a visitors' center attracts thousands of people every
year to its observation deck to peer across the Susquehanna River
at the hourglass-shaped cooling towers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the next month, the fortunes of Three Mile Island, whose
mistakes shook public confidence in the nuclear power industry,
could signal its ability to survive the worst adversity. At a time
when many have predicted that nuclear power will not be able to
compete in the increasingly deregulated electricity market, a sale
of Three Mile Island would show that one company, anyway, thinks
atomic energy can turn a profit _ for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   GPU has had the reactor actively on the block since December.
Fred Hafer, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in
June that he had been negotiating for months with a prospective
buyer, which he declined to identify, and that he expected to
announce a deal by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Only Unit 1, which was not involved in the March 1979 accident,
is for sale. The hulk of Unit 2, from which tons of radioactive
rubble were removed after a partial meltdown of its core, is not
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Hafer also hopes to sell the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in New
Jersey in the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people who follow the industry, including analysts and
nuclear critics, say that Peco Energy Co. of Philadelphia, which
already operates two nuclear plants, both in Pennsylvania, is the
most likely buyer. Peco recently established a joint venture with
British Energy PLC to acquire more nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we can build an even greater competitive
advantage by grouping nuclear units to exploit economy of scale,''
said Jim Waddington, a Peco spokesman, who declined to comment on
whether the company would buy Three Mile Island. Jerry Rainey, who
heads Peco's nuclear division, added, ``I think you'll see a deal
announced in 1998,'' though he also refused to identify the plants
that would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these are complicated deals, and nothing is certain
until a contract is signed, especially the price. Unit 1 is
reportedly worth $600 million, but several factors must be weighed,
and a determination must be made of who is responsible for the
substantial costs of decommissioning a plant. And even if an
agreement is reached, it would have to be approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the plant is buzzing with the possibility of a
takeover, officials of nearby towns have been notified that a
change of ownership may occur, and Langenbach said he already had
transition plans on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale takes place, Hafer will have succeeded where others
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, a spate of troubled reactors have been
put on the market, but there have been no takers. The owners of one
plant, Maine Yankee in Wiscasset, even created a Web page
(www.buynuclear.com), complete with color photographs, to promote
its sale, but to no avail. The plant was retired instead, though
its equipment is still for sale.
</P>
<P>
   GPU was prompted to divest itself of its nuclear operations by a
new law in Pennsylvania that ends the guaranteed rate structure
that benefited utility monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   It has opted to get out of the business of generating
electricity _ from reactors and all other sources _ and instead
concentrate on transmission.
</P>
<P>
   As more states adopt deregulation laws, other companies are
likely to follow suit. Connecticut, for instance, passed an
electric deregulation law earlier this year that requires the
state's largest power company, Northeast Utilities, to try to
auction off its nuclear reactors by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say there are likely to be more sellers than
buyers, and even some companies that have successfully managed
nuclear plants are wary about adding more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to increase our nuclear exposure,'' said
Randy Wheeless, a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp. of Charlotte,
N.C., which operates seven reactors. ``There's a lot of uncertainty
about how nuclear will be treated in a deregulated environment.
From our standpoint, it may be best to sit and let those questions
be answered and then look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And the idea that someone would want to buy Three Mile Island
has some local people reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had customers who were just sitting here laughing about
it,'' said Alma Zeager, 42, the owner of Village Homestead, a
nearby restaurant. ``I still don't think it's safe, but I don't
want to move to Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the deal appear promising is that many think that
Unit 1 of Three Mile Island is among the best-run reactors in the
world. As company executives are at pains to point out, there are,
in a sense, two Three Mile Islands, the bad one of 1979 and the
good one of today.
</P>
<P>
   Only a football field away from Unit 2, which will never operate
again, Unit 1 last year completed a continuous run of 616 days and
23 hours, a world record for uninterrupted operation of a
light-water nuclear reactor, the type in commercial use in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the 107 reactors now operating in the United
States are not able to produce electricity as inexpensively as
plants powered by gas, coal and oil, Unit 1 is an example of how
nuclear power can be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   GPU has projected that any power company that has operating
costs of more than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour in the New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland market will be unable to survive, and
Unit 1 comes in at 2.5 cents. That is in stark contrast to Oyster
Creek, for instance, which the company estimates has a cost of 3.7
cents a kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unit has been one of the industry's best performers,''
said Kit Konolige, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. David
Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a watchdog group, said, ``It is very competitive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Plant workers and company executives say that the industry as a
whole, and Unit 1 in particular, learned valuable lessons from the
accident at Unit 2.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred when operators failed to close a pressure
relief valve, allowing a million gallons of cooling water to escape
and causing the radioactive core to reach a temperature as high as
5,000 degrees. If operators had closed the valve and turned on an
emergency cooling system, the accident could have been averted.
</P>
<P>
   But the plant had begun operating only a few months earlier, and
the workers did not comprehend what was happening. They mistakenly
thought that a light on the control panel indicated that the valve
was closed.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for nuclear power contend that this mistake would not
be made today. They say that the industry now requires more
training, that every reactor has an on-site simulator for practice,
that the number of control-room workers has increased, that
management is required to be more actively involved in daily
operations and that federal regulators have stepped up their
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   And if Unit 1 is sold, the deal will confirm the belief of many
workers that they have overcome the past. ``We were a joke in the
industry,'' said Dave McCurdy, a maintenance supervisor for 29
years. ``This would show that we've come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are people who once fought to close the plant who
now support it. ``I've got to be fair about it,'' Mayor Stephen
Reed of Harrisburg said. ``The plant has made some major
advances.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Unit 1 was closed for six years as the plant revamped
its operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Epstein of Three Mile Island Alert, an anti-nuclear
group, said that improvements were overstated. He noted that only
last year the NRC fined GPU $210,000 for a string of violations,
including inadequate engineering designs and poor implementation of
emergency preparedness programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NRC has an overall favorable impression of Unit 1.
``If you get beyond the image that so many members of the public
have,'' said Neil Sheehan, an NRC spokesman, ``its performance has
been pretty successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the reactor could be sold to Peco troubles Epstein
because of that company's past. In 1987, federal regulators shut
down Peco's Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Delta, Pa., because
operators were found to be sleeping on duty in the control room.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Peco has overhauled its operations, becoming,
according to analysts, a leader in the industry. Peach Bottom was
restarted in 1989, and this year it and Peco's other nuclear plant,
in Limerick, received Power magazine's Powerplant Award, marking
them as among the nation's best-managed reactors.
</P>
<P>
   But Epstein noted that Peco was fined $55,000 in June by the NRC
because scraps of netlike nylon cloth, used for maintenance, were
discovered in an emergency cooling pump at Peach Bottom, and that
could have hampered its use in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   A sale of Three Mile Island to Peco, Epstein said, would be like
``transferring the title from the Three Stooges to the Marx
Brothers.'' He said the true lesson of Three Mile Island had yet to
be learned: No nuclear plant, he contends, can be operated safely.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors at the observation-deck gift shop one recent afternoon
did not seem troubled by any of this as they considered buying
Three Mile Island T-shirts, beer mugs, bottle openers and ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hollinger, who works in the visitors center, said that he
gets lots of tourists from abroad, and that Europeans are surprised
they can get so close to the accident site. Schoolchildren can
sometimes even be seen at the bottom of the defunct cooling towers,
shouting up to the top to hear the echo.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, Hollinger said, ``can't believe that this is where
it happened.''

IRAN'S BARBARIC DRESS CODE FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: SIDEBAR accompanies IRAN-TOURISTS)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GAIL BENSINGER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For female travelers in Iran, the biggest issue is hijab, the
dress code that requires women to wear dark, shapeless garments and
to cover their hair.
</P>
<P>
   For Western women used to going bare-headed, the sheer
discomfort of fabric around necks and chins _ especially when it's
hot, as it frequently is in Iran _ is relentless.
</P>
<P>
   The most restrictive form of hijab is the chador, the
all-encompassing dark robe that covers a woman from head to toe,
held closed by a hand under the chin or by the teeth if she has her
arms full of children and packages. Such a garment declares a
woman's adherence to the strictest laws of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   For a few especially holy sites, such as the compound that
houses the shrine of the Imam Reza in Mashhad or the mosque of
Shah-E Cheragh in Shiraz, our Iranian tour guide lent us huge,
unwieldy squares of dark printed fabric, leading one of our number
to describe us as a procession of puddings.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat more relaxed form of hijab is a head-scarf and
manteau, a loose, long overcoat that goes down to mid-shin, even in
summer. Such garments offer more opportunity for stylishness _ and
two free hands, not to mention pockets. The scarves were often
paisley or with flower prints, and women in manteaus tended to wear
them atop fashionable shoes and occasionally jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Dislike of the dress code is one of the most contentious issues
in this politically charged country, where the deposed shah forbade
chadors and the new theocratic rules make hijab mandatory. The most
daring women allow hair and jewelry to peek out from behind scarves
and they wear makeup. When we got on the plane to leave, virtually
all of the Iranian women shed their scarves and made up their
faces, even before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   For foreigners, the rules are a bit more relaxed. We wore
raincoats, loose-fitting jackets or newly purchased manteaus with
scarves, or occasionally just baggy shirts and dark pants or long
skirts. On inter-city bus rides, we shed our scarves until we
reached the various checkpoints, when our English-speaking guide
would announce a ``scarf alert'' and we would scramble to
re-assemble our headgear.

<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ It was another eventful off-season at Tanglewood
here, with more contention as to the direction of the Tanglewood
Music Center and changes in its administration. All of that will
take time to shake down and sort out.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Boston Symphony Orchestra opened its own
season on Friday evening and Sunday afternoon, and beautiful
weather for those concerts could lull a listener into thinking, for
the moment, that Tanglewood was its old idyllic self.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the programs set out to lull. As festival fare goes,
they were uncompromising, even challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Seiji Ozawa set the tone for a weekend of serious choral music
on Friday, conducting Berlioz's ``Damnation of Faust,'' a big,
unwieldy work of the sort in which he often excels. Here, the piece
was slow to come together.
</P>
<P>
   Some murky harmonies too weird even for Berlioz in the lower
woodwinds and some frayed edges in the excellent Tanglewood
Festival Chorus suggested under-rehearsal. And in this open space,
Vinson Cole's familiar portrayal of the title role lacked the
claustrophobic immediacy it had a few months ago in a semistaged
performance with the Brooklyn Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the work caught fire only in the drinking
scene, with David Wilson-Johnson providing an excellent lead as
Brander and the men of the chorus contributing fine woozy slides.
The second half proved altogether more compelling, thanks largely
to the steady presence of Frederica von Stade as Marguerite.
Wonderful in her big numbers, she drew like efforts from members of
the orchestra: Steven Ansell, the principal violist, in ``The King
of Thule'' and, especially, Robert Sheena, the English hornist, in
the Romance.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Rouillon seemed slightly miscast as Mephistopheles,
producing beautiful sounds but lacking the needed plangency at the
bottom and any sense of real menace. Ozawa and the orchestra and
chorus all hit their stride in ``The Ride to the Abyss'' and
``Pandemonium,'' producing the kind of excitement one might have
hoped for throughout.
</P>
<P>
   In Bernstein's brief ``Chichester Psalms,'' on Sunday, they did
provide it throughout. Derek Lee Ragin, a countertenor, took the
part of the boy soprano more than satisfactorily, yet the role lost
some of its vulnerability. The concluding chorale was especially
fetching, accompanied only by a bird, which seemed all too eager to
spell the orchestra. Here, Ozawa was substituting for Robert Shaw,
who had canceled because of illness. Other conductors picked up the
other works.
</P>
<P>
   John Oliver, the conductor of the chorus, led Beethoven's Mass
in C briskly and sometimes eventfully. He did not always make a
convincing case for his favored choral setup, with the vocal ranges
shuffled, missing the knifelike clarity needed when a melodic voice
dips or rises a semitone or suspends a dissonance. The fugues
sorted themselves out nicely, however, and made a big impact. The
vocal soloists _ Dominique Labelle, Marietta Simpson, Richard
Clement and Wilson-Johnson _ were generally fine.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Arming, the young cover conductor for the orchestra's
Tanglewood concerts, led Brahms' ``Nanie'' expansively, making the
most of his moment. Although this is not an easy piece with which
to make an effect, everything was pretty much in place, and the
chorus, especially, seemed intent on lending moral support.

AFRICA FETE: MUSICAL IDEAS FROM AFAR
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For African pop musicians, using ideas from other
places has never been a tough decision. Creative assimilation is
part of both the pop process and African tradition. The real
questions are how to use borrowed materials, and how much. Africa
Fete, the package tour that brings African musicians to American
audiences, presented four distinct answers _ from Mali, Senegal,
Somalia and Congo _ at Central Park Summerstage on Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Salif Keita, from Mali, and Cheikh Lo, from Senegal, are both
rooted in the West African griot tradition, with songs that set
incantatory, Islamic-tinged vocals above circular patterns and runs
played on the kora (harp-guitar). Keita's new band, Wanda, mixes
musicians from Mali and New York, and it sets out to mesh African
rock and American funk, wandering musical frontiers with a reckless
enthusiasm. Keita has been concocting African hybrids since the
1980's, but Wanda is his rawest, most exploratory music yet.
</P>
<P>
   The band includes a kora player, Toumani Diabate, alongside two
guitarists steeped in funk and jazz, and it turned its songs into
jams, riding terse vamps wherever they led. There were ethereal,
hypnotic passages dominated by the kora, with intricate patterns of
finger picking; there were stretches where modal chords turned into
jazz harmonies, as Ousmane Kouyate played dizzyingly fast guitar
leads; there was down-and-dirty funk, with the guitarist Freddie
Bryant attached to his wah-wah pedal. And Keita, whose voice has
always been riveting, responded to the band's forays with
heightened fervor, eager to rise above boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lo maintains an established way of merging griot music and rock;
his band plays Senegalese mbalax, brisk dance music with high
guitar lines and the sputtering cross rhythms of a talking drum.
His international touches included the inevitable reggae tune (sung
in French) and one song with a flamenco tinge, but most of the
songs followed the worthy example of Youssou N'Dour, who produced
Lo's album ``Ne La Thiass'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch). Lo proffered
heartfelt messages above music that was transparent yet propulsive.
</P>
<P>
   Maryam Mursal was Somalia's first female pop star before she
fled its civil war, and she now sings an exile's songs, lamenting
her country's misery and wishing for peace. Her voice is deep and
gutsy, an alto filled with sorrow and determination; her songs have
strong Arab influences, but they are catchy in Western ways, with
forthright melodies that start on the downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Her band, from Denmark, underlines the hand-drum beat with a
rock rhythm section and connects the songs to current dance music,
using samples of horn sections and pulsating synthesized bass
lines. Diligently recreating the arrangements from Mursal's album
``The Journey'' (Real World), the band was merely competent; its
bass player kept upstaging Mursal. But her voice and songs were
indomitable.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Wemba, from Congo, has one of the most sympathetic voices
in the world, a tenor croon that can take on a penetrating power
without losing any of its sweetness. His new band, Molokai, is his
most Westernized group yet, placing his voice amid the
slow-building dramas of European and American-style pop ballads, as
if he has heard too many Peter Gabriel albums.
</P>
<P>
   Breathy synthesizer chords hovered behind him. His guitarists
played aggressive lead lines. Two women harmonized and sometimes
sang in English, with lyrics like ``Hear the children cry.'' The
songs were flawlessly performed and utterly disheartening as they
embraced Western cliches.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the set, when Papa Wemba sang his older Congolese
dance tunes, with their buoyant rumba beat and gleaming guitars,
the music suddenly sounded vital again.

STOCK HYPE ON INTERNET SNAGS UNWARY INVES TORS 
</HEADLINE>
 OIL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG ANDERSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - The Internet is a valuable tool for private
investors, allowing them access to information once reserved
strictly for brokers and big-stakes players.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more, cyberspace has become a playground for spin
doctors and snake-oil salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, online investors need to face the oncoming wave of
stock solicitations with a high degree of Web-surfer skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of hype and promotion of
small-company stocks on the Internet,'' said Marc Beauchamp,
communications director for the North American Securities
Administration Association.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Web is so vast and unregulated, lawmakers have a
tough time keeping up with law-breakers. Unfortunately, many people
are in awe of new technology, and they assume everything they read
online is the gospel truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is being sucked in more than we hoped they would,''
said Michael Burton, director of securities for the Arizona
Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   One common method of reaching undiscriminating investors is
``spamming.''
</P>
<P>
   Spamming is the mass dissemination of unsolicited e-mail, a
highly criticized means of pitching sales. Receiving a spam e-mail
is tantamount to getting a cold call from telemarketers, except
that thousands of messages can be sent out for mere pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's spams were mainly come-ons for X-rated Web sites.
This year, it's penny stocks, small investment opportunities and
credit offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess commerce is replacing the world's oldest profession,''
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Another common way in which unscrupulous people push stocks is
to enter online financial chat rooms and give ``friendly advice''
about how fast a company is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Since users can choose any name they wish, chat room
communication is essentially anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   And it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the commission tries to stop bogus investment
solicitations when it can, but exponential growth of new Web sites,
free speech issues and jurisdictional problems are outstripping
regulators' ability to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-defense is really the way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burton said state and federal agencies are doing what
they can to restrict Internet investment offers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the California Corporations Commission ordered 10
companies to either comply with state securities requirements or
stop offering investment opportunities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One company on the list is Eventemp Corp., a fledgling
Scottsdale, Ariz., firm that is developing a system to preheat or
precool a car via a remote pager.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Crandall, an attorney in the California commission's
enforcement division, said he followed up on some spam e-mails and
Internet press releases touting Eventemp as a great investment
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The spams contained lines such as: ``Analysts say look for
Eventemp to go as high as $10 by March 1. . . . Analysts predict
that stock could shoot to $6 in the next few days. . . . Get in
while there is still time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Schroeder, Eventemp's president and chief executive
officer, said he was not aware of the spamming until he started
receiving complaints about it.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail campaign ignited a firestorm of online criticism
against Eventemp, spearheaded by Rich Hilgersom, an information
systems analyst from Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Hilgersom said he had received one spam too many when the
Eventemp message landed in his e-mail box.
</P>
<P>
   After doing some research, Hilgersom constructed a Web page
devoted entirely to Eventemp, criticizing the company and its
methods of promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said Eventemp hired Sloane Fitzgerald Inc., a public
relations firm in New York City, to promote the company's product
and was not responsible for the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said he terminated relations with the firm after
learning of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The phone number for Sloane Fitzgerald, also ordered by the
California Corporations Commission to qualify in California or stop
making investment offers, has been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said some online press releases contained false or
misleading statements about Eventemp.
</P>
<P>
   One release announced that Eventemp had signed up Don Massey
Cadillac, a Plymouth, Mich., dealership, ``to purchase and sell our
new product line.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Massey, used car manager at Massey's Plymouth location,
said representatives from Eventemp had promised to send
demonstration units of their air-conditioning system but never
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promised a product and never showed up,'' Massey said.
``We don't carry it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said criticism Eventemp has received probably caused
the car dealership to deny it ever made the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They backed off. Wouldn't you?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventemp stock, which trades on the largely unregulated OTC
Bulletin Board, peaked at 4 7/8 in early February, at the height of
the PR blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The stock now sits at 1 1/2 with very little activity.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said criticism of Eventemp is to blame for the
plummeting stock value, and he is angry at those who blasted his
company on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand how there can be no accountability for
people on the Internet,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
By following these basic guidelines, Internet users can greatly
reduce their chances of being taken in by investment scams:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spamming is seldom done by reputable companies and should be
reported to your Internet provider, as it usually violates Web
service agreements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not judge a company by how flashy its Web page is. Anyone
can construct a site with fancy graphics and animation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be skeptical of ``friendly'' people offering stock advice in
chat rooms. They could have ulterior motives _ including taking
your money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before investing, do a little research. Check out the
company's track record with state authorities. The Better Business
Bureau may have a complaint record for the company, although lack
of such a record does not mean the business is reputable. &QL;

 &HT;    Piazza still fuming over 'ridiculous call'
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denver _ With a bandage on his right thigh covering a gash
caused by Michael Tucker's cleat, Mike Piazza leaned against a wall
Monday and had this message for the Braves right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was an illegal slide,'' the Mets catcher
said, ``but I'd call it an unethical one.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, starting behind the plate in tonight's All-Star Game, is
still upset about what happened Sunday at Turner Field when Tucker
came sliding across the plate with the winning run in the 11th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The ball had been hit to short left field, and the Mets appeared
to nail Tucker. Bernard Gilkey's throw to the plate was on target,
and Piazza blocked the plate and held the ball closely to his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   But home-plate umpire Angel Hernandez thought otherwise, setting
off a furious argument from the Mets. Both reliever John Franco and
manager Bobby Valentine bumped Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, once he realized that Tucker had been called safe, also
went crazy, arguing with the umpire and spiking the baseball. A day
later, he was still talking about the play _ and whether Tucker's
slide was legal. Replays clearly show Tucker's right foot up in the
air, heading for Piazza's chest.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball rules don't cover details of sliding or whether a
certain style is illegal. For instance, a player cannot slide out
of the basepaths to break up a double play or beyond the bag. But
nowhere in the rulebook does it say a player cannot slide with his
feet up. However, it's an unwritten rule among players.
</P>
<P>
   But Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said, ``If I thought
Michael did something wrong on that slide, I would have said
something to him. But what does the catcher expect? He had the
plate blocked. It was a just an aggressive play by Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, National League president Leonard Coleman said Monday
that he will wait until after the All-Star Game to review the
incident. Fines and even suspensions could be handed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (Coleman) takes into account what the situation was,''
Piazza said. ``It was a very emotional game for us, and it was a
ridiculous call. And I don't think anything was done out of malice.
I think we were just trying to talk to him, and he was walking off
the field.''

CRIMESTOPPER (Phoenix) - Alvin Moses says Phoenix's new
crime-fighting approach has worked in his neighborhood. Since
police stopped arresting drug dealers, gang members, and armed
robbers one-at-a-time and attacked the dens from which they dealt
death and dope, life has become a lot more peaceful. Police say
that, in fact, crime has gone down 31 percent in three central
Phoenix neighborhoods where they fought crime by taking a tough
stance against the apartments from which the crime emanated. It's
part of a nationwide crime-fighting stragegy. By BILL HERMANN.
Story rescheduled from earlier, moved in the ``A'' cateogry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FIGHTING BULLS (Trincheras, Sonora, Mexico) _ The spindly bull
calves leave the womb with their legs wobbly but their hearts
strong. And their spirit bred for generations to put the hurt on
human bodies. Which is exactly the way Dr. Adrian Ortega Fernandez
likes it on his sprawling ranch in the desert of northern Sonora.
This is where he raises ``pura sangre'' _ full blood _ bulls of
Iberian fighting ancestry that are the stars of northern Mexico's
resurgent bullfighting industry. By MARK SHAFFER. Story moved in

SNAKEOIL (Undated) - The Internet is a valuable tool for private
investors, allowing them access to information once reserved

RESTLESS-BAND (Undated) - When country supergroup Restless Heart
quietly stopped beating in 1994, most of the members went off to
other musical ventures. When the band was on the road, few groups
could touch Restless Heart. The quintet created crystal harmonies
that were almost frighteningly pure. Now it's back. The group has
out a greatest-hits disc that features three just-recorded songs.
The first single, ``No End to This Road,'' is rapidly moving its
way up the chart. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E``

   Quiet Days in Paris
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ There has been a sharp falloff in the number of
well-known designers staging men's wear shows in Paris this season.
Among those who had presentations last season and did not show this
past week are Walter van Beirendonck, Emanuel Ungaro, Ozwald
Boateng, Claude Montana, Eric Bergere and Givenchy. Issey Miyake
and Jean Paul Gaultier both opened their collections in Milan,
Italy, instead of Paris, though Gaultier also presented his line
here.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier has his collections made in Italy and wanted to be
closer to the production. Designers also want maximum exposure, and
by the time the caravan of retailers and fashion media hits Paris,
its numbers have dwindled. Gene Pressman, a co-chairman of Barneys
New York, was the lone senior retailer in Paris. Michael Gould,
chairman of Bloomingdale's, and Stephen Elkin, chairman of Bergdorf
Goodman, left after Milan. This development does not concern the
Chambre Syndicale, the French organizing body for the shows. The
lull is temporary, said Denise Dubois, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers stayed away because they were afraid the World
Cup would make it difficult to secure rooms, Ms. Dubois said,
adding, ``We have nothing to be worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   New Clothes in the Louvre
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Musee de la Mode et du Textile at the Louvre, the
Paris equivalent of New York's Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, will begin a series of twice-a-year
exhibitions that will highlight current commercial fashion. The
first installation of the unusual program, called ``Le Plus de la
Mode'' (``The Height of Fashion''), will run from July 22 through
the first week of September. It will feature about 30 outfits drawn
from the men's and women's collections currently in stores, said
Pamela Golbin, a curator. They will be chosen by the museum's staff
and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to assure the museum a steady supply of clothing for
its archives and to strengthen relationships with the fashion
community, Ms. Golbin said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems an odd course for a museum to embark upon, but it
should have intriguing results. What constitutes a museum piece
will be contrasted with the requirements of commercial fashion.
``We're here to show not only a garment as clothing to be worn, but
also as an identity to itself, and as a social object,'' Ms. Golbin
said. ``Fashion houses and stores have one object in mind: How they
can sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Golbin, though, will be assessing a garment's importance on
esthetics, technical innovation and quality, and social relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary but Entertaining
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Diffusion, or secondary, collections by definition do
not break ground and are less conceptual than top lines. But
designers insist on giving their secondary lines runway shows, and
they go to great lengths to engage guests.
</P>
<P>
   For her Versus show last week in Milan, Donatella Versace
offered a winning, loose-fitting casual take for the young in batik
pants, overalls and pink shirts. She also offered entertainment _
British singers Jimmy Ray and Catatonia _ and a runway-worthy
entrance by Whitney Houston, trailed to her front-row seat by six
aides-de-camp.
</P>
<P>
   At Emporio Armani, Giorgio Armani created a kind of theater
without walls. More than half the audience was seated in
traditional theater style, in front of the proscenium, looking up
to the stage, which was to be the runway. The remainder of the
guests were seated on the stage on bleachers, making them part of
the show. The likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver were
thus forced at least to look as if they were paying attention to
the more than 100 outfits that came down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Gianfranco Ferre's theatrics for GFF had the audience sitting
around a vast public pool and models in sheer aqueous-colored
sportswear and water shoes appearing to walk on water _ actually
stepping across a boardwalk suspended below the water's surface.

LEADERSHIP TURMOIL TEARS GREEK ORTHODOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Knoxville; moved July 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago the nation's 2 million Greek Orthodox cheered the
news that Metropolitan Spyridon had been chosen to be their new
archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, there is revolution within the Greek church,
with people who once supported Spyridon now formally demanding his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What started last year as criticism by some church activists of
what they considered the autocratic style of Spyridon, leader of
the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, has
ballooned into a full-fledged attempt by many deep-pocketed Greek
Orthodox, including several in Boston, to force the archbishop to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   It's an extraordinary display of public dissent that has
dismayed many Orthodox and non-Orthodox Christians. Some Orthodox
say the seriousness of the controversy is underscored by the makeup
of the dissident group, Greek Orthodox American Leaders, or GOAL.
The group's leaders are some of the most powerful church members;
at least 20 of GOAL's 54 leaders have each contributed $100,000 or
more to the Greek church in recent years, according to church
records and GOAL leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archbishop fails to have an understanding of fundamental
American values _ freedom of expression, the dignity of the
individual and participatory decision-making,'' said Dr. Thomas
Lelon, executive director of GOAL and vice president and dean of
academic affairs at Nichols College in Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon, through a spokesman at the archbishop's headquarters
in New York, declined requests to be interviewed for this story.
But in an interview published this month in the official newspaper
of the Greek Archdiocese of America, he chastized his critics for
failing to put the good of the church ahead of their own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that individuals have concerns and issues, and
even band together, but the church is not composed of parties and
lobbies,'' Spyridon told the Orthodox Observer. ``We are all
members of the Body of Christ. I hope we never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   GOAL leaders have taken their campaign against Spyridon across
the country, trying to convince the rank and file that financial
mismanagement and a leadership style that devalues the laity should
cost the archbishop his job. So far, they have held meetings in 17
different cities, including Boston, where typically the meetings
are held by teleconference or in private homes. Their first meeting
was last November in Southborough, Mass. at a Nichols College
conference center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A showdown between Spyridon and his detractors could occur in
early July when the church's clergy and laity gather for their
biennial convention.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has tainted the Greek Orthodox Church, caused church
donations to drop, and left many to wonder whether Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew, who appointed Spyridon and is the spiritual
leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox, will intervene.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Orthodox church sources say, Bartholomew is
standing behind his embattled archbishop but is becoming
increasingly alarmed by the turmoil engulfing the church. Some GOAL
members and other church activists have personally appealed to
Bartholomew to oust Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon's defenders say the archbishop is being victimized by
malcontents, unhappy with Spyridon's efforts to safeguard the
church's Orthodox integrity from changes to suit American tastes.
For instance, Spyridon has chafed at the decreasing use of Greek in
the liturgy, and the abandonment of Byzantine chanting in favor of
Christian hymns. His critics believe he is trying to impose Old
World customs on a modern American Greek church that has moved
beyond its Greek origins.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Spyridon supporters acknowledge he faces a series of
problems he must deal with if they are not to undermine his ability
to lead the church:
</P>
<P>
   _The church's flagship educational institution, Hellenic College
and Holy Cross School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., is under
investigation by two independent academic accrediting agencies
investigating whether academic standards were violated last year
when the president and three professors were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Some professors have told the Globe that the four priests were
fired for their refusal to cover up sexual misconduct by another
Greek Orthodox priest. Archdiocesan officials say the firings were
based on personality conflicts and had nothing to do with the
sexual misconduct, which occurred at a campus party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at least two professors have left the school in
recent weeks, according to two priests who work at the college. A
spokesman for the school could not be reached. Only eight students
have enrolled at the theology school for the September term, down
from roughly 15 to 20 in years past.
</P>
<P>
   _The Archdiocesan Council, the panel that helps Spyridon run the
church, has raised concerns in a report prepared by a special
committee about what they described as ``serious cash flow
problems'' in the church's finances, including the archbishop's
attempt to purchase a $1.4 million home without the council's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dimitriou resigned as the archdiocese's financial director
earlier this year. Church sources said it was because of
disagreements over the way church funds were being handled.
Attempts to reach Dimitriou last week were unsuccessful. Spyridon
abandoned his attempts to purchase a house, and aides say church
finances are being audited by an outside accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   _Priests in parishes in Massachusetts, Ohio, and California say
that Sunday collection box donations have dropped significantly in
the past few months. ``People who are disgusted by the direction of
the church's leaders are voting with their pocketbooks,'' said one
priest in a parish in Boston's western suburbs, who like seven
other priests interviewed for this story asked not to be identified
because they did not want to be linked publicly with the
controversy. Some supported Spyridon, others did not.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond issues of leadership style and financial management,
observers say the conflict between Spyridon and dissidents is also
a cultural clash.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spyridon was born in Ohio, he has spent most of his
adulthood in Greece and in Istanbul, where he has been shaped by a
strongly hierarchical and cleric-run church structure.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1996 and found a church that had
fully embraced American democratic values, where a premium had been
placed on giving laity a strong voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been puzzled that this commitment to Greek Orthodox
tradition has been misintepreted by some people as a negative
change, a `roll-back' or backward turning for our church,''
Spyridon told the Orthodox Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history Orthodoxy has thrived, some religion scholars
said, precisely because it has adapted to different national
cultures while preserving its theological foundations. The use of
English, for example, has helped make Orthodox Christianity more
accessible to the growing number of Americans converting to
Orthodoxy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hierarchs from overseas often don't understand American
culture and how that impacts the church,'' said Vigen Guroian,
professor of theology and ethics at Loyola College in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon's supporters recall that when he was appointed, it was
hoped he could work to unite the 5 million Orthodox Christians in
the United States into a major religious force by reaching out to
the other ethnic branches of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Methodios, bishop of the Greek Diocese of Boston,
said that Spyridon has endured a steep ``learning curve,'' and is
now trying to be more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's becoming more tolerant of situations he can't

 &HT;    44-year-old DeBerg signs with Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons took out an insurance policy
Monday, when 44-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg, a 16-year
veteran, signed a one-year contract with the team.
</P>
<P>
   If DeBerg makes the roster, he will be the oldest player in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg's signing came after it was learned that Mark Rypien, who
had signed a two-year, $1.85 million contract to be the backup for
Chris Chandler, will not be in Suwanee when training camp begins on
July 23. Rypien's football career is on hold because his son,
Andrew, is battling brain tumors and his wife, Annette, is fighting
a serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   That made it more urgent for the Falcons to sign an experienced
backup before their three-day minicamp opened today.
</P>
<P>
   Available veteran free agents included Wade Wilson, David
Klingler and Neil O'Donnell, recently released by the Jets. But
Atlanta decided to sign DeBerg, who last played in 1993 with Tampa
Bay (three games) and Miami (five games). He completed 136-of-227
attempts for 1,707 yards and seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg played under Falcons coach Dan Reeves in Denver from
1981-83 and was his quarterback coach in 1995-96 with the Giants.
He is familiar with Reeves' system and worked out for the Falcons
on June 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Being this close to training camp) kind of limits you in what
you can do, and Steve is one of the few who would fit the bill
because he knows the system,'' said Reeves, whose team was 7-3 in
games Chandler started and finished last year but was 0-6 in
others. ``More important is the fact that he worked out really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg would supplant Seattle quarterback Warren Moon, 42, as
the NFL's oldest player. He ranks 13th in NFL history with 33,872
passing yards, 10th in completions (2,844) and 11th in attempts
(4,965). He played in San Francisco (1978-80), Denver ('81-83),
Tampa Bay ('84-87), Kansas City ('88-91), Tampa Bay again ('92-93)
and Miami ('93).

 &HT;    CLINTON MOVES TO RAISE MEDICARE SUPPORT TO LOW-INCOME ELDERLY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton launched a new effort Monday to
inform up to 3.9 million Americans that they are entitled to
federal assistance in paying for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's action, announced at a brief news conference in the
Rose Garden, came in response to a report by Families USA, a
non-partisan health advocacy group, that estimated between 3.3
million and 3.9 million low-income elderly do not take advantage of
federal programs that pay Medicare premiums, and in some cases
deductibles and copayments as well.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, which Families USA had scheduled to release
Tuesday, it found that an estimated $1.7 billion to $2 billion was
improperly being deducted from the Social Security checks of
low-income elderly to pay for Medicare premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The federal effort to reach those eligible for the programs will
include special mailings coordinated by the Social Security
Administration _ which deducts the $43.80 monthly Medicare premium
_ and the Department of Health and Human Services, which
administers Medicare for 38 million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, case workers, federal and state field offices and
the Internet will all be used to help publicize the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through this effort, hundreds of thousands of older and
disabled low-income Americans will receive more affordable health
care without any new congressional action,'' Clinton said. ``This
is a duty we owe our parents and our fellow citizens, and we should
honor it. It's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, who joined
Clinton in the Rose Garden, hailed the announcement as an
initiative that could benefit millions of Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps outlined today by the president will go a long way
to ensuring that low-income Medicare beneficiaries will have a much
better chance to get their Medicare premiums subsidized so that
their meager Social Security checks are no longer deducted,''
Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Congress created two programs to help low-income
elderly beneficiaries pay their Medicare Part B premium, which
covers doctors bills and related services. The programs are
administered through the federal-state Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   One program, known as Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs),
covers beneficiaries with incomes at or below the poverty level for
the elderly: $8,292 for an individual and $11,100 for a couple. It
covers the monthly premium as well as deductibles and copayments.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1.9 million to 2.4 million beneficiaries who
qualify for the program nationally do not participate in it, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The other program, known as Specified Low-Income Medicare
Beneficiaries
</P>
<P>
   (SLMBs), covers low-income elderly up to 120 percent of poverty,
or $9,900 for individuals and $13,260 for couples. It covers just
the monthly premiums. An estimated 1.4 million beneficiaries
eligible for this program do not participate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A third program, which began this year, is eligible to pay the
premiums of beneficiaries with incomes between 120 percent and 135
percent of poverty ($11,112 and $14,892, respectively, for
individuals and couples). Almost 500,000 people nationally are
expected to be eligible on a first-come, first-served basis, but
the report said only 4,723 _ less than 1 percent _ had applied as
of last month.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA suggested that participation levels are low for two
reasons: many beneficiaries don't realize they are eligible, and
applying for benefits is cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Although Medicare premium deductions are set when people enroll
at their Social Security office, they must apply for the assistance
programs at state welfare and Medicaid offices.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack urged the Social Security administration to directly
enroll low-income beneficiaries for the programs. A White House
official said the federal government would urge states to
streamline the application process, but shifting the programs to
the Social Security administration would require a change in the
law.

<P>
   The right to compose music is one of the last that women have
chosen to claim, which raises an interesting question. But that
right is now being energetically upheld. A fair proportion, if
nothing like 50 percent, of the most talented composers at work in
the United States are women: Joan Tower, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich,
Barbara Kolb, Thea Musgrave, Shulamit Ran and Augusta Read Thomas
are outstanding examples. Abroad, prominent composers include women
like Betsy Jolas, Olga Neuwirth, Kaija Saariaho, Judith Weir and
Sofiya Gubayidulina. The battle for recognition is over. The
question now is, What is women's music or what might it be?
</P>
<P>
   Creative contributions to that discussion are at hand. This week
the Lincoln Center Festival is presenting an opera by Paula M.
Kimper, ``Patience and Sarah.'' And on July 16 a whole evening of
music by women, including a new work by Carol Barnett, will be
performed in Minneapolis to mark the 150th anniversary of the first
women's rights convention, at Seneca Falls, N.Y. If ever those
founding mothers of Seneca Falls gave their attention to music, the
record is silent. There were, to be sure, more pressing issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it is curious that very few women gained important
reputations for their music before the late 1960s, by which time a
good number of women had long been established at the highest level
of painting, to cite another art form with few front-rank women
before the 20th century. Even those earlier women who had produced
fine music, such as Mrs. H.H.A. Beach and Ruth Crawford Seeger,
were not much noticed until two or three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the delay have to do with the fact that change,
when it came, resulted not only from pressure from female composers
but also from a shift in the understanding of music and musical
tradition. Barriers of all kinds were falling. Musicians and
audiences were becoming interested in medieval and Renaissance
music, in the musical cultures of Asia and Africa and in the host
of Western composers who had previously been judged peripheral. All
these adventures made it harder to sustain the idea of a canon
dominated by a dozen great composers, all men and nearly all from
German-speaking Central Europe. And if this central idea of
classical music _ the idea of the core repertory _ was being
questioned by the profession, general audiences were bound to
respond by questioning the value of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this earthquake in Western musical culture, the
arrival of female composers came at a difficult time. Since the
late 1960s, women have been able to look forward to fully
professional careers as composers and not content themselves, as
women before often did, with the status of a very minor master,
composing domestic songs (Liza Lehmann) or light chamber music
(Cecile Chaminade), and often accepting a role behind the men of
the family (Fanny Mendelssohn, Clara Schumann, Alma Mahler). But
since the late 1960s, too, the prospects of widespread acclaim for
any composer, woman or man, have been receding. It is not
surprising, therefore, that no women have emerged as great
composers during the last three decades. No men have either.
</P>
<P>
   Given that so much has changed, examples from the past are
probably not going to help much. Current enthusiasm for Hildegard
of Bingen _ easily measured by how much her albums outnumber and
outsell those of her troubadour contemporaries _ can be understood
only as part of a re-evaluation of female composers from history.
But it is not at all certain that this re-evaluation is
demonstrating any distinctively female attributes in women's music
or providing anything more than confidence boosting for young women
who compose, important as that may be.
</P>
<P>
   After all, men's music is not particularly male. Down the
centuries from Monteverdi to the present day, most male composers
have favored sopranos above all other kinds of singers and favored
instruments that operate in the soprano register, notably the
violin. The voice of classical music is female. Accordingly, the
female characters in opera are generally more fully drawn,
dramatically dominant and persuasive. It would be hard to say how,
for instance, ``The Marriage of Figaro'' would have been different
if the score had been composed by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may help explain why women's music is not, so far,
sounding so different from men's music. The lesson may be that sex
is much less important than national origin in influencing a
composer's music. French music, Russian music, American music:
These all have their particular sounds. Women's music does not.
Probably this is because French, Russian and American composers
grow up with different stimuli that have a close bearing on music:
different languages, different musical traditions, both classical
and vernacular, different ideas of music's cultural place and
function.
</P>
<P>
   Female composers, on the other hand, grow up in the same world
as men. To insist otherwise _ to lay claim to a tradition of
women's music going back to Hildegard _ may be tempting but will
probably also be incapacitating. It would be unlikely to help any
musical girl to think that her heritage comprised a remote nun
together with a few salon composers and could not by definition
include Beethoven and Debussy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that women's music is not easily distinguishable from
men's comes from a recent CD of music by 11 American composers who
define themselves as lesbians (Composers Recordings Inc. 780) and
also from Ms. Kimper's ``Patience and Sarah,'' an excerpt from
which is on this record. The CD's program is so diverse that no
common thread is discernible, and none of the tracks stand out as
evidently female, let alone evidently lesbian. ``Patience and
Sarah'' includes love music for two female voices, but this is
nothing new. Such music, at a considerably higher erotic
temperature, can be found throughout the operatic repertory, from
``The Coronation of Poppea'' to ``Der Rosenkavalier.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion seems inevitable that sexual preference, as well
as sex, is inaudible. And it is not obvious that any contrary
indications come from the music of male composers who identify
themselves or who have been identified as gay. Of course, people
who think they understand Tchaikovsky's sexual inclinations can
start to build theories about the meanings of his operas, his
ballets and even his symphonies. And those theories may well be
convincing and instructive. But they depend on knowledge that the
music itself does not disclose. Shades of sensibility that have
been associated with male homosexual behavior _ performance,
subterfuge, empathy _ are everywhere in music, and it would not be
at all difficult to construct a case for Mozart's homosexuality,
any more than for his womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   This neutrality of music, with respect to sex and sexuality,
goes against the grain. It is hard to believe that a composer's
nationality is vital but not these matters that seem so much deeper
in the personality. How can it be that music, the most erotic of
the arts is indifferent to the source and object of the desires it
manifests?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these instincts are right, and once a sufficient number
of female composers have been working for a sufficient time,
women's music will be a category as particular _ if also as broad
and diffuse _ as American music, Russian or French. When that time
comes, it may also become clear what men really sound like.

   GERMANY-POLITICS (Dresden, Germany) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
fighting an uphill battle for a precedent-setting fifth term. And
with eastern unemployment stubbornly high and a nationwide malaise
settling in over Kohl's 16 years in office, the German leader and
his Christian Democrat party face a cruel twist of fate. German
unity eight years ago was Kohl's biggest single triumph; now its
tribulations could help unseat him, fundamentally redrawing
Germany's political landscape. By Alan Cowell. 1,800 words. With

   3MILE-NUKE-SALE (Londonderry Township, Pa.) _ Having a name that
most people equate with nuclear disaster, Three Mile Island might

   SOUTHCAROLINA-GAYS (Columbia, S.C.) _ In this tradition-bound
state, few things are viewed as seriously as an assault on the

IRAN: IF YOU GO, BRING CASH

<P>
   Tourism was discouraged until recently by the mullahs who won
the revolution, and they still don't make it easy. Solo travel is
nearly impossible for non-Farsi-speakers. So most foreigners join
groups, leaving to travel agencies arrangements for the mandatory
visa as well as hotels and in-country travel.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Traveling across the interior of Iran is
grueling. It's a big country, with only limited train service, so
you must take buses, private cars or Iran Air, which is not an
airline you would want to accumulate frequent-flier miles on.
Traffic conditions in cities and along the two-lane highways
between them range from scary to terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels: Most Iranian hotels that rise above the fleabag level
date from the shah's era, and the ones we stayed in were clean and
comfortable, if occasionally in need of sprucing up. Each room
offered the usual amenities, including TV and refrigerator. Hotel
bathrooms have Western-style toilets, but in public places most
toilets are of the squat variety.
</P>
<P>
   Food and drink: The water is safe, so we had no worries about
brushing our teeth or eating fresh fruit and salads. The food was
good, if a bit monotonous. Nearly every meal started with barley
soup, and every menu offered a range of kebabs. Rice accompanied
every entree. Chicken and lamb are the usual meats, but fish is
generally available. The bread is terrific, as are the yogurt and
the feta cheese served with fresh herbs. Drinks include soft drinks
and non-alcoholic beer _ booze is strictly forbidden by the
dictates of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Money and shopping: Bring cash, in small denominations. U.S.
credit cards and travelers checks are useless. The official
exchange rate is far below the black market rate. You can get in
serious trouble if the authorities catch you changing money
illegally. There's not a lot to buy, although the bazaar in Isfahan
features good handicrafts _ intricate wooden boxes and picture
frames, jewelry, textiles and the like. U.S. sanctions against Iran
prohibit the import of carpets.
</P>
<P>
   Further reading: ``The Iranians'' by Sandra Mackey is a
comprehensive general history, and the just-published paperback
version contains a useful political update. ``The Mantle of the
Prophet'' by Roy Mottahedeh discusses the role of Shia Islam, while
``Nine Parts of Desire'' by Geraldine Brooks looks at women's
issues throughout the Muslim world. ``The Art and Architecture of
Islam'' and ``Islamic Arts,'' both by Sheila Blair and Jonathan
Bloom, are informative. The only easily available guidebook is
Lonely Planet's 1997 edition of ``Iran.''

   HOUSTON _ Former Mayor Bob Lanier once told a convention of
radio talk-show hosts that he votes Democratic about three fourths
of the time.
</P>

   It wouldn't be the first time that Lanier helped a GOP
candidate. But his backing of a contender from the Bush clan is
rare.

   Lanier helped raise campaign money for Democratic presidential
candidates Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992. The
Republican candidate both times was George Bush, father of the
governor.

<P>
   In the 1994 gubernatorial contest, Lanier introduced Democratic
Gov. Ann Richards at a campaign event in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a word, she's a leader,'' he said, citing her work to
reduce crime and provide the city with transportation funds.

   She lost the election to George W. Bush.

   There are also political connections between Lanier and Bush,

   Austin political consultant Mark McKinnon produced television

   Bush and Lanier were on the same side last year when Bush signed

   But when Lanier's backers pushed a bill that would override
Houston's term limits and allow Lanier to run for mayor again, Bush
said the Legislature would never approve because it believes in
``local control.'' The proposal died in committee.

Netherlands tries to escape shadow
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MARSEILLE, France _ It's about the team that casts the longest
shadow in the world of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   And the team that stands in it.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil wins big games; the Netherlands loses them. Brazil
somehow always brings its diverse and often voluminous egos
together at just the right time. The Netherlands always manages to
strip itself apart.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has spent the last 40 years building a reputation for
greatness. The Netherlands has spent the last 20 helping others
achieve greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil vs. the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a painful history for us at the World Cup,'' Dutch
coach Guus Hiddink said. ``We have had many disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the contrasting fates of these multitalented teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Brazil,'' defender Cafu said. ``That means we are
obligated to win. And not just win, but win with style and playing
beautiful soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these are different times and different players from the
ones that spawned the travels of these soccer-loving nations _ the
likes of Brazil's Pele and Garrincha and the hard-luck Holland
heroes Johan Cruyff and Robbie Rensenbrink.
</P>
<P>
   But until something happens to change the course these teams
have taken, with Brazil having won four World Cup championships and
the Netherlands having fallen short twice, both nations realize the
shadows will remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the first memory I have of the Dutch national team
was when it lost the championship,'' Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp,
29, said, referring to the 1974 World Cup title game in which the
Dutch were heavily favored but lost to West Germany. ``I was very
upset. We want to win this World Cup and give our country what it
has wanted for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1974 and 1978 Dutch teams lost in the World Cup
finals has there been a better chance.
</P>
<P>
   But making today's World Cup semifinal at Stade Velodrome all
the more intriguing is the opponent, Brazil. It will be trying to
add to its great World Cup legacy in this game that promises much
excitement, considering the offensive-mindedness of both teams, and
is meaningful in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians could be on their way to an unprecedented fifth
Cup championship. The Dutch could be stepping out of the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a destiny that we had to play the Dutch,'' said
Brazil coach Mario Zagallo, who has faced the Netherlands as a
player, assistant coach and head coach. ``We cannot fight it. They
are a team that we should play. Our destiny is the Netherlands.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Zagallo was on the bench coaching when the Cruyff-led
Dutch defeated Brazil 2-0 in the Cup semifinals. Zagallo saw his
squad lose to an unforgettable side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the best team in the (1974) tournament,'' Zagallo
said. ``They played artful football. It was beautiful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was agonizing for the Netherlands. That 1974
Netherlands team recently was ranked among the top five best soccer
teams in history. But it is the only one among the five that didn't
win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 years later, it was agonizing again for the Dutch when
in Dallas the Netherlands fought back from a 2-0 deficit against
Brazil to tie the score, only to give up a free kick and lose 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game is still painful to remember,'' Dutch defender Jaap
Stam said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Netherlands team was quite similar to this one, with
the likes of Bergkamp and the de Boer twins, Frank and Ronald. It
was an extremely talented Dutch team, much like the 1974 and 1978
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was a self-destructive team, with apparent racial
tensions adding to its demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Dutch tradition to fall apart from the inside,''
Hiddink said. ``It is very disappointing and frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But this team promises more.
</P>
<P>
   There is apparent harmony both on the field and in the locker
room. Race issues have long been resolved, said midfielder Edgar
Davids, who is black and was at the center of the 1994 controversy.
The tensions came from a lack of getting to know one another on a
social level, Davids said.
</P>
<P>
   And on the field, everything is smooth. Twice already in
elimination games, the Dutch have scored in the final minute to
win, with Bergkamp's winning goal against Argentina last week among
the more memorable goals to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously have grown in power,'' Brazil defender Leonardo
said of the Dutch. ``I'm impressed by the way in which some very
strong individuals have managed to adapt to a collective mentality.
I'm also a little surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, it hasn't been the Dutch way to funnel formidable
talents together in such a way. When asked to name the last time he
saw a Dutch national team perform as cohesively and in such a
clutch fashion as this one has, Hiddink responded, ``I don't
remember when.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are a team that can prove to be the best,''
Bergkamp said. ``The only way to prove that is to play Brazil.
We've tasted a bit of success, and we want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brazil has drunk from the Cup so many times its nation is
addicted. It is expected to win today. And always.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Dutch tradition, the Brazilians traditionally
are individual and often egotistical superstars away from the
national team who somehow find a way to become one once they pull
on the yellow jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, there were persistent rumors and reports about
squabbles within the Brazilian team, most notably between forwards
Romario and Bebeto. But by the end of the tournament, Brazil was
happy and lofting the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Bebeto and Romario standing side-by-side, rocking
their arms back and forth in celebration of a key goal on the way
to the championship continues to be played over and over on the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The game in which that celebration took place was against the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope history repeats itself,'' Brazil's Ronaldo said. ``We
are playing much better as a team with every game in this
tournament. We are ready to win the Cup. We are ready to defend our
championship, and we know we are good enough to do it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martha Nierenberg was one of the lucky ones. When the Nazis
invaded her native Hungary on March 19, 1944, ``the whole family
went into hiding with a friend in Budapest,'' she recalled. ``By
noon, they were looking for my father.'' Unlike others with Jewish
backgrounds, she and most of her relatives soon escaped, including
her father, Alfonz Weiss. The Weisses were so important
economically _ employing 30,000 workers to make everything from
airplanes and tanks to tin cans and needles _ that they bartered a
25-year lease on their factory for freedom. When they fled, they
were escorted by police cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Nierenberg, now 74, also remembers what they left
behind _ especially the mansion of her maternal grandfather, Baron
Maurice Herzog, on Andrassy Boulevard, Budapest's Champs-Elysees.
``It was like a museum, like the Frick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those works, widely known as the Herzog Collection, now
hang in Hungarian museums where they were left for safekeeping
during the war or placed after being stolen by the Nazis and later
returned to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   She wants them back.
</P>
<P>
   But Hungary, the latest in a string of countries whose national
collections have been hit by individuals' claims for wartime
plunder, seems torn. As a fledgling democracy just starting to make
its way in the West, and as a country that itself is trying to
reclaim looted art in Canada and Russia, including many other
paintings from the Herzog Collection, it might be sympathetic. But
its national politics and cultural aspirations are tugging in the
opposite direction. Negotiations between the Nierenbergs' lawyers
and Hungarian officials, which began in mid-1996 and went smoothly
at first, broke down last winter, just as Hungary was gearing up
for a national election in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nierenberg and her husband, Ted, who live in Armonk, N.Y.,
thought they had an agreement last fall on 21 of the 30 works they
had so far claimed, including paintings by or attributed to El
Greco, Cranach, Zurbaran and van Dyke. A team of experts from
Sotheby's had valued the batch at $8 million to $14.5 million. ``We
were slightly conservative,'' said George Wachter, the director of
Sotheby's Old Master paintings department, partly because the works
were viewed on museum walls and could not be studied closely.
</P>
<P>
   Wachter called the Cranach and Zurbaran paintings ``fantastic
pictures,'' but said that the El Greco was best labeled ``workshop
of El Greco with the possible assistance of El Greco himself,'' and
that a Velazquez was also probably misattributed. ``It is a very
beautiful, high-quality picture, and if we did more research, we
might be able to go further,'' he said. ``But we said it should be
attributed to Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nierenbergs were willing to take back 60 percent of this
group, and to forgo the rest in lieu of Hungarian taxes. But, they
said, Hungarian officials soon reneged, proposing instead to study
the case further. The two sides have had no contact for months, and
neither agrees with the other's version of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stalling,'' Nierenberg said. ``I'm 75, and they think
I'll lose interest, and it will go away.'' (The couple's four
children have not focused on the quest.)
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians, however, differ. ``They do have some claims, but
we don't know how much,'' said Ivan Ronai, the director of the
department of cultural heritage in the Culture Ministry. ``Some
paintings were clearly deposited at the museum for safekeeping.
Some are less clear. We don't know how they got there.'' The
Nierenbergs have no contracts proving anything, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole collection in Hungary should be handled as a
package,'' he added. ``But until we know the exact status of each
painting, we are not in a position to bargain. That is why we
suggested arbitration. We're waiting for them to come back, but
they just refused.''
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg said he and his wife would agree to international
binding arbitration, but not the kind the Hungarians had in mind.
``They said, `We'll go to arbitration, but we pick three Hungarians
and you pick three Hungarians,''' he said. ``It was utterly
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Nierenbergs have decided to apply public pressure,
despite an early agreement not to talk about the dispute. ``The
Hungarians said they wanted to get into NATO, and they didn't want
any bad publicity,'' Nierenberg said. ``And then the government
felt it would lose the election if it gave away national
treasures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But with Hungary's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization seemingly assured, and with a new Hungarian government
in place, the Nierenbergs said going public was their best
recourse, even though diplomats say the new regime is more
nationalistic and less internationally minded than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The designated minister for preserving national cultural
heritage, Jozsef Hamori, just learned of the issue. Donald Blinken,
a former U.S. ambassador to Hungary who remains interested in the
case, raised it with him on a trip to Budapest in late June.
Reminding Hamori that Hungary was the first former East Bloc
country to allocate funds to pay Holocaust survivors a monthly
stipend, ``I told him Hungary did it right once and ought to come
to grips with this issue of art right away,'' Blinken said.
</P>
<P>
   The new government may also have a hard time taking a tough
stance in light of Hungary's activities with Canada. A year ago,
the Hungarian Culture Ministry quietly asked the Montreal Museum of
Fine Arts to return ``The Marriage Feast at Cana,'' by Giorgio
Vasari, which was stolen from the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts
during the war. The Montreal museum _ which said the painting had
been sold in 1961 by a state-owned store in Budapest and acquired
later by the museum in good faith _ responded that it had no
obligation to return the painting. It proposed ``co-ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary declined, and a lawyer for the Culture Ministry recently
gave letters outlining the dispute to the press. One, to the
museum's lawyers, dated Oct. 9, 1997, noted that when war losses
were discovered in North American museums, ``it has not been the
practice to hide behind national laws,'' but that ``a higher moral
and ethical standard has systematically been applied.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nierenberg case is also complicated by the looted art held
by the Russians. They intercepted many paintings stolen by the
Nazis in Hungary as the works, including many from the Herzog
Collection, were being shipped to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Baron Herzog had donated some paintings to the
Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, but he retained the bulk of the
collection. When he died in 1935, followed by his wife in 1941, the
collection was left mainly to his three children, one of whom was
Martha Nierenberg's mother, Elizabeth. Elizabeth (who married
Alfonz Weiss) later inherited the one-third share of her brother
Steven, who died in 1966. The other third was inherited by a
brother who died in a labor camp during the war and whose share
fell to his Italian ex-wife and their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Nierenberg, as the oldest surviving heir of Elizabeth
Weiss, said that she _ along with her sister, Mary, and brother,
John _ were entitled to two-thirds of the Herzog Collection.
</P>
<P>
   For years, no one in the family did anything about reclaiming
the art. Much of the Herzog Collection, whose 1,500 to 2,500 pieces
included decorative objects as well as paintings by Italian,
Spanish and Dutch Old Masters and French Impressionists, has simply
vanished. Besides, when the family sought compensation for its
industrial losses right after the war, what it got was bunch of
virtually worthless Hungarian coupons, Mrs. Nierenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This precedent dampened the family's whole desire,''
Nierenberg said. ``Why do anything for the art? We got bupkis for
the real estate and the factory,'' he added, using a Yiddish term
for nothing. The family did not know where the art was because of
the Iron Curtain, and Mrs. Nierenberg said her mother downplayed
the loss: ``Her feeling always was, `We were out, and it was
fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago, the Russians acknowledged that they held
``trophy art'' from the war in their museums and vaults. When they
started to exhibit it, some pictures were even labeled ``Herzog
Collection.'' The Pushkin Museum in Moscow, for example, displayed
``a big picture of El Greco's that was my mother's,'' Mrs.
Nierenberg said. That changed the Nierenbergs' minds. They set
their sights on Hungary because Russia has refused to give anything
back.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has not helped their cause with the Hungarians,
who have been trying since 1991 to retrieve works from Russia.
Minutes of the negotiating meetings with the Nierenbergs' lawyers
show that the Hungarian officials have tried several times to shift
the conversation to the works in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hungarians said we should help them get the Herzog
Collection back from Russia,'' Nierenberg said. ``They think it
belongs to them. If we get this settled, we might do something with
the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, the Nierenbergs said, they have spent more than
$50,000 on legal fees and on a curator they hired to prepare an
inventory of the art they lost and to substantiate their claims
that the paintings were left for safekeeping, not donated.
Nierenberg, who with his wife founded Dansk Design, the upscale
housewares maker, in 1954 and sold it in 1985 for about $20 million
to Brown-Forman, said he was willing to spend another $100,000 on
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   New government or not, it may not get easier. In recent months,
there has been a telling change. Previously, ``all these paintings
in the museum in Budapest were identified as `Herzog Collection,'''
Nierenberg said. Now, Blinken and other witnesses said, those
labels simply give the date of acquisition.

COMMENTARY: MIDEAST FUTURE SHOCK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The big talk in Israel last week was that three
young Israeli software designers, and their venture capitalist
backer, just sold their two-year-old company _ Mirabilis _ to
America Online for $287 million. Mirabilis is an Internet
communications tool that allows users to talk and exchange computer
files while on line. Israel is now second only to the United States
in the number of computer-related start-up companies spawned in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, up north, Syria is still debating whether to allow in
the Internet. A Palestinian businessman from Bethlehem who had just
returned from trying to do business in Damascus complained to me:
``If I go to Syria and I don't have fax, cell phones or Internet,
what do I do? These are my tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: What does it mean for the future of the Middle East
that Syria is still debating whether to get on the Internet and
Israel is already designing the next generation of the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   I think it means a lot. This widening tech gap between Israel
and her neighbors _ Israel's GDP is roughly equal to that of Egypt,
Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon and Syria combined _ will
simultaneously make Israel much less vulnerable to Arab political
pressures, terrorism, boycotts and the ups and downs of the peace
process, while making Israel much more vulnerable to conventional
or unconventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons. First, in the old days Israel grew
oranges, Morocco grew oranges, Spain grew oranges. So if importing
countries were upset with Israel they could easily punish it by
buying someone else's oranges. But what happens when there is only
one Mirabilis? What happens when an Israeli company near Tiberias
is the only one in the world that makes a key Ethernet switching
chip? What happens when Israeli companies start to dominate a key
tech sector like online tools for Internet security, which are
built around algorithms developed in the Technion and Israeli army?
</P>
<P>
   What happens is that everyone comes courting Israel, no matter
where the peace process is. Japan, which always shied away from
Israel fearing Arab retaliation, is now the second-largest venture
capital investor in Israel, after the United States. Japan is weak
in software design and has been gobbling up Israeli software
companies. China now has 52 scientists doing research at Israel's
renowned Weizmann Institute. India also has 52. ``If you have the
technology people want,'' an Israeli business writer told me, ``no
one cares if you are suppressing Palestinians.'' In the 1970s the
Arabs had what the Japanese needed most to fuel their economy _
oil. Now Israel has a raw material that others covet almost as much
_ information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Israel is less vulnerable to low-level pressures
is that knowledge investors are sophisticated. They understand,
unlike tourists, that when a shooting happens in Luxor, Egypt, it
is nowhere near their software-design center in Haifa, so they
don't run easily. Moreover, high-tech knowledge exports tend to be
very light and not easy to disrupt. Some are exported by modem.
Also, Israel's high-tech exports go, not to its neighbors, with
whom it is in tension, but to faraway markets in Asia, the European
Union and the United States. Finally, high-tech investment is in
people, not factories, which can be easily destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely this last point that underscores Israel's
vulnerability as well. Israel is developing a knowledge economy,
but knowledge workers are very mobile and they like to live in nice
places. If the key knowledge workers in Israel decide that the
situation has reached an intolerable point _ because they cannot
abide the rising influence of the ultra-Orthodox in political life,
or the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians or Prime Minister
Netanyahu's mounting attacks on Israeli intellectual elites _ then
knowledge people will leave.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while Israel's economy today might be able to absorb more
pain without economic costs, there is one thing it cannot absorb,
and that is a new war with the Palestinians. With a $17,000 a year
per capita income, Israel today has a standard of living close to
England's. The Mirabilis kids are the new role models in Israel,
where there are now long waiting lists for every engineering
school.
</P>
<P>
   If the political situation here deteriorates, and Netanyahu has
to call on Israeli boys to go back and recapture the West Bank and
Gaza, the Israeli middle class will be infuriated, and some will be
out the door. Israelis will never begrudge Netanyahu for bargaining
hard, but they will not accept a new war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more vulnerability _ that Israel will get so far
ahead of its neighbors that one of them will, out of humiliation or
frustration, lash out in some unconventional manner and try to
level the playing field _ and Israel. Those who can't make a bomb
will buy a bomb. Those who can't export software will export rage.

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ The trendy designer, embodied by Tom Ford at
Gucci, and the unapologetic industrialist, represented by Giorgio
Armani, now define fashion in Milan, and it speaks well of the city
that both can thrive in such a hothouse. Seemingly overnight, Milan
has become the magnet for designers from around the globe showing
their menswear for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clamor, designers can attract attention in two ways.
They can, like Armani, command it with vast reserves of
professional esteem born of creating fashion history, like Robert
De Niro's luring movie audiences with the same role. Otherwise,
like Leonardo di Caprio, they had better offer something new, and
it should preferably be young.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet able to take the first path, Ford went with the
alternative. After four years of creating the image of the Gucci
man as cynical sexpot, he has recast him as the dreamy romantic.
The startling transformation made Gucci the show of this round,
which ended Thursday with Ford capturing an emerging quixotic
spirit in menswear.
</P>
<P>
   It's axiomatic that fashion is about change, but how and when a
design house should change has become an urgent question as
companies have expended and fashion has become a tentacle of global
entertainment. Once a designer establishes a successful image, does
he move on and risk millions in sales? Or does he hold fast to his
concept and possibly lose relevance? That Milan had strong
contenders for both positions indicates there are no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek Gucci look of sullen sophistication was in danger of
growing stale. Ford replaced it with clothes that reeked of giddy
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted things to be less perfect, less matched,'' Ford said.
``Suits were not as important.'' The show, he said, was about mood.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts, in gauzy pink or military khaki, will look familiar
to baby boomers, who came of age in the 1970s, and almost everyone
will recognize the hip-hop drop-crotch trousers. But there were new
twists everywhere, like an extraordinary khaki shirt sequined and
beaded in cobalt-blue flowers, baggy pants in hot pink and the new
Gucci shoe _ a sneaker with Velcro straps and the old double-G
Gucci canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Ford juxtaposed a pristine white zip-front shirt with Velcro
snap at the collar with distressed white baggy trousers. A simple
gray sleeveless T-shirt topped gray flannel pants awash in enough
crystals and embroidery to raise Liberace from the dead. And the
Gucci suit itself was tamed with a looser shape and plainer-looking
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholders will be watching to see if Ford wins his crapshoot.
The most prominent among them, Miuccia Prada and her husband,
Patrizio Bertelli, owners of Prada, in two transactions last month
acquired a 9.5 percent stake in Gucci, a publicly traded company.
None of the principals in the two companies, including Ford, the
creative director and a stockholder, will say much about the
investment, which was unsolicited by Gucci and is extraordinary in
fashion circles.
</P>
<P>
   The distraction obviously did not dampen Ford's creativity, nor
that of Ms. Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Her white, sheer nylon shirt slipped easily over gray trouser
shorts, which ended midcalf in the gather characteristic of sweat
pants. Shirt jackets in breezy fabrics had the boxiness of a jacket
but the cuffs of a shirt. The collars on summer coats and suits _
less boyish than last season's _ were left raw.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prada notwithstanding, Italy owes its reputation to
industrialization. There is now plenty of creativity, partly
because of a cosmopolitan atmosphere typical of Paris. Americans
show in Milan. New, too, are the formidable Belgians, the Japanese,
the Canadians and the English.
</P>
<P>
   American designer John Bartlett, in his first presentation for
Byblos, drew upon ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' the moody cult film
starring Steve McQueen. Bartlett used the movie as a reference
point for his own men's line, shown this year in New York with more
success. But his touch was assured, and polished-denim two-button
suits with orange zippered body shirt, bold geometrically striped
knits and slim white leather jeans refreshed the parade of
nonchalant, athletic fashion on some runways around town.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Edwards, the American collection designed by Richard
Bengstrom and Edward Pavelik, was handsome, with a visible
improvement in quality. The designers put an easy hand to anoraks
with drawstrings above the waist, loose trousers, pinstripe jeans,
and knit polos with quilting on the sleeves, all in quenching
shades of white, blue and khaki.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein has the might of an industrialist, but he has
chosen to dance aggressively at fashion's edge. His unlined and
unconstructed jackets fell over wide pants with a drawstring at the
waist. A honey-color leather pullover or a white or gray cotton
drawstring shirt was paired with nonchalant drop-crotch trousers,
also in white and gray.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Paul Gaultier's image is rooted in challenging status-quo
sensibilities. The humor of his show made it perfect for customers
cruising for fun pieces. Low culture has become an endless source
of inspiration for the intelligentsia, designers included. Suburban
summers spent guzzling bear in washed-out jeans came to life on
Gaultier's sand-covered runway. Knit tops strained against models'
pectorals, softened by roomy trousers, and when cool nights call
for a cover-up, there are blouson jackets with ribbed-knit trim for
men nostalgic for Members Only.
</P>
<P>
   Designers like Dirk Bikkembergs, Alessandro Dell'Acqua and Ennio
Capasa for Costume National have built their reputations on change.
Bikkembergs invited his audience to the source of his inspiration,
an ice-skating rink. As guests took their seats at the center of
the ice, about a dozen speed skaters in red unitards zoomed around
the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   The show explored the theme with strong fitted sweaters, piped
in the elliptical shape of a skating rink, worn with baggy
trousers. There were red leggings with a navy stripe down the side
under tailored jackets, pinstripe suits with large shoulders and
flapping pants and loose tunic tops with deep scooped necklines.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dell'Acqua was not able to make his creations work so smoothly.
His sheer fitted Champagne-tone nylon tops with raised seams down
the front and straight-leg pants with fraying seams provided
interesting touches, but many of the clothes were oversimplistic
or, like over-the-knee shorts, unflattering.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly or uncomfortable clothes are no longer interesting. Even
designers like Capasa, who just two years ago was contributing his
share of them, is adding elegant touches and softening his approach
with wonderful results. It began with reversible leather shirt
jackets in black and stone, supple and relaxed. The most casual of
spring garments, the khaki-color jacket, came in double-faced
cotton. Capasa's mixes of paler khaki with mushroom-brown were
appealing, and several jackets were made from paperlike cotton. And
while many designers ease their suits with knitwear, Capasa has
suddenly gone back to shirts. This kind of about-face separates
designers who set trends again and again from those stuck in a
mold.
</P>
<P>
   Armani defiantly calls himself ``an industrialist,'' in
explanation of the small changes he has made in his line each
season. ``It's a slow process because you've got to sell your
collection at the end of the day,'' he said. ``You have to educate
the consumer. Men don't want a big revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Within his collection of fluid drapey signature suits, Armani
did offer some novelty, like loose Chinese worker jackets with
matching pants. Although Armani says he is restlessly in search of
a new silhouette, he could do much to refresh his benchmark look by
casting some of his designs in crisp or modern synthetic fabrics,
rather than putting see-through tops under suits.
</P>
<P>
   Like Armani, Valentino and Gianfranco Ferre approach menswear
with familiarity in mind. Such designers, swaddled in the blanket
of success and acclaim, risk missing the cues that it is time to
move on.

<TEXT>
<P>
   REGINA, Saskatchewan _ Along with Chief Long Dog's three-bladed
tomahawk and the fading stuffed remains of Nero, the loyal parade
horse, the hanging rope used to dispatch a rebel, Louis Riel, 113
years ago was one of the most popular exhibits in the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police museum.
</P>
<P>
   All that visitors can see of that exhibit today, though, are
glue marks and tack holes where the rope used to be mounted. The
museum's directors removed it last year after some Indian police
recruits complained that the macabre artifact offended them.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's willingness to bend to the complaint is just one
small sign that even 11 decades have not been enough to quell the
unrest and bitterness surrounding Riel's execution.
</P>
<P>
   To some in Canada, Riel remains a traitor who was hanged for
leading a deadly rebellion of Metis _ settlers of mixed European
(primarily French) and Indian descent who were in the way of
westward expansion after Canada became a dominion in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   But for many in this country where heroes seem to be as scarce
and sought after as warming breezes, he has become a bona fide
figure of admiration, a misunderstood martyr who stood up for his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   To the Metis, who have never been officially recognized by
Canada as a separate people, he is a rallying point for a dim dream
of nationhood. According to the latest government figures, there
are about 152,000 Metis, and they make up about 19 percent of
Canada's total Indian population.
</P>
<P>
   To French Catholics in Quebec, especially separatists, the
French-speaking Riel _ a devout Catholic _ symbolizes the will of
minorities to overcome oppression and stand up for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   And to people all over the western part of this vast country,
Riel has come to stand for western alienation and the struggle to
be recognized by the east, where power still resides.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from all three groups, the federal government has
had to re-evaluate Riel's place in Canadian history. When it issued
an apology in January to Canada's Indians for the abuse they had
suffered through several hundred years of paternalistic treatment,
the government promised to reassess Riel's conviction and
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse the government of revisionism. They have focused
their anger on a parliamentary bill that would officially reverse
Riel's conviction for high treason and designate him a founding
father of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they come again,'' The Calgary Herald said in a recent
editorial, ``the revisionists with their soap and scouring pads,
eager to scrub away at the dirty little stains of history until
it's all cleaned up and made presentable for the mores of the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's sponsors say they are simply setting the record
straight. ``We don't want to change one second of history,'' said
Reg Alcock, a Liberal sponsor of the bill from Winnipeg, Manitoba,
which was the site of another rebellion led by Riel, in 1869.
</P>
<P>
   Alcock said his own feelings about Riel had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing Riel was some kind of murderous traitor,''
he said. ``It wasn't until I was in my early 20s, when the province
of Manitoba put a statue to him on the back lawn of the Legislature
in 1972, that I started thinking about it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when Riel's historical standing began to change is not
clear. But it seems to have coincided with the period after World
War II when Canada began to turn away from Britain and toward the
United States, with its emphasis on individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is not uncommon to find schools and community buildings
named for the man who was executed for high treason against the
queen.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Riel was an extraordinary character _ an
unusually vibrant mix of worldliness and grass-roots leadership. He
was a literate man who spoke French and English and was elected
several times to the Canadian Parliament _ but then prohibited by
English-speaking Protestants from taking his seat in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   He was an outspoken Catholic at a time when English Canada was
overwhelmingly Protestant, and he rallied thousands of Metis to
defy the surveyors sent to tame the land that would become the
province of Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also capable of demagoguery. When a kangaroo court
convicted an English Protestant, Thomas Scott, of leading a
counterinsurgency against the Metis, Riel did not intervene,
although a word from him apparently would have been sufficient to
prevent the execution.
</P>
<P>
   After the execution, the forces against Riel mounted and he fled
to the United States in 1870. He remained in exile on and off for
much of the next 15 years. The Canadian government offered to pay
him to remain in exile but Metis friends persuaded him to return to
the Canadian prairie. In 1885, he arrived in the area of the west
that would become Saskatchewan to help defend the Metis against
continuing English migration.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out _ what Canadian history books call the
Northwest Rebellion of 1885 and what the Metis call the Northwest
Resistance. The Canadian government became intent on getting rid of
Riel, who by then saw himself as the Metis' Messiah. He was
captured, charged with treason, put on trial and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in Canadian Lawyer published in February, Ronald
Olesky made a convincing case that the government rigged the trial
against Riel. ``The Crown's tactics were directed toward conviction
at any cost,'' Olesky wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Since there were no trees growing on the prairie then,
scaffolding was built next to the Regina headquarters of the
Northwest Mounted Police, precursor of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. On Nov. 16, 1885, with a rope attached to the scaffolding
around his neck, Riel was forced out the second-floor window of the
guard room and was hanged.
</P>
<P>
   The hanging took place not far from the museum where the rope
had been displayed. Today, the hanging site is a pleasant patch of
well-watered grass, flanked by lines of poplars and pines. A
memorial will be erected there someday, if the Metis agree.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   So far, they have opposed the bill before Parliament. They say
that anything short of outright and complete exoneration would be
an injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just accept history as the status quo without ever
questioning it, then it's not history, it's myth, and you might as
well build a temple to it,'' said Jean Teillet, a great-grandniece
of Riel and a lawyer in Toronto. ``You know what they say about
history being written by the victors.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Riel is not likely to end soon. A proposal
earlier this year to change the name of a homely stretch of highway
around the city from the Ring Road to Riel Way has stalled because
of fears it would cost too much to make new road signs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not likely that the hanging rope will ever be returned
to the display in the Mounties' museum, said William Mackay, the
museum's curator. It was the only noose the museum displayed, and
the curator doubts it is real.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the museum has three pieces of rope, each identified
by somebody as the right one and each a different length and
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mounties' forensic lab is now analyzing the pieces, but
Mackay doubts that will prove anything. One piece came to the
museum years ago from a donor who got it from the friend of a
friend. One came in anonymously in the mail. The third was brought
in by a man who said he bought it at the railway station, and
Mackay said there are accounts of Riel hanging ropes being openly
hawked in Regina up to World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the Riel exhibit has not changed, nor will it,
Mackay said. High treason, rebellion, all the inflammatory words
remain. But the rope is gone, even though it probably never slipped
around anyone's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the symbolism that counts,'' Mackay said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Louis Riel, it always is.

ITALY RECOVERS THREE STOLEN PAINTINGS _ AND ITS WOUNDED PRIDE
</HEADLINE>

By ALESSANDRA STANLEY  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Bursting into apartments in Turin and Rome in pre-dawn
raids, the Italian police on Monday recovered two Van Goghs and a
Cezanne stolen from the National Gallery of Modern Art. The raids
ended a seven-week search for the paintings, among Italy's most
valuable post-Impressionist works.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, three armed robbers hid inside the museum until
closing time, then tied up three guards, turned off the alarm and
walked out with the paintings, a brazen theft that was deeply
humiliating to the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a bleeding wound that Italy didn't deserve,'' Deputy
Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said at a news conference to
announce the recovery and the arrest of eight Italian suspects,
including a museum employee. ``Today, the wound is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Veltroni, who is also the minister of culture, described the
theft as the work of professional robbers. Police investigators,
who traced the gang members through the museum employee with
wiretaps and surveillance, said they identified the suspects more
than a month ago but moved slowly for fear the artworks could be
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult and risky operation because we had to make
sure we didn't endanger the paintings,'' said Italo Ormanni, the
prosecutor who led the investigation. ``It was more important to
recover them than make the arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the paintings _ ``Le Jardinier,'' by Van Gogh, and ``Le
Cabenon de Jourdan,'' by Cezanne _ were found unharmed and wrapped
in blankets and cardboard under a bed and on top of a wardrobe in
an apartment in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of
Rome. The other Van Gogh _ ``L'Arlesienne'' _ was found in Turin in
an apartment that also held guns, rifles, masks, false beards and
material that could be used to make bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Italy overflows with Renaissance treasures, but it has very few
post-Impressionist and Modernist works. The Van Goghs were the only
oil paintings by the artist in Italy. ``Le Cabenon de Jourdan'' was
the country's only major work by Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is also rich in art thefts. The police estimate that more
than 4,000 valuable works have been stolen in the last 30 years. In
1992 thieves stole 13 paintings, including a Velasquez, from a
museum in Modena. All were later recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Crime prevention has improved in recent years. Veltroni said
that art theft was 50 percent lower this year than last year, and
that half the stolen works are recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Veltroni said all three paintings would be back on display on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the suspected robbers, the police said, had previously
served jail sentences for armed robbery in Belgium. While tracing
the paintings, the investigators said, they overheard the suspects
plotting robberies in France and Belgium, and tipped off their
European counterparts about the plans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 100 Italian law-enforcement officers worked the case.
They investigated all 160 museum employees, eventually focusing on
one woman, a guard, who had contacts with people with criminal
records, and who is accused of helping the robbers plan their
break-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the question of whether there was an inside
connection was confirmed, and this for me ruins the joy of the
recovery,'' said Alessandra Pinto, director of the National Gallery
of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   But she also saw a bright side: ``At the same time, the fact
that someone inside the gallery assisted the criminals dismantles
the charges that our security system was inefficient. It is much
more difficult to protect things if it is an inside job.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said the robbers had hoped to make $18 million by
selling the paintings abroad to private collectors, a plan that art
experts found preposterous. Officials said the suspects had
contacted one art trafficker to fence the stolen paintings, and
were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had been experts in art theft, they would never have
chosen these three paintings,'' said Francesco Maria Benedetti,
director of operations of the art theft squad of Italy's military
police. ``They are too well known and too difficult to sell. These
people were bank robbers and very dangerous people, but they did
not know much about art.''

INDIA, WITH AN EYE ON CHINA, INSISTS IT WILL DEVELOP A NUCLEAR
DETERRENT
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In talks with the United States on nuclear
weapons, which are to resume on Sunday, India will insist on its
right to develop a nuclear arsenal capable of giving it a ``minimum
deterrent'' against China, a senior official says.
</P>
<P>
   But in a briefing for Western reporters on Sunday, the official,
from the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said India
would offer concessions, including several the United States has
rejected in the past as insufficient. He said India was also
willing ``eventually'' to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
fulfilling a pledge by Vajpayee that India will not conduct more
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said India already had nuclear weapons it could use in a conflict
with Pakistan or China, its likely adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Whether India is capable of firing nuclear weapons, or needs
months or possibly years to turn its technology into usable
weapons, has been an open issue since India announced five
underground nuclear tests two months ago. Pakistan followed in late
May with two rounds of nuclear tests of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking me if we have a delivery system, the answer
is, `Yes, we do,' '' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   India and the United States have already held one round of
inconclusive discussions since the nuclear tests, during a visit to
Washington last month by Jaswant Singh, a senior official of the
Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist group that leads
India's 14-party coalition government. Singh is to hold a second
round of talks on Sunday in Frankfurt with Strobe Talbott, the
deputy secretary of state; Talbott is to follow up with a visit to
New Delhi on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing officer said that India was ready to take steps to
respond to Western pressures. The most important, he said, would be
its readiness to sign the test-ban treaty once Indian negotiators
had determined ``what we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   By this the official appeared to mean that India would use the
prospect of signing the treaty as a bargaining chip in its bid to
get the United States to lift or at least ease the wide-ranging
economic sanctions Washington imposed after the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In a potentially significant reformulation of earlier statements
on the treaty, the official said India would no longer demand that
the treaty be rewritten to include language committing all nuclear
powers to a schedule for reducing and eventually eliminating their
nuclear arsenals. The official said India recognized that with more
than 140 nations having signed the treaty, it was impractical to
expect it to be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, India would press its case for total nuclear
disarmament within the so-called Non-Aligned Movement and in the
United Nations, forums where India has pressed for the elimination
of nuclear weapons for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Before possibly signing the treaty, the official said, India is
ready to take other steps: turning India's pledge not to conduct
further nuclear tests into what he called ``a legally binding
international commitment;'' making a similarly binding pledge not
to transfer nuclear technology to other countries, and pledging to
join negotiations in Geneva on a new treaty to limit the production
of the fuels required for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said India would not accept the main demand by
the United States: that India give up development of a nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected another American demand, a halt to missile
tests, because India sees the tests as essential to develop a
deterrent. All five established nuclear powers _ Britain, France,
China, Russia, and the United States _ have called on India and
Pakistan to halt all steps toward developing nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The official said India expected China to be the most resolute
in pressing for India not to develop a nuclear arsenal. But he said
India was equally determined that it would have an arsenal to
balance China's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is not Pakistan,'' he said. ``Our problem is
China. We are not seeking parity with China. We don't have the
resources, and we don't have the will. What we are seeking is a
minimum deterrent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The official made his remark about being able to deliver nuclear
weapons in response to a reporter who noted that India has
fighter-bombers that could be adapted to carry nuclear weapons. But
the official did not specify whether the delivery system he was
referring to involved aircraft or missiles. Western intelligence
agencies have estimated that India has a few dozen nuclear
warheads, but have expressed doubt that the warheads are ready for
use.
</P>
<P>
   Most military experts said India and Pakistan could use their
small stockpiles of nuclear warheads only after a time-consuming
and technically complex process of mating the warheads to delivery
systems, either aircraft or missiles. At the same time, having
declared themselves nuclear powers, both countries would almost
certainly want their adversaries to believe that the weapons were
ready for possible use.
</P>
<P>
   The government's readiness to talk about concessions on the
issue appears to have been hastened by the changing public mood in
India, which has gone from euphoria over the tests to anxieties
over the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties have aggravated the slump in the economy that
had already begun as a result of the crisis elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   India has endured a 20 percent drop in share prices since the
nuclear tests, a 7 percent fall in the value of the rupee against
the dollar and a flight of foreign investments.

   ROY-ROGERTOWN (Los Angeles) _ To the folks in the Los Angeles
community of Chatsworth, Roy Rogers was more than America's
favorite cowboy. The singing cowboy WAS Chatsworth, the man who
lived in the ranch house on Trigger Street. All around town, from
the commuter train station he and Dale dedicated three years ago to
the chamber of commerce, where they're working up plans to give the
town a Western makeover, people reminisced about the man's goodness
in the place where Rogers and his wife Dale Evans spent their
working years and made many of their Western movies. Rogers and
Evans, who lived in a six-bedroom ranch house in the Chatsworth
neighborhood, later developed many homes in the area, plotting them
on streets like Trigger and Dale. The singing cowboy died Monday of

 &HT;    How will great pitching from Maddux, Wells stand up in Coors
Field?
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Tonight's pitching matchup in the All-Star Game
represents two players from different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   There's Atlanta's Greg Maddux, a perfectionist on the mound who
lives on his control and away from the game he's quiet, almost
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's David Wells of the Yankees, who relies on a hard
fastball and curve, his delivery a bunch of arms and legs and off
the field he argues with his owner and counts O.J. detective Mark
Fuhrman as one of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be interesting,'' said National League manager Jim
Leyland of the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   It could be more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux and Wells could find themselves paired against each other
come the World Series as their teams went into the break with the
best records in the their respective leagues.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, it's probably two innings apiece as Maddux is
on his seventh All-Star team, his third start while Wells is making
his second appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And Coors Field has never been very friendly to Maddux. He has
allowed 14 earned runs in 18 innings here and when asked what the
difference was between Coors and other parks he said, ``Slider
doesn't slide as much, curve doesn't curve as much. But you can
still pitch here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has pitched just once in Denver, back in 1995 when he was
playing for Cincinnati and when asked what his strategy would be in
a park where balls travel 10 percent further a major league record
222 homers were hit last season, he said, ``Duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells went on to add, ``You just have to create something. I
think hopefully I have a vision of a high-scoring game, but
hopefully not when I'm in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the game is at Coors and because of all the home runs
that have been hit throughout baseball this season, there are a lot
of offensive expectations when such players as Mark McGwire and Ken
Griffey Jr. walk up to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But said Griffey, ``The two starting pitchers that will be
starting, I don't know if it's going to be a high scoring game ...
maybe a quick game. But hopefully it's a lot of fun. Hopefully the
fans get what they want: A couple of guys get some home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, the game could turn out to be a power classic like
there was back in 1971 at Tiger Stadium when six future Hall of
Famers hit homers, a group that included Hank Aaron and Roberto
Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NL leads the series 40-27-1 though last year the
AL won 3-1 in Cleveland, the NL's only run coming on a homer by
Javier Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will have three players in tonight's starting lineup.
In addition to Maddux, there is Chipper Jones at third and Walt
Weiss at second. Lopez will likely come on in the fourth inning and
replace Mike Piazza behind the plate while Andres Galarraga goes to
first after McGwire gets at least two at-bats. Also, Tom Glavine
will pitch, probably behind San Diego's Kevin Brown who is expected
to replace Maddux after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is always a good time,'' said Glavine, who is on his
sixth All-Star team. ``There have been a couple of times where I
haven't pitched, but I want to this time because I have had some
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lopez, ``I sort of feel like this is my first All-Star
Game, I guess I will always feel that way no matter how many times
I come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Maddux, ``These games are great to play in. You know, you
just play. It's almost like spring training. You really enjoy the
game. There is no pressure to win or anything like that. You have
fun.''

MEXICO'S RULING PARTY WINS A HUGE VICTORY IN CHIHUAHUA STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico _ Mexico's governing party, which has seemed
in retreat before a rising opposition tide, has swept to one of its
most important triumphs, electing a former businessman to the
governorship of Chihuahua and for the first time recovering a state
that had been controlled by rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Sunday's Chihuahua elections, announced on Monday,
was the second stinging defeat in a year for National Action, the
pro-business party known as the PA, which had governed Chihuahua
since 1992 and which some had seen as the opposition's best chance
to win the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission accomplished!'' Patricio Martinez Garcia, Chihuahua's
governor-elect from President Ernesto Zedillo's party, known as the
PRI, said in a victory news conference on Monday. ``We've
triumphed. We've recovered Chihuahua.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI split the results in two other northern states where
there was gubernatorial balloting, winning easily in Durango, where
the opposition vote was divided among three candidates, and losing
in a more closely-watched election in neighboring Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   The Zacatecas vote gave an important lift to Mexico's leftist
opposition party, whose victorious candidate was a PRI legislative
leader who defected to the Party of the Democratic Revolution
earlier this year after being passed over for the governing party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zacatecas loss was more than compensated by the PRI's
victory in Chihuahua, one of Mexico's fastest-growing industrial
states, bordering Texas and New Mexico, which has often functioned
as a harbinger of political experimentation and change in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN's rise from a marginal party of conservative Catholic
ideologues began with victories in Chihuahua towns and cities in
the early 1980s, including the election of Francisco Barrio as
Ciudad Juarez's mayor in 1983. In 1992 gubernatorial voting here,
Barrio became only the second opposition figure ever to win control
of a Mexican statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now the PRI's victory here has reversed Chihuahua's symbolism.
Making the damage worse, the PAN candidate, Ramon Galindo, said
repeatedly during the campaign that ``the battle for Chihuahua is
the battle for Mexico,'' suggesting that a victory by the PRI here
would complicate the opposition's quest to wrest the presidency
from the PRI for the first time in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo acknowledged his defeat on Monday in a moist-eyed news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Corral, a federal congressman from Chihuahua who is the
spokesman for the PAN's national executive committee and who
accompanied Galindo in his news conference, laid his party's defeat
to a slander campaign in which the PRI told voters that the PAN
intended to dismantle Chihuahua's public schools, forcing poor
families to pay for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI waged a dirty war, systematically distorting our
party's image through a campaign of insults and false
accusations,'' Corral said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, Barrio, now a lame-duck governor, took a more
philosophical approach in a meeting with reporters in the Chihuahua
governor's palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even defeats can be opportunities if you know how to take
advantage of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN's defeat appears to end any chance that Barrio might run
for president. Instead, the Chihuahua elections strengthen the
likelihood that the PAN will pick as its presidential candidate
Vicente Fox, the governor of the central state of Guanajuato, who
began campaigning in earnest for the job early this year. But
Barrio refused to rule anything out of his own future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to identify things to improve and change about our
party,'' Barrio said. ``Today's defeats can be the germs of
tomorrow's victories.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Aziz Nassif, a professor who has written two books about
Chihuahua politics, seconded Barrio's call for introspection within
the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PAN needs to do some self-criticism,'' Aziz said,
describing Galindo as a lackluster candidate with a weak record as
Mayor of Ciudad Juarez. ``They need to seriously examine how they
pick their candidates and how they develop their image.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, Aziz said, ``has shown they are capable of learning
from their mistakes and adapting to new situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Zarate Flores, the editor of a Mexican political
newsletter, agreed. ``These elections prove that its too early to
announce the PRI's funeral,'' Zarate said. ``Now we see that when
the PRI combines an attractive candidate and good marketing with
its efficient political machinery, they can win elections.''

GAY RIGHTS DRIVE MEETS FIERCE RESISTANCE IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ It was not by accident that the first shot of
the Civil War was fired in this tradition-bound state, where few
things are viewed so seriously as an assault on the inherited
culture. It is a place where lawmakers still scoff at suggestions
that the Confederate flag be removed from the Capitol dome and
where only a federal court order enabled women to enroll at the
Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with increasing vigor, the resistance to change
extends to another perceived threat: homosexuality. For more than
two years, leaders of this state's churches, governments and
schools have erected barrier after barrier against a cultural
invasion that many view as an affront to their most cherished
values.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year with little economic discontent, Senate
majority leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., brought new focus to the
politics of morality when he declared in a television interview in
June that homosexuality is a sin. But if Lott was trying to
escalate a rhetorical war on homosexuality, the battle was joined
some time ago here in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It began in May 1996, when the Greenville County Council adopted
a resolution declaring homosexuality incompatible with community
standards. The decision, on a vote of 9-3, prompted organizers of
the run carrying the Olympic torch to Atlanta to shelter the flame
in a van as it moved through the rapidly growing county.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months alone, the mayor of Myrtle Beach has
joined business and religious leaders in opposing a gay-pride rally
there (it took place anyway), a high school principal has canceled
a free concert by the Indigo Girls, at least partly because parents
complained that the rock singers, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, are
lesbians, and a Republican candidate for state agriculture
commissioner has vowed to protect the family farm from the
``homosexual movement.''
</P>
<P>
   While a recent report by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
asserts that a growing majority of Americans support equality for
homosexuals, gay rights leaders acknowledge that South Carolina may
be a microcosm of much of nonurban America. The state is inherently
conservative in its politics, religion and social practices, and
many here regard the increasing openness of gay life as emblematic
of a broader moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just homosexuality,'' said the Rev. Steve R. Hubbard,
a 37-year-old Baptist minister from Myrtle Beach who organized a
family-values coalition in response to this year's gay-pride rally.
``We've got a 60 percent divorce rate. We've got kids killing kids
in our schools. We've got prostitution. We've got sexually
transmitted diseases at an all-time high. We've got gambling that
is destroying families. And in the end, what is always hurt is the
traditional family, which provides for a community and a
civilization what no other unit can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   But gay rights leaders, political scientists and government
officials also agree that a distinct confluence of factors has
contributed to the rawness of gay rights conflicts here: the
pervasiveness of fundamentalist Christianity, which interprets
scriptural warnings against homosexuality as God-given truth; the
ties between religious conservatives and the state's surging
Republican Party; the increasing activism of the state's gay
community; the South's history of bigotry, and the state's
resistance to cultural change, racial and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here perceive themselves on the defensive, defending
their culture, their religion, their communities, against outside
forces,'' said Charles W. Dunn, a political scientist at Clemson
University. ``They see these changes, such as homosexuality, and
they rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's gay leaders say homosexuals have been energized
by the attacks, with more taking an active stand on political
issues. Gay rights organizations have been established in all the
state's major cities. Columbia has a gay community center that
advertises itself with a pink triangle on its sign. The gay-pride
march in Myrtle Beach this year, the ninth annual event in the
state, attracted an estimated total of 5,000 to 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders depict their victimization as in keeping with a
legacy of Southern hate. While public expressions of racism are no
longer acceptable in the region, they say, there is no such taboo
against homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be discrimination against gays and lesbians
everywhere, but here the gay-baiting is so open,'' said Harriet D.
Hancock, a mother of three, including a gay son, and co-chairwoman
of the South Carolina chapter of Parents, Families and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays. ``It used to be race-baiting. Now it's
gay-baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Snell, co-chairman of the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian
Pride Movement, which has a mailing list of 8,000 to 10,000, said
the state's homosexuals were ``the scapegoat du jour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've sent a message here,'' Snell said of antigay forces,
``that it's OK to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   But church leaders depict their message as one of hate for the
sin and love for the sinner.
</P>
<P>
   Like many fellow clerics, the Rev. Stan Y. Craig, the pastor of
Choice Hills Baptist Church in Greenville and an organizer of his
city's Citizens for Traditional Family Values, cites the Bible as
the foundation of his approach to gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he believed that homosexuality was ``demonic'' and
``a stench in the nostrils of God.'' His organization's blue and
white placards proclaim that homosexuality is ``Satan's plot for
our children'' and that ``sodomy is not a family value.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade C. Cleveland, one of the three members of the Greenville
County Council who opposed its resolution against homosexuality,
said that homophobia might not be more prevalent in South Carolina
than elsewhere but that it might be more virulent, ``because we get
it so honestly from the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's justified by God,'' Cleveland said, ``you can do a
whole lot more through a jihad than through normal dislikes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Snell and Ms. Hancock argue that fundamentalist zeal has
influenced policy and political rhetoric because of the dependency
of Republican politicians on the votes of religious conservatives.
The state GOP is certain enough of its constituents' views on
homosexuality that it does not even poll on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like asking everybody if they're for free ice
cream,'' said Trey Walker, a party spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a state like South Carolina, pollsters warn,
Republican candidates can expect a backlash if they attack
homosexuals with malice. And recent elections here have shown that
the most socially conservative candidate does not always win
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, in the last 14 months, Gov. David M. Beasley,
Lieut. Gov. Robert L. Peeler, Attorney General Charles M. Condon
and Rep. Bob Inglis, who is running for the U.S. Senate this year
against longtime Democratic incumbent Ernest F. Hollings, have all
attended family-values rallies that were organized in reaction to
gay rights marches.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Senate race, state Republican chairman Henry
McMaster has already derided Hollings' sponsorship of a 1983 bill
to protect homosexuals from employment discrimination. At the state
Republican convention in May, David Eckstrom, who later won the
party's nomination for state education superintendent, spent more
than a third of his speech touting his support for the cancellation
of the Indigo Girls concert at Irmo High School, near Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to take a stand,'' said Eckstrom, who is
chairman of the school board that governs Irmo High. ``If the
Indigo Girls got their feelings hurt, that's too bad.'' Eckstrom
later mailed text of his remarks to religious conservatives around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the political use of gay issues a step farther, Jim
Gordon, a Republican candidate for state agriculture commissioner,
declared last month that ``we can't have farming based on Bob and
Bob being married and a new definition of marriage.'' Gordon won 31
percent of the vote in a three-way primary on June 9, finishing
second to the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, gay rights leaders find much wanting in South
Carolina's legal code. It is one of 14 states that outlaw sodomy,
both homosexual and heterosexual, according to the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force. It is one of 29 states with laws prohibiting
same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislature, which has a Republican-controlled House
and a Democratic-majority Senate, banned same-sex marriages in
1996, Gov. Beasley said that ``America is in a moral meltdown today
because its leaders, under pressure from special interest groups,
want to always appear tolerant.'' Beasley declined to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is also one of nine states without a hate crime
law of any kind. After a racial shooting in 1997, Condon, the
Attorney General, proposed hate crime legislation that would have
assigned special penalties to those convicted of crimes motivated
by racial bigotry. But when lawmakers introduced a competing bill
that would have expanded the definition of a hate crime to include
bias attacks against women and homosexuals, Condon dropped his
support, saying it would be impossible to gain passage for such
legislation. He also declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay leaders blame Condon and others for contributing to a
climate that encourages anti-gay violence. Twice in the last seven
months, they point out, a lesbian named Regan Wolf has been
brutally whipped at her home near Lancaster, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   In both incidents, Ms. Wolf was knocked unconscious at her home
and strung up spread-eagle on a porch. The beatings left horizontal
red stripes across her back, as if she had lain on a sizzling
grill. In the first incident, a message was left in spray paint on
the steps: ``Jesus weren't born for you, faggot.'' State and local
law enforcement officials have made no arrests and decline to say
whether they regard the attacks as homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who are leading the fight against gay rights here
make it clear that they feel that their state and their values are
under seige.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the Greenville minister, said he had grown increasingly
disturbed as President Clinton liberalized the country's policy on
gays in the military, as television sitcoms began to feature openly
gay characters, and as gays and lesbians marched through Greenville
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is about to happen in Greenville has already happened in
places like San Francisco and New York City,'' said Craig. ``We
really believe this is the last bastion of moral decency left in
America, and they're trying to push their agenda into this part of
the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The same sentiment led Mark S. McBride, a city councilman in
Myrtle Beach, to speak out last year against the opening of a gay
bar in the resort town's Pavilion area, a gaudy boardwalk of roller
coasters, video arcades and T-shirt shops. The gay bar, which he
said would attract ``transvestites and drag queens and people being
led around on leashes in dog collars,'' did not blend with the
family-friendly image that Myrtle Beach has long tried to promote,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His stand against the bar gave McBride a platform from which to
run for mayor, and he narrowly defeated a longtime incumbent in
November. In tribute, the gay pride movement announced that it
would hold its May 1998 march in Myrtle Beach. McBride again made
his displeasure known, and the city's largest developer, Burroughs
&AMP; Chapin Co., killed plans by several nightclubs in one of its
developments to hold an outdoor concert by the Village People that
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not going to allow our company's facilities to be used
to further a cause that we felt was a negative influence on our
community,'' said company president Douglas P. Wendel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gay bar opened and the march was held (McBride sent
his wife and two children to Greenville for the weekend), the
34-year-old Mayor still hopes to preserve the traditional family
orientation of his town.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've built ourselves on over the last 60 years is the
traditional family base,'' he said. ``People don't come here to be
subjugated to all the progressiveness, all the sophistication, all
the enlightenment of big city life.''

 &HT;    Talks aimed at averting yet another UAW/GM strike
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. and United Auto Workers in
Dayton started high-level negotiations Monday in hope of saving two
local brake plants and avoiding another devastating labor strike.
</P>
<P>
   The local talks begin at a time when GM and the UAW are
negotiating to end two crippling strikes in Flint, Mich., that have
dragged on into their second month.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders for UAW Local 696, which represents 3,400 hourly workers
at the brake plants, confirmed that GM and International UAW
officials began a new round of talks in a Moraine hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the talks said ``no progress'' was made
Monday towards settling job and outsourcing issues that have split
GM and Local 696 for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all in the same room, but nothing is happening right
now,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and UAW officials both declined comment on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The brake plants produce anti-braking system parts used in many
GM cars and light trucks built in North America. A 17-day strike in
1996 at the brake plants virtually shut down GM's North American
production within days and cost the automaker $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The current negotiations were prompted by the threat of another
strike at the plants. Last week, Local 696 leaders received
approval from members to organize a possible strike against GM
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   If the local talks fail, Dayton could be the site of another
strike by the UAW. The Flint strikes have closed 26 of GM's 29
North American assembly plants, idling more than 7,000 GM workers
in the Miami Valley and 162,000 auto workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue splitting the UAW and GM in Dayton continues to
be the plants employment level. Company documents show GM wants to
slash about 1,800 jobs at the brake plants and combine the
operations into the Needmore Road factory. The union says GM agreed
in the local contract to employ about 2,900 workers at the plants
until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   GM also wants to eliminate 'make out and quit,' a quota clause
that requires workers to produce certain number of parts in an
8-hour workday. Workers sometimes complete the work in five or six
hours, but get paid for a full shift. Because of the quota clause,
company officials say the brake plants have the lowest productivity
rating among any of GM's parts plants.
</P>
<P>
   The two brake plants have been facing the threat of sale or
shutdown because of massive financial losses over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GM and the UAW are under intense pressure to settle
the strikes in Flint before the costly walkouts cause permanent
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strikes plants began a month ago and have cost the
automaker more than $1.2 billion in second-quarter profit from lost
output of cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement this week would allow GM to begin the complex
process of restarting plants by Monday, the end of its annual
two-week summer vacation. It's an important target for negotiators,
who in the past have responded to deadlines. Without a settlement
soon, GM risks fouling a $4 billion truck rollout and surrendering
hard-to-regain market share to rivals such as Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ford and Chrysler will have better chances to grab
GM customers the longer the strike lasts. GM dealers' inventories
have been shrinking because of the lost production. The automaker
has already said it expects poor sales in July, as much as 40
percent below the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the Flint strikes last, the more difficult it is for
each side to sell the agreement as a victory, analysts said. GM
needs to show Wall Street and investors that it gained the right to
lower its manufacturing costs or improve efficiency. GM executives
are under pressure to win concessions the longer the strike lasts,
and their careers could be hurt if they don't, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW needs to show it will protect jobs at the world's
largest automaker. Union members at the two plants must ratify the
agreement before they return to work.

   Not every remark can be etched in stone, or even margarine, so
Diana-watchers everywhere will be grateful for ``Remembering Diana:
The People's Tribute to Their Princess.''  &UR; Rick Blalock &LR;  and  &UR; K.
Thomas Oglesby &LR;  of Georgia have compiled and edited some of the
millions of tributes to the princess that appeared, in print or on
the Internet, after her death. Among the world leaders who weighed
in:
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a toucher. I appreciated that in her,'' said  &UR; Diana &LR; 
 &UR; Ross &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana was loved by the people of Russia,'' said  &UR; Boris &LR; 
 &UR; Yeltsin &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been hard for me,'' said  &UR; Barbara Walters &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Through her commitment to organizations that help people in
need, Diana embodied the true spirit of volunteerism, transcending
stations in life and wealth. She reached out a helping hand to
those who most needed one, and that is the true meaning of
community,'' said &UR; Liane Levetan &LR; , chief executive officer of DeKalb
County, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Archbishop of York &UR; David Hope &LR; , second banana in the Church
of England only to the Archbishop of Canterbury, told the Sunday
Times of London that the Diana museum  &UR; Earl Spencer  &LR; opened last
week was inappropriate. ``It's the last thing she would have
wanted,'' he said, suggesting that a more appropriate memorial
would be remembrance of ``lives changed, wounds healed, bodies
remodeled and remade. ... We need to beware of clinging to the
icon. There is some element of wallowing in her death.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. The postal service of New Zealand has canceled plans to
issue a set of stamps commemorating the September anniversary of
Diana's death because it couldn't get approval from the Princess of
Wales Memorial Trust in time, and (having missed the bandwagon) it
was worried about ``over-commercialization.''

which is on silk ties and mugs is not what he is about,'' said
Julian.

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Until the strike began a month ago, Steven
White's workday at a General Motors parts factory here followed a
familiar routine. Arriving at 6:30 every morning, he stood at an
assembly line welding steel rails in semidarkness, wearing heavy
protective clothing in a factory with no air-conditioning and
temperatures exceeding 100 degrees on summer days.
</P>
<P>
   White's job has been to grab a 30-pound, six-foot-long steel
rail from a conveyor belt with his right hand, pull it across to
his left hand, lower it into a brace and weld a bumper bracket on
the side. He has to do the work partly by feel, he said, because a
low ceiling was erected several years ago over his place on the
line to ward off a leak in the 45-year-old factory's roof, and no
light has been installed under the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   What makes White's job controversial, and one of the core issues
in a showdown between GM and the United Automobile Workers union,
is the hours that he keeps. ``If everything runs without any
breakdowns, we'll get done by 1:30 or 2,'' including a half-hour
lunch break, White said. For working six and a half or seven hours,
White draws eight hours' pay, at $19 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   GM is now fighting to eliminate the practice of allowing White
and others here to go home early with full pay if they produce a
certain number of parts. GM has delayed plans to invest $180
million in White's factory until the union agrees to abolish the
practice, known as a ``pegged rate.'' But the UAW has resisted,
noting that a local agreement last year with GM already calls for
the practice to be phased out for any new auto parts production
assigned to the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by 3,200 workers at the factory here, combined with a
three-week-old strike by nearly 6,000 sympathetic workers at
another GM auto parts factory in Flint, has crippled production at
the world's largest company. GM has closed 26 of its 29 assembly
plants in North America for lack of parts and has declared an
after-tax loss of $1.18 billion through June 30. The strikes have
forced GM to lay off 162,700 workers temporarily, while outside
suppliers have laid off thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of barely talking to each other, GM and UAW
negotiators began bargaining in earnest on Friday and talked
through the holiday weekend. Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice
president for GM issues, said Monday that the talks had been
``constructive,'' but he would not predict when a settlement might
be reached. Both sides are trying to have a deal ratified by
workers in time for GM factories to reopen next Monday, the end of
the automaker's regularly scheduled two-week summer shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged rates were common in the auto industry in the late 1940s,
when foreign automakers posed little threat to domestic companies
and the UAW's power was at its height. The rates have virtually
disappeared since then, as companies have demanded longer hours to
become more competitive. Indeed, many long-time industry executives
were surprised to learn they still existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astounding to me to find GM still has those practices,''
said Gerald Meyers, the retired chairman of American Motors Corp.,
which eliminated pegged rates in the 1950s. The UAW's current
national agreements with the Big Three automakers do not include
such rates.
</P>
<P>
   But they have persisted in a few GM parts factories where local
UAW units have negotiated separate deals. These are factories that
produce parts needed by so many assembly plants for so many car and
truck models that GM decided to pay the rates rather than risk a
strike _ until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 of the 3,200 workers here are covered by pegged rates,
mainly welders who build engine cradles, which are lattices of
steel bars that support a car or truck engine. These workers put in
four and a half to six and a half hours a day and draw a full day's
pay, said Peter Ternes, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on the picket line here said that only about 100 people
who were especially proficient at their tasks were able to finish
in just four and a half hours. Ternes said that two of the six
engine cradle production lines had people on the shortest hours,
but did not give a precise number. Workers are not allowed to leave
the factory until they have spent eight hours inside, but can take
a break until the end of their shift once they have made enough
auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   Because those covered by pegged rates have been leaving early,
GM had to pay $33 million in unnecessary overtime last year, said
Donald Hackworth, group vice president for North American car
operations. The overtime contributed heavily to a $50 million loss
for the factory, he said, adding, ``The insidious work practice
here quite frankly is totally noncompetitive and we've got to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts have also found the factory to be inefficient.
Harbour &AMP; Associates, a manufacturing consulting firm in Troy,
Mich., has concluded that labor costs at GM's steel parts factories
are higher than any competitors' costs _ and that the Flint factory
has unusually high costs even by GM standards.
</P>
<P>
   But Norwood Jewell, the bargaining committee chairman of the
local union here, said that the inefficiency was GM's fault. Unlike
the assembly lines in other factories, certain slow-moving
equipment here is connected directly to the main production line,
instead of making parts separately nearby, he said. This hurts
productivity because the entire line must operate at the speed of
the slowest equipment, Jewell said, adding that GM had already told
him of plans to change the factory's layout.
</P>
<P>
   Poor productivity has ``nothing to do with our people, nothing
to do with standards or pegged rates,'' Jewell said. ``It's poor
engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said that the union was concerned about the health and
safety of its members. GM's Ternes said that the factory here had
the lowest injury rate of any of GM's 18 metal parts factories. But
among workers on the picket line, fear of injuries was a frequent
refrain, along with a strong desire for GM to invest more money in
the factory.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Brenda Domby said that her production line, which makes engine
cradles for Oldsmobile Auroras and Buick Park Avenues, had very
little automation because it was not originally designed for the
high output that GM now expects. Mrs. Domby said that she had to
pull 55-pound engine cradles by hand from a conveyor belt 40 times
an hour, weld steering gear brackets onto the cradles and then push
the cradles on to the next worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get hung up, and then you have to pull and tug them,''
Mrs. Domby, a slender woman of average height, said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Johnson, who uses a robot to weld the heaviest steel
bars in the cradles for GM's mid-size sedans, said that it was hard
to finish work early because the bars were often poorly shaped and
had to be pounded by hand with hammers. ``They run these bad parts
for hours and we have to fit them together,'' she said. ``You're
beating them and you're hammering them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson said that the pegged rates improved productivity, by
giving workers an incentive to work harder. ``When you set a goal,
you work to achieve it, you feel good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But other automakers have achieved high output without pegged
rates, partly by running production lines at speeds that require
workers to move briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment breakdowns are a common complaint here. White said
that when he was given his current task in 1995, he did not get a
backup welding gun, unlike other workers. As a result, he said, he
frequently worked overtime because his gun broke down. After three
years of steady complaints, he was given a backup gun in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ternes said that the automaker had already invested $400 million
in maintenance and new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   James Blakemore, who does the final welding of cradles for
Chevrolet Astro vans, said that he earned the right to leave work
an hour early if he produced enough parts under conditions that are
often difficult. ``The management doesn't know what they're talking
about when they say these are easy jobs'' because of the shorter
hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Blakemore said that with pegged rates already eliminated for
new parts being produced by the factory, he and other workers would
not keep their current work rules forever. ``They're going away and
we understand that and we accept that,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will punish health insurance
companies that deny coverage to sick people, in violation of a 1996
law, by excluding them from the lucrative insurance market for
federal employees, administration officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The law was intended to make insurance more readily available to
millions of Americans who change or lose their jobs. But federal
and state officials said they saw worrisome signs that some health
insurance companies were circumventing the law. They said some
companies discouraged sales to eligible individuals, charged very
high premiums or penalized insurance agents selling coverage to
customers with pre-existing medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a directive to be issued on Tuesday, Clinton will order the
Federal Office of Personnel Management, which negotiates health
benefits for federal employees and their dependents, to use its
purchasing power to ``insure that health plans come into
compliance'' with the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The main authors of the health insurance measure, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law, were Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Kansas
Republican who retired from the Senate last year, and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's draft order says, all health plans that insure
federal employees will have to certify that they are complying with
the Kassebaum-Kennedy law in their private insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically,'' it continues, ``I direct OPM to take all
appropriate action, up to and including termination of a
participating health plan from the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program,'' if it finds that any insurer is violating the
letter and spirit of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal employee program is the nation's largest
employer-sponsored health insurance program, covering nine million
people through 350 health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has agreed
to inform the federal government of any violations found by state
officials. Glenn Pomeroy, president of the association, said, ``We
are pleased to work with the administration in a partnership to
make sure that everyone entitled to the protections of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law gets them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy, the insurance commissioner of North Dakota, said state
officials would be asked to inform the federal government whenever
they imposed fines or other penalties on insurers for violating the
standards set in the 1996 law. Most states have written the federal
standards into state law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intends to have the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration tell the Office of Personnel Management about any
insurance companies that flout the 1996 law in the states that have
not revised their laws. Missouri, California and Rhode Island are
among the states that have not revised their laws to conform with
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials said they could not immediately
identify companies that had violated the 1996 law. But state
officials said they would probably discover violations when they
investigate complaints or conduct routine examinations of insurers'
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action, the White House on Monday announced an
effort to help more than three million people get assistance in
paying Medicare premiums. The assistance is available to elderly
and disabled people with low incomes (up to $11,108 a year for an
individual and $14,888 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   Medicare premiums now total $525.60 a year and are expected to
increase over the next decade, to $1,268 a year in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new effort came in response to a highly
critical report by a consumer group, Families USA, which said that
the government was overcharging poor elderly people nearly $2
billion a year by deducting Medicare premiums from their Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said that
many elderly people did not seek the federal assistance because
they were unaware of it or feared they would be stigmatized for
going to welfare offices to apply for it.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill on Aug. 21, 1996,
he said, ``It will eliminate the possibility that individuals can
be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing medical
condition.'' He said the law would help up to 25 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, found that some insurers were shunning the very people
who were supposed to benefit from the law. Rep. Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn., said: ``I am outraged at the mockery that some insurance
companies are making of the law in some states. How can health
coverage be accessible if it costs $15,000 a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the law appeared to be ``working well for the vast
majority of Americans'' in the group insurance market, allowing
them to move from job to job without having to worry about losing
coverage. Most of the problems, he said, involve ``price gouging''
in the individual insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Kennedy introduced a bill to limit the premiums that
may be charged to people who leave their jobs and try to buy
insurance on their own. The limit would be 50 percent above the
rates charged to people in good health. Insurers vehemently oppose
such federal regulation, as do many Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have told agents that they will reduce
or eliminate the commissions they receive for selling insurance to
small groups or to people with medical problems. In March, the
Clinton administration sent a bulletin to insurers and state
officials saying it regarded such practices as a violation of the
1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Stokes Trautwein, director of federal policy analysis
at the National Association of Health Underwriters, which
represents 15,000 agents and brokers, said on Monday that despite
that warning, some insurers were still ``reducing commissions to an
abnormally low level'' for coverage sold to small businesses with
two to nine employees. ``This is contrary to the spirit'' of the
1996 law, she said.

NO POLICY CHANGE, U.S. ASSURES TAIWAN AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration sought to reassure the
Taiwan government on Monday that there had been no change in
American policy toward Taiwan despite Clinton's declaration in
China that the United States would not support Taiwan's
independence from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's comments about Taiwan last week duplicated
statements made in the past by other administration officials, it
was the first time that the president had articulated the policy
himself.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks set off alarms in Taiwan, which Beijing considers a
breakaway province, and on Capitol Hill, where Taiwan has many
supporters. A statement today by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan
suggested that the island's fears would not be quickly allayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, your country should negotiate directly with us
about any matters involving Taiwan,'' Lee said after meeting in
Taipei, the Taiwan capital, with an American official who had been
sent there to provide reassurances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not have to _ and should not _ hold bilateral talks
with the Chinese Communists'' about Taiwan's sovereignty, he told
the American official, Richard Bush, the Washington-based chairman
of the American Institute in Taiwan. The institute is a nominally
private organization that handles American relations with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters in Taiwan that Clinton's trip to the
mainland and his comments there did not indicate that Washington
was trying to bolster China's demands for reunification with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``United States policy toward Taiwan has not changed,'' he said.
``In all its elements, it is exactly the same as before President
Clinton's trip.''
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting in Shanghai last week, Clinton appeared to make
a concession to his Chinese hosts by making a public declaration of
a policy known as the ``three no's'' _ no American support for an
independent Taiwan, no recognition for a separate Taiwan
government, and no support for Taiwan's entry into international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that the president said in China changes our
relationship with Taiwan,'' said P.J. Crowley, a White House
spokesman.

CLINTON ACCEPTS YELTSIN'S INVITATION FOR SEPTEMBER SUMMIT TALKS IN
MOSCOW
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has agreed to travel to Russia in
early September to meet with President Boris Yeltsin, although the
Russian legislature has not fulfilled a request to ratify an
important arms control treaty signed with the United States, the
White House announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents have made a practice of annual summit
meetings, but for more than a year the White House had postponed
responding to Yeltsin's invitation to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never said that ratification of the treaty, known as
START-2, which was signed five years ago, was a requirement for his
visit, but he indicated that it was his strong preference. The
president had said he hoped to move on to discussing further arms
reductions, a topic that White House officials now say will be on
the agenda this fall even without approval of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, they just felt that the issues we have
to discuss were more important than waiting for the Duma,'' an
administration official said, referring to the lower house of the
Russian Parliament. In describing those issues, he listed the
ethnic violence in Kosovo and the state of the Russian economy,
badly shaken by the financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate ratified the arms control treaty in 1996. But despite
pleas from Yeltsin, the Communists, and nationalists who dominate
the Russian Parliament have dragged their feet over ratification of
the treaty, which would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals
to about 3,500 warheads apiece, citing security concerns and the
high cost of destroying the weapons. The Parliament plans to take
up the issue in September.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that Vice President Al Gore would meet in
Moscow later this month with the Russian prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko, to help prepare the agenda for the summit meeting. The
precise dates for the president's trip, as well the site of his
meeting with Yeltsin, have not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also anxious to visit Ireland and Northern Ireland
this year to celebrate the recently approved peace agreement there.
He may make those stops as part of his Russia trip, one aide said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House squeezed the Russia trip into a presidential
schedule already jammed with foreign travel. Clinton just returned
on Saturday from a nine-day trip to China. Earlier this spring, he
spent almost two weeks in Africa. In April, he attended a summit
meeting in Santiago, Chile, and in May he attended one in
Birmingham, England, making stops in Germany and Switzerland along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The president is still scheduled to visit India, Pakistan, and
Bangladesh in November, although the White House is weighing a
change of schedule because of the nuclear tests conducted this
spring by India and Pakistan. Regardless, Clinton will be in Asia
that month, for a summit meeting in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Yeltsin during the Birmingham summit, Clinton
urged him to seek ratification of the arms control treaty to help
persuade budding nuclear powers like India and Pakistan that they
were moving in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Clinton's travel was scheduled long before the
disclosure in January that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
had broadened his investigation of the Whitewater land deal to
include the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former
intern. But the White House has welcomed the busy foreign travel as
an opportunity to escape Washington and to display the president as
a global leader.
</P>
<P>
   The packed foreign schedule is also coming in a year when the
administration is struggling to accomplish its legislative agenda.
With congressional elections looming in November, a comprehensive
tobacco agreement has eluded Clinton, and some presidential aides
have all but given up on a budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden to lay out his
agenda, pressing Congress to act in what he called ``the remaining
38 working days'' of this legislative session. He called on
Congress to approve new money for the International Monetary Fund,
a juvenile crime bill and bills to change the campaign finance
system and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has a choice to make in writing this chapter of our
history,'' the president said. ``It can choose partisanship, or it
can choose progress. Congress must decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president is trying to avoid a vote on another matter
once central to his agenda. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
recently that he may bring up so-called fast track trade
legislation this fall to give Clinton enhanced authority in
negotiating trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the White House lost a bruising fight for the
legislation, as Democrats deserted Clinton over fears of a backlash
by organized labor and environmental groups against trade deals.
The White House regards Gingrich's proposal as a political ploy,
and on Monday, Clinton made clear that he was in no hurry to see
such a vote.

 &HT;    WebMentors turn tables, tutor own teachers
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Throughout the summer, University of Dayton
professors are inviting a select group of UD students into their
offices for lengthy, one-on-one instructional sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Listen closely and you'll hear the usual professorial lecturing
about the importance of thorough understanding of the subject
matter coupled with quiet reassurances that there are no dumb
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But wait . . . these personal tutorials have a twist. The
students are the teachers, the teachers the students.
</P>
<P>
   UD wants to make sure all of its professors develop enough
computer know-how to be able to build and maintain their own World
Wide Web pages as the school prepares to wire up its students,
faculty and staff into what it calls a ``Learning Village.'' And
who better to teach its teachers than Web-savvy UD students who
have grown up with computers?
</P>
<P>
   Thus the ``WebMentors'' program was born. Seven students adept
in the intricacies of the Internet and Web have trained 50 UD
faculty and staff since last fall. The university pays the
WebMentor students for their efforts but does not charge UD
employees for the training.
</P>
<P>
   WebMentor Bill Rombach, a 21-year-old accounting and finance
student, said he was a little worried about whether faculty members
would be reluctant to take instruction from a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the way it has turned out, a lot of the faculty are
completely eager to learn,'' Rombach said. ``It's refreshing to see
professors excited about learning from students.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no hand-holding, Rombach said. ``We put our hand on
their shoulders, but we let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Rombach's pupils, Father John McGrath, S.M., assistant
professor of religious studies at UD, recognizes the benefits of
the new technology. During a recent session between the two, the
conversation focused on icons, HTML directories, Netscape software
and double-clicks-versus-single-clicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more way to reach students and help them
learn,'' McGrath said after his training session. ``There is an
element of creativity to it that makes it exciting and leaves a lot
to students' own initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The role-reversal aspect of the WebMentors program carries its
own benefits for faculty members, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us,'' he said. ``We get a better understanding
of how students feel.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and his colleagues who receive training agree to three
conditions: they must be willing to learn, keep their Web sites
fresh and updated and share their Web knowledge with colleagues.
McGrath, who has worked with a computer in his classes for eight
years, says he's eager to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I had this when I prepared my doctoral thesis. . . ``
he said.

ROY ROGERS, AMERICA'S FAVORITE COWBOY, DIES AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: A shortened version, OBIT-ROGERS-SHORT, is also being
filed)  
 (JT)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Rogers, a shoe factory worker's son from Cincinnati who rode
a golden palomino horse and a harmonious voice to fame as
Hollywood's most beloved and quintessential singing cowboy, died
Monday at his ranch in Apple Valley near Victorville, Calif. He was
86.
</P>
<P>
   With a guitar propped on his knee and six-shooters holstered on
his hips, the crinkly eyed Rogers became a hero to the staunch fans
of his TV show and nearly 100 movies, popular enough to eventually
have a roast beef fast-food chain named after him, as he tamed the
West with his characteristic heart and compassion. A practitioner
of minimal violence, he much preferred to shoot the pistol out of a
gunslinger's hand than actually harm the man, his vileness
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In midcentury America, when celluloid prairie life captivated
the nation, the redoubtable Rogers was the ``King of the Cowboys,''
his wife and co-star Dale Evans the ``Queen of the West'' and
Trigger, Rogers' wonder horse, the ``Smartest Horse in the
Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Following their exploits on the Double-R-Bar Ranch, along with
those of Buttermilk, Miss Evans' buckskin horse, and Bullet, their
German shepherd, was an essential rite of growing up. Children ate
from Roy Rogers lunchboxes, played with Roy Rogers cut-out dolls
and slept on Roy Rogers bedsheets, dreaming of being musical
buckaroos themselves. Who could forget Trigger rearing up
majestically while Roy Rogers waves his hand toward the cerulean
Western sky? Who couldn't sing along as Roy and Dale shook off
trail dust and broke into ``Happy Trails to You,'' their signature
song that Miss Evans wrote? Who didn't ache for just one chance to
meet the hero in the flesh and drawl, ``Howdy, pardner''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there will be a lot of sad and grateful Americans,
especially of my generation, because of his career,'' said
President Clinton, a boyhood fan of Rogers'.
</P>
<P>
   He was an outsized and, for a cowpoke, an immaculately-dressed
figure. There was his doubled-creased 10-gallon white hat, the
flowing kerchief knotted at the side of his neck, the gabardine
cowboy shirt, the western-cut trousers and those shiny, pointed
cowboy boots. He embodied unmistakably wholesome values, and evoked
a vanishing and idealized America, when men tipped their hats to
the ladies and sang sentimental ballads around the bone-warming
glow of a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   At the pinnacle of his fame in the decade after the end of World
War II, Rogers was consistently the most popular western star in
America, succeeding Gene Autry and William ``Hopalong Cassidy''
Boyd in the genre. A survey conducted by Life magazine among
children found that when they were asked whom they most wanted to
emulate, Rogers matched Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.
In a single month in 1945, he received 75,000 fan letters,
eclipsing a record held by Clara Bow, the silent-film star.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers gladly shared the limelight with his wife, who frequently
accompanied him in singing and frequently steered him out of harm's
way; with George ``Gabby'' Hayes, his garrulous, bewhiskered
sidekick, and with Trigger. Rogers discovered Trigger among the
many horses auditioning for the role of his trusty stallion in
``Under Western Stars,'' the movie that began his career in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on him and rode him 100 yards and never looked at
another horse,'' Rogers later recalled. He described Trigger, who
cost $2,500 in 1938, as ``the best thing that ever happened'' to
him. Under Rogers' tutelage, the horse learned a lengthy repertoire
of tricks. He could untie ropes, sit in a chair, fire a gun and add
and subtract.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to perform in front of people, and there wasn't
anything I asked of him he wouldn't do,'' Rogers once recounted to
his biographers, Jane and Michael Stern. ``He walked up stairs in
hospitals to visit the sick children. I insisted that Trigger get
star billing in all my pictures. After all, what's a cowboy without
a horse?''
</P>
<P>
   When Trigger died in 1965 at age 33, the Smithsonian Institution
wanted to display him in Washington. Rogers could not bear the
separation. He had him mounted (not stuffed) and he remains, in his
rearing hind-leg pose, the most popular attraction at the Roy
Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Victorville.
</P>
<P>
   In his durable career, Roy Rogers starred in 91 feature motion
pictures and 102 half-hour television films. For many Americans,
the titles of his films are imprinted on their memories: ``In Old
Caliente,'' ``The Arizona Kid,'' ``Days of Jesse James,'' ``Robin
Hood of the Pecos,'' ``Springtime in the Sierras,'' ``North of the
Great Divide,'' ``Pals of the Golden West.'' His own favorite was
``My Pal Trigger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He also starred in touring rodeos, made records and developed
extensive business interests in real estate, music publishing and
fast food. Children of today are doubtlessly more aware of Rogers
as a roast beef sandwich than a cowboy. In 1968, the Roy Rogers
Family Restaurants, a fast-food chain built around roast beef
sandwiches, was developed by Marriott Corp. in partnership with
Rogers. He, in turn, became a Marriott stockholder. The chain,
which grew to upward of 800 restaurants, was sold in 1990 to
Hardee's, which sold it last July to the MRO Mid-Atlantic Corp. It
has shrunk to about 110 restaurants. As recently as 1995, Rogers
appeared in an ad campaign for the roast beef sandwiches. He
recited some poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s and early '50s, more than 2,000 fan clubs
around the world declared their fidelity to the cowboy couple. More
than 400 licensed products bore their names and visages, and
Rogers' picture adorned 2.5 billion boxes of Post cereals. Their
rodeo set a box-office record at Madison Square Garden and they
were the only couple picked as grand marshals of the Tournament of
Roses parade in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers felt it was his duty to send his fans ``Rogersgrams''
with homespun counsel like, ``Be neat and clean'' and ``Study hard
and learn all you can.''
</P>
<P>
   When not roping and shooting straighter than anyone else, Rogers
and Miss Evans found time to support various Christian charities
and the religious programs of the Rev. Billy Graham and Bill
Bright, who founded the Campus Crusade for Christ. Rogers was also
involved in programs to aid the handicapped and chronically ill,
especially children.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Roy Rogers was emphatically pragmatic, and his
interest was in teeth.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Leonard Franklin Slye on Nov. 5, 1911, one of four
children and the only son of Andrew and Hattie Womack Slye. His
father worked for the United States Shoe Co. in Cincinnati; his
mother was a homemaker who loved music.
</P>
<P>
   Their house stood about where second base now is at Riverfront
Stadium, where the Cincinnati Reds play baseball. The family was of
modest means. Rogers used to say, ``I hardly wore shoes until I was
almost grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he became a star, much was made of Rogers' Choctaw Indian
blood from his mother's side of the family. American Indians basked
in his accomplishments, and in 1967, he was named ``outstanding
Indian citizen of the year'' by a group of western tribes. Rogers
accepted the honor and was pleased to be counted as one of them,
but he made it clear that his calculations made him only one
thirty-second Choctaw. The rest of his ancestors were Dutch and
English.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rogers admired cowboy stars from the silent screen era
like Hoot Gibson and Tom Mix, he did not envision himself galloping
across the prairie. His ambition was to become a dentist, a
profession, he reasoned, that everyone needed.
</P>
<P>
   However, his absorption with cowboys and Western culture began
to grow in 1919, when Andrew Slye moved his family from the city to
a small farm in Duck Run, Ohio. There, in the ``last house in the
holler,'' Roy learned to ride on a mule, acquired the
ranchhand-skills and gained the familiarity with animals and nature
that he would eventually apply to the Hollywood range.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the family moved back to Cincinnati. To help ease Andrew
Slye's worsening money problems, Rogers dropped out of school to
work alongside his father in the insole department of the United
States Shoe Co. In 1929, as the stock market was poised to crash,
Rogers moved again, this time to California, to find work as a
fruit picker. In short order, his entire family, struggling for
survival, joined him.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers later said that when he read John Steinbeck's
``Grapes of Wrath,'' he thought that Steinbeck might have been
writing about the Slye family instead of the Joads. Rogers spent
many evening hours playing the guitar and singing for fellow farm
workers. He would later recall that some of his happiest memories
were from the Depression years, ``when we didn't have anything to
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   To supplement his meager income picking peaches, Rogers formed a
singing duo with a cousin, Stanley Slye, and the two performed at
parties and square dances for whoever would hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made his radio debut in 1931 as a member of Tom Murray's
Hollywood Hillbillies. He also performed with groups like the
International Cowboys and the O-Bar-O Cowboys. For a while, he was
known as Cactus Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Bob Nolan, the composer of ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds,''
Rogers assembled another group. A radio announcer got their name
mixed up and called them ``the Sons of the Pioneers.'' It stuck,
and in the middle 1930s they began to make transcriptions of
romantic cowboy ballads that were heard all over the country.
``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' became popular even among people with no
affinity for country-western music.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1935, the Sons of the Pioneers began to show up in
the movies. They appeared briefly with Bing Crosby in ``Rhythm on
the Range'' and in Gene Autry's first movie, ``Tumbling
Tumbleweeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys with musical abilities were very much the rage in those
Depression years and none outshone Gene Autry. But when Autry made
clear to Republic Studios, a young company focused on the western
genre, that he wanted a hefty raise, the studio began searching for
another cowpuncher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937 Rogers auditioned for the star role in a movie called
``Washington Cowboy,'' which he heard about in a hat shop while
getting his Stetson cleaned. He bested a line-up of competing
singing cowboys to land the part that had been written for Autry.
The name of the film was changed to ``Under Western Stars.''
Instead of Len Slye, Republic planned to rename him Dick Weston,
but they eventually settled on Roy Rogers, his name from then on.
</P>
<P>
   The public warmed to him at once. Bosley Crowther, reviewing
``Under Western Stars'' for The New York Times, wrote that the
newcomer had ``a drawl like Gary Cooper'' and ``a smile like
Shirley Temple.'' Republic worried that Rogers' slitty eyes made it
look like he was squinting. They recommended he use drops to widen
them. But moviegoers felt just fine about his crinkly expression.
With Gene Autry off to war as a flier, Roy Rogers became ``King of
the Cowboys'' in 1943. He never relinquished the title.

</P>
<P>
   In all of his films, Rogers appeared as a low-keyed,
well-intentioned, dependable good guy. He never bragged or
postured. Always protective of the weak, he was kind to animals,
God-fearing and slow to anger. He also sang pleasantly throughout
his career and in one 1944 film, ``Hollywood Canteen,'' introduced
Cole Porter's ``Don't Fence Me In.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' first wife was Arlene Wilkins, whom he met in 1931 while
on the road with a singing group. Broke, he agreed to sing, ``The
Swiss Yodel'' for a lemon pie. She made it. They married in 1936.
She died of an embolism days after she gave birth to their son, Roy
Rogers Jr., in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he met Dale Evans, cast opposite him in ``The Cowboy
and the Senorita.'' They were married on New Year's Eve in 1947,
and she remained until he died ``my sweetheart and hunting and
fishing partner all wrapped up into one.''
</P>
<P>
   Devoted as they were, they never kissed on the screen. Rogers
frowned on such public displays and was ever mindful that he was a
potent role model for millions of children (he said he gave up beer
on hunting trips because it was inconsistent with his image). Once,
though, he came ever so close to kissing his wife in front of his
fans.
</P>
<P>
   In one film, he was to kiss her on the forehead to apologize for
shoving her under a bed to keep her from getting hurt in a fight
scene. ``But they had a conference and decided against it,'' Miss
Evans said. ``The kids, you know, so I never even got kissed on the
forehead. I just get knocked under beds.''
</P>
<P>
   They made several films together, and in their successful
television series for NBC, which ran between 1951 and 1957, she
joined Rogers after every show to sing, ``Happy Trails.'' That
theme was a title of their autobiography, published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers married Miss Evans, he was a widower with three
children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, another daughter, Linda
Lou, and Roy Rogers Jr. She was a twice-married actress with a son,
Thomas Frederick Fox Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In raising a family, the couple endured more than their share of
heartbreak. Miss Evans and Rogers had a daughter, Robin Elizabeth,
who was born with Down syndrome and died shortly before her second
birthday. They had kept her at home, uncommon in those days, and
rejected any thought that they keep her illness a secret in
accordance with a show-business notion that audiences would recoil
if a perfect couple had an imperfect child. In 1953, Miss Evans
wrote a best-selling inspiration book about their daughter called
``Angel Unaware.''
</P>
<P>
   To help soothe their grief over Robin's death, the couple
adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee. On Aug. 17,
1964, when she was 12, she was killed when a church bus collided
with a car near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David
``Sandy'' Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after a
goodwill visit to an orphanage, choked to death in a military
hospital in Germany where he was serving in the Army. After he
died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ``Salute to Sandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Evans and Rogers adopted one other child, Dodie, an
American Indian whom Miss Evans met while touring an orphanage, and
fostered another child, Marion, who was 6 years old when they found
her in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Miss Evans, Rogers is survived by his children,
Roy Rogers Jr., Cheryl Barnett, Linda Lou Johnson, Dodie Sailors,
Marion Swift and Tom Fox, 15 grandchildren and 33
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at the Church of the Valley in
Apple Valley. Details are not yet complete.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers Jr., known as Dusty, serves as curator of the Roy
Rogers-Dale Evans Museum, set at the edge of the Mojave Desert and
seven miles from the Rogers-Evans ranch, named the Double-R Bar
like the one on their television series. There can be found all the
memorabilia of a time in America when the good guys were singing
cowboys who wore white hats, fought fairly and never used language
stronger than ``Shucks.''
</P>
<P>
   When it didn't interfere with his favorite soap opera, ``Guiding
Light,'' Rogers would often visit the museum and converse with
visitors. He continued to wear his white Stetson, his gabardine
shirts by the celebrated courtier Nudie of Hollywood, complete with
flowers and fringes, and his silver and leather belts fashioned by
Edward Bohlin, known as ``the Michelangelo of saddlecraft.'' Even
though his legs ached and he would have been more at ease in
sneakers, he always pulled on his pointy boots with the high heels.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Roy Rogers remained a humble and simple man. ``I'm
an introvert at heart,'' he once said. Commenting on the adversity
in his own life, he wrote, ``If there were no valleys of sadness
and death, we could never really appreciate the sunshine of
happiness on the mountaintop.''

MANY EVACUEES RETURN HOME AS FIRES BEGIN TO SUBSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. _ For an excruciating three days, an estimated
35,000 people waited in shelters and hotel rooms just outside
Flagler County, as a result of a mandatory evacuation while
firefighters battled the worst wildfires in Florida's history. On
Monday morning, evacuees collected their photo albums, cats, dogs
and other belongings and came home, most of them, to relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my house was gone,'' said Donna Kerney of Bunnell,
who had thrown a hose and running sprinkler on her roof and fled as
flames neared her neighborhood on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the vast majority of the evacuees, she went home
Monday and found that though parts of her house were burned and
smoke-damaged, it was still habitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the grace of God, it stood,'' said Ms. Kerney, a
37-year-old administrative assistant for the city of Bunnell.
</P>
<P>
   Flagler County's worst-case scenario, that three wildfires
burning out of control would merge and race eastward through the
county all the way to the Atlantic, evaporated in the last few
days. The residents' fear was washed away first by firefighters'
hoses and then by much-anticipated rain.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as the thousands of residents returned to their homes
after cancellation of the mandatory evacuation, some of them
driving through the rain they had prayed for, talk was more about
what might have happened than about what did. Only about 40 homes
were destroyed or damaged in Flagler County, officials said, by
wildfires that consumed almost 50,000 acres, most of it scrub and
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Several families lost everything when their homes went up in
flames, including Beatrice and Gerald Snyder, who celebrated their
47th wedding anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   Their home in Bunnell was reduced to ashes, along with memories
that spanned a half-century. They can rebuild their home, but
``that isn't going to bring back 47 years of stuff,'' said Mrs.
Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   But the news in most neighborhoods around northern and east
central Florida was better Monday morning, as firefighters and rain
continued to beat back wildfires _ though flare-ups continued in
some places, triggered by lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tide has turned to some extent, at least temporarily,''
said Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 95 and U.S. 1, the main north-south travel routes,
were reopened, though plumes of smoke from new and dwindling fires
continued to rise into the air in Flagler, Volusia and Brevard
counties.
</P>
<P>
   What the parched region had needed most, as wildfires raged
through palmettos, pines and sometimes homes, was rain. ``Every
little bit helps,'' said Ms. Kerney about the brief downpours on
Monday. ``But we need much more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters have said there is a 50 percent chance of
thundershowers for the region, and more rain is needed if
firefighters are to continue gaining ground. Less than 2 inches
fell in the region. Firefighters said it would take a downpour of
more than 10 inches to put out the remaining fires.
</P>
<P>
   But for many residents here, who had previously been ordered
from their homes by state officials, any good news was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The past few days ``have been pretty rough,'' said Tom Hubbard,
who manages the Bunnell Thriftway, the town's only supermarket, as
returning residents filled his store, going about the business of
living.
</P>
<P>
   But now the emergencies seemed smaller. The worries were more
about having enough groceries in stock than about whether the
store, which was not damaged, would fall victim to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far,'' he said, ``we've been able to supply everything they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials took time, during the respite, to count the cost
of the wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday evening, 58 fires still burned in Florida, pushing
the total of wildfires to more than 2,000 since May, and the number
of acres burned to 474,462.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag, in property losses has reached $276 million.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 101 people have been injured, almost all of them
firefighters, and 161 homes have been gutted or badly damaged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only one person has died. An elderly man in a Flagler County
nursing home died from an apparent heart attack as he was being
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's miraculous that there haven't been more
deaths,'' said McKay.
</P>
<P>
   In Flagler County, people with ruined and damaged houses
wondered how they would pay for the repairs that insurance did not
cover.
</P>
<P>
   John Livingston, 36, came home to find his house damaged but
standing. The heat around the house was so intense that the roof
warped and now leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But he found out Monday that he might qualify for a low-interest
loan from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a godsend,'' he said. ``I'm glad they're here
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerney, like many residents here, is accustomed to wild
weather and even wildfires. But this time was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the fires in 1985, and I was pretty much used
to it,'' she said. This time, ``we didn't have much time to get
out.''

ROY ROGERS, AMERICA'S FAVORITE COWBOY, DIES AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: A longer version, OBIT-ROGERS, has also been filed)  
 (JT)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Rogers, a shoe factory worker's son from Cincinnati who rode
a golden palomino horse and a harmonious voice to fame as
Hollywood's most beloved and quintessential singing cowboy, died
Monday at his ranch in Apple Valley near Victorville, Calif. He was
86.
</P>
<P>
   With a guitar propped on his knee and six-shooters holstered on
his hips, the crinkly-eyed Rogers became a hero to the staunch fans
of his TV show and nearly 100 movies, popular enough to eventually
have a roast beef fast-food chain named after him, as he tamed the
West with his characteristic heart and compassion. A practitioner
of minimal violence, he much preferred to shoot the pistol out of a
gunslinger's hand than actually harm the man, his vileness
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In midcentury America, when celluloid prairie life captivated
the nation, the redoubtable Rogers was the ``King of the Cowboys,''
his wife and co-star Dale Evans the ``Queen of the West'' and
Trigger, Roger's wonder horse, the ``Smartest Horse in the
Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Following their exploits on the Double-R-Bar Ranch, along with
those of Buttermilk, Miss Evans' buckskin horse, and Bullet, their
German shepherd, was an essential rite of growing up. Children ate
from Roy Rogers lunchboxes, played with Roy Rogers cut-out dolls
and slept on Roy Rogers bedsheets, dreaming of being musical
buckaroos themselves. Who could forget Trigger rearing up
majestically while Roy Rogers waves his hand toward the cerulean
Western sky? Who couldn't sing along as Roy and Dale shook off
trail dust and broke into ``Happy Trails to You,'' their signature
song that Miss Evans wrote?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there will be a lot of sad and grateful Americans,
especially of my generation, because of his career,'' said
President Clinton, a boyhood fan of Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Roy Rogers was emphatically pragmatic, and his
interest was in teeth.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Leonard Franklin Slye on Nov. 5, 1911, one of four
children and the only son of Andrew and Hattie Womack Slye. His
father worked for the United States Shoe Co. in Cincinnati; his
mother was a homemaker who loved music.
</P>
<P>
   Their house stood about where second base now is at Riverfront
Stadium, where the Cincinnati Reds play baseball. The family was of
modest means. Rogers used to say, ``I hardly wore shoes until I was
almost grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rogers admired cowboy stars from the silent screen era
like Hoot Gibson and Tom Mix, he did not envision himself galloping
across the prairie. His ambition was to become a dentist, a
profession, he reasoned, that everyone needed.
</P>
<P>
   However, his absorption with cowboys and Western culture began
to grow in 1919, when Andrew Slye moved his family from the city to
a small farm in Duck Run, Ohio. There, in the ``last house in the
holler,'' Roy learned to ride on a mule, acquired the
ranchhand-skills and gained the familiarity with animals and nature
that he would eventually apply to the Hollywood range.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the family moved back to Cincinnati. To help ease Andrew
Slye's worsening money problems, Rogers dropped out of school to
work alongside his father in the insole department of the United
States Shoe Co. In 1929, as the stock market was poised to crash,
Rogers moved again, this time to California, to find work as a
fruit picker. In short order, his entire family, struggling for
survival, joined him.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers later said that when he read John Steinbeck's
``Grapes of Wrath,'' he thought that Steinbeck might have been
writing about the Slye family instead of the Joads. Rogers spent
many evening hours playing the guitar and singing for fellow farm
workers. To supplement his meager income picking peaches, Rogers
formed a singing duo with a cousin, Stanley Slye, and the two
performed at parties and square dances.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made his radio debut in 1931 as a member of Tom Murray's
Hollywood Hillbillies. He also performed with groups like the
International Cowboys and the O-Bar-O Cowboys. For a while, he was
known as Cactus Mac.
</P>

Rogers assembled another group. A radio announcer got their name
mixed up and called them ``the Sons of the Pioneers.'' It stuck,
and in the middle 1930s they began to make transcriptions of
romantic cowboy ballads that were heard all over the country.
``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' became popular even among people with no
affinity for country-western music.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1935, the Sons of the Pioneers began to show up in
the movies. They appeared briefly with Bing Crosby in ``Rhythm on

Tumbleweeds.''

``Washington Cowboy,'' which he heard about in a hat shop while
getting his Stetson cleaned. He bested a line-up of competing

The name of the film was changed to ``Under Western Stars.''
Instead of Len Slye, Republic planned to rename him Dick Weston,

and the Senorita.'' They were married on New Year's Eve in 1947,
and she remained until he died ``my sweetheart and hunting and
fishing partner all wrapped up into one.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers married Miss Evans, he was a widower with three
children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, another daughter, Linda
Lou, and Roy Rogers Jr. She was a twice-married actress with a son,
Thomas Frederick Fox Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In raising a family, the couple endured more than their share of
heartbreak. Miss Evans and Rogers had a daughter, Robin Elizabeth,
who was born with Down syndrome and died shortly before her second
birthday. They had kept her at home, uncommon in those days, and
rejected any thought that they keep her condition a secret in
accordance with a show-business notion that audiences would recoil

wrote a best-selling inspiration book about their daughter called
``Angel Unaware.''
</P>
<P>
   To help soothe their grief over Robin's death, the couple
adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee. On Aug. 17,
1964, when she was 12, she was killed when a church bus collided
with a car near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David
``Sandy'' Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after a
goodwill visit to an orphanage, choked to death in a military
hospital in Germany where he was serving in the Army. After he
died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ``Salute to Sandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Evans and Rogers adopted one other child, Dodie, an
American Indian whom Miss Evans met while touring an orphanage, and
fostered another child, Marion, who was 6 years old when they found
her in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Miss Evans, Rogers is survived by his children,
Roy Rogers Jr., Cheryl Barnett, Linda Lou Johnson, Dodie Sailors,
Marion Swift and Tom Fox, 15 grandchildren and 33
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at the Church of the Valley in
Apple Valley. Details are not yet complete.

GETTING PERSONAL IN PARIS WITH ROMANTIC VISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo has been sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

(JT) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Designers working in Paris create such highly personal
collections that it is somewhat surprising that they find an
audience at all for their men's wear collections, which were shown
here last weekend. But they do, because within their peculiarities
often lie the seeds of many fashion visions. It was impossible to
ignore the free and gentle breeze wafting through Paris as
designers led by Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo crystallized the
romantic theme shown earlier in Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   For these designers the boundaries between the genders have
always been porous, and the result is an unforced quality to their
artistic designs.
</P>
<P>
   Men, of course, began to be outdressed by women only in the 19th
century with the advent of the suit. In certain tribal societies,
it is perfectly acceptable for male citizens to adorn themselves
fancifully. And to be a romantically dressed 1970s-style rock star
was a powerful fantasy that still resonates strongly for many men.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto's graceful collection did not ask men to suspend
reality to that extent. He made the imaginary tangible with hooded
black zippered nylon tunics and trousers that bloused softly at the
narrow ankle, and with crushed suits in stark white or faintly
metallic black in a soft fabric of acrylic and metal. Gently faded
floral jackets skimmed over earthy black pants.
</P>
<P>
   Models, mostly nonprofessionals with emotional ties to each
other _ husband and wife, brother and sister, best friends, all in
men's clothes _ took to the runway as couples, underlining
Yamamoto's theme.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kawakubo, too, chose her models in the Comme des Garcons
show with deliberation, putting the entire line on sweet-faced
young boys, none of whom appeared older than 16. ``Hidden jewels or
secret treasures'' are what she called the striped jackets
imaginatively lined in row upon row of red or teal ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffles down the front of unblemished white shirts peeked from
beneath jackets and trousers, as it seemed as if the wearer, in a
rush toward something exciting, had pulled them on without
bothering to iron them.
</P>
<P>
   Like any sincere romantic, Ms. Kawakubo sometimes was swept
away, tacking ruffles hither and yon on the outside of jackets that
looked as if they were worn inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The flowering of romantic design has shunted aside minimalism
and pushed dour sub-styles like Goth back underground. The work of
Raf Simons could not truly be said to be emblematic of the
development, but like almost everything in Paris, it was fashion
fantasia. Simons abandoned his Gothic creed and revealed more
clearly how close he had come to his quest for impeccably tailored
jackets and pants that are fit for a raver.
</P>
<P>
   He heightened the experience of viewing his awesome tailoring of
floor-dragging trousers with an inverted pleat down the leg and
long sleeveless jackets by staging a breathtaking show at the Cite
des Sciences et de l'Industrie. The building is mostly glass. More
than 50 models slowly traversed one of the building's high
breezeways, their thin bodies outlined against the Paris skyline,
as the audience, seated on a lower breezeway, viewed them across an
expanse of air.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of the unheralded Joe Casely-Hayford was also
streetwise and individualistic. Few designers were able to make
trouser shorts an alternative as convincingly as Casely-Hayford
did. With elegant sweaters with asymmetrical neckline, wide-leg
wrap-waist trousers in ecru-colored canvas and narrow jeans with
seams that curved in toward the front of the leg, he proved that he
deserves more attention.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment of the season was Dries van Noten, with his
offhand assemblage of indistinct T-shirts, shapeless pants and a
dour green palette. If there was a point to the collection, it was
a dull one, and it was painful that in this, of all seasons, there
was no sign of Van Noten's original romantic vision.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Paul Smith, John Rocha and Hedi Slimane for
Yves Saint Laurent warmed to the moment. Smith mixed embroidered
and floral jackets with jeans and funky drooping trousers, and
Rocha adorned cotton summer jackets with flashes of embroidery and
decorative feather appliques. Slimane evolved the look he began
developing last season, a fluid rarefied approach to men's wear,
with slim-fitting trench coats over languid pants and with refined
tunic shirts open at the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Even Paris' indulgent show of flesh spoke to the kind of
libertine romanticism that the city has encouraged among artists
for generations. Both Thierry Mugler and Shirtology, a company that
plans to open a store in Paris this month, brought their separate
fashion visions to men's swimwear and lingerie _ and, yes, that is
the correct word. In case anyone asks, two-tone swim briefs and
trunks with vertical slashes at the hip are the way to hit the
beach next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Paris could a design company named Shirtology, without a
smidgeon of irony, stage a runway show that included about three
shirts. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the Atlanta Botanical Garden, they have been
anticipating this event like the flight of Kahoutek. Curators and
security guards have been standing watch around the clock. Websites
and telephone hotlines have been updated daily to keep the
citizenry informed. For more than a week, enthusiasts have trekked
through the lobby of the Fuqua Conservatory, cameras in hand, in
order to monitor and record the progress.
</P>
<P>
   And then on Saturday afternoon, days before anyone expected it
to happen, the world's largest and perhaps rarest flowering plant,
the Amorphophallus titanum, began to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In botanical terms, this is not unlike the birth of a giant
panda at the National Zoo. Only six times in history, including
once last month at the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, has the
plant flowered in cultivation in this country. And the curators
here believe that none of the previous phallus-shaped plants has
matched the 6-foot, 2-inch length of this one, which explains why
one visitor wondered aloud whether the potting soil had been spiked
with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why officials at the botanical garden here plan
to lord it over their competitors by printing T-shirts proclaiming:
``Our Amorphophallus is way bigger than yours.'' Horticultural
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Size, of course, is not everything, at least not in botany. And
with the Amorphophallus titanum, a native of Sumatra, Indonesia,
that is also known as the Titan arum, it is the stench that counts
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Upon blooming, the flower emits an odor that is most frequently
compared to that of rotting flesh, all in a ploy to convince
beetles and flies that the plant is carrion. Once lured to the
Titan arum, the bugs pick up pollen and transport it to other
flowers. Not for nothing is the plant known in Sumatra as bunga
bangui, or corpse flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in yesterday it smelled like a cross between a
dead animal and a rotting pumpkin,'' said Ron Gagliardo, the
botanical garden's curator of tropical plants and the man who
nurtured the Titan arum from a seedling with a diet of bone meal
and chicken manure. ``You get used to it, but in the first few
minutes it was a little nauseating even for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell Monday, while noticeable, was far from repugnant, at
least partly because the conservatory was ventilated with a
constant flow of cooled air. Carolyn White, a security guard, did
her best to reassure those who seemed disappointed that the smell
was bearable. ``It was really bad yesterday,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The botanical garden is normally closed on Mondays, but opened
this time so that visitors could view the Titan arum before the
flower curls and sheds, a process that is usually completed only
two or three days after the blooming begins. A steady flow of
curiosity-seekers, having heard the big news in radio and
television news reports, streamed into the conservatory to pose for
pictures with the newest local celebrity. As parents lined their
children in front of the plant, the adorable youngsters inevitably
pinched their nostrils with their fingers and made disgusting
gagging sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors noted that in an era when the other side of the
planet is only a Website away, it was refreshing to be astounded by
a work of nature. ``There's so much in the world that we're unaware
of,'' said Sister Marian, 49, a bespectacled Dominican nun who
carried a Canon camera. ``How many times in your lifetime do you
get to see something like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Beck, a 72-year-old retiree, said the plant was ``just a
fascinating darn thing.'' He added, ``It's a wonder what nature can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagliardo, who was certain that his ward would not bloom until
Wednesday or Thursday, was visiting friends in Denver, some 1,200
miles away, when he received the blessed news in a telephone call
on Saturday night. Like a father absent for the birth of his child,
he sped to the Denver airport early Sunday morning and talked his
way on to a crowded flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to the desk and showed them a picture and said,
`Have you ever seen this plant?''' the 33-year-old Gagliardo
recounted. ``They said, `Why are you showing us this?' And I said,
`Because it's my plant and it's blooming and I've got to get back
to Atlanta'.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the Amorphophallus titanum is a compound flower, or
inflorescence, with a series of small flowers hidden within a vast
vase-like spathe that is the color of dried blood. The grayish
spadix, which 10-year-old Sarah Baalbergen likened Monday day to a
giant bird's beak, shoots skyward from the base of the spathe.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the Amorphophallus titanum is larger than the
largest single flower, the Rafflesia arnoldii, also from Sumatra.
And its mystique is only enhanced by the difficulty of its
cultivation, the unpredictability of its flowering and the
remarkable speed of its growth. Since the bud of the Atlanta plant
emerged from the soil on June 12, it has grown an average of five
to six inches a day.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Laufer, the public relations manager for the botanical
garden, acknowledged that the decision to refer to the Titan arum
as a flower involved a bit of marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine the confusion if we hung a banner at the
entrance advertising the world's largest inflorescence,'' she said.
``No one would turn in the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   While pleased with Monday's show, officials at the botanical
garden were disappointed that they were not able to artificially
pollinate the plant, an unprecedented feat. Officials at the
Fairchild garden in Miami collected pollen from their plant last
month and supposedly sent it to Atlanta, but it never arrived.
``The pollen,'' Gagliardo said dejectedly, ``seems to be lost in
the mail.''

JAPANESE SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE CLONED ADULT COWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japanese scientists announced Monday that they had created two
calves that are clones of adult cows. If their claims are correct,
the two calves born on Sunday would be the first clones of adults
after Dolly the sheep, whose birth was announced last year.
</P>
<P>
   But cloning experts were cautious, saying that they had no
reason to doubt the Japanese researchers but that the scientists
have not yet offered evidence that they have cloned adult cows.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitsuo Kita, a senior researcher at the Ishikawa Prefectural
Livestock Research Center in Japan, reported that his group used
much the same method as Dr. Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in
Scotland used to clone Dolly the sheep. They slipped adult cow
cells _ taken, Kita reported, from the uterine tube of a cow _ into
unfertilized cow's eggs whose own genetic material had been
removed. The genes from the adult cells took over and directed the
cells to develop into calves that are genetic identical twins of
the cows whose cells were used for cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Kita's group said they had created pregnancies in five cows. One
gave birth to twins prematurely on Sunday. The others are due to
deliver in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This method will make it possible to breed a large number of
cattle with high-quality beef of larger milk production,'' Kita
told Agence-France Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dolly was born, a few researchers have questioned whether
she was really cloned from an adult cell, noting that the feat had
not been duplicated. Several calves have been born that were cloned
from fetal cells, but this is considered easier than cloning from
cells of an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Robl, a cloning expert at the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst, who has cloned from calf fetuses but not
yet from adult cows, said that he would like to see more data
before commenting on the Japanese feat. The announcement did not
provide details that are necessary for investigators to assure
themselves that cloning took place. In particular, there is no
evidence that the Japanese have yet done the extensive DNA analysis
of the calves that would prove their genes are exactly the same as
the genes of the cow that was cloned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Seidel, a cloning expert at the Colorado State
University in Fort Collins, said he was inclined to believe the
announcement. ``The Japanese are pretty careful about the claims
they make and they can muster the resources to do these types of
experiments,'' he said. On the other hand, he said, it is hard to
know how to assess claims published only in a press report.
</P>
<P>
   But, Seidel and others noted, whether or not this particular
announcement stands up, they expect to see more clones of adults in
the near future.

 &HT;    Men's tour adopts points race for 2000
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men's tennis and stock car racing are on opposite ends of the
sports universe, but the ATP Tour is borrowing from the Winston Cup
circuit to enhance the sport's popularity in the next century. In
2000, there will be an ATP Tour points race and nine
``mini-majors'' to bring the top players together.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans think the ATP's current ranking system is too
complicated, especially when Marcelo Rios loses in the first round
of Wimbledon but could have ascended to No. 1 had Pete Sampras lost
in the Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   The standings approach, approved last week, will be based on
points earned to date in a calendar year. The 12-month rankings
will be maintained for seeding purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   If a standings format were in effect this year, it would bring
to life Sampras' quest for a record sixth straight final No. 1
ranking. The record is the five in a row held by Sampras and Jimmy
Connors (1974-78). In the ``standings,'' Sampras broke the top 10
this week only after winning Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Another change announced by the ATP Tour last week is the
requirement that all players who qualify for the four majors and
the Super 9 events must play them or receive a mandatory zero in
their ``best 14'' results that count toward rankings. Under the
current system, Rios' first-round loss isn't figured into his
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't play, he doesn't score,'' ATP Tour CEO Mark
Miles said about the new plan. ``I don't think that's an odd
concept in sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuveen wins for Pernfors
</P>
<P>
   Mikael Pernfors got his first victories on the Nuveen Tour last
week in Finland, beating Guillermo Vilas and Veli Paloheimo.
Pernfors, along with Bjorn Borg and Connors, plans to play in
Atlanta's Nuveen Tour stop Sept. 30-Oct. 4 at Atlanta Athletic
Club. ... Tough loss for Atlanta's Ellis Ferreira at Wimbledon. He
and Rick Leach lost in the doubles quarterfinals to Jonas Bjorkman
and Patrick Rafter 5-7, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson rushes home
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson pulled out of the
45-and-over doubles final Sunday at Wimbledon to rush home to
Florida, where his home is threatened by wildfires. Gullikson's
family lives in Flagler County. ... Little chance it will happen,
but Todd Martin should be considered the No. 2 singles player for
the U.S. team's Davis Cup match against Belgium. Martin is up to
No. 30 while Jim Courier is floundering at No. 45. It's assumed
Andre Agassi will play No. 1 singles and that Martin and Richey
Reneberg will be the doubles team in the July 17-19 match in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Tim Henman gets a $3.3 million bonus from his equipment sponsor,
Slazenger, if he reaches the top 10. His semifinal loss to Sampras
prevented that this week, but he did improve five spots to a
career-high No. 13. ... Jana Novotna moved up a spot to No. 2 in
the rankings, matching her career high. Nathalie Tauziat is No. 10,
also matching her best. Anna Kournikova dropped out of the top 10
to No. 15 after withdrawing because of a thumb injury. ...
Wimbledon's total attendance was down almost 12,000 this year.
World Cup soccer and the early loss of such stars as Steffi Graf,
Serena Williams, Kournikova, Greg Rusedski and Agassi didn't help.
... In the Sampras-Goran Ivanisevic final, there were 182 points
ended on serve _ 44 aces, 110 service winners and 28 double faults
_ an average of 3.4 per game.

 &HT;    Pressure Pak ending at the Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ The Open That Wouldn't Close finally became
another major championship for 20-year-old Se Ri Pak Monday. It
took 92 holes and five days. It took the South Korean making bogey
from ankle deep water. It took Duke senior-to-be Jenny
Chuasiriporn, despite the loss, to the pinnacle of her athletic
life.
</P>
<P>
   It even took Pak, who on the course is icy and emotionless, to
tears when her 18-foot putt found the cup for birdie on the second
hole of the first sudden-death playoff in tournament history,
giving her the U.S. Women's Open title at the Blackwolf Run Golf
Course.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, the first Asian to win the title, became the youngest
champion (20) in U.S. Women's Open history; the first LPGA rookie
to win two majors in a season since Juli Inkster in 1984; and the
first since Meg Mallon in 1991 to win consecutive majors. With
Chuasiriporn an amateur, Pak already had secured the professional
winner's check of $267,500 before the start of Monday's 18-hole
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really surprise myself because this is my first year and I
just really start,'' Pak said. ``The first time I win a major (the
McDonald's LPGA Championship in May), I surprise myself. Maybe some
people thinking I am lucky. Now I win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my trophy here. Now the dream is true. It's come to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak came back after trailing Chuasiriporn by four shots through
five holes of the playoff. Chuasiriporn, also 20, was foiled by a
triple-bogey at the 6th hole that allowed Pak to get back into the
match. After the stunning 45-foot putt Sunday that pushed her into
the playoff, Chuasiriporn displayed a carryover of momentum,
chipping in for birdie at the first hole and sinking an 8-footer
for birdie at No. 2. But at the par-3 6th, when her pulled 9-iron
wound up in unplayable high grass, the story changed. She re-teed,
made a wild approach putt and finally made 6. Pak parred for a
three-shot swing. The Korean finally tied the match at the 12th
with a 15-foot birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Although No. 11, the 92nd hole, offically decided the
tournament, the difficult, 421-yard 18th was as crucial. Pak only
made the most important bogey of her life there.
</P>
<P>
   After driving into high grass in the hazard area next to the
Sheboygan River, Pak, after about 10 minutes of studying the
situation, hit out cleanly with a sand wedge, but into the right
rough. Hitting to the green in three with an 8-iron, Pak two-putted
for bogey. Chuasiriporn smartly hit her second shot away from the
water hazard, but then chipped too strong to the right fringe, 15
feet past the cup. Admitting that her hands were shaking,
Chuasiriporn pushed the putt slightly and missed, giving both
players 2-over 73's and pushing the match to extra holes.

ROY ROGERS, 86, KING OF THE COWBOYS, OF HEART FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Rogers, the singing ``King of the Cowboys'' whose straight
shooting in movies and, particularly, in television made him a hero
to generations of young fans, died Monday at his home in Apple
Valley, Calif., at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers died of congestive heart failure, according to a
spokeswoman, Jane Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Born Leonard Slye on Nov. 5., 1911, in Cincinnati, Mr. Rogers
drove a truck and picked peaches during the Depression to make ends
meet. Eventually, he entered show business as a country singer with
the Sons of the Pioneers, before he landed a $75-a-week job in 1937
as singing cowboy at Hollywood's Republic Studio. Armed with a
guitar, six-shooters, and charm, he was the No.1 Western star at
the box office from 1943 until 1954. He made 87 Westerns in all,
and in them, he was the cowboy who fought fair, never killed the
bad guys but only shot the gun out of their hands and lived to sing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But it was in television that Mr. Rogers made his biggest
mark, and where the twinkle in his eyes and his good-guy smile had
the most impact. Following Gene Autry and ``The Lone Ranger'' onto
network TV, ``The Roy Rogers Show,'' ran on Sundays at 6:30 p.m.
from 1951 to 1957 on NBC. It inspired a following of boys and girls
to dress in cowboy and cowgirl garb and send away for all kinds of
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In many films and in the television series, he costarred with
Dale Evans, whom he married in 1947. She was the co-writer of
``Happy Trails to You,'' which became their theme song. Featured
were his famous palomino horse, Trigger &UR;  &LR; (who was later stuffed and
placed in Rogers's museum), his dog, Bullet, and Evans's horse,
Buttermilk. His sidekick in films was the bewhisk-ered Gabby Hayes,
in television, Pat Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blessing to have shared my life together with him for
almost 51 years,'' said Evans. She and Mr. Rogers married 14 months
after his first wife, Arlene, died. Evans, born Frances Octavia
Smith in Uvalde, Texas, became known as ``Queen of the Cowgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   Others paid their tributes to Mr. Rogers as well. President
Clinton said, ``I really appreciate what he stood for, the movies
he made, and the kind of values they embodied. Today there will be
a lot of sad and grateful Americans, especially of my generation,
because of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible loss for me,'' said cowboy crooner Gene
Autry, 90. ``I had tremendous respect for Roy and considered him a
great humanitarian and an outstanding American. He was, and will
always be, a true Western hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, the 83-year-old actor who played the Lone Ranger,
said: ``He certainly was a role model for people all over the
world. Just a good, straightforward man. He always treated people
with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an introvert at heart,'' Mr. Rogers once said. ``And show
business _ even though I've loved it so much _ has always been hard
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers was a co-founder of Sons of the Pioneers, which had a
couple of radio hits in the '30s, ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' and
``Cool Water.'' Mr. Rogers kept up his musical career in recent
years, releasing an album of old and new songs, ``Tribute,'' in
1991. The album featured country superstar Clint Black (a Rogers
lookalike) as a guest singer on one cut, ``Hold On Partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers and Evans became well known for their Christian
beliefs and spoke at many religious gatherings, including some of
evangelist Billy Graham's revivals.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had nine children, which brought pain as well as
happiness to their lives. Their daughter Robin, who was mentally
retarded, died of complications of the mumps shortly before her
second birthday in 1952. Korean-born Debbie, one of the couple's
adopted children, was killed with seven others in a 1964 church bus
crash, and the following year, their adopted son John choked to
death while serving in the Army in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, it doesn't say you're going to get by without
having troubles,'' Mr. Rogers once said. ``I'm not a fanatic about
religion. I think it's a practical way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   His sense of fairness was tested when Herbert Yates, then
president of Republic Pictures, sold some of Mr. Rogers's movies to
television in the early '50s. Mr. Rogers thought he was due
residuals and took Republic to court. Mr. Rogers lost the battle in
the US Supreme Court, but he fired an important salvo for the
rights of actors regarding ancillary rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers also pioneered marketing. He and a fellow TV cowboy,
Hop-along Cassidy, realized that their names meant something in the
open market. Eventually, Mr. Rogers had his name on everything from
clocks and bedspreads to wristwatches and lunch boxes, but said he
never put his name on a product he didn't believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers leaves is wife, Evans; Roy Rogers Jr., his son from
his first marriage; Linda Lou Johnson, a daughter from his first
marriage; Cheryl Barnett, an adopted daughter from his first
marriage; Dodie Sailors, an adopted daughter from his marriage to
Evans; 15 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.

   Ford Motor Co. on Monday reported a 9.8 percent increase in June
car and light-truck sales from June 1997, pushing total U.S. car
and truck sales last month to a seasonally adjusted annual selling
rate of 16.7 million, its highest rate in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. vehicle sales for the month totaled 1,570,355 cars and
light trucks, a 14.1 percent increase from June 1997, the best
month since September 1986, according to Ward's Automotive Reports,
which calculates percentage changes on a daily selling rate. Last
month had one more selling day than did June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of both cars and trucks increased, though truck sales were
substantially higher. Car sales totaled 818,604 units, up 6.4
percent from June 1997; light-truck sales were 751,751 units, up
23.9 percent. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 16.7
million cars and trucks was the highest level since August 1987,
when the rate was 16.8 million cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported that its Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar
divisions sold 406,991 cars and light trucks in June, a 9.8 percent
increase from June 1997. Ford's car sales totaled 169,278 vehicles,
up two-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier. Ford's light-truck
sales were 237,713 units, up 17.9 percent. Ford's total truck sales
set an all-time monthly record for any manufacturer and beat
General Motors Corp.'s truck sales by a scant 1,346 units.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of GM's North American assembly operations are closed
because of two strikes by the United Automobile Workers union at
parts-making operations in Flint, Mich. In addition, three of its
North American truck plants are in the process of being converted
to produce a new version of its full-size pickup truck, which is
scheduled for release in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was the last automaker to report sales. Nearly every major
vehicle manufacturer, most of which reported sales last week,
experienced higher sales in June compared with the month a year
earlier. The Chrysler Corp. set a new monthly sales record, selling
252,485 cars and trucks, a 10.5 percent increase. Toyota sales
totaled 117,043 cars and trucks, up 17.2 percent, setting a new
June record. Honda also set a new June record, with 88,928 vehicles
sold, an increase of 7.7 percent. Also reporting higher sales for
June were Isuzu, Kia Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Porsche,
Subaru of America, Suzuki, Volkswagen and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Only Saab (which includes its sales in GM's total), Nissan,
Hyundai and BMW had lower sales this June compared with June 1997;
BMW had higher car sales but lower sales of sports utility vehicles
at its Land Rover division.
</P>
<P>
   The extremely strong sales in May and June, however, may be
short-lived, according to analysts. ``July sales will collapse,''
predicted David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities Inc. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   GM sales are expected to drop between 30 percent and 40 percent
this month compared with July 1997 because of the strikes, Ronald
L. Zarrella, vice president in charge of GM's North American
Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing Group, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle sales in May and June were partly fueled by attractive
incentives, some of which ended this month. GM has announced that
it will not renew its customer loyalty program. In mid-April, GM
sent former GM buyers certificates of $500 to $1,000 to use toward
the purchase of specific GM vehicles, above and beyond other cash
rebates and low-financing charges as incentives. The highly
successful program was an effort to rebuild GM's U.S. market share,
which had fallen below 30 percent early in the year; the program
pushed it over the 30 percent mark. Now, GM does not need
incentives because its inventory on dealership lots is running out
because of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler had matched GM's program with their own
customer loyalty plans, which included acceptance of GM
certificates. Chrysler's program was to expire Monday at midnight,
and the automaker is expected to announce its future incentive plan
on Tuesday. Ford's program also expires Tuesday and the company is
expected to announce if it plans to renew the incentive program.
Analysts, however, expect both companies to follow GM's lead and
end the loyalty programs.

WORRIES OVER JAPAN AND U.S. SEND TREASURIES HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concerns about Japan and signs of a slowdown in the
United States sent Treasury prices higher Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32, to 107 31/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, fell to 5.57 percent, from 5.60 percent Thursday, matching
the low set on June 15 _ the lowest it has been since the
government began regular sales of securities in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Monday's gains came from overnight weakness in the
Japanese yen compared with the dollar, amid speculation that Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan was not promising permanent tax
cuts. Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca
Raton, Fla., called Monday's session extremely quiet with light
trading after the July 4 holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bias is toward higher prices,'' he said, ``especially with
all the positive information about inflation. The market's positive
tone has a lot to do with foreign buying and the strength of the
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about $32.9 billion of bills, notes and bonds were traded
by the major brokerage firms by late in the day, down 35.1 percent
from the average Monday during the third quarter of 1997, according
to GovPx, the bond-pricing service.
</P>
<P>
   Pugliese does not expect anything to rock the market in the near
term, with the exception perhaps of a few reactions to news
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally the market is strong, and many believe there are
more than a half-dozen reasons why the market will continue to do
well,'' he said. ``Yields are probably where they should be, based
on the present scenario. So we should be in a trading range this
week with an upward bias on prices. Any new type of negative news
is going to bring in buyers at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   The only major economic data expected this week are Friday's
Producer Price Index for June, which some analysts expect to be
unchanged for both the overall and the core numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp increase in drug prices in May contributed to the 0.2
percent gain in the overall and core indexes, and some analysts
believe that prescription prices could continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's regular weekly bill auction of new three-month and
six-month bills was uneventful, with the average rate for a
three-month maturity 4.960 percent. The six-month bill produced an
average rate of 5.010 percent.

ROY ROGERS, 86, KING OF THE COWBOYS, OF HEART FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Rogers, the singing ``King of the Cowboys'' whose straight
shooting in movies and, particularly, in television made him a hero
to generations of young fans, died Monday at his home in Apple
Valley, Calif., at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers died of congestive heart failure, according to a
spokeswoman, Jane Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Born Leonard Slye on Nov. 5., 1911, in Cincinnati, Mr. Rogers
drove a truck and picked peaches during the Depression to make ends
meet. Eventually, he entered show business as a country singer with
the Sons of the Pioneers, before he landed a $75-a-week job in 1937
as singing cowboy at Hollywood's Republic Studio. Armed with a
guitar, six-shooters, and charm, he was the No.1 Western star at
the box office from 1943 until 1954. He made 87 Westerns in all,
and in them, he was the cowboy who fought fair, never killed the
bad guys but only shot the gun out of their hands and lived to sing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But it was in television that Mr. Rogers made his biggest
mark, and where the twinkle in his eyes and his good-guy smile had
the most impact. Following Gene Autry and ``The Lone Ranger'' onto
network TV, ``The Roy Rogers Show,'' ran on Sundays at 6:30 p.m.
from 1951 to 1957 on NBC. It inspired a following of boys and girls
to dress in cowboy and cowgirl garb and send away for all kinds of
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In many films and in the television series, he costarred with
Dale Evans, whom he married in 1947. She was the co-writer of
``Happy Trails to You,'' which became their theme song. Featured
were his famous palomino horse, Trigger &UR;  &LR; (who was later stuffed and
placed in Rogers's museum), his dog, Bullet, and Evans's horse,
Buttermilk. His sidekick in films was the bewhisk-ered Gabby Hayes,
in television, Pat Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blessing to have shared my life together with him for
almost 51 years,'' said Evans. She and Mr. Rogers married 14 months
after his first wife, Arlene, died. Evans, born Frances Octavia
Smith in Uvalde, Texas, became known as ``Queen of the Cowgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   Others paid their tributes to Mr. Rogers as well. President
Clinton said, ``I really appreciate what he stood for, the movies
he made, and the kind of values they embodied. Today there will be
a lot of sad and grateful Americans, especially of my generation,
because of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible loss for me,'' said cowboy crooner Gene
Autry, 90. ``I had tremendous respect for Roy and considered him a
great humanitarian and an outstanding American. He was, and will
always be, a true Western hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, the 83-year-old actor who played the Lone Ranger,
said: ``He certainly was a role model for people all over the
world. Just a good, straightforward man. He always treated people
with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an introvert at heart,'' Mr. Rogers once said. ``And show
business _ even though I've loved it so much _ has always been hard
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers was a co-founder of Sons of the Pioneers, which had a
couple of radio hits in the '30s, ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' and
``Cool Water.'' Mr. Rogers kept up his musical career in recent
years, releasing an album of old and new songs, ``Tribute,'' in
1991. The album featured country superstar Clint Black (a Rogers
lookalike) as a guest singer on one cut, ``Hold On Partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers and Evans became well known for their Christian
beliefs and spoke at many religious gatherings, including some of
evangelist Billy Graham's revivals.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had nine children, which brought pain as well as
happiness to their lives. Their daughter Robin, who was mentally
retarded, died of complications of the mumps shortly before her
second birthday in 1952. Korean-born Debbie, one of the couple's
adopted children, was killed with seven others in a 1964 church bus
crash, and the following year, their adopted son John choked to
death while serving in the Army in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, it doesn't say you're going to get by without
having troubles,'' Mr. Rogers once said. ``I'm not a fanatic about
religion. I think it's a practical way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   His sense of fairness was tested when Herbert Yates, then
president of Republic Pictures, sold some of Mr. Rogers's movies to
television in the early '50s. Mr. Rogers thought he was due
residuals and took Republic to court. Mr. Rogers lost the battle in
the US Supreme Court, but he fired an important salvo for the
rights of actors regarding ancillary rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers also pioneered marketing. He and a fellow TV cowboy,
Hop-along Cassidy, realized that their names meant something in the
open market. Eventually, Mr. Rogers had his name on everything from
clocks and bedspreads to wristwatches and lunch boxes, but said he
never put his name on a product he didn't believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers leaves is wife, Evans; Roy Rogers Jr., his son from
his first marriage; Linda Lou Johnson, a daughter from his first
marriage; Cheryl Barnett, an adopted daughter from his first
marriage; Dodie Sailors, an adopted daughter from his marriage to
Evans; 15 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.

OPTIMISM LIFTS S&AMP;P 500 TO A HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investor optimism that corporate earnings would
continue to grow and interest rates would remain near historic lows
lifted stocks higher Monday, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index reaching another closing record.
</P>
<P>
   Led by gains in shares of Lucent Technologies, Home Depot,
Coca-Cola and Merck, the S&AMP;P 500 index rose 10.89 points, to
1,157.31.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are thinking there won't be too many disasters out
there,'' Jim Benning, a trader at Bankers Trust, said of the
quarterly profit reports, which are to begin appearing in earnest
next week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, investors are not likely to be disappointed.
Traditionally, most companies that anticipate earnings shortfalls
soften the blow by warning investors well in advance of the actual
earnings reports. Stocks then are likely to fall on the forecast,
but may rise if actual earnings are no worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, actual earnings normally beat expectations by about
2 percent to 3 percent, according to First Call Corp., which
compiles analysts' forecasts. Therefore, near-term, beating the
estimates should only be bullish if 4 percent or more of the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 do so, First Call said in a recent market
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   A large amount of the investor euphoria on Monday also was
fueled by a decline in long-term interest rates. On Monday, the
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.57 percent. That
matched its level on June 15, which was the lowest yield on the
security since the Treasury began issuing bonds on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Lower yields enable companies to borrow at lower rates and are
expected to increase capital expenditures and to aid in lifting
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not expecting much pricing power, so you're just
going to have to act smarter and build smarter'' in order to lift
corporate profits, Benning said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average increased 66.51
points, to 9,091.77, marking its third consecutive close above
9,000 since early June. The Nasdaq composite index, which is
heavily laden with technology issues, rose 15.47 points, to
1,909.47, and is just 8.14 points away from its April 22 record.
Microsoft, Ericsson and Compuware led the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of slowing economic growth, the National Association
of Purchasing Management said its index of nonmanufacturing
business activity fell to 61.5 in June from 64 in May. Readings
above 50 mean business is still expanding, thus investors viewed
the moderate June decline as positive.

EDITORIAL: A COWBOY'S TRAIL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   There is, in America, no more pliable figure than the cowboy. He
is whatever we want him to be whenever we need to imagine him. He
rides in from somewhere else, driving cattle, chasing badmen,
fleeing the past or simply mulling over the landscape as it looks
from the back of a horse. He is as artificial as the worst of
movies can make him, and he is more authentic than even the truest
of stories that are told about him. How richly we have elaborated
the myth of cowboys _ surrendering the reality nearly completely in
the process _ can be demonstrated by a simple thought-experiment.
Try to imagine a western that could star both John Wayne and Roy
Rogers, who died Monday at 86. It can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Roy Rogers was that almost unimaginable
thing, the domesticated cowboy. He had a steady girl and a steady
horse and a steady sidekick and, in a sense, a steady job that had
nothing to do with cattle but everything to do with being a sort of
Stetson Superman, always appearing on the scene of trouble in the
nick of time wearing a costume that made Superman look dowdy. (To
recent generations, he is known, sadly, only from the restaurants
that bear his name.) Into the scripts that cast John Wayne, trouble
would ride unexpectedly from somewhere out beyond the horizon. But
in Roy Rogers' movies, and still more in his TV series, which ran
from 1951 to 1957, there was no horizon, only the edge of the set.
To the character Roy Rogers played when he was playing himself on
screen, trouble came in distinctly limited forms, resolved by a
song or a chaste embrace with Dale Evans, his wife and partner of
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   But to those of us who grew up watching Roy Rogers on television
in the 1950s, it was not the romance that registered. It was his
friendship with Trigger, his horse. Every half hour peaked when Roy
leaped aboard Trigger _ did we ever see Roy actually saddle his
horse? _ and galloped down a shade-mottled trail to the sound of
hoofbeats. For many viewers the picture of Roy Rogers, aglint in
the sun, racing across the harmless West upon Trigger, is a picture
as invincible to time as a childhood memory.

EAST GERMAN SPORTS DOCTOR TELLS OF ISSUING STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A former East German sports doctor admitted Monday in a
Berlin court that he handed out anabolic steroids for use by young
female swimmers, the first formal confession of such practices by
an official of the Communist state that once churned out
gold-medal-winning athletes with bizarre consistency.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Dieter Binus said that the doses of the
steroids never exceeded 1,000 milligrams a year, an amount that he
contended was too small to harm the young swimmers. He denied
giving testosterone injections or other drugs to the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Binus, a 59-year-old Berlin physician, was testifying at a trial
in which he, another doctor and four coaches are accused of
seriously injuring 19 athletes through the forced use of steroids.
Despite his disclaimers, the doctor's admission that steroids were
used amounted to an extraordinary breakthrough for prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the defendants at the trial, which opened in March, had
denied the charges. But last week, Binus reached an agreement with
the state prosecutor, Rudiger Hillebrand, in which he agreed to
testify about the use of steroids in return for a lighter sentence
if convicted. The maximum sentence he faces is a fine.
</P>
<P>
   The trial amounts to the culmination of a long and divisive
investigation into what prosecutors believe was the state-sponsored
use of steroids by the former East Germany as part of a campaign to
attain athletic excellence that would reflect favorably on the
former Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   For many years before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, East
Germany, with only 16 million inhabitants, consistently won an
extraordinary number of gold medals in swimming and track events.
But suspicions that drugs were behind the glory were never
definitively proved.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, when the U.S. men won 12 of
their 13 events, the U.S. women, despite breaking eight U.S.
records, won only one of 13 events. East Germans won 11 events and
a Russian won the other.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Monday's testimony, Jack Nelson, the head coach of
the 1976 U.S. women's Olympic team, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is glorious. It's all sad, but it's also great because
our women who did so fantastically well in 1976 may not get their
rightful reward. It doesn't matter who gave the German doctors the
orders to use steroids. It was wrong. It just breaks my heart that
the United States has never saluted the greatest women's swimming
team it's ever had. Shirley Babashoff would have won four gold
medals and would have broken four world records if it was a level
playing field. It just surprises me how long it's taken for this to
come out and how long our own representatives in the United States
haven't gone to bat for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Weilgus, executive director of U.S. Swimming, the national
governing body, said that ``once this is settled in the German
court system we'd like to find an appropriate way, and I'm not sure
what that is yet, to recognize these American athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean asking the International Olympic Committee to
give gold medals to those swimmers from the United States and
elsewhere who were denied them because of drug use by East Germans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board has talked about that,'' he said. ``We have no
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 19 female athletes called as witnesses at the
Berlin trial have said their bodies became more masculine as a
result of ``little blue pills'' they were made to take. They said
they suffered unnatural body hair, voice changes, severe acne and
abnormal muscle growth.
</P>
<P>
   According to secret files recovered from the Stasi, the East
German secret police, some women were ordered to abort fetuses that
might have been deformed by the drugs. Rica Reinisch, an Olympic
gold-medal swimmer, has said she was given steroids at age 12
without knowing what they were and now suffers from ovarian cysts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reading a statement, Binus said he did not give the pills to the
athletes himself, but would hand them to coaches who were charged
with making sure the swimmers took what were then known as the
``supporting means.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that as a doctor for the Dynamo Berlin team from 1969
to 1986, he did not have the authority to decide whether the
performance-enhancing drugs should be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only an official carrying out orders,'' Binus said,
suggesting that the orders came from the doctors' commission in the
national swimming association.
</P>
<P>
   He added that his co-defendant, Dr. Bernd Pansold, who was one
of the association's doctors, decided which athletes should receive
the drugs. Pansold, who continues to deny the charges, did not
testify Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that Binus' confession will bolster a case that
the prosecution hopes will eventually lead to the trial of senior
former East German officials.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the use of steroids, begun in 1993, has
already caused anger among former East German leaders. Egon Krenz,
East Germany's last Communist leader, has said the trial is ``about
revenge because East Germany was better at sport than West
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes from many other countries, including the United States,
have been found to have taken steroids, but the apparently
systematic nature of the East German program, and its extent,
remain without obvious parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Venedey, Binus' lawyer, said in a telephone interview
that it was very difficult to say where the real responsibility for
the policy of using steroids lies.

GUN-CONTROL ADVOCATES THREATENING TO DERAIL DAMAGE-CAP
LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., W.Va., N.J., Calif., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gun control advocates who want the firearms
industry to be held responsible for gun-related injuries or deaths
are threatening a fragile agreement on broad legislation that would
affect lawsuits against manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, scheduled for debate in the Senate this week,
would place a cap of $250,000 on the punitive damages that small
businesses would have to pay in cases involving faulty products.
The limit on damages, opposed by consumers, is part of a broader
product-liability bill that businesses have been seeking for nearly
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The White House helped negotiate the bill after President
Clinton two years ago vetoed an earlier version that would have
capped damages paid by companies of all sizes. The pending version
defines small businesses as those that employ fewer than 25 people
and have annual revenues of less than $5 million a year.
Gun-control advocates say that nearly one in five guns sold in the
United States is made by a small company, and that two of the guns
manufactured by small companies rank among the top 10 weapons found
at crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun forces fear that the punitive damage limits on small
businesses would derail their larger efforts to hold the gun
industry accountable, in much the same way as the anti-smoking
forces have stepped up pressure on the tobacco industry. Just as
those forces found their voice in the state attorneys general, the
gun control advocates hope that big-city mayors can carry their
banner with lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns have persuaded two Democratic senators, normally
allies of Clinton, to propose exempting the gun makers from the
protections offered by the bill. That proposal could drive away
supporters of the broader liability legislation, vastly
complicating propsects for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Reilly, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of
Small Business, said that any changes in the language of the bill
could scuttle the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for gun manufacturers say that the caps on damages
would affect only a small percentage of firearms makers and is
irrelevant because these companies routinely win lawsuits
contending that they have negligently marketed their products. The
manufacturers support the product-liability bill as part of what
they say is a much-needed overhaul of the litigation process.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer advocates, including Ralph Nader, oppose the bill
on grounds that the measure makes it more difficult for consumers
to recover damages, the business community is split.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses view the proposed legislation as a relief from
excessive litigation. Even for larger companies, the bill would
raise the standards of proof for a consumer to be eligible to
recoup damages. But some large companies _ like chemical producers
and automobile manufacturers, which have substantial liability
exposure _ wanted the same protection against high punitive damages
that smaller businesses would receive.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could pose a political dilemma for many Democrats and
some suburban Republicans who want to be responsive to the concerns
of small businesses but whose support for gun control can be an
important distinction in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring the picture further are the competing interests behind
the bill: It is strongly backed by the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful lobbying group for small business,
while it is strongly opposed by the trial lawyers, who tend to make
large financial donations to Democrats. (Trial lawyers have been
particularly generous to Clinton, who in this case is going against
their wishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The White House helped hammer out the bill in an agreement with
Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and John Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va. Nader
said the White House ``bollixed'' the bill by making proposals that
it did not expect Gorton to accept. And two Democratic senators _
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Dianne Feinstein of California
_ expect to sponsor an amendment that would exempt the entire gun
industry from the limits. The bill already exempts tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those 12 firearms companies made 17 percent of all guns sold in
the United States between 1990 and 1995, according to an analysis
by the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit group in Washington that
promotes gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, the 12 companies made 23 percent of all
.38-caliber pistols, which are the most popular caliber. And they
made two of the top 10 guns that are found at crime scenes, the
center said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official conceded that the bill's failure to
exempt the gun industry ``complicates things because the president
has been so strong on guns,'' but insisted this was not an
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   And other backers of the bill asserted that it offered no
substantive protection for gun makers. ``These are just folks who
don't like this bill and are looking for ways to tear it down,''
said Victor Schwartz, counsel for the Product Liability
Coordinating Committee, which has been seeking similar, if
stronger, legislation for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no situation where any of these gun manufacturers have
paid punitive damages anywhere near the cap,'' he said. ``It's a
completely bogus argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats in both the Senate and the House already oppose
the larger bill but on other grounds _ they see it as
anti-consumer. Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic
leader, told Clinton in a recent letter that the bill was a ``grave
mistake'' and would limit consumer rights for the sake of a myth
that businesses are burdened by an excess of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the Violence Policy
Center, said that gun-control advocates are trying to formulate a
new legal line based on the tobacco cases _ not that guns are
defective but that the manufacturers are knowingly marketing a
dangerous product. Although the bill deals only with product
liability, she said that even this limit on lawsuits against gun
manufacturers would be a setback to the anti-gun movement.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, which represents the gun industry, said that the
bill would have little effect. And he dismissed the attempt to
mimic the success of anti-tobacco groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very important distinction between tobacco and
firearms,'' he said. ``When you use tobacco as it is intended to be
used, it is harmful; when you use a firearm as intended, not only
is it not harmful to the user, it can save the user's life.''

TEXAS TEEN ACCUSED OF SETTING BOY, 8, ON FIRE SOBS IN COURT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAUL McKAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONROE, Texas _ A 13-year-old boy accused of setting an
8-year-old neighbor on fire sobbed Monday when a judge announced
that he will remain in custody on allegations of aggravated
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Retired state District Judge John Martin also said in a court
hearing that Don W. Collins will be detained for at least a week on
related accusations of injury to a child in the June 28 attack on
Robert Ray Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Robert has named Collins as the
one who attacked him on a wooded trail in the east Montgomery
County subdivision where the boys are next-door neighbors. Sources
have said that Collins had threatened to hurt Robert after the
younger boy told his father that Collins had stolen his fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   About a month earlier, Robert reportedly had told people that he
had seen Collins molest a child in the woods in their neighborhood
near Splendora, about 30 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Robert was listed in critical but stable condition Monday at the
Shriners Burns Hospital-Galveston after undergoing one of the
numerous skin-graft surgeries that doctors say he will need in a
recovery that will take years.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered third-degree burns over 99 percent of his body after
being doused with a flammable liquid and set afire on his 8th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked in Monday's court hearing by two sisters and an uncle,
who massaged his shoulders as he stood before the judge, Collins
lowered his head and wept as Martin announced that he had appointed
Conroe lawyer William ``Bill'' Hall, who was unable to attend the
hearing, to defend him. Martin set another hearing for July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his age, Collins cannot be certified to stand trial
as an adult, Montgomery County prosecutor Bill Pattillo said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that Collins will be prosecuted under the
Determinate Sentencing Act. That means that if he is convicted of
aggravated assault, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years,
or of injury to a child and given a maximum sentence of 40 years, a
judge would determine when he turns 18 whether he should serve out
the full sentence in an adult prison.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Collins has admitted being present when
Robert, who was headed down the wooded trail to meet a 9-year-old
friend, was doused with a flammable liquid _ presumed to be
gasoline _ and set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Collins reportedly has tried to place at least some of the blame
on a younger boy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any others are considered suspects at this point,
prosecutor Mike Valdez said, ``We anticipate that Robert is going
to be able to give us the whole story eventually, so the
investigation will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   According to probable-cause documents, Robert was asked who had
set him on fire when he regained consciousness and was taken off a
ventilator Thursday morning. According to the documents, he told
his mother and two nurses at the Galveston hospital that ``Don did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents note that investigators last week were seeking a
warrant to search the home of a relative where Collins has been
living for ``a gasoline can or other devices'' capable of
containing flammable liquids.
</P>
<P>
   No such container has been found either at the home where
Collins was staying or in the woods where Robert was burned,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, advised Collins' half sister, April Collins,
and an uncle, John Horn, to have someone in the family pursue legal
custody of the teen-ager, who currently has no legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   April Collins, 24, said her mother died about three years ago.
Her half brother's father, she said, is ``nowhere to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn, who owns a glass business in Cleveland, Texas, and April
Collins insist that the teen is not responsible for the crime. Horn
complained Monday that authorities have not allowed him and the
other relatives to see the teen, telling reporters that ``you seem
to know more about everything than we ever thought about.''

 &HT;    This time, hole keeps Pak's hopes alive
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Jenny Chuasiriporn knows a comfort zone when she
sees one. She had a feeling that the 18th hole, which had allowed
her a 45-foot bomb the day before, would be her spot to either win
the U.S. Women's Open in Monday's playoff or see it slide away on
the holes of sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   These Duke kids are usually pretty smart. Indeed, the 18th
proved clean out of miracles for the 20-year-old amateur. When it
looked like Chuasiriporn had a par wrapped up on Blackwolf Run's
421-yard 18th, it became a bogey. When it looked like Se Ri Pak was
doomed there, hitting from the bank of the water hazard, she
somehow manufactured a bogey to tie.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, with experience becoming a larger factor with
each passing moment, Pak sank an 18-foot putt on the second playoff
hole to secure the U.S. Women's Open title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to watch,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``I really had
a sixth sense she was going to make that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chuasiriporn's 15-foot par try at the 18th curled just
above the hole, she knew the magnitude of the opportunity that had
just gotten away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had the putt, but my hands were shaking a lot,''
Chuasiriporn said. ``I thought that was going to be it, but it
didn't turn out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The final result notwithstanding, Chuasiriporn left Wisconsin
with no regrets. Barely noticede when the week started, she nearly
left with the USGA hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty satisfied with the way I handled it,'' she said.
``I mean, it was so stressful at times this week. This is just
another thing to build my confidence and my mental game. Everything
is just a big plus coming out of this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, a psychology major, said she probably will turn
pro after she graduates. The big surprise would be if she didn't.
Especially now that she's gained some Matt Kuchar-like notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as though in a year's time I'll probably give it a
chance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chuasiriporn had desired to play the Women's Open as a
pro, she could not have done so. Because her spot was earned as a
member of the Curtis Cup team, she was only eligible as an amateur.
Several of her Curtis Cup team members followed her in the gallery,
along with her parents, brother Jimmy, 10, and Duke coach Dan
Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn played with golf balls bearing a University of
Virginia Cavalier logo. A friend of Virginia's Louis Chitengwa, she
lost a putting contest with him at a UVA golf camp last week and,
according to the wager, had to display his logo instead of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance record
</P>
<P>
   The tournament set a U.S. Women's Open for attendance, drawing
115,000 over four days at Blackwolf Run, breaking last year's mark
of 109,000 at Pumpkin Ridge near Portland, Ore. ``On a scale of
10,'' said past USGA president Judy Bell, ``it (the event) was a
60.''... About 10,000 people attended Monday's playoff.

FAA SEEKING TO INSTALL NEW NETWORK OF NAVIGATION AIDS TO REPLACE
RADIO BEACONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration is trying to
replace its aging nationwide network of radio beacons and other
navigation aids with a satellite-based system that is simpler, more
accurate, and less expensive to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   But it is running into a problem: some aviation experts think
that the new system will not be reliable, and they want the
government to maintain both the new and the old.
</P>
<P>
   The old system is a network of more than a thousand radio
beacons, used like lighthouses, in long-distance navigation, a
similar number of radio aids that help airplanes approach runways,
and about 100 long-distance radars, used to help controllers on the
ground determine the location of planes.
</P>
<P>
   The existing equipment costs more than $100 million a year to
maintain. Much of it, though, will reach the end of its useful life
in the next few years, and would cost billions of dollars to
replace.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the aviation agency wants to replace its beacons and
radars with an enhanced version of the Global Positioning System, a
network of satellites launched by the Pentagon that sends location
signals. Inexpensive receivers sold at electronics stores can
pinpoint a position to within a few yards, and the receivers are in
wide use in pleasure boats, trucks, and even farm tractors.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is spending $475 million on a supplemental system that
would let airplanes use the signal to find their way to within a
few hundred feet of runways. If the new system cuts delays, it
could save the airlines hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
Proponents say it will let planes fly closer together and land
safely in low-visibility weather, because of greater certainty
about where they are.
</P>
<P>
   But some air traffic experts say that the older, less
sophisticated system has an advantage. Decentralized, strong, and
simple, it can withstand the loss of several radio beacons or
radars. On most days, in fact, it does.
</P>
<P>
   Langhorne Bond, the administrator of the FAA from 1977 to 1981,
said at a recent conference that the Global Positioning System,
although accurate and cheap, could easily be jammed by a terrorist
or a hostile power, and could even be subject to inadvertent
interference, partly because it uses low-power signals.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also expressed concern that moving to the GPS would mean
that a single method would tell an airplane and controllers where
the plane is, tasks now accomplished by separate systems. ``They're
creating the mother of all single-thread systems there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cluster of jammers, some floated in weather balloons, would
destroy all GPS navigation and approach-guidance for hundreds of
airliners'' as well as private aircraft, Bond said. When visibility
was poor, he said, ``many of them, perhaps most of them, would
crash without back-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials agree that radio interference, deliberate or
accidental, could be a hazard. They said they are already studying
what backup system they should retain.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA wants to eventually abandon radio beacons, called VHF
omnidirectional radios, which send a radio signal to each degree on
the compass. The FAA would also like to abandon 1,100 instrument
landing systems, which guide aircraft approaching runways.
</P>
<P>
   By next March, the FAA plans to accept delivery of a network of
receivers on the ground that will be used to help reduce the margin
of error in the Global Positioning System. The system should start
in about a year and be fully operational by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That system, accurate to about 20 feet over the continental
United States, is called the Wide Area Augmentation System. Later,
the FAA plans a Local Area Augmentation System, with ground-based
receivers calculating errors and broadcasting a correction factor
over an area of a few square miles, that would be accurate enough
to guide planes to runways in near-zero visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The local augmentation system would be far cheaper than existing
instrument landing systems, and a single unit could provide
guidance for all the runways within several miles. Existing
instrument landing systems are good for only a single runway.
</P>
<P>
   Global positioning would also eventually replace radar. Planes
carrying GPS receivers would know their location to within a few
feet, and broadcast that to all other planes and to controllers on
the ground. And it is a crucial part of a new system for avoiding
crashes into mountains, with an instrument that continuously
compares the plane's position and route against a database of the
world's mountains.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 planes, most of them small private aircraft,
already use GPS for navigation. The FAA has given only limited
approval for the system's use in airliners, mostly over ocean
routes, where there is no ground-based beacon system.
</P>
<P>
   One possible back-up is a radio-based navigation system called
Loran-C, maintained by the Coast Guard for ships and widely used by
private planes, but the Transportation Department is planning to
replace that, with GPS. Congress has directed the Transportation
Department to study Loran's future.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joseph Canny, the deputy assistant secretary for transportation
policy at the Transportation Department, said in a telephone
interview that when the FAA decided to pursue the wide area
augmentation system, ``an important part of the cost justification
is that they would expect when that system is in place, to be able
to phase out a substantial part of the ground-based systems.
</P>
<P>
   But officials are now saying that they may, in fact, have to
maintain at least part of the existing system, or develop an
entirely new back-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues on the table is whether we would need some
sort of backup system,'' said Daniel Salvano, the FAA's acting
director for the Office of Communication, Navigation and
Surveillance Systems. ``We haven't finalized our position.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, even if GPS cannot suffice alone, it must be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of countries are moving towards satellite systems,'' he
said, and if the Untied States does not do the same, ``we will have
the potential of having different types of equipment on board our
aircraft that fly internationally, and when they fly into our
airspace, they will have to have different equipment.''

UTILITIES SUFFER HUGE LOSSES AS DEMAND SURGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ill., Ore.)  (lb) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Midwestern utilities, Firstenergy Corp. and Illinova, said
Monday that they had suffered huge losses from having to buy power
on the open market during the recent heat wave when prices surged.
The companies said the losses would result in much lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other utilities have also reported large losses after they were
caught short on supplies of electricity when a heat wave swept the
Midwest late last month, causing a surge in demand. The utilities
had to scramble to find extra supplies from other regions or be
forced to black out some of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities turned to a young market that trades electricity
as contracts in crude oil and other commodities are traded. But the
heavy demand drove spot prices for electricity as high as $7,000 a
megawatt-hour; the price range is usually from $30 to $50 a
megawatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Prices went up also because of a default by a major trader of
power, Federal Energy Sales of Rocky River, Ohio. The default made
some utilities that had extra power to sell reluctant to enter the
open market, tightening supplies further because they feared that
other traders could also default on power contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As deregulation has begun to take hold, many utilities have set
up units to trade electricity contracts. Utilities, however, are
clearly still learning about the risks. Some utilities have asked
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the
industry, to see why prices went up so much and so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Firstenergy, which is based in Akron, Ohio, said it expected
that second-quarter earnings would be reduced by $53 million, or 24
cents a share, mostly from trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it had set aside $27 million for bad debts
that could result from a contract with suppliers that had defaulted
on delivering power in the June heat wave. It added that it might
also be forced to cut its dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Illinova, which is based in Decatur, Ill., said it might break
even or post a loss for this year because it was forced to buy the
high-priced power. The company had been expected to earn about
$1.70 a share according to analysts surveyed by IBES International.
The company plans to take charges of $113 million for the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Altenbaumer, the chief financial officer of Illinova,
said that the company would pay its 31-cents-a-share dividend
scheduled for August but that it was reviewing whether to pay
dividends for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities joined other companies that said their earnings
would be lower because of trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificcorp, a utility based in Portland, Ore., said its
earnings for the second quarter would be 30 percent below
estimates.

ADVERTISING: SELLING BASEBALL _ WITH A SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As major-league baseball heads into the All-Star Game on Tuesday
night, an agency that specializes in selling with a smile is
seeking to help the sport improve its image.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners, the New York shop that is expert in
humorous campaigns, has introduced a series of offbeat commercials
for the ``Game of the Week'' baseball broadcasts on Saturday
afternoons on the Fox network. The slapstick spots _ infused with
the wacky perspective and odd, cartoon-like characters that are
Freeman mainstays _ come after the agency won several prestigious
awards for an off-kilter television campaign to promote Fox's
coverage of National Hockey League games.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign attempting to ``Freemanize'' baseball is appearing
amid indications that the sport's imperiled state may be improving
after years of labor problems and diminished interest among younger
fans. The trade publication Mediaweek reported this week that
ratings for national broadcast and cable TV baseball games were
rising, fueled by growing interest in interleague play, the race to
break Roger Maris' single-season home run record and strong
performances by widely followed teams like the Atlanta Braves and
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game now has some momentum behind it,'' said Neal Tiles,
senior vice president for marketing at the Fox Sports division of
Fox Broadcasting Co., a unit of News Corp. in Century City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task for hockey was to position it as a sports fan's kind
of sport,'' he added, while for baseball the goals are to ``break
through with a highly creative message'' and ``differentiate the
Fox Saturday game to make it seem special.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was selected for the assignment, Tiles said, because the
agency, by taking ``creative risks in a strategic way,'' produces
results for marketers like Little Caesars pizza and Staples that
``are not tremendous advertising spenders.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the awards that Freeman won for the NHL campaign haven't
hurt. Those honors included a Gold Lion at the 45th annual
International Advertising Festival in Cannes, France; the Grand
Clio for television work at the 39th Clio Awards presentation, and
two silvers at the D&AMP;AD show in London, rare kudos for an American
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The hockey commercials presented hilarious glimpses into a
parallel universe where basketball, squash, bowling, billiards and
golf ``would be better'' if they were played like hockey. For
instance, the basketball spot featured play-by-play coverage of a
college game in which a goalie was perched atop the net to prevent
rival players from sinking baskets. And the bowling spot showed a
bowler knocking down an opponent before he could make game-winning
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Fox gave us a whole lot of instruction in
creating the hockey commercials,'' said Cliff Freeman, chairman and
chief creative officer at Freeman, a unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC,
other than ``to try to get hockey fans to be more aware of the
broadcasts on Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   For baseball, he added, the assignment was ``a little more
specific,'' promoting such features of the Fox coverage as camera
shots from the catcher's perspective and enhanced sound, which
``give a visceral feeling of being inside the game'' in order to
``heighten the drama'' _ an attribute that many fans have believed
was sorely lacking during recent seasons plagued by strikes and
instances of what were widely perceived as player and owner greed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the idea was to make baseball more exciting, Freeman
replied: ``I'm not sure how much that was in the back of our minds,
but it probably was. The Fox broadcast features have juiced up the
whole experience of the game, to make it more like you're there.
Baseball at its best is very exciting, but people say that a lot of
the time there isn't that feeling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And feeling is at the center of the Freeman baseball
commercials, as in feeling sore, dazed or battered. Each spot shows
baseball fans performing dangerous stunts meant to duplicate plays
by stars like Brady Anderson, Bernie Williams and Randy Johnson.
Though the action is clearly in the vein of the Three Stooges or
``Dumb and Dumber,'' as a cautionary note each commercial ends with
the words ``Don't try it at home'' superimposed on screen.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, a man climbs a ladder to reach a rope that he uses
to swing into the side of a barn. After he grunts in pain, his
friend declares, ``That sounded like Anderson.'' At that point,
footage from a Fox baseball broadcast appears, presenting Anderson,
a Baltimore Orioles outfielder, crashing into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   In a second spot, a man crouches behind a horse as his friend
slaps the horse on the rump. The horse, being a horse, knocks the
first man down, of course, at which point the friend says, ``That,
uh, looked like the foul tip into Rodriguez.'' The spot then cuts
to footage from a game in which Ivan Rodriguez, the Texas Rangers
catcher, is dinged by a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The other stunts include a man falling after being hit by a
shopping cart filled with cement blocks, to duplicate how a catcher
feels when Williams, the Yankee outfielder, knocks him down at home
plate, and a man falling after being hit by a baseball thrown from
a moving pickup truck, to duplicate the force of a fastball tossed
by Johnson, the Seattle Mariners pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so over the top,'' Freeman says of the simulated
violent acts in each commercial, which were produced by using stunt
performers ``and some camera tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiles said that the spots would run during various Fox prime
time, sports and children's programs as well as on a cable sibling,
the Fox Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   More commercials are planned, he added, as Fox is ``working with
Cliff again for postseason baseball coverage, straight on through
to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like extra innings for the stunt performers.

JASPER GRAND JURY INDICTS WHITE SUSPECTS IN DRAGGING DEATH OF BLACK
MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Three white men were indicted Monday on capital
murder charges alleging they kidnapped a 49-year-old black man and
dragged him to his death behind a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of James Byrd Jr. early June 7 brought international
attention to this East Texas town of 8,000. On Monday, the Jasper
County grand jury issued two indictments, one naming Bill King, 23,
of Jasper and Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs, the other
naming Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said it is ``pretty likely''
prosecutors will seek a death sentence for King and Brewer. He said
Berry may be spared in exchange for his testimony against the other
two. Capital murder carries a sentence of either death or life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In chilling affidavits filed in the case so far, investigators
have said Berry told them that Brewer and King beat Byrd, kicked
him, sprayed his face with black paint and chained him by the
ankles to the back of Berry's pickup, then dragged him almost three
miles along country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Byrd's head and right arm were ripped from his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Monday that reports from the FBI lab in Washington
backed up ``some parts'' of Berry's story.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date was set, but Gray said it would likely be early
next year by the time defense attorneys finish having their experts
look at the mounds of forensic evidence police have gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer and King could be tried together, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The three men have been held without bond in the Jasper County
Jail since they were arrested the night after Byrd was killed.
State District Judge Joe Bob Golden is expected to appoint new
attorneys for King and Brewer because earlier court-appointed
attorneys aren't certified to try capital cases. No Jasper County
attorneys are certified to try capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont attorney Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn said Berry hired
him Friday to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said that although Byrd was dragged behind Berry's
truck, Berry ``had nothing to do'' with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just there,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said he would like Berry to be tried in Jasper, adding
that Berry's friends and relatives raised the money to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an excellent chance of him being found not
guilty,'' Hawthorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who early on said Berry's testimony against the other two
men would be important to the cases against them, said Monday that
he wants to look at more forensic lab results before considering if
he will seek the death penalty for Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very pleased with the results we've gotten so
far,'' Gray said of the lab results. ``Obviously, our evidence has
improved significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   A multi-agency task force headed by the FBI has been
investigating the crime and is still at work, Sheriff Billy Rowles
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one FBI agent appeared before the grand jury Monday.
Rowles and several of his investigators also appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury of four men and eight women _ two of them black _
spent less than three hours hearing testimony before voting to
indict the three men.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of local black citizens joined reporters at the
courthouse waiting for the grand jury to return the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to see that justice is done,'' said Paul Beaty,
44, who added that he doesn't think African-Americans always get
justice in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jury trial will show if there's justice in Jasper,''
District Attorney Gray said later.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities earlier said they hoped to file federal
charges on the suspects. But Gray said that as the cases evolved it
became apparent that it would be better to charge them under state
capital murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors will assist him during the trials, Gray
said, adding that if any one of the trio is acquitted, federal
charges may be filed later.
</P>
<P>
   The trials, along with that of another Jasper man indicted for
capital murder Monday in an unrelated case, could cost Jasper
County a total of $1 million, Gray said. The cost would go up
significantly if pretrial publicity causes the trials to be moved
out of Jasper, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there will have to be an increase in taxes,'' Gray
said. ``We'll do what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray hopes the trials will be in Jasper, but he said defense
attorneys may try to have them moved. Judge Golden will make the
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying's massive publicity has been a ``distraction,'' but
the case has otherwise been handled like other capital murder cases
in Jasper County, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and Gray have been deluged with calls and
interview requests by hundreds of news agencies, including
reporters from as far away as New Zealand and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   When 25 members of various Ku Klux Klan groups and 50 members of
New Black Panther and other black dissident organizations appeared
in Jasper on June 27, they were surrounded by at least 200
reporters and cameramen.

MEXICO'S RULING PARTY RETAKES CHIHUAHUA IN SYMBOLIC VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: Subs 5th and 6th graphs to add name of the PRD candidate in
Zacatecas, Ricardo Monreal Avila, and background about him, and the
Chihuahua race.)   (fb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico _ Mexico's governing party, which has seemed
in retreat before a rising opposition tide, has swept to one of its
most important triumphs, electing a former businessman to the
governorship of Chihuahua and for the first time recovering a state
that had been controlled by rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Sunday's Chihuahua elections, announced on Monday,
was the second stinging defeat in a year for National Action, the
pro-business party known as the PA, which had governed Chihuahua
since 1992 and which some had seen as the opposition's best chance
to win the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission accomplished!'' Patricio Martinez Garcia, Chihuahua's
governor-elect from President Ernesto Zedillo's party, known as the
PRI, said in a victory news conference on Monday. ``We've
triumphed. We've recovered Chihuahua.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI split the results in two other northern states where
there was gubernatorial balloting, winning easily in Durango, where
the opposition vote was divided among three candidates, and losing
in a more closely-watched election in neighboring Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   The Zacatecas vote gave an important lift to Mexico's leftist
opposition party, whose victorious candidate, Ricardo Monreal
Avila, was a PRI legislative leader who defected to the Party of
the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, this year after having been
passed over for the governing party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Monreal, 41, owes little to the PRD. He won election largely as
a result of his own carefully constructed personal political
organization, and how closely he will work with PRD leaders in
governing his state remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In Chihuahua, Martinez, 50, a real estate executive who first
ran for office in 1992, winning election as mayor of the state's
capital, also appears quite likely to develop an unusually
independent relationship with the PRI, whose governors have until
recently been handpicked by successive Mexican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But his victory more than compensated for the governing party's
loss in Zacatecas. Chihuahua, which borders western Texas and New
Mexico, is one of the fastest-growing industrial states in Mexico.
The governing party's victory there is laden with extra
significance, because the state has often functioned as a
Californi-esque harbinger of political experimentation and change
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN's rise from a marginal party of conservative Catholic
ideologues began with victories in Chihuahua towns and cities in
the early 1980s, including the election of Francisco Barrio as
Ciudad Juarez's mayor in 1983. In 1992 gubernatorial voting here,
Barrio became only the second opposition figure ever to win control
of a Mexican statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now the PRI's victory here has reversed Chihuahua's symbolism.
Making the damage worse, the PAN candidate, Ramon Galindo, said
repeatedly during the campaign that ``the battle for Chihuahua is
the battle for Mexico,'' suggesting that a victory by the PRI here
would complicate the opposition's quest to wrest the presidency
from the PRI for the first time in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo acknowledged his defeat on Monday in a moist-eyed news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Corral, a federal congressman from Chihuahua who is the
spokesman for the PAN's national executive committee and who
accompanied Galindo in his news conference, laid his party's defeat
to a slander campaign in which the PRI told voters that the PAN
intended to dismantle Chihuahua's public schools, forcing poor
families to pay for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI waged a dirty war, systematically distorting our
party's image through a campaign of insults and false
accusations,'' Corral said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, Barrio, now a lame-duck governor, took a more
philosophical approach in a meeting with reporters in the Chihuahua
governor's palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even defeats can be opportunities if you know how to take
advantage of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN's defeat appears to end any chance that Barrio might run
for president. Instead, the Chihuahua elections strengthen the
likelihood that the PAN will pick as its presidential candidate
Vicente Fox, the governor of the central state of Guanajuato, who
began campaigning in earnest for the job early this year. But
Barrio refused to rule anything out of his own future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to identify things to improve and change about our
party,'' Barrio said. ``Today's defeats can be the germs of
tomorrow's victories.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Aziz Nassif, a professor who has written two books about
Chihuahua politics, seconded Barrio's call for introspection within
the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PAN needs to do some self-criticism,'' Aziz said,
describing Galindo as a lackluster candidate with a weak record as
Mayor of Ciudad Juarez. ``They need to seriously examine how they
pick their candidates and how they develop their image.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, Aziz said, ``has shown they are capable of learning
from their mistakes and adapting to new situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Zarate Flores, the editor of a Mexican political
newsletter, agreed. ``These elections prove that its too early to
announce the PRI's funeral,'' Zarate said. ``Now we see that when
the PRI combines an attractive candidate and good marketing with
its efficient political machinery, they can win elections.''

AFTER 92 HOLES, PAK WINS HER SECOND MAJOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ It finally ended on the 20th playoff hole. It was
the longest U.S. Women's Open ever, and one of the most dramatic, a
compelling championship duel between two remarkable 20-year-olds
seeking their place in their sport's history. And while Se Ri Pak's
victory firmly established her as a new force in women's golf, the
performance of Jenny Chuasiriporn, who nearly became the second
amateur to win the Women's Open, was extraordinary in its own
right.
</P>
<P>
   Making an 18-foot birdie putt on the second hole of sudden
death, Pak finally vanquished Chuasiriporn to become the youngest
Women's Open champion ever. After the winning putt dropped,
breaking a tie at 2 over par through 19 playoff holes, the normally
stoic Pak burst into tears, as her father, Joon-Chul Pak, ran onto
the 11th green to embrace her.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional victory lifted Pak, a South Korean who is the
fourth straight foreign winner of the Open, into lofty company.
Having won the McDonald's LPGA Championship in May, Pak became the
first rookie to win two majors in the same year since Juli Inkster
in 1984. Pak is the first woman to win back-to-back majors since
Meg Mallon in 1991, and the first woman to win two majors in the
same year since Laura Davies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she believed that she was the No. 1 player in the
world, Pak laughed and said: ``No, not yet. But good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue? In her rookie season on the LPGA tour, Pak
moved to fourth on the money list ($525,170) with Monday's $267,500
first-place check. With accurate driving, superb iron play and
admirable cool under pressure, Pak has arrived as someone capable
of winning major championships far more quickly than even she
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Pak did not start playing golf until 1989, but she developed
rapidly, winning numerous tournaments in South Korea before moving
to Orlando, Fla., last year to work with renowned golf teacher
David Leadbetter. Pak earned her tour card at qualifying school
last fall, and she has already earned a reputation as one of the
tour's hardest-working players, often spending hours on the
practice range after her round is over.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when Pak struggles to understand questions
during interviews, but her command of English has improved greatly
since last year. And when asked if winning two majors in the same
year put her ahead of schedule, Pak gave an insightful answer. ``My
sponsor, they, like, really surprised,'' she said. ``Maybe they get
me more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chuasiriporn, who will turn 21 on Thursday, delivered
an admirable performance, nearly joining Catherine LaCoste, won won
the Open as an amateur in 1967. Chuasiriporn, whose parents are
originally from Thailand, was gracious in defeat, but as she
prepares for her senior year at Duke University, she will remember
two key miscues from Monday: a triple bogey on No. 6 after she had
built a four-stroke lead, and then a missed 15-foot putt for par on
No. 18 that could have won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt it slip away there,'' Chuasiriporn said of her
putt for par at No. 18. ``I thought I was going to do it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another thing to build my game and my confidence.
I am pretty satisfied with the way I handled it. I guess I really
feel like I am going to win one, so I am really not too
disappointed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Pak looks like a player who will have other titles in her
future, none may test her more than Monday's. She survived 92 holes
of grueling golf _ four 18-hole rounds, an 18-hole playoff and two
sudden-death holes _ on a challenging Blackwolf Run course that was
among the toughest layouts in Open history. And Monday, she
overcame a four-stroke deficit after five holes, as well as a poor
tee shot on the par-4 18th hole that forced her to remove her socks
and shoes and hit her second shot off a steep bank while standing
in a water hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, that recovery shot typified Pak's determination,
and it was a turning point. Pak and Chuasiriporn reached the 18th
green tied at one over par, but after Pak pulled her tee shot into
the hazard, Chuasiriporn hit her second shot onto the fringe of the
green, only about 50 feet from the hole. Pak was in deep trouble,
with no chance to reach the green from the bank, while Chuasiriporn
was in solid position to make a par. So instead of opting to take a
drop out of the water hazard, which would have cost her a penalty
stroke, Pak elected to play the ball from where it was, even though
she faced an extremely difficult shot.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off. The crowd cheered when Pak removed her
shoes, cheered again when she removed her socks, and cheered again
when she hit a difficult wedge shot, over the 6-foot-high bank,
across the fairway and into the rough on the right-hand side. Still
about 138 yards from the green, Pak then hit a solid 8-iron to
within about 17 feet of the pin. But Chuasiriporn still had the
edge. From the fringe, she hit a chip shot about 15 feet past the
hole, and then Pak left her 17-foot putt for par more than a foot
short.
</P>
<P>
   That left Chuasiriporn with a 15-foot putt at No. 18 for the
victory. After the sensational 35-foot putt she made at No. 18 on
Sunday to get into the playoff, most people expected her to make
this one, including Pak. ``I thought she make that par putt,'' Pak
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuasiriporn pushed the putt just a little, and it slid past
the hole. ``I thought I had that putt, but my hands were shaking a
lot,'' Chuasiriporn said.
</P>
<P>
   So the battle continued, the first time a Women's Open had ever
reached sudden death. Both players made par at the first sudden
death hole, the par-5, 564-yard No. 10, as they both missed birdie
attempts of more than 20 feet. But at the par-4, 374-yard No. 11,
it finally ended.
</P>
<P>
   After both players reached the green in two shots, Chuasiriporn
missed a birdie attempt from about 18 feet, then watched helplessly
as Pak lined up her final putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had a sixth-sense feeling she would make it,''
Chuasiriporn said.
</P>
<P>
   So after many holes, and many anxious moments, Pak had won
another major, and there was no doubt she had earned it. ``I am
really happy,'' Pak said. ``That is why I cry.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Only 16 new cases of people sickened by eating raw
Galveston Bay oysters were reported over the weekend, leading
health officials to hope the record-setting outbreak is tapering
off.
</P>
<P>
   The latest count showed 316 cases of the flulike diarrheal
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Though harvesting of oysters in Galveston Bay stopped June 25
after illnesses were first linked to the shell fish contaminated by
the bacteria, ``Vibrio parahaemolyticus,'' the count had been
leaping upward by more than 50 new cases a day.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Health spokesman Doug McBride said Monday
that he thought the voluntary recall by oyster houses may be
starting to have an effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're no longer accepting illness reports over our
800-telephone number in Austin,'' he said. ``Instead, we're
directing those who think a raw oyster made them sick to call their
local health department who will then report it to us. I'm sure
we'll probably get a few more calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak last week surpassed the national record of 209 set
last summer by illnesses from contaminated oysters harvested in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking kills the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Texas supplies more than half the oysters eaten raw in the
nation, and the reports of illnesses from Galveston Bay oysters
came from three states in addition to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the 316 total are 248 cases from Texas, 53 from Florida, 12
from Oklahoma and three from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   One fatality was reported in the Pacific Northwest outbreak last
year. None has been recorded so far from the Galveston Bay outbreak
although ``three or four people have been hospitalized,'' McBride
said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the bacteria causes flulike symptoms that last up
to seven days and are not life-threatening unless the sick person
has an immune-deficiency disorder. Symptoms include diarrhea,
abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, vomiting and headache.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oyster fishermen are awaiting lab reports on water, soil and
meat samples taken from the oyster reefs in Galveston Bay to
determine the cause of the trouble and how long it might last.
</P>
<P>
   The health department hopes to have those results by Wednesday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria is always present, even in the cleanest waters of
the world, but usually not in quantities that would make anyone
sick. Because of that, state officials want to know what triggered
the outbreak, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that the extreme heat and drought conditions in
Texas caused the bacteria to become more plentiful, while another
is that a heartier, more virulent strain of that bacteria has
developed.

 A Milelong Bridge Links Danish Islands  
 Swollen Rivers Prompt Concern in California   
 Music and Dance Staged in Paris Parks  
 Historic Lighthouse To Open in Atlantic City  
 Rethinking a Landmark in Marrakesh

<P>
   In English, it is called the Great Belt. In Danish, it is
Storebaelt. It opened on June 14, incorporating the second-longest
suspension bridge in the world and linking east and west Denmark by
automobile, replacing ferry services that once carried visitors
between Halsskov on the island of Sealand and Knudshoved on Funen
and cutting travel time by approximately an hour, not counting
waiting for a ferry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 5,350 feet, the East Bridge, which is part of an 11-mile
bridge and tunnel, is surpassed only by the 6,500-foot-long
Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan, which opened in April. The Golden
Gate Bridge, now ranked seventh in the world, spans 4,200 feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rail link across the Great Belt opened a year ago; about
20,000 train passengers a day now make the trip. The project took
10 years to complete at a cost of about $4.3 billion. Automobile
traffic is expected to begin at about 10,000 cars a day, rising to
17,000 in 2001. The one-way toll for a car is about $31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 9.3-mile connection for trains and cars, called the Oresund
Fixed Link, is under construction between Copenhagen and Malmo,
Sweden, and is scheduled to open in 2000. It will consist of a
4.8-mile bridge, a 2.5-mile artificial island and a 2-mile tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another example of El Nino's lingering ill effects, the
California Department of Boating and Waterways issued a safety
advisory on June 22 warning that the state's rivers are colder,
faster and carrying more debris than normal this summer because of
the melting of a record Sierra Nevada snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory was prompted by the deaths of nine rafters on
swollen central and northern California rivers _ including the
American, Cosumnes and Yuba Rivers _ in a one-week period. Three
were on commercial trips accompanied by trained whitewater guides
and six on private outings without professional assistance. (Two
rafters on air mattresses were also killed last month, and a
kayaker drowned in February.)
</P>
<P>
   The highest number of California whitewater deaths for an entire
season is 12, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Standard, a department spokeswoman, said some California
rivers were carrying up to seven times the normal volume of water
for this time of year. Additionally, cool spring weather delayed
the snow melt, causing water temperatures to be much colder than
usual and increasing the chance of hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Although state water officials believe the Sierra runoff has
peaked, this year's massive snowpack means that full rivers, and
the need for extra caution, will extend well into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're at the most expert level,'' said James Bailey, a
state hydrologist and experienced river kayaker and rafter, ``take
lessons or go with a guide. It's a great year for rafting, but do
it with a pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the Paris Quartier d'Ete performing-arts festival
peppers the city's monuments and gardens with music, dance and
theater performances. The festival's ninth edition begins on Sunday
at 7 p.m. with a free concert by Ju Percussions from Taiwan in the
Jardin des Tuileries. On July 25 at 6 p.m., the Tuileries will be
the site of a Jidai-Matsuri, a traditional parade from Kyoto with a
display of kimonos and re-enactments of events in Japan's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Palais Royal will be the venue for dance on July 20 to 23,
including the contemporary French choreographer Jean-Claude
Gallota, at 10 p.m. Tickets are $17.75.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th arrondissement's futuristic Parc Andre Citroen,
France's Orchestre National will give a free performance of
Beethoven's Seventh Symphony on July 25 at 9 p.m. Pierre Henry, the
French composer and interpreter of ``musique concrete,''
inaugurates a series of performances on July 21 with his ``Symphony
for a Lone Man'' at the Thermes de Cluny.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz will take over the 16th-century Hotel d'Albret on the Rue
des Francs-Bourgeois from July 27 to Aug. 2, including performances
by the saxophonist Michael Brecker July 27, and the accordionist
Richard Galliano with Michel Portal, clarinetist, July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Jardin du Luxembourg will rock to the sound of world music
groups such as Ongo Trogode, who play huge Banda horns from the
Central African Republic July 23 to 25, Cuarteto Cedron from
Argentina July 27 to 29, Burundi Drums Aug. 9; all at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A giant tepee built in front of the Centre Georges Pompidou for
the duration of its renovation will be the setting for theater
performances including ``Barboni'' by Pippo Delbono, an Italian
Teatro Commedia dell'Arte company.

   The 170-foot-tall Absecon Lighthouse in Atlantic City, which was
first lighted in 1857, is scheduled to reopen by the end of the
month (the exact date has not yet been determined). Visitors will
be able to climb the tower's 228 steps and walk outside on the
balcony (or gallery, in the lighthouse lexicon) to view the city
and nearby Brigantine beach.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse's original first-order Fresnel lens, the most
powerful of the French-manufactured lighthouse lenses, will be on
display at the top of the tower. The lens was powerful enough to
project the light up to 20 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Inlet Public-Private Association, a nonprofit corporation,
directed the $2.6-million restoration of the lighthouse, which had
been closed for 15 years. The tower's exterior has been repainted
yellow and black to reflect its appearance from 1925 to 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to tour the interior of the newly
reconstructed lighthouse keeper's house, rebuilt on the foundations
of the original residence. Plans for the keeper's house include a
visitor center with exhibits and a museum shop. The lighthouse and
keeper's house, on Pacific Avenue between Rhode Island and Vermont
Avenues, will be open Thursday through Monday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
year round. Admission is $4 for adults (including admission for one
child), $1 for children. Information: (609) 449-1360.

   La Maison Arabe in Marrakesh, a near-legendary restaurant that
closed a decade ago, was reborn this year. But this time it's a
hotel. A charming and beautifully decorated collection of 11 rooms
meanders through the two buildings that housed the restaurant on a
side street in the Medina (old city). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations, all different, range from a small room with
a queen-size bed and a private patio to large bedrooms with living
room and terrace dripping oleander and bougainvillea on the top
floor, affording a view of the city. All have sleek marble
bathrooms furnished with thick towels and bathrobes.
</P>
<P>
   The public areas, filled with antiques and artifacts, are
ornamented with carved cedar and plaster in typical Moroccan style.
The staff members wear traditional Moroccan dress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new hotel is more elaborate than the famous namesake
restaurant, which was the first in the Medina to serve fine
Moroccan food while catering to Europeans when it opened in 1947.
The restaurant was owned by Suzy Larochette, who came to Marrakesh
for health reasons with her mother and sister in 1938; they were
stranded there when World War II broke out. Through her well-placed
contacts, she got the pasha of Marrakesh, Si Thami el Glaoui, to
provide a chef for the restaurant from his entourage. In its
heyday, the restaurant welcomed such notables as Winston Churchill
and the Aga Khan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a French-Italian entrepreneur, Fabrizio
Ruspoli, and his partner, Philippe Cluzel, started talking with Ms.
Larochette who, though nearly 90, is as feisty, opinionated and
stylish as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed classy,'' Ms. Larochette said of Ruspoli.
</P>
<P>
   She sold them the two houses but made them agree not to put in a
restaurant because she lives in an adjacent house and did not want
the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, those who stay at La Maison Arabe will get an early
wake-up from the 5 a.m. call to prayer over loudspeakers from the
Bab Doukkala mosque across the alley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   La Maison Arabe, 1 Derb Assehbe-Bab Doukkala, Marrakesh;
telephone (212-4) 39-12-33, fax (212-4) 44-37-15. Rooms range from
$139 to $266 from June 14 through Dec. 9 and $181 to $320 the rest
of the year, including breakfast and afternoon Moroccan tea.
</P>
<P>
   Most rooms are air-conditioned; all have heating and cable
television.

TO HASTEN APPEAL, REPORTER ADMITS VIOLATING CHILD-PORN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A veteran radio reporter pleaded guilty in federal
court on Monday to violating the nation's child pornography laws,
saying he did so to hasten his appeal that he was trafficking in
lewd photos of minors on the Internet as part of his First
Amendment right to research an article on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Larry Matthews, a freelance journalist who works
for National Public Radio and public television in Maryland, was
scheduled to go on trial in suburban Maryland on Tuesday on 15
counts of using his computer to trade images of under-age girls
engaged in various sexual acts with other minors and adults. But
his lawyer, Michael V. Statham, said that a ruling by the trial
judge last week dealt a fatal blow to Matthews' chances and made it
pointless to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Alexander Williams Jr. ruled that Matthews could not use
the First Amendment's guarantee of an unfettered press as a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A press pass is not a license to break the law,'' Williams
ruled, adding that Matthews would not even be allowed to suggest to
the jury that he was a journalist whose motive was to expose
aspects of the child pornography trade on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Matthews had broadcast a three-part series on the
subject of Internet child pornography on a local Washington radio
station. He said in court papers that he had hoped to use the
information he was acquiring to write a magazine article, although
he did not offer evidence that he had communicated with any
publication about arranging to sell such an article.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, 54, pleaded guilty to one count of receiving lewd
images of minors and one count of transmitting such images; the
plea came in an agreement with prosecutors that allowed him to
appeal. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 11, after which his
lawyers may seek to have Williams' ruling overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' lawyers had argued that the only way for their client
to penetrate the secretive world of fanciers of child-pornography
was to pretend to be one himself. Many transactions in that world,
they argued, occur in private chat rooms where people are
hard-pressed to win the confidence of suspicious players. Williams
said, however, that there were ways to scrutinize the world of
child pornography without breaking the law including interviewing
law-enforcement officials. Matthews' lawyers had argued that such a
method would only provide a government-approved version of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the second half of 1996, Matthews engaged in a brisk
trade of child pornography over the Internet. As often happens in
such cases, one of the people with whom Matthews corresponded was
not a child pornography trader as advertised but a federal agent
trolling cyberspace to snare people who were violating the federal
law against such traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, then under investigation, declared he also was not
what he seemed. He was, he said, just researching an article he
hoped to write about whether child pornography was as easily
available as its critics contended and how well it was policed. The
Justice Department said that such an explanation did not matter and
Matthews was indicted in July 1997. Moreover, the prosecutors in
suburban Maryland asserted that they were convinced that Matthews
was not researching a news article but was just using that as an
excuse to send and receive illicit materials.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews operated under such Web names as ``Mr. Mature'' and
``Dd4SubFem.'' When FBI agents raided his home in Silver Spring,
Md., in 1996, they found two images of prepubescent girls on his
computer's hard drive. They then subjected Matthews' computer to a
sophisticated search and found many more such images he had tried
to delete.
</P>
<P>
   The federal child pornography laws are themselves an unusual
exception to traditional First Amendment theory and practice that
generally allows people to possess and consume any information no
matter how offensive it may be to the government or others. In the
case of child pornography, however, the Supreme Court has ruled
that there is a legitimate government interest in outlawing its
possession because it creates a market that inevitably requires the
exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1982 ruling upholding a New York state law, the court
raised the possibility that there might be legitimate exceptions of
``serious literary, scientific, or educational value.''

 &HT;    A few All-Stars are glad personal nightmares are behind them
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Understandably, the starting left side of the National
League infield seemed distracted on Monday, seemed less than fully
engaged in festivities on the eve of the All-Star Game. Walt Weiss,
the shortstop, had a dazed look on his face. Chipper Jones, the
third baseman, had a weary tone in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   All around them in the clubhouse, their fellow all-stars were on
top of the world, laughing, smiling, chatting about nothing more
significant than whether that big guy over there _ Mark McGwire _
might hit 62 homers this summer. Weiss and Jones weren't ready to
join the party.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Braves teammates are thankful to be here _ Weiss as an
all-star for the first time in an 11-year career (''I had given up
on ever making it'') and Jones as a starter for the first time in
three all-star appearances. But they're spent, emotionally,
mentally, from the recent traumas in their families' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Coors Field Monday afternoon, Weiss _ a former
Colorado Rockie _ had taken his 3-year-old son to the family's
Denver pediatrician. ''Brody's petrified of doctors right now,
afraid he'll get poked again,'' Weiss said. ''So the doctor said,
'He's looking fine. Let's wait until later in the week for more
blood work.''' The kid has won the battle against E. coli, but he
remains weak and will be checked twice a week for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a reminder every day now of what's important,'' said
Weiss, occupying his old locker in the Rockies' clubhouse. ''What
he's been through . . . trivializes the game.'' And then the
consummate professional ballplayer sought, unnecessarily, to
clarify: ''Not to say the game is trivial. It is not trivial. It's
important to me, being my first All-Star Game and, who knows, maybe
my last. When I'm on the field, my obligation is to my team. But
when you've dealt with life and death, it gives the game a new
spin.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he told of Brody's reaction when it was explained to
him what made him sick: ''He was almost apologetic for swallowing
the pool water. We told him, 'No, no, it's not your fault.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows his recent trauma doesn't compare to Weiss', but
that makes it no less real. The ravaging wildfires in Florida were
approaching his parents' and grandparents' side-by-side houses; the
family's cherished belongings, including the framed jersey that
Jones wore in the '95 World Series, had been removed. But the fire
was stopped 200 yards from the houses, which are out of immediate
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few days ago,'' Jones said, ''I was debating whether to even
come out here; I was comtemplating missing a couple of games of the
Mets series (last weekend). I wanted to go home. Not that there is
anything I could do, but if my house was burning down, my family
would need me. I know I had trouble focusing on the field, and I
can't imagine going through what Walt did.''
</P>
<P>
   Come tonight's All-Star Game, both Weiss' son and Jones' parents
will be at Coors Field. And, eyes brightening, Jones expressed hope
that the night will prove thereapeutic for both families. ''Who
knows?'' he said. ''Maybe something special will happen out
there.''

DEATH OF ROY ROGERS IS EVERYBODY'S LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
And LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He shined shoes in Ohio, sold magazines in Missouri and chopped
cotton in Texas while working his way toward Hollywood and the slim
chance of stardom. But Roy Rogers more than made it. When he died
on Monday at the age of 86, the nation mourned the loss of a
straight-shooting, singing cowboy legend who embodied everything
decent about the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``He influenced several generations of Americans,'' said Red
Steagall, a cowboy poet and troubadour from Fort Worth, Texas, who
came to know Rogers and his family. ``He was one of those people
who taught us the difference between right and wrong because he
always wore the white hat and he was always in conflict with the
guys in the black hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he always defeated them,'' Steagall said, growing
husky-voiced with emotion as he spoke. ``Good always defeated evil
in all of Roy's productions. It's too bad that so much of our
society today wears gray hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar tributes poured in as news spread about Rogers' death of
congestive heart failure at the California home that he shared with
wife and co-star, Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning six decades in movies, television and
recordings, Rogers was the singing ``King of the Cowboys.'' Rogers
and Evans were among the nation's most recognized and admired
couples, their anthem, Happy Trails to You, among the century's
most beloved songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there will be a lot of sad and grateful Americans,
especially of my generation, because of his career,'' President
Clinton said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rogers' movies that most inspired a teen-ager named Don
Edwards, who eventually followed in the Ohio native's footsteps as
a cowboy singer, and in later years became Rogers' friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy was bigger than life,'' said Edwards, a Weatherford,
Texas, resident who appeared in the recent movie The Horse
Whisperer. ``He had a big influence. He was an icon. My mom and dad
would drop me off at the movie house and they didn't have a problem
with that, me staying all day, because Roy Rogers was preaching the
same things that they were. You were in good hands with Roy in the
movie house...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you kind of sad that he's not here anymore,''
said Edwards, also a country singer based in Fort Worth. ``But
there are a lot of memories, a lot of things on my walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also worked as a Depression-era truck driver and peach
picker, then was a successful country singer with the Sons of the
Pioneers that he helped organize before he landed a $75-a-week job
in 1937 as a singing cowboy at Hollywood's Republic Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a guitar, six-shooter, crinkly-eyed good looks and
shy country charm, Rogers rose in salary and popularity. From 1943
to 1954, he was the top western star at the box office in a
magazine poll of theater operators.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who survives her husband, shared the screen in many of
Rogers' 87 films and a long-running TV series. Rogers' palomino,
Trigger, became a household name. In his performances, Rogers
fought often, but always fairly, and usually shot the gun from the
bad guy's hand, not the bad guy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was and will always be a true western hero,'' said Gene
Autry, Rogers' friend and longtime cowboy rival.
</P>
<P>
   Off-screen, Rogers was described by friends as a gracious and
deeply religious man, someone keenly aware of his straight-shooting
image and ability to influence young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never showed anything on screen that wasn't part of his
personal life,'' Steagall said. ``He was absolutely the most
outstanding person you could imagine. He was very dedicated to his
family, he was strongly convicted in his faith in God, and he
wasn't afraid to tell that to anyone who would listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steagall, like many others who knew Rogers, on Monday recalled
favorite memories of the cowboy star. Steagall took Rogers goose
hunting on his 80th birthday, and a few years ago visited Rogers at
the California museum he and his wife had created near their
California home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he was able, he would greet everyone down in the
lobby of that museum,'' Steagall said. ``That was his big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards recalled meeting Rogers in the 1950s as a star-struck
teen-ager after Rogers' performance in a Boston rodeo. Edwards kept
the program from that rodeo, and had it handy decades later when he
and Rogers were introduced at a western awards program in
California. By then, Edwards had become a successful recording
artist in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been carrying it around for a long time,'' Edwards
recalled. ``He signed it, and I'll never forget this as long as I
live. He wrote `Roy Rogers,' then he stopped and looked up at me.
`Do you mind if I sign Trigger, too?' That just melted my heart and
it went on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Rogers contributed laudatory liner notes to Edwards'
album Happy Cowboy. In 1994, Edwards and several other western
performers joined Rogers on stage at a Tucson, Ariz., western music
festival to sing Happy Trails To You.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking at the time, `Golly, this is probably the
neatest thing I've ever done,' '' Edwards said. ``From being a kid
watching him in a 9-cent movie house, to singing with him on stage
in Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was born Leonard Slye on Nov. 5, 1911, in Cincinnati, but
began the trek to California in 1929. He made his first mark as a
singer in the mid-1930s, co-founding the group that would come to
be known as the Sons of the Pioneers. The group recorded hit
records, such as Tumbling Tumbleweeds and Cool Water, before Rogers
embarked on his movie career.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers replaced Autry as Republic's top cowboy when Autry left
to serve as a flier in the Army Air Forces during World War II.
Rogers was first teamed with Evans, a singer and sometime actress,
in the 1944 film Cowboy and the Senorita.'' They married in 1947,
14 months after the death of his first wife. Evans, born Frances
Octavia Smith in Uvalde, Texas, became known as the ``Queen of the
Cowgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and his wife eventually became well-known for their
religious beliefs and spoke at many religious gatherings, including
some with evangelist Billy Graham. Evans wrote several
inspirational books, including ``Angel Unaware'' about the couple's
daughter, Robin, who was born with Down syndrome and died in 1952
at age 2 of complications from the mumps.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy would continue to plague the family. Debbie, one of the
couple's adopted children, was killed in a church bus crash in
1964. The next year, another adopted child, John, choked to death
in Germany while serving in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, it doesn't say you're going to get by without
having troubles,'' Rogers once said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Rogers is survived by six children or
stepchildren, 15 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren. A
memorial service is planned for Saturday at the Church of the
Valley in Rogers' home of Apple Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child dreamed of being a Roy Rogers or a Dale Evans, but
for people like Don (Edwards) and me, he created a way of life that
we're enjoying now with cowboy music and the image of cowboy
music,'' Steagall said on Monday. ``It's a great personal loss to
everybody who admires Roy and tried to live by the values they
learned from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I didn't see him very often,'' Steagall said, ``I
just figured he'd always be there.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa. _ Having a name that most people
equate with nuclear disaster, Three Mile Island might not seem to
be a choice piece of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   But GPU Inc., the New Jersey utility that owns the plant on an
island in the Susquehanna River, is convinced it can do something
that no other company in the United States has done: sell a used
nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on its curb appeal,'' said Jim Langenbach,
the site director, sounding a little like a homeowner who has just
added a new coat of paint before an open house. ``Pulling weeds,
picking up trash, planting flowers. The real reality has nothing to
do with that, but it doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years have passed since warning sirens blared, schools
closed and more than 100,000 residents fled central Pennsylvania,
afraid of radiation poisoning from the most serious
nuclear-power-plant accident in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the fear has faded, employees here say that when people
find out where they work, they still are asked whether they glow in
the dark. And a visitors' center attracts thousands of people every
year to its observation deck to peer across the Susquehanna River
at the hourglass-shaped cooling towers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the next month, the fortunes of Three Mile Island, whose
mistakes shook public confidence in the nuclear power industry,
could signal its ability to survive the worst adversity. At a time
when many have predicted that nuclear power will not be able to
compete in the increasingly deregulated electricity market, a sale
of Three Mile Island would show that one company, anyway, thinks
atomic energy can turn a profit _ for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   GPU, based in Parsippany, N.J., has had the reactor actively on
the block since December. Fred Hafer, the company's chairman and
chief executive, said in June that he had been negotiating for
months with a prospective buyer, which he declined to identify, and
that he expected to announce a deal by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Only Unit 1, which was not involved in the March 1979 accident,
is for sale. The hulk of Unit 2, from which tons of radioactive
rubble were removed after a partial meltdown of its core, is not
for sale. It will never produce electricity again.
</P>
<P>
   Hafer also hopes to sell the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in
Forked River, N.J., in the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people who follow the industry, including analysts and
nuclear critics, say that Peco Energy Co. of Philadelphia, which
already operates two nuclear plants, both in Pennsylvania, is the
most likely buyer. Peco recently established a joint venture with
British Energy PLC to acquire more nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we can build an even greater competitive
advantage by grouping nuclear units to exploit economy of scale,''
said Jim Waddington, a Peco spokesman, who declined to comment on
whether the company would buy Three Mile Island. Jerry Rainey, who
heads Peco's nuclear division, added, ``I think you'll see a deal
announced in 1998,'' though he also refused to identify the plants
that would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these are complicated deals, and nothing is certain
until a contract is signed, especially the price. Unit 1 is
reportedly worth $600 million, but several factors must be weighed,
and a determination must be made of who is responsible for the
ultimate costs of taking the unit out of service. And even if an
agreement is reached, it would have to be approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the plant is buzzing with the possibility of a
takeover, officials of nearby towns have been notified that a
change of ownership may occur, and Langenbach said he already had
transition plans on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale takes place, Hafer will have succeeded where others
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, a spate of troubled reactors have been
put on the market, but there have been no takers. The owners of one
plant, Maine Yankee in Wiscasset, even created a Web page
(www.buynuclear.com), complete with color photographs, to promote
its sale, but to no avail. The plant was retired instead, though
its equipment is still for sale.
</P>
<P>
   GPU was prompted to divest itself of its nuclear operations by a
new law in Pennsylvania that ends the guaranteed rate structure
that benefited utility monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   It has opted to get out of the business of generating
electricity _ from reactors and all other sources _ and instead
concentrate on transmission.
</P>
<P>
   As more states adopt deregulation laws, other companies are
likely to follow suit. Connecticut, for instance, passed an
electric deregulation law earlier this year that requires the
state's largest power company, Northeast Utilities, to try to
auction off its nuclear reactors by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say there are likely to be more sellers than
buyers, and even some companies that have successfully managed
nuclear plants are wary about adding more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to increase our nuclear exposure,'' said
Randy Wheeless, a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp. of Charlotte,
N.C., which operates seven reactors. ``There's a lot of uncertainty
about how nuclear will be treated in a deregulated environment.
From our standpoint, it may be best to sit and let those questions
be answered.'' Duke, however, hopes to extend the useful life of
existing plants well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that someone would want to buy Three Mile Island has
some local people reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had customers who were just sitting here laughing about
it,'' said Alma Zeager, 42, the owner of Village Homestead, a
nearby restaurant. ``I still don't think it's safe, but I don't
want to move to Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the deal appear promising is that many think that
Unit 1 of Three Mile Island is among the best-run reactors in the
world. As company executives are at pains to point out, there are,
in a sense, two Three Mile Islands, the bad one of 1979 and the
good one of today.
</P>
<P>
   Only a football field away from Unit 2, which will never operate
again, Unit 1 last year completed a continuous run of 616 days and
23 hours, a world record for uninterrupted operation of a
light-water nuclear reactor, the type in commercial use in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the 107 reactors now operating in the United
States are not able to produce electricity as inexpensively as
plants powered by gas, coal and oil, Unit 1 is an example of how
nuclear power can be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   GPU has projected that any power company that has operating
costs of more than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour in the New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland market will be unable to survive, and
Unit 1 comes in at 2.5 cents. That is in stark contrast to Oyster
Creek, for instance, which the company estimates has a cost of 3.7
cents a kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unit has been one of the industry's best performers,''
said Kit Konolige, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. David
Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a watchdog group, said, ``It is very competitive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Plant workers and company executives say that the industry as a
whole, and Unit 1 in particular, learned valuable lessons from the
accident at Unit 2.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred when operators failed to close a pressure
relief valve, allowing a million gallons of cooling water to escape
and causing the radioactive core to reach a temperature as high as
5,000 degrees. If operators had closed the valve and turned on an
emergency cooling system, the accident could have been averted.
</P>
<P>
   But the plant had begun operating only a few months earlier, and
the workers did not comprehend what was happening. They mistakenly
thought that a light on the control panel meant the pressure-relief
valve was shut.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for nuclear power contend that this mistake would not
be made today. They say that the industry now requires more
training, that every reactor has an on-site simulator for practice,
that the number of control-room workers has increased, that
management is required to be more actively involved in daily
operations and that federal regulators have stepped up their
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   And if Unit 1 is sold, the deal will confirm the belief of many
workers that they have overcome the past. ``We were a joke in the
industry,'' said Dave McCurdy, a maintenance supervisor for 29
years. ``This would show that we've come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are people who once fought to close the plant who
now support it. ``I've got to be fair about it,'' Mayor Stephen
Reed of Harrisburg said. ``The plant has made some major
advances.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Unit 1 was closed for six years as the plant revamped
its operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Epstein of Three Mile Island Alert, an anti-nuclear
group, said that improvements were overstated. He noted that only
last year the NRC fined GPU $210,000 for a string of violations,
including inadequate engineering designs and poor implementation of
emergency preparedness programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NRC has an overall favorable impression of Unit 1.
``If you get beyond the image that so many members of the public
have,'' said Neil Sheehan, an NRC spokesman, ``its performance has
been pretty successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the reactor could be sold to Peco troubles Epstein
because of that company's past. In 1987, federal regulators shut
down Peco's Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Delta, Pa., because
operators were found to be sleeping on duty in the control room.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Peco has overhauled its operations, becoming,
according to analysts, a leader in the industry. Peach Bottom was
restarted in 1989, and this year it and Peco's other nuclear plant,
in Limerick, received Power magazine's Powerplant Award, marking
them as among the nation's best-managed reactors.
</P>
<P>
   But Epstein noted that Peco was fined $55,000 in June by the NRC
because scraps of netlike nylon cloth, used for maintenance, were
discovered in an emergency cooling pump at Peach Bottom, and that
could have hampered its use in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   A sale of Three Mile Island to Peco, Epstein said, would be like
``transferring the title from the Three Stooges to the Marx
Brothers.'' He said the true lesson of Three Mile Island had yet to
be learned: No nuclear plant, he contends, can be operated safely.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors at the observation-deck gift shop one recent afternoon
did not seem troubled by any of this as they considered buying
Three Mile Island T-shirts, beer mugs, bottle openers and ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hollinger, who works in the visitors center, said that he
gets lots of tourists from abroad, and that Europeans are surprised
they can get so close to the accident site. Schoolchildren
sometimes stand at the bottom of the defunct cooling towers,
shouting upward to create an echo.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, Hollinger said, ``can't believe that this is where
it happened.''

GENOCIDE TRIAL OF BOSNIAN SERB DOCTOR OPENS IN THE HAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE _ The U.N. tribunal dealing with war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia opened the trial on Monday of a Bosnian Serb
charged with the crime of genocide, the first time an international
trial for genocide has taken place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The accused, Dr. Milan Kovacevic, 57, practiced anesthesiology
in Prijedor, but according to his indictment he played a key role
in the Serbs' plan to drive out and kill large numbers of Muslim
and Croat civilians from his area.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's proceedings opened in the main courtroom, one of the
tribunal's three courts. It is one of seven trials going on here
involving the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   During the opening session, Kovacevic pleaded not guilty to the
charge of genocide and not guilty to all other charges, including
crimes against humanity and other war crimes. The grey, stocky
physician hardly spoke and sat quietly, often taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   But his chief counsel, Dusan Vucicevic, a Serbian emigrant who
lives in Chicago, said the charge of genocide against his client
was `'improper and it can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Vucicevic said his client bore no responsibility for the actions
of the army and the police. ``For each and every one of the
allegations, there is a reasonable explanation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main leaders of the Balkan conflict are at large,
the case against the Serbian doctor is seen as especially
significant because the judges are expected to set new definitions
for genocide, the most heinous of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It would also send an important signal to a conference now going
on in Rome to set rules for a permanent international court to
prosecute crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   No conviction for genocide has ever been decided in an
international tribunal. Genocide was not part of international law
when the World War II trials began at Nuremberg and Tokyo and
therefore was not part of the criminal charges, although it was
used to describe Nazi crimes and was later used in local trials in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   After the Holocaust, though, the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was drawn up by the United
Nations in 1948 and went into effect in 1951. It defined genocide
as the destruction in whole or part of a national, ethnic, racial,
or religious group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the Genocide Convention was never applied
in an international court,'' said an expert at the tribunal. ``It's
the ultimate crime; it has a particular stigma attached to it. But
because we have no finished cases, the parameters of the law are
still vague.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Kovacevic,'' he went on, ``we can expect the
judges to elaborate on the law, to outline what the destruction of
a group means, if it means not just collective murder but also
creating conditions that destroy or impair a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Some national courts have used variations of the Genocide
Convention, as Israel did for the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, but
the court there _ for reasons of Israeli law _ defined the Nazi's
role in transporting Jews to death camps as crimes against the
Jewish people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the moment, a parallel U.N. tribunal is also trying dozens of
people on charges of genocide committed during the bloody conflict
in Rwanda in 1994. The tribunal, based in Tanzania, has not yet
issued a verdict, though there has been one guilty plea, and courts
in Rwanda have convicted some Hutu of genocide under local laws.
</P>
<P>
   Experts here expect Kovasevic's trial to be long and
complicated. They argue that there is no shortage of atrocities and
mass killings in the Balkan war, many of them well documented. But
they say the intention to commit genocide in Bosnia is less clear
cut and perhaps more difficult to prove than in the case of Rwanda,
where Hutu leaders made clear a policy of exterminating the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core question of the Kovacevic case is whether ethnic
cleansing amounts to genocide,'' said Christian Chartier, the
spokesman for the tribunal here.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kovacevic is the first defendant to stand trial on
genocide charges before the tribunal, he is not the only suspect
facing those charges. Others indicted for genocide include the two
most-wanted suspects, the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military commander, Ratko Mladic. Both
remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal uses the term ``ethnic cleansing'' for what
prosecutors have called a carefully planned Serbian campaign to
unite the territory where Serbs lived and to evict non-Serbs from
regions in Bosnia to which Serbs considered they had a historical
right.
</P>
<P>
   During that process, more than 700,000 Bosnian Muslims were
evicted and thousands tortured, raped, and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevic was a key part of that campaign, his indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the chief prosecutor in his case, Brenda Hollis, told
the court that he put in place and helped carry out the campaign in
Prijedor.
</P>
<P>
   She said that at the onset of the war, Kovacevic, in addition to
his hospital work, was appointed deputy director of the ``Serbian
Crisis Staff'' of politicians, army commanders, and police chiefs.
This made him second in the political command of Prijedor and it
meant that he knew or had reason to know of the terror, the
looting, the torture and the killings of the local Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The municipality once had 112,000 people, 44 percent Muslim and
about 42 percent Serb. Between the end of April and the end of
December 1992, the Crisis Staff directed attacks on non-Serbs and
their detention and deportation, Hollis said.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant, she went on, that Kovacevic was accountable for
the three concentration camps of Prijedor, among the most notorious
of the Balkan war. At least 2,000 men were killed in two of the
camps, at Omarska and Keraterm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Omarkska, people saw corpses every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the third camp, Trnopolje, many Muslim women were tortured
and raped, mainly by Serbian soldiers and policemen, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kovasevic is said to be ill and has had at least one stroke,
according to a tribunal official. He has been in the court's
custody since July 1997. His indictment was kept secret by the
tribunal until he was arrested by members of a British-led NATO
force at the Prijedor Medical Center, where Kovacevic remained the
director. From there he was brought to The Hague.

 &HT;    ALL-STAR NOTEBOOK: Ripken's fielding streak questions
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Cal Ripken has been to 16 All-Star Games, but when he
sat in front of the media Monday, everyone wanted to know the
answer to just one question:
</P>
<P>
   When will the streak, now at 2,566 consecutive games, end?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how it would happen,'' Ripken said. ``It's
not going to go on forever. So, when it happens, when the streak
ends, it will take care of itself. The situation will present
itself, which will make sense, and it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, hitting just .258, has been criticized at times, some
feeling he is hurting the team being in the lineup every day. But
management is not about to bench him and Ripken feels he should be
in there every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the ballpark with a simple approach,'' he said.
``(If) the manager is making his lineup, thinking I can be one of
the guys that can help us win, I'll play. I am considered the
everyday third baseman of the Baltimore Orioles. The streak itself
can by analyzed, dissected, opinions can be formed in all different
directions. But I don't worry about all that kind of stuff. I worry
about the thing that matters most, my approach to the game, it's my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors, rumors, rumors
</P>
<P>
   A lot of trade talk is flying around and the latest on the
Braves is that they are interested in Montreal's Mark Grudzielanek
to play second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have placed Grudzielanek on the block and the Braves
remain concerned about the shoulder of Keith Lockhart and are
disappointed with the play of Tony Graffanino.
</P>
<P>
   Another rumor: The Braves have also called the Orioles about
All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar and the Reds about Bret
Boone, who is also here. It may be worth renting Alomar for the
rest of the season considering he probably will not cost a lot
because he is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Back home
</P>
<P>
   In Denver these days it's Andres this, Andres that. The local
media continue to pound the Rockies for not bringing back Andres
Galarraga, who signed with the Braves and had the best first half
of his career, hitting 28 homers and driving in 72 runs. ``It is
good to know that they miss me, but I am really surprised that they
aren't doing well,'' Galarraga said. ``They are so far away from
first place.''
</P>

   With only two shortstops on the NL team, expect starter Walt
Weiss to get a lot of playing time, replaced by Florida's Edgar
Renteria in the sixth inning. The only position where a player is
allowed to come back in the game is at catcher, and that is only if
there is an injury. ... ESPN will have 17 cameras at the game,
including what they call a bat track, which illustrates bat speed.
... It's interesting that Rockies third baseman Vinny Castilla has
made two All-Star Games and both times when Bobby Cox of the Braves
hasn't been the manager. Said Castilla, a former Brave, with a
grin, ``He likes Chipper better.'' ... When San Diego All-Star Andy
Ashby had a 75-pitch victory Sunday, he had the fewest pitches in a
complete game by a starter since pitches were first counted back in
1988. The previous low was Greg Maddux's 78-pitch wonder last year.
... Because two center fielders _ Ken Griffey Jr. and Kenny Lofton
_ were voted in as starters by the fans, some wondered who would
get the nod there. It will be Griffey while Lofton is in left. ...
There will be 23 first-time All-Stars participating tonight. ...
Galarraga on missing the home run derby because of back problems:
``I would have really loved to participate here.'' ... The Boone
family now has three generations of All-Stars, starting with Bret's
grandfather Ray in 1954 and again in '56 and father Bob, from
1976-79 and again in '83. ... When Griffey took batting practice
Monday, he was booed by the crowd, the fans upset he was not
participating in the home run derby. But at the last minute,
Griffey decided to enter and the jeers turned into cheers.

CLINTON TO SIGN DIRECTIVE AIMED AT CURBING HEALTH INSURANCE
ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 10th graf to insert role description of Federal Health Care
Financing Administration) (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will punish health insurance
companies that deny coverage to sick people, in violation of a 1996
law, by excluding them from the lucrative insurance market for
federal employees, administration officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The law was intended to make insurance more readily available to
millions of Americans who change or lose their jobs. But federal
and state officials said they saw worrisome signs that some health
insurance companies were circumventing the law. They said some
companies discouraged sales to eligible individuals, charged very
high premiums or penalized insurance agents selling coverage to
customers with pre-existing medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a directive to be issued on Tuesday, Clinton will order the
Federal Office of Personnel Management, which negotiates health
benefits for federal employees and their dependents, to use its
purchasing power to ``insure that health plans come into
compliance'' with the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The main authors of the health insurance measure, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law, were Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Kansas
Republican who retired from the Senate last year, and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's draft order says, all health plans that insure
federal employees will have to certify that they are complying with
the Kassebaum-Kennedy law in their private insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically,'' it continues, ``I direct OPM to take all
appropriate action, up to and including termination of a
participating health plan from the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program,'' if it finds that any insurer is violating the
letter and spirit of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal employee program is the nation's largest
employer-sponsored health insurance program, covering nine million
people through 350 health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has agreed
to inform the federal government of any violations found by state
officials. Glenn Pomeroy, president of the association, said, ``We
are pleased to work with the administration in a partnership to
make sure that everyone entitled to the protections of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law gets them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy, the insurance commissioner of North Dakota, said state
officials would be asked to inform the federal government whenever
they imposed fines or other penalties on insurers for violating the
standards set in the 1996 law. Most states have written the federal
standards into state law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intends to have the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which oversees state regulation of health
insurance, tell the Office of Personnel Management about any
insurance companies that flout the 1996 law in the states that have
not revised their laws. Missouri, California and Rhode Island are
among the states that have not revised their laws to conform with
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials said they could not immediately
identify companies that had violated the 1996 law. But state
officials said they would probably discover violations when they
investigate complaints or conduct routine examinations of insurers'
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action, the White House on Monday announced an
effort to help more than three million people get assistance in
paying Medicare premiums. The assistance is available to elderly
and disabled people with low incomes (up to $11,108 a year for an
individual and $14,888 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   Medicare premiums now total $525.60 a year and are expected to
increase over the next decade, to $1,268 a year in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new effort came in response to a highly
critical report by a consumer group, Families USA, which said that
the government was overcharging poor elderly people nearly $2
billion a year by deducting Medicare premiums from their Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said that
many elderly people did not seek the federal assistance because
they were unaware of it or feared they would be stigmatized for
going to welfare offices to apply for it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill on Aug. 21, 1996,
he said, ``It will eliminate the possibility that individuals can
be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing medical
condition.'' He said the law would help up to 25 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, found that some insurers were shunning the very people
who were supposed to benefit from the law. Rep. Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn., said: ``I am outraged at the mockery that some insurance
companies are making of the law in some states. How can health
coverage be accessible if it costs $15,000 a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the law appeared to be ``working well for the vast
majority of Americans'' in the group insurance market, allowing
them to move from job to job without having to worry about losing
coverage. Most of the problems, he said, involve ``price gouging''
in the individual insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Kennedy introduced a bill to limit the premiums that
may be charged to people who leave their jobs and try to buy
insurance on their own. The limit would be 50 percent above the
rates charged to people in good health. Insurers vehemently oppose
such federal regulation, as do many Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have told agents that they will reduce
or eliminate the commissions they receive for selling insurance to
small groups or to people with medical problems. In March, the
Clinton administration sent a bulletin to insurers and state
officials saying it regarded such practices as a violation of the
1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Stokes Trautwein, director of federal policy analysis
at the National Association of Health Underwriters, which
represents 15,000 agents and brokers, said on Monday that despite
that warning, some insurers were still ``reducing commissions to an
abnormally low level'' for coverage sold to small businesses with
two to nine employees. ``This is contrary to the spirit'' of the
1996 law, she said.

THE DAY HAPPY TRAILS LED TO COWTOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was Feb. 2, 1958, and Americans fretted
about losing the space race to the Soviet Union's Sputnik. Fort
Worth _ ``Cowtown'' _ took a breather from the Cold War to welcome
a hero to many, Roy Rogers, who rolled into town with wife Dale
Evans, sidekick Gabby Hayes, and the Sons of the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final night of the Southwestern Exposition and Fat
Stock Show and Rogers was the host of a live telecast from the
rodeo, which NBC said easily beat out the 8 o'clock Sunday night
competition _ Ronald Reagan on CBS' ``General Electric Theater''
and ABC's ``Sid Caesar Show.'' NBC estimated the audience at 50
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands of the Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum sat a
13-year-old ninth-grader from Monnig Junior High, who had
worshipped Roy Rogers since he first saw the cowboy hero in
Saturday afternoon ``pitcher shows'' in Rising Star, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy, but Roy was the
epitome of the `good guy,' '' said Fort Worth City Councilman Jim
Lane, recalling an admiration that has wavered little over the
years, although he has stopped dressing like the ``King of the
Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really made me sad this morning when I heard he had died.
He was truly an American hero,'' said Lane, who owns a full-size
cutout of the singing cowboy, an official Roy Rogers lunch box,
saddle and other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Television's Channel 5, then known as WBAP-TV, supplied the
local crew, and NBC brought in a director for the Stock Show
performance of ``The Chevrolet Show's'' Roy Roger's Musical Review.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had been in town for a series of midnight-to-3 a.m.
rehearsals, held at the late hour because of the rodeo schedule,
said Johnny Hay, 79, a producer, director and on-air talent at WBAP
who helped out with cue cards during the Rogers show.
</P>
<P>
   The lettering, he recalled, was made extra large for Gabby, the
whiskered old-timer who, it turned out, didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his lines memorized,'' Hay recalled. ``It was Roy who
couldn't read them. He wouldn't wear glasses. So at the last minute
I had to redo all of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the broadcast, a 24-year-old Bob Watt Jr., now the
Stock Show's general manager, was told that the coliseum dirt was
``too red'' for the new color TV cameras. He scrambled to find
something to change the hue without making the soil unsuitable for
the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was found in cream-colored cotton seed hulls, a
feed filler, which he quickly spread the length and breadth of the
arena, the Stock Show chief recalled yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Rogers' live broadcast from the Stock Show went off
without a hitch except for the moment _ unseen by viewers at home _
when rodeo animals were released while six local dancers were still
on the coliseum floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were equipped to climb up a wall, but when a steer
comes at you, you do it,'' recalled Ed Holleman, 71, of Fort Worth,
a dancer who choreographed the routines. As for Rogers, ``I had not
been a fan _ until I met him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were literally millions who never met Rogers but
maintained a lifelong affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been a nut about Roy Rogers,'' Lane said. ``I have a
palomino and a Jeep. He was just your buddy. When Dale Evans came
here last year, I was lucky enough to be on the stage with her. I
told her that Roy and I rode a million miles together.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TWO VOTES FOR MCGWIRE TO HIT 62  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The numbers change, but for a day or two or sometimes an at-bat
or two, each number is part of their name. The names and numbers
now are Mark McGwire 37, Ken Griffey Jr. 35, Sammy Sosa 33.
</P>
<P>
   For most home-run hitters, any of those numbers is a good
season. But as McGwire, Griffey and Sammy Sosa gathered for Tuesday
night's All-Star Game, each has a realistic chance to surpass the
name and number that defines home-run history for one season: Roger
Maris 61.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire needs only 25 more to break the record, Griffey only 27,
Sosa only 29.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sosa, the Cubs' 29-year-old right-fielder, was asked
Monday which had the best opportunity to break Maris' record, he
never hesitated even with Griffey sitting next to him in the Coors
Field interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my money on Mark McGwire,'' Sosa said. ``Griffey, I
know you my boy, but...''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey laughed. Sosa continued in his Dominican-accented
English, saying: ``We have another second half to go. Who knows? I
might be the one, Griffey might be the one, or Mark.'' But with a
smile, Griffey agreed that McGwire had the best chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bigger,'' the Mariners' center fielder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that Griffey swing, that's something that's natural,''
Sosa said. ``He don't try to hit a home run, just an easy swing,
make contact. Myself, I'm crazy. I'm swinging the bat all the way.
If I'm not swinging the bat hard, I think I'm cheating myself.
Mark, he is so big, he swing so easy. I don't think he go out there
trying to swing hard to hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just enjoy it,'' McGwire said. ``Why guys are backing out,
I'm sure they all have their own reasons, but I enjoy it. It's
something I do. It's something that I've accepted that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 58 last season, including 24 after being traded to
the Cardinals from Oakland on July 31. He hit 52 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly,'' the 6-foot-5-inch 250-pound first baseman
said, ``some of the longer ones I've hit, I didn't realize they
were going that far because a lot of people say, `What's the
feeling?' Actually there's really no feeling at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when the ball meets the bat that it's left the ball
park. My swing is nice and easy, short and compact. It's really
effortless. Because of that, there's really not that hard feeling
that I think some players have. It's a nice, easy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire minimized the theory that his back problems threaten his
chance to hit 62, if not 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take away 1993 and 1994 where I missed all those games,
I've basically averaged 150 games a year,'' he said, alluding to
the heel ailment that put him on the disabled list. ``Everybody
gets injured in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play six months of the year. No other sport does that. We
play through the hottest time of the year. I've had a bad back
since 1989. It's something I have to deal with. I swing a bat
probably 100,000 times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he believes that missing all those games in 1993 and 1994
made him a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time since I was a Little Leaguer that I had
to sit on the bench and watch a game,'' he said. ``It was the first
time that I really started watching pitchers pitch to hitters. I
started watching tapes on how they pitched me. I started watching
hitters, how they approached other pitchers. When I came back, I
started adapting that to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   And almost every day now, McGwire sees himself linked to Babe
Ruth, who hit 60 homers in 1927, and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that when I was a kid and all I wanted to do was
pitch, it wasn't until my sophomore year in college that I turned
into a hitter, never knowing if I'd get a chance to go to the big
leagues,'' he said, alluding to the University of Southern
California. ``The next thing you now, they're talking about my name
along with Babe Ruth, Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle. It's
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's that Mark McGwire hits baseballs over walls. Maybe, in
one season, like nobody else ever has.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WALLKILL, N.Y. _ Dressed in camouflage gear and war paint,
reeking of bug spray and perspiration and armed with rifles and
ammo, Dan Furlong and his buddies were having the time of their
lives, replaying the games of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Shouts of ``I nailed you, big daddy!'' and ``You got me, man!''
rose from the wooded playing field. From behind bunkers and thick
trees, their escape slowed by gopher holes and knee-high grass, two
teams fired gooey pellets of paint at each other. The ``dead'' left
the field with carbon dioxide-powered guns raised over their heads
in surrender, then compared welts with those who had fallen before
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish everybody would get killed so we could eat,'' said
Furlong, the center of attention this muggy summer afternoon.
Furlong, 30, is to be married Saturday, and this was his bachelor
party.
</P>
<P>
   The rowdy day of mock warfare _ a cross between a ``Die Hard''
movie and a game of capture the flag _ was organized for Furlong by
his best man, Mike Jackel, who a year ago chose the same way to
celebrate his passage from the single life to matrimony. They are
part of a small but growing legion of men who are shunning the
traditional bachelor party, a bacchanal with strippers, in favor of
more politically correct, if no less masculine, events.
</P>
<P>
   Paintball parties, like Furlong's, are popular. So are golf
outings, like the one for Pete Wolverton, a book editor in New York
City who joined his friends for five rounds in three days near
Cooperstown, in upstate New York. Or baseball excursions, like the
chartered bus trip to an Orioles game at Camden Yards in Baltimore
for John Massy, a Connecticut bond trader. Or an all-male weekend
in the Hamptons, the party of choice for Rob Gerstner, a New York
City businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Strip clubs, like Scores on the East Side of Manhattan, report
no loss in business. In fact, a spokesman there boasted that
celebrity grooms-to-be have included the New York Yankees' David
Cone and Roseanne's ex, Tom Arnold. But bridal magazines across the
nation have taken note of the movement away from debauchery to
parties built around adventure and athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really coming on strong,'' said Thomas Gunning, the
editor of Wedding Pages, which publishes 39 zoned editions. Gunning
recently commissioned an article on the trend away from liquor and
lap dancing. ``What modern, sophisticated woman is going to abide
that?'' he continued. ``This is a survival instinct among men.
Women will not stay with us if we're that stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that paintball parties don't sound a little odd, themselves,
when they are examined by experts. Activities like paintball or
other team sports are ``aggressive coalitionary behavior,'' said
Richard Wrangham, a Harvard University anthropologist, ``an
evolutionary necessity for the male of the species,'' who must
learn to hunt and wage war.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior, which involves ``aiming and chasing,'' is
inherently pleasurable to men, according to Steven Pinker, a
psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And its
``sheer physicality is one of the last refuges of maleness,'' said
Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist at the University of Washington.
``Doing this kind of guy thing,'' she said, ``is a way of saying `I
love this woman, but I'm still one of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wedding consultants, who are usually not involved in the
bachelors' plans, nonetheless advise a tame celebration. ``I've
been suggesting this kind of thing to my bridegrooms,'' said
Claudia Hilbert, a party planner in Bronxville, N.Y. ``This way,
you don't have him rolling in _ or not rolling in _ for the
ceremony.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Torkos, 27, a police officer in Denville, N.J., said his
pals have not stopped talking about his paintball party last year.
``It's still a macho thing, but here you get to shoot and kill all
your friends,'' Torkos said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry McAward, the owner of the field where Torkos played, in
Jim Thorpe, Pa., said he had never been asked to provide a stripper
on the sidelines. McAward's theory, more colloquially expressed
than those of the academics, is that ``yelling and screaming like a
12-year-old does the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   There was bonding aplenty at Paintball Madness here, a 394-acre
complex a few miles from Middletown, N.Y., followed by a barbecue
in Furlong's honor at the home of his best man, Jackel, in Mahopac.
Two women were invited, Jackel's wife and his sister Meredith, and
their presence caused barely a ripple _ except when Lisa Jackel
``killed'' her husband in the first salvo of the first game. Since
they were teammates, the hit was recorded as friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Furlong's bride, however, did not get a chance to figuratively
eliminate him. She was at the manicurist, he said, getting nail
extensions so her hands would look perfect in the ``ring pictures''
two weeks hence. The pearly polish would be touched up right before
the wedding, Furlong said, but meanwhile she would get used to
moving about with long fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the game is either to capture the other team's flag
or to kill all the opponents by plugging them with .68-caliber
pellets, the size of marbles, that are made of vegetable oil,
dishwashing soap and water-soluble dye. Referees determine when a
player has been killed by examining the splat of paint on his
jumpsuit. The pellets leave raised, red welts on the skin; the
carbon dioxide rifles shoot with a report as loud as a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Furlong, a youth pastor at a church in Yorktown, had a moment of
glory midway through the afternoon. He was patiently biding his
time in the shrubs near the corner of the field, just waiting for
someone from the other team to dare a run for the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Sessa, a 22-year-old intern at the church, did just that
when members of his team had Furlong outmanned, 2-to-1. Sessa raced
the length of the field unchallenged and had his hand outstretched
for the flag when Furlong aimed a volley of pellets at him. None
hit the younger man. But he stumbled out of bounds, empty-handed,
and thus lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   Furlong retreated in triumph to a chaise longue near the grill
where hamburgers hissed. ``This is a good way to get out of doing
the lawn,'' he said. ``There are 15 guys here who should be mowing
today but aren't.''

   PALM COAST _ Nobody died, but dozens of lives were lost all the
same.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning Monday, the homeless were returning home. They
stood in the ashes where they used to live, picked through the
rubble of their lives, and said goodbye to all the little things
that won't mean anything to anyone but them.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 Flint Lane, Reuben Levinton, 73, was down on his hands and
knees where the kitchen used to be, handing shattered knickknacks
to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is the stone egg I brought from Russia or
not,'' said Mary Levinton, 80.
</P>
<P>
   The Levintons learned their home had been lost when they
recognized the magnolia tree outside their kitchen window while
watching TV in the Palatka motel where they took refuge Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Three blocks east, on Flanders Lane, newlyweds Alan and Jodi
Lowe stood in their back yard and peered through the shell of their
former home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange,'' Alan Lowe said. ``The screen in my
satellite dish melted, but a plastic bird feeder handing in the
tree next to it wasn't touched.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was throughout this middle-class neighborhood
where the average house costs $70,000 and all the street names
begin with F. House after house was untouched by the fire, the
lawns green, basketball nets hanging in the driveways, and then
suddenly a single home was ash and shell.
</P>
<P>
   In her back yard, Jodi Lowe turned to stare through the burned
woods between her block and the next block over. The dry ground
still smoldered in spots, and the pine trunks. ``I never could see
my neighbors before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Over at 1 Fielding Lane, David and Mary Hartman and their
18-year-old son Josh wandered aimlessly through the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the National Geographics, right there,'' David Hartman
said, kicking a mound of ash.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Hartman fled with two guitars and the Grateful Dead T-shirt
on his back. In the rubble he found an iron candleholder. ``It was
under my bed,'' he remembered. ``My bed was right about here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hartmans learned their house had burned Sunday night when
they called the emergency 800 number from a motel in St. Augustine.

STEINBERG AIMS FOR 5TH SCGA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBOURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly 20 years ago, Craig Steinberg won the
Pacific-10 Conference golf championship and made a career decision.
The USC senior stuck to his studies and remained an amateur golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, today a 40-year-old San Fernando Valley optometrist
and attorney, never has regretted forgoing professional golf. And
the longtime Van Nuys resident is happy the way things have worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   His work has been satisfying, his family life rewarding. And his
golf game has taken him to the verge of history.
</P>
<P>
   When Steinberg tees up as defending champion Friday in the
opening round of the 99th Southern California Golf Association
championship in Murietta, he will be bidding for a record-tying
fifth title.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Stadler, Scott Simpson, Corey Pavin, Phil Mickelson, Steve
Pate and Mark O'Meara _ all of whom went on to successful careers
on the PGA Tour _ failed in their bids to win even one SCGA title.
No one since 1926 has won five _ Paul Hunter was the first and
last.
</P>
<P>
   Chatsworth's Tim Hogarth, one of 12 area entries in the 64-man
SCGA field, likes Steinberg's chances, even if the straight-hitting
Steinberg might prefer a course a bit tighter than 7,008-yard,
par-72 SCGA Members Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fabulous player and he gets better every time I see him
play,'' said Hogarth, the 1996 U.S. Public Links champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says this course doesn't fit him, because it's so open and
more of a bomber's course and he does better on a straighter
course. He's so straight it's scary. But I like his chances no
matter where he tees up.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who won the SCGA in 1988, '91 and '92, outlasted
arguably the hottest amateur in the country last July when he won
his fourth title by one stroke at tight and familiar Lakeside.
</P>
<P>
   In the final round, Steinberg shot his second 67 of the
tournament to finish 4-under-par 276 and nip Walker Cup participant
Jason Gore, who was coming off consecutive wins in the state
amateur and state open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have enjoyed the last one the most,'' Steinberg said.
``It was at Lakeside, where I had caddied since I was 15, and I had
the good fortune of having the club president caddying for me.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Steinberg is coming off a strong showing in the state
amateur at Pebble Beach, where he won medalist honors, then reached
the second round of match play before losing 1-up to eventual
champion Ed Cuff Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings on that,'' Steinberg said. ``I played
very well. And in the match I lost, I wouldn't do anything
different. I had just one bogey and broke par at Pebble Beach. But
I would have rather lost to him on Saturday (in the final) than on
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuff also will be at Members Club this week. Longtime amateur
standout Mark Johnson will be there as well, bidding for one of the
few titles to elude him in a 26-year SCGA career.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 44, won the SCGA's high school title in 1972 and has
since won the state amateur, Pacific Coast amateur, SCGA
mid-amateur three times and SCGA tournament of club champions four
times.
</P>
<P>
   Cuff, a 1984 U.S. Amateur quarterfinalist, could become the
first player in 56 years to hold state and SCGA amateur titles at
the same time if he wins this week. A consistently strong
contender, he has been a state semifinalist three of the past five
years, defeating Tiger Woods one year. He'll certainly be a prime
challenger to Steinberg's title defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth thinks if a small group were to be formed including
Steinberg, Cuff, Johnson ``and I'd like to throw my name in there
once in a while, I think the (SCGA) winner could come out of that
group very easily.

 &HT;    Brogan turns down Education job, becomes Bush's running mate
instead
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Wanted: Applicants for State Commissioner of
Education. Administer largest chunk of state budget. Also sits on
Cabinet, deciding marina leases, power plant siting, executive
pardons. Salary: $112,895.
</P>
<P>
   Application fee of $6,590.46 due July 17. Ability to raise
hundreds of thousands of dollars in a short period of time a must.
</P>
<P>
   So went the casting call Monday as both political parties
scrambled to find candidates for a job that until this weekend had
seemed a lock for Republican incumbent Frank Brogan, who on Monday
announced he would instead join the ticket of governor's candidate
Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With Brogan abandoning what appeared to be an easy road to
re-election, only one candidate remained Monday in the race: Palm
Beach County's Ron Howard, who 12 years ago ran for the post as a
Republican and is now trying as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   A second Democrat who had hoped to challenge Brogan, Tallahassee
Community College instructor Eric Prier, Monday dropped out of the
race, having raised only $1,300 in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, though, is not likely to go unopposed for long.
Republican officials named a handful of potential candidates. Among
them: state Sen. John Grant of Tampa, who earlier this year
unsuccessfully sought the top job at the State Board of Community
Colleges; Rep. Bill Sublette of Orlando, who chairs the House
education budget committee; and Rep. Bill Andrews of Delray Beach,
who chairs the House K-12 Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats said to be considering a run: outgoing House
Minority Leader Buzz Ritchie of Pensacola; Rep. Cynthia Chestnut of
Gainesville, the former chairwoman of the House Education
Committee; Rep. Keith Arnold of Fort Myers, who prior to Brogan's
announcement was still running for governor; and Secretary of Labor
Doug Jamerson, a former state representative from St. Petersburg
who was defeated by Brogan four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by the support,'' said Jamerson, adding that he
had been getting calls all day from people asking him to run.
</P>
<P>
   Sublette, an Orlando lawyer, said he will have to choose between
the education job and a run for an empty Senate seat. ``This is a
real shocker. It's thrown us into a tailspin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lateness of Brogan's decision means that a candidate would
have to raise enough money for a statewide primary election in just
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree Bush chose wisely with Brogan. Running
mates have not been Bush's strong suit: 1994 Rep. Tom Feeney
alienated many because of his unorthodox, libertarian views; this
past winter, Secretary of State Sandra Mortham quit the ticket
because of negative publicity over her financial management of her
office.
</P>
<P>
   But while clearly helping Bush and possibly helping himself _ it
would give Brogan a strategic post from which to seek the
governor's mansion _ the move gives an opportunity for the
Democrats to retain the balance of power on the Cabinet, even if
they lose the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats can win back the Education Commissioner's seat, and
the other five incumbents all win, Democrats would keep their
current 4-3 majority, even if Bush beats the Democrat front-runner,
Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, for governor.
</P>
<P>
   And that possible scenario created some friction between Bush
and State Party Chairman Tom Slade.
</P>
<P>
   Slade, who has been out of the country for the past several
weeks, played a strong, not-quite-appreciated role in Mortham's
departure from the ticket. Bush, when asked if Slade approved of
Brogan's selection, answered tersely: ``Well, he found out about it
last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade could not be reached Monday, but did issue a news release
supporting the selection and acknowledging that the party must now
find a strong candidate on just 11 days notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no denying that we as a party have a task of holding
that seat,'' said GOP spokesman Bob Sparks. ``Do we wish we had
Frank Brogan again? Absolutely. But he has accepted a higher
calling. And that's that.''

 &HT;    Brogan announces acceptance on Bush's ticket
 &HT;    By Joe Vidueira and Brian Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Maybe it was all those plugs for Education
Commissioner Frank Brogan at the end of every Jeb Bush for Governor
commercials that gave it away, but no one seemed surprised Monday
at gubernatorial candidate Bush's choice for running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dynamic leader, very charismatic,'' said Schools
Superintendent Sara Wilcox, who succeeded Brogan in 1994. ``I can't
say I'm surprised. Frank Brogan achieves whatever he sets his mind
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogan's former associates praised the selection, saying they
had long ago predicted the Martin County educator's rapid ascent to
the highest levels of state politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``His character is impeccable, he's a great communicator and
he's the hardest worker I've ever seen,'' said former St. Lucie
Schools Superintendent David Mosrie, who Brogan named director of
public schools in 1996. ``He really walks the talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, Bush and Brogan were greeted by more than
100 cheering supporters as their private jet landed at Stuart Jet
Aviation. Stuart was a symbolic last stop for Brogan, who began his
political career here in 1988 when we was elected Martin County
schools superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Mary, by his side, Brogan told the crowd that by
joining the Bush ticket he would be able to further push his agenda
to improve education. Brogan said he believed that as lieutenant
governor working closely with Bush he could have more of an impact
on education than he does as education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who says he has visited more than 170 schools since
beginning his second campaign for governor, said that Lt. Gov.
Buddy MacKay ``cannot name one thing that he has done to enhance
the chances for a child to learn and Frank Brogan can name 100
things.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crowd left, Brogan and Bush parted company. Brogan
planned to spend some time in Martin County before beginning his
part of the campaign later this week. Meanwhile, Bush and his
family planned to depart today for a vacation in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Retired school board member and Port Salerno Elementary
principal Marion Carpenter said that she saw the spark of a future
leader when Brogan interviewed for his first teaching job in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   She said Brogan showed up in a three-piece suit and wing-tipped
shoes, and soon took over the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: He's a leader, we gotta get him,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, some were surprised Brogan accepted a role as
second-in-command. ``I thought he'd run for governor himself,''
said Carpenter. ``I guess this is a starting place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others saw a darker side in Brogan's meteoric rise, decrying his
conservative politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should pray for the health of Jeb Bush,'' said Tim
Black, vice president of the Martin County Education Association.
``Contrary to what Frank would have you believe, I never have
considered him a friend to teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogan's twin brother, John, who owns Brogan Pest Control in
Port St. Lucie, said his brother will relish the upcoming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker the pace, the hotter the fire, the more he likes
it,'' he said. But that's not the secret to his success, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremely hard worker, but he's also genuine and
sincere. And I think the general public appreciates that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosrie and others whose jobs may be endangered by wholesale
changes in the education department if the Bush-Brogan ticket
prevails looked at their boss' success philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd wish he'd stay on as commissioner. But the
bigger picture is that now education will be elevated to a higher
level in the campaign (and in state government). He's doing the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What will the future hold for Brogan if the new GOP ticket
prevails?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Frank Brogan wants it to,'' Wilcox said. ``This may
be just the beginning.''

BRITISH TO ALLOW PROTESTANT MARCH IN BELFAST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ A day after a Protestant Orange
Order parade was blocked from marching through a Catholic
neighborhood, the British Parades Commission reversed two earlier
decisions Monday and gave permission for another Protestant march
to parade past a Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairman Alistair Graham said allowing the order to
march past the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast next Monday should not
be seen as a tradeoff to help balance the decision banning the
march Sunday in the Drumcree area of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   A further ban, he said, would have risked inflaming passions
among pro-British Protestant loyalists who already feel aggrieved
at what they see as the authorities' eagerness to placate the
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot ignore the importance of perceptions in Northern
Ireland,'' Graham said at a news conference, ``and there is now a
clear emerging sense of deep hurt amongst loyalists, which arises
from our decisions to reroute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in danger of spilling over into a serious
law-and-order situation which is harmful to both communities,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   After two nights of sporadic violence over the Drumcree ban,
however, many people here considered the decision an attempt to
mollify the Protestants and a bid to head off possible new
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts said the decision was a weak, if not
disingenuous, attempt to make the government appear evenhanded,
alternating permissions and denials to weaken opposition. In
Ulster, pleasing one side usually outrages the other.
</P>
<P>
   The decison against the Drumcree Protestants produced Protestant
violence; the decision in favor of the Protestants next Monday is
expected to produce demonstrations by Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for residents of the Ormeau Road, John Gormley, said
the Catholic community would challenge the commission's ruling in
court, arguing that it had not met the legal guidelines set down
for the Orange marches.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said the decision was unlikely to defuse the
sitation at Drumcree, or end the fear that the violence endangers
the peace effort. Many feel that the most optimistic scenario is
that the inevitable public disorder in the next week will fade,
permitting the new Northern Ireland Assembly to resume its work
when it reconvenes in September. The least optimistic would be
Protestant unionist members' resignation from the new assembly,
which would vitiate the institution and raise the likelihood of
resumed sectarian killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Belfast march, which has twice been banned by the commission
in the last year, will be one of about 500 parades to celebrate the
victory of the Protestant William of Orange over his Catholic
father-in-law, King James II, at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
</P>
<P>
   Most Catholics find the parades offensive and triumphalist.
Protestants say they are a matter of freedom of assembly, a basic
right.
</P>
<P>
   The province was calm during the day Monday, but at night,
Protestants in Belfast continued their violent reaction, the police
said. Most of the incidents involved rioters throwing gasoline
bombs at the police. There were no injuries. A police spokesman
said at midnight, ``It's not as bad as last night, but the night is
young.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People worried about the effects of sustained violence on the
peace effort, which nevertheless appeared to be moving ahead with
the start of work by the new assembly. It is to enact the peace
agreement approved in a referendum in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the violence will break up the whole thing,'' said
Pauline Hegney, a Catholic mother of four, whose husband was shot
dead seven years ago by Protestant paramilitary forces. ``I don't
understand it,'' she added. ``Why should people want to march down
streets where they have no supporters?''
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Wood, a political consultant and former information
director for the British government here, said of the violence: ``I
don't think it puts the peace process in crisis. They are separate
matters. But it shows just how deep the fault line runs in parts of
Northern Ireland society.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and political leaders appealed Monday for restraint, and
for an end to the disorders caused by Protestants angry at the
British government's decision to deploy hundreds of combat-ready
British troops and armed policemen to block the 191-year-old annual
parade down a street in Drumcree, Portadown, 35 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Orangemen camped out overnight in Drumcree,
sleeping in tents decorated with Union Jacks and vowing to stay
until they received permission for their march. They said that they
would remain peaceful, that the violent demonstrators were not
Orangemen and that Orangemen were not provoking the violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night the Orangemen were regaled by the Rev. Ian
Paisley, the hard-line Protestant leader known for his open
anti-Catholicism and opposition to the peace effort and the
assembly, which is to give Catholics more power. He did not
advocate violence, but he promised the campers they would win.
</P>
<P>
   Their mood Monday morning was jovial as they posed for
photographers and cameramen and answered reporters' questions. Two
years ago, in a similar dispute at Drumcree, Protestants rioted for
four days after the British government banned the march. The riots
forced the government to reverse its decision and allow the march.
The reversal in turn provoked Catholic rioting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, protesters blocked dozens of roads, hijacked and
burned cars and fought several batttles with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Rioters in a neighborhood near the Belfast city center threw
flaming gasoline bombs at the police, who pushed the attackers back
by firing plastic bullets. There was only one serious injury in the
provincewide disturbances. An inspector's skull was fractured with
a brickbat in Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
   But the Protestants stayed largely in their own neighborhoods;
there were no serious clashes with Catholics. The police said the
level of violence on Sunday night was much lower than it had been
two years ago, during the last Drumcree crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the political consultant, said ``What we need is four or
five days of the world's cheapest policeman _ rain.''

 &HT;    40,000 Florida resident return to homes
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger, Charles Elmore and Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL _ Crossing through charred forests and scorched fields,
nearly 40,000 residents who fled angry wildfires devouring their
rural county last week returned home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For most, what they found was relief.
</P>
<P>
   While fires that at one point launched a fireball across
Interstate 95 burned nearly 49,000 acres, only 51 homes in Flagler
County were destroyed. Many more, surrounded by barren, blackened
landscape, remained safe behind a strip of green lawn that marked
firefighters' last line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a combat zone during World War II and that's what
this reminds me of,'' said Paul Economo, who learned through a
county hotline Sunday that his Palm Coast house had survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called up last night and . . . he said, `You're lucky,' ''
Economo said. ``He told me two of my neighbors weren't so lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   All around Central Florida, life tried, as best as possible, to
return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   I-95, closed since Friday between St. Augustine and Titusville,
reopened by lunchtime Monday. In Brevard and Volusia counties,
where fires burning since Memorial Day weekend devoured more than
200,000 acres, most returned home Sunday. Nearly all the fires,
particularly four that threatened to converge in a firestorm Friday
in Flagler County, had been sealed off by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   After days of plotting fire attacks, efforts turned to relief.
</P>
<P>
   At an elementary school near Palm Coast, the center of the
fire's destruction, FEMA and state officials hung out their shingle
and offered help finding temporary shelter, paying rent, even
counseling. Small loans are available for minor repairs, but those
who completely lost homes will have to go through their insurance
carriers or the Small Business Administration, said FEMA community
relations officer Maria Munoz. By Sunday, 198 had requested housing
assistance from a FEMA hotline. Fifty more showed up at the school
by 3 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Central Florida relaxed, state officials shifted
their gaze north, where a new blaze ignited in a bone-dry stretch
of the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles flew to Bay County to survey 600 acres burned
by a fire possibly touched off by lightning Monday. Though the area
is sparsely populated, state officials worry it could spread
quickly and fear the Panhandle region of Florida will become their
tinderbox because it remains so dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get a break in this drought, we'll continue to have
fires,'' Chiles said. ``The good news is we have enough manpower.
That helped us a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the cost of fighting the fires has topped $116
million with losses estimated at $276 million. Altogether, 474,462
acres have burned statewide. About 100 people, mostly firefighters,
have been injured, and one elderly patient being evacuated from a
Flagler County nursing home suffered a heart attack and later died.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to visit Volusia County on Thursday to
see the damage. Vice President Al Gore toured Flagler County last
week.
</P>
<P>
   What they will find is a battlefield, where an army of 7,000
firefighters from 44 states, including 200 who arrived overnight
from Maryland, waged war. Usually deserted country roads still
rumble with fire engines, tankers and trucks carrying platoons of
rescue workers. At intersections, National Guardsmen sent to
prevent looting stand watch, rifles slung across their shoulders. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew remains in effect in Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   But even while the area remains in a kind of stand-down, rescue
workers are wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with this fire, it came through so fast, this
isn't dead. It could burn again,'' said John Tomaszewski, an
assistant fire chief from Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A severe storm packing strong winds and hail and moving through
the area mid-afternoon Monday briefly set off alarms. But it passed
without fanning any more fires. Scattered storms were expected to
bring 1 to 2 inches of rain Monday, but officials say at least 10
inches is needed to douse the fires. There is a 50 percent chance
of more rain for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   As they returned _ officially the county borders opened at 9
a.m. _ Flagler residents encountered signs of how narrowly the
battle was sometimes won.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all 51 of the houses destroyed are in Palm Coast, an area
of thickly wooded neighborhoods bordering I-95 where houses sit
sometimes only three to a street. Most of the houses were built in
the early 1980s and only one main road running north-south connects
them. The area resembles Wellington, with houses more widely
spaced; on every fifth lot, say, rather than side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Fires had been burning for more than 30 days here without much
worry. Then came Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A fire in the northwest corner near the Matanzas Woods
neighborhood suddenly sped southeast, pushed through treetops at up
to 35 mph, said Richard Wieser, Flagler County spokesman.
Firefighters saved most of the homes in the area before the fire
came to a brief standstill at I-95. Suddenly it fired its fireball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it jump I-95,'' said Jeff Aleshire, a Palm Coast
resident who ignored a voluntary evacuation and watched the fires
Thursday night. ``It was a big ball of fire basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Embers crossed four lanes of closed highway and ignited
neighborhoods further east. The next morning, state emergency
officials called for the countywide evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Desiree LaForte was one of the lucky ones. Her mother was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hear it on the phone yesterday was a little bit much for
me,'' said LaForte, who learned from the hotline that her house had
survived but her mother's had not. Monday morning she picked
through the chalky remains of her mother's one-story stucco house.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not going to take this well.''
</P>
<P>
   LaForte was about to give up searching the remains when her
brother-in-law eyed a sooty piece of iron, the end pieces to a park
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought that down from New Jersey when we moved,'' she
said. ``Good. At least we have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dixon had been playing golf just blocks from his Matanzas
Woods neighborhood when firefighters told him to start packing
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my golf clubs, a couple pairs of clothes and the
lawnmower. I figured there'd be no need to pack everything up
because we'd just be unloading it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dixon family home of nine years is now a pile of greasy
rubble. He and his wife April salvaged only one or two pieces of
his grandmother's china. Before noon, he stood in a driveway to
nowhere, debating options with an insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   April Dixon weighed what to tell their two toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your 2-year-old says he wants to go home,'' she said,
tears welling, ``you just don't say anything. I try to change the
topic.''

   DELAND _ Floodwaters were noticeably missing and the numbers
were skewed _ think 22 cocker spaniels instead of two _ but Volusia
County's experimental ``ark'' sailed through the firestorm
peacefully and with high praise from its passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers and volunteers operated a
people-and-pets shelter that took in 70 owners and 200 critters who
had to leave their homes. Dogs, cats, chickens, pigs, parakeets,
guinea hens, goldfish, five horses, one turtle and a pygmy goat,
most of them sleeping, eating and watching TV together in a
300-foot-long air conditioned building at the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody called it a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me was how quiet it was,'' said Cindy Chesley, an
off-for-the-summer teacher who volunteered for kitchen duty. ``We
never heard any barking or any kind of loud noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners slept on cots, their pets beside them in cages, from
studio-apartment size wire enclosures _ for Great Danes _ to tiny
plastic carriers for puppies, Pomeranians and cats.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross brought food, the Salvation Army hooked up a
trailer outfitted with showers, and people kept coming through the
door with casseroles, blankets, pillows, toys, animal food, cages
and cat litter.
</P>
<P>
   Earl and Betty Hutson, who moved to DeLand last year from
Boynton Beach, even brought their Fun Bus for the kids to play in.
They converted the old school bus into a mobile play center with
miniature roller-coaster, jumping cage and slide.
</P>
<P>
   The people-and-pets shelter is a pilot program pushed by the
county's Animal Control Board, but never tested until now. By all
accounts, it was a thundering success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for this place, I don't know where we'd be,''
said Ed Maiocchi of Palm Coast, as he and wife Enid began hauling
their own and their son's pets out of the shelter, a total of five
dogs and nine cats.
</P>
<P>
   Kennel owner Mary Ann Meekins brought her own population
explosion _ 22 cocker spaniels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got so much walking, they were spoiled,'' Meekins said.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter will stay open through the end of the week, Director
Sergio Pacheco said _ just in case.

ENNIS COSBY MURDER CASE GOES TO JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ As comedian Bill Cosby sat with his
family in the front row, a jury filed out of a courtroom here
Monday to begin deliberating the fate of the man accused of
murdering Cosby's son, Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance in court by Cosby, his wife, Camille, and their
daughters, Erika and Erinn, was their first at the two-week trial
of Mikail Markhasev.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors will return on Tuesday to resume deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday they heard Deputy District Attorney Anne Ingalls, in
closing arguments, tell jurors that Markhasev had convicted himself
with his own words.
</P>
<P>
   In letters that he wrote to another inmate while he was in the
county jail after his arrest, Ms. Ingalls said, Markhasev referred
to the Cosby killing as a ``robbery gone bad,'' a phrase she often
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis Cosby was shot to death while changing a flat tire about 1
a.m. on Jan. 16, 1997, beside a road on the west side of Los
Angeles. Stephanie Crane, a friend of Ennis Cosby's, testified that
he had called her when he got the flat and that she was waiting
behind him in her car as he fixed the tire. When a man came up to
her window, she fled, she said. When she returned, she found Ennis
Cosby dead, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ingalls reminded jurors that DNA evidence showed that a hair
found inside a cap wrapped around the murder weapon was almost
certainly Markhasev's. She referred to testimony from Christopher
So, who led police to the murder weapon, that Markhasev had said he
shot a black man, and that ``It's all over the news.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that another witness testified that Markhasev and a
friend, Eli Zakaria, were glued to the television in the hours
after the murder, looking for news of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But, in their closing arguments Monday, Markhasev's lawyers said
the letters were fabricated by the inmate who prosecutors said had
received them, David Gomez, and they raised questions about how
different styles of handwriting were used in one letter.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev's lawyers also attacked the credibility of So, who was
paid $40,000 by The National Enquirer for interviews and stands to
get a $100,000 reward if Markhasev is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   They said the prosecution was trying to ``torture'' evidence to
fit their theory of the crime. They pointed out that there was no
evidence placing Markhasev at the crime scene, and they raised
suspicions about the hair, noting that it was discovered nearly a
year after the cap was booked into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Henry J. Hall, a public defender, acknowledged in his closing
that he could not deliver on a promise he made to the jurors at the
start of the case: that he would prove it was Zakaria who pulled
the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can't prove to you, based on the evidence that has been
presented, that Eli Zakaria committed this crime,'' Hall said. But
he went on to argue that a composite sketch based on a description
by Ms. Crane more closely resembled Zakaria than Markhasev.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria was expected to be a chief government witness in the
case but he refused to testify, reportedly saying that he would
assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if put
on the stand. He appeared briefly in the courtroom once, when the
government compared his appearance with a composite sketch to
refute the defense contention that he is the man depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby watched the defendant closely as he was brought out in the
morning. During a recess, Cosby chatted and laughed with Ms.
Ingalls, and later, as defense lawyers finished their summations,
he put a comforting hand on the shoulder of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Markhasev, who was 18 at the time, faces life in
prison without parole.

 Women Outscore Men in Net-IQ Test   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The high-tech industry is dominated by men, but women are just as
Internet savvy, according to a national test of Web surfers' online
intelligence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women scored slightly higher than men on the online SAT-style
test sponsored by MCI Communications, the phone and Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   In the second annual test of Web-searching skills, women racked
up an average score of 82 _ equal to the national average _
compared with men's average of 80. The point difference is not
considered statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   Men make up two-thirds of Internet users nationwide and
constitute about the same portion of the 8,000 people who completed
the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cyberspace, we're all equal,'' said Diane Strahan,
executive director for community partnerships at Washington-based
MCI.
</P>
<P>
   By gender, maybe. But MCI also measured performance by state _
and California, birthplace of the high-tech industry, didn't even
come close to the top of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Delaware was an ``A'' student, with a 94 score, while
California ranked behind 27 other states, with an 82 average.
</P>
<P>
   Utah was the No.2 state, and Alaska and Nebraska tied for third.
</P>
<P>
   Test-takers answered multiple-choice questions by searching the
Internet (although there was no way to prevent them from cheating).
It's no coincidence that the Internet intelligence test is similar
to the SAT test _ it was designed by a division of the Educational
Testing Service, the Princeton-based architects of the
college-entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   Results were measured by speed and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Internet users' searching skills have improved
slightly. Last year's national average was 78, about 5 percent
lower than the 82 average for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans' Internet skills are improving _ we went from a `C+'
to a `B-,''' Strahan said.
</P>
<P>
   People ages 40 to 60 and those between 24 and 39 were the top
performers, each tallying up averages of 84. Test-takers who were
ages 18 to 23 years trailed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   A few people scored 100, which required correct answers to all
the questions within a few hours. MCI did not measure how many
people had perfect scores or determine who they were.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3 million people visited the site,
 &LR; www.nettest.mci.com &LR; , which went up in April.

SALOMON TO DISBAND ITS BOND ARBITRAGE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Salomon Smith Barney said Monday in a memo to
employees that it would disband its U.S. bond arbitrage group _ for
years an important, although volatile, contributor to the profits
and vaunted trading reputation of Salomon Brothers _ after that
business suffered an estimated $15 million in losses in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The losses are relatively small for a firm that trades billions
of dollars. But the shuttering of the group and the departure of
its leaders illustrate how much has changed at Salomon _ a firm
once known for its swagger and its big market bets _ following the
Travelers Group's $9 billion acquisition of Salomon Inc. late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Less risk, and particularly less big risk-taking with the firm's
own money, is now the order of the day, several people at Salomon
Smith Barney said Monday. The business of trading for customers is
now, some executives said, prized over proprietary trading with the
firm's own money.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Weill, the chairman of Travelers Group, and his
lieutenants at Travelers' merged investment firm, Salomon Smith
Barney, have prospered particularly through their careful
management of Main Street businesses that sell financial services
to private citizens and are said to be uneasy with the kinds of big
and sometimes spectacularly successful risk-taking Salomon has made
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney is ``going to be predominantly a retail
shop,'' an executive close to the firm said, adding, in reference
to Weill and his deputies James Dimon and Deryck Maughan, who are
co-chairmen and co-chief executives of Salomon Smith Barney,
``They're risk averse.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Salomon Smith Barney executive who spoke on the condition
of anonymity defended the closing as a sensible management move.
``There are now less opportunities in the U.S. bond markets,'' the
executive said. ``We now have a broader menu of options when we
decide how we want to use our capital.''
</P>
<P>
   In its memo to employees Monday, Salomon Smith Barney said that
Robert Stavis and Jeffrey Rosenbluth, the managing directors who
ran Salomon's bond arbitrage group, ``have decided to leave the
firm in order to pursue other opportunities.'' Stavis and
Rosenbluth, who have each spent more than 10 years at Salomon,
declined to comment when reached at their offices late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates at the firm, the U.S. bond arbitrage
group _ some 30 people in total _ might make a total loss of about
$15 million in the second quarter, after turning in a profit of
about $80 million in the three months ended March 31. The group's
employees will either be absorbed into the company's other bond
businesses or be let go, people at Salomon said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon and Maughan were the authors of Monday's memo to all the
firm's employees, which was titled Reorganization of Global
Arbitrage. ``Global arbitrage results this quarter will show a
small loss, a swing of about $100 million over the last quarter, in
large part driven by the reduced performance of the U.S. arbitrage
unit,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. bond arbitrage business has become less profitable in
recent years. More efficient markets mean that there are fewer easy
profit opportunities for such businesses. And, interest rates have
been more stable in recent years, reducing profit opportunities for
traders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Effectively, Salomon is getting out of the bond arbitrage
business in the United States, assigning global responsibility for
that business to Costas Kaplanis, an executive based in London. In
its memo, Salomon said, ``We believe there continues to be
significant proprietary trading in other regions of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking big trading stakes has often caused embarrassing
quarterly losses for Salomon Brothers, which the firm was prepared
to accept as it often reaped huge annual profits from adventurous
trading. The closed business, several executives at the firm said
Monday, had regularly made big contributions to annual profits even
though it sometimes suffered quarterly losses.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon has often surprised investors with its sudden losses and
profits. Just last fall, for example, its profits for the three
months ended Sept. 30 were substantially reduced by a loss
estimated at about $100 million that the firm's equity traders _
who are not involved with the group closed Monday _ suffered on
investments betting on British Telecommunications PLC's ultimately
unsuccessful acquisition of MCI Communications Inc. When British
Telecom reduced its initial offer for MCI, Salomon's investments
soured.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other sudden losses, too. In 1994, Salomon's
bond business for institutional customers slumped, contributing to
an annual loss for that year of $400 million.

PENTAGON SAYS A FORMER GENERAL COMMITTED ADULTERY AND LIED
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army's former deputy inspector-general engaged
in a pattern of ``inappropriate behavior'' or adulterous affairs
with the wives of four officers under his command, according to a
Pentagon report given to members of Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Gen. David R.E. Hale, also ``sanctioned the
misuse of government resources'' to pay for international travel by
one of the women and then lied ``in an effort to deceive others
concerning his conduct,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by Eleanor Hill, the Pentagon's
inspector-general, significantly expands the controversy over Hale
and the accusations against him. The general, 53, retired in
February with the Army's blessing, even though a criminal complaint
accusing him of coercing sex had been filed by a subordinate's wife
while he was serving as deputy commander for NATO ground forces in
southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered Ms. Hill's
office to review the accusations and the Army's handling of the
case, including the decision to allow Hale to retire quietly, four
months after taking over as the Army's deputy inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the Army announced that it had begun a criminal
investigation based on Ms. Hill's findings, but the extent of the
accusations of wrongdoing was not clear until Monday. A copy of the
report, with the names blacked out to conceal the identities of the
women involved and other witnesses, was provided to The New York
Times by congressional staff members critical of how the Army
handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Army and other branches of the military
have been criticized for instances of sexual harassment and
misconduct that were ignored or investigated slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's response to the Hale accusations has prompted charges
of a double standard, giving senior officers more leeway than
junior officers or enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Army vigorously prosecuted its senior enlisted
soldier, Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, on 18 counts of sexual misconduct
involving six women, although he was ultimately convicted on only
one charge of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more example of the disparity with which the
military operates,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who has
strongly criticized the Army since Hale's case became public. ``If
you're a friend of the big guns and you've committed a crime, you
can just quietly disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hale has retired, the Army could recall him to active
duty to face court-martial. The Army's action last week strongly
suggested that he could face charges within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accusations first arose in March, Hale has refused to
comment publicly on the case, but the inspector-general's report
said he strongly denied the accusations. He also submitted a
40-page rebuttal, according to an official familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from a criminal complaint filed in January
by Donnamaria Carpino, the wife of an Army colonel who served under
Hale's command at the NATO base in Izmir, Turkey. She accused the
general of coercing her into having sex over a period of time in
the spring of last year by threatening to bring charges of adultery
against her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpino divorced her husband in November, while Hale
divorced his wife in August 1997, after 30 years of marriage,
according to the report
</P>
<P>
   The inspector-general's report concluded that the
``preponderance of evidence'' showed their relationship was
consensual. But it also said that Hale's conduct fell under the
crime of adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry also uncovered evidence of adulterous affairs and of
other ``inappropriate relationships'' with other wives of
subordinates or former subordinates. The accusation of misuse of
taxpayer money involved the general's authorization that reimbursed
Ms. Carpino for the cost of a trip from Turkey to the United States
in May 1997, accompanying him, although ostensibly to attend to a
medical emergency involving her mother.

DEATH OF ROY ROGERS IS EVERYBODY'S LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
And LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He shined shoes in Ohio, sold magazines in Missouri and chopped
cotton in Texas while working his way toward Hollywood and the slim
chance of stardom. But Roy Rogers more than made it. When he died
on Monday at the age of 86, the nation mourned the loss of a
straight-shooting, singing cowboy legend who embodied everything
decent about the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``He influenced several generations of Americans,'' said Red
Steagall, a cowboy poet and troubadour from Fort Worth, Texas, who
came to know Rogers and his family. ``He was one of those people
who taught us the difference between right and wrong because he
always wore the white hat and he was always in conflict with the
guys in the black hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he always defeated them,'' Steagall said, growing
husky-voiced with emotion as he spoke. ``Good always defeated evil
in all of Roy's productions. It's too bad that so much of our
society today wears gray hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar tributes poured in as news spread about Rogers' death of
congestive heart failure at the California home that he shared with
wife and co-star, Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning six decades in movies, television and
recordings, Rogers was the singing ``King of the Cowboys.'' Rogers
and Evans were among the nation's most recognized and admired
couples, their anthem, Happy Trails to You, among the century's
most beloved songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there will be a lot of sad and grateful Americans,
especially of my generation, because of his career,'' President
Clinton said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rogers' movies that most inspired a teen-ager named Don
Edwards, who eventually followed in the Ohio native's footsteps as
a cowboy singer, and in later years became Rogers' friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy was bigger than life,'' said Edwards, a Weatherford,
Texas, resident who appeared in the recent movie The Horse
Whisperer. ``He had a big influence. He was an icon. My mom and dad
would drop me off at the movie house and they didn't have a problem
with that, me staying all day, because Roy Rogers was preaching the
same things that they were. You were in good hands with Roy in the
movie house...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you kind of sad that he's not here anymore,''
said Edwards, also a country singer based in Fort Worth. ``But
there are a lot of memories, a lot of things on my walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also worked as a Depression-era truck driver and peach
picker, then was a successful country singer with the Sons of the
Pioneers that he helped organize before he landed a $75-a-week job
in 1937 as a singing cowboy at Hollywood's Republic Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a guitar, six-shooter, crinkly-eyed good looks and
shy country charm, Rogers rose in salary and popularity. From 1943
to 1954, he was the top western star at the box office in a
magazine poll of theater operators.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who survives her husband, shared the screen in many of
Rogers' 87 films and a long-running TV series. Rogers' palomino,
Trigger, became a household name. In his performances, Rogers
fought often, but always fairly, and usually shot the gun from the
bad guy's hand, not the bad guy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was and will always be a true western hero,'' said Gene
Autry, Rogers' friend and longtime cowboy rival.
</P>
<P>
   Off-screen, Rogers was described by friends as a gracious and
deeply religious man, someone keenly aware of his straight-shooting
image and ability to influence young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never showed anything on screen that wasn't part of his
personal life,'' Steagall said. ``He was absolutely the most
outstanding person you could imagine. He was very dedicated to his
family, he was strongly convicted in his faith in God, and he
wasn't afraid to tell that to anyone who would listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steagall, like many others who knew Rogers, on Monday recalled
favorite memories of the cowboy star. Steagall took Rogers goose
hunting on his 80th birthday, and a few years ago visited Rogers at
the California museum he and his wife had created near their
California home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he was able, he would greet everyone down in the
lobby of that museum,'' Steagall said. ``That was his big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards recalled meeting Rogers in the 1950s as a star-struck
teen-ager after Rogers' performance in a Boston rodeo. Edwards kept
the program from that rodeo, and had it handy decades later when he
and Rogers were introduced at a western awards program in
California. By then, Edwards had become a successful recording
artist in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been carrying it around for a long time,'' Edwards
recalled. ``He signed it, and I'll never forget this as long as I
live. He wrote `Roy Rogers,' then he stopped and looked up at me.
`Do you mind if I sign Trigger, too?' That just melted my heart and
it went on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Rogers contributed laudatory liner notes to Edwards'
album Happy Cowboy. In 1994, Edwards and several other western
performers joined Rogers on stage at a Tucson, Ariz., western music
festival to sing Happy Trails To You.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking at the time, `Golly, this is probably the
neatest thing I've ever done,' '' Edwards said. ``From being a kid
watching him in a 9-cent movie house, to singing with him on stage
in Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was born Leonard Slye on Nov. 5, 1911, in Cincinnati, but
began the trek to California in 1929. He made his first mark as a
singer in the mid-1930s, co-founding the group that would come to
be known as the Sons of the Pioneers. The group recorded hit
records, such as Tumbling Tumbleweeds and Cool Water, before Rogers
embarked on his movie career.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers replaced Autry as Republic's top cowboy when Autry left
to serve as a flier in the Army Air Forces during World War II.
Rogers was first teamed with Evans, a singer and sometime actress,
in the 1944 film Cowboy and the Senorita.'' They married in 1947,
14 months after the death of his first wife. Evans, born Frances
Octavia Smith in Uvalde, Texas, became known as the ``Queen of the
Cowgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and his wife eventually became well-known for their
religious beliefs and spoke at many religious gatherings, including
some with evangelist Billy Graham. Evans wrote several
inspirational books, including ``Angel Unaware'' about the couple's
daughter, Robin, who was born with Down syndrome and died in 1952
at age 2 of complications from the mumps.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy would continue to plague the family. Debbie, one of the
couple's adopted children, was killed in a church bus crash in
1964. The next year, another adopted child, John, choked to death
in Germany while serving in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, it doesn't say you're going to get by without
having troubles,'' Rogers once said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Rogers is survived by six children or
stepchildren, 15 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren. A
memorial service is planned for Saturday at the Church of the
Valley in Rogers' home of Apple Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child dreamed of being a Roy Rogers or a Dale Evans, but
for people like Don (Edwards) and me, he created a way of life that
we're enjoying now with cowboy music and the image of cowboy
music,'' Steagall said on Monday. ``It's a great personal loss to
everybody who admires Roy and tried to live by the values they
learned from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I didn't see him very often,'' Steagall said, ``I
just figured he'd always be there.''

UNION PACIFIC FIGHTS TOUGHER REGULATION; SAYS CONGESTION IS
EASING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Union Pacific Railroad, seeking to fend off demands
for tougher federal regulation, said on Monday that congestion was
easing, capacity expanding, and competition with rival carriers
intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   And the company said that the whole railroad was now using a
single computer system for the first time since its 1996 merger
with Southern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But many customers are hardly reassured. Executives of the
Entergy Corp., a major electricity provider in the South and
Southwest, said the utility had not been able to get enough coal
delivered to its power plant in White Bluff, Ark., because of
congestion on the railroad. Several weeks ago, the utility came up
with a roundabout solution. Entergy now transfers coal from trains
to barges near Chester, Ill., and floats them down the Mississippi
River and up the Arkansas River to its plant. But the company says
it still cannot satisfy its demand for coal and has asked
regulators to allow a rival of Union Pacific to share its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Union Pacific have until Wednesday to file complaints
with the Surface Transportation Board, the principal railroad
regulator. The board will decide whether the government should do
more to clean up railroad congestion around the Houston area and
the Gulf of Mexico coast.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from members of Congress and Union Pacific
customers, the board, which is up for congressional reauthorization
this year, is also set to consider broader forms of relief for the
railroad's customers and tighter control over the whole rail
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas, has introduced a bill that
would make it easier for shippers to win rate cases that come
before the board in areas that lack competition. The bill would
also allow the transportation board to double, to 18 months, the
duration of emergency orders such as the one now requiring Union
Pacific to share some yards and tracks. That order, already
extended three times, expires next month.
</P>
<P>
   While the chances that Congress will act before its summer
recess are remote, such proposals are often meant to prod the
Surface Transportation Board to act on its own.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The merger with Southern Pacific to form the nation's largest
railroad caused what regulators called an unprecedented breakdown
in rail traffic through the heart of the nation. Economists
estimate that shippers have lost billions of dollars, and some
customers, like Entergy, have sued for compensation. Union Pacific
reached a settlement with DuPont, however, just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific says there is no need to continue the emergency
order or impose any other rules. ``I don't think that by any
stretch of the imagination there's a congestion crisis on Union
Pacific,'' said Arvid E. Roach, a partner at the law firm of
Covington &AMP; Burling, which is responsible for presenting the
company's case to the Surface Transportation Board.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in Texas, the epicenter of a Union Pacific crisis
that began last year, yards have opened up and traffic is flowing
more smoothly, the company has said in its weekly reports.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, a
leading business group, said that refineries and chemical plants
along the Gulf Coast were still having trouble moving their
products. Larry Parsons, the United Transportation Union general
chairman for much of Texas and Louisiana, confirmed the
improvements while adding that conditions were not back to normal.
But because the remedy has included a crash hiring program, he said
that inadequately trained brakemen and conductors were working on
the trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know one end of a boxcar from the other,'' he said.
``If you're a conductor and they send you one of these newbies out
there, you've got to watch this kid to keep him from getting killed
when he's running around.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific has said that its new employees receive ample
training, and Roach pointed to reduced accident rates this year.
Last year, however, a series of crashes left 11 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad's worst snarls are now in and around Nebraska,
where coal trains, grain shipments, and cars bound for ports
converge on the nation's busiest tracks and its busiest yard, in
North Platte. In its latest reports, Union Pacific blames track
maintenance and the construction of new tracks and sidings.
</P>
<P>
   Checks with several utilities indicated that Union Pacific's
problems do not appear to be a factor in power shortages around the
Midwest. Entergy, however, has said it has had to switch from coal
to other fuels or buy power from other producers. Union Pacific
says it is shipping only about 75 percent of the coal it has
committed to carry, but this share represents a gain from about 50
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
   The transition to a single computer system for the entire
railroad has contributed to the tie-ups. Computers that could not
talk to each other sometimes lost track of shipments altogether.
The railroad said it delayed the final stage of its computer
integration, on the West Coast, from May 1 to July 1, adding
hundreds of technicians to help with the transition.
</P>
<P>
   While many customers have said the merger squelched competition,
Union Pacific has said it left two stronger competitors throughout
the Western United States. In the merger, it ceded or shared some
routes with Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monopolists earn monopoly profits,'' Roach added. ``This
company has had losses for three quarters.'' The losses have
resulted from lost traffic and new investments to expand and
improve the rail system.

   Craig Stadler, Scott Simpson, Corey Pavin, Phil Mickelson, Steve
Pate and Mark O'Meara _ all of whom went on to successful careers
on the PGA Tour _ failed in their bids to win even one SCGA title.
No one since 1926 has won five _ Paul Hunter was the first and
last.
</P>
<P>
   Chatsworth's Tim Hogarth, one of 12 area entries in the 64-man
SCGA field, likes Steinberg's chances, even if the straight-hitting
Steinberg might prefer a course a bit tighter than 7,008-yard,
par-72 SCGA Members Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fabulous player and he gets better every time I see him
play,'' said Hogarth, the 1996 U.S. Public Links champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says this course doesn't fit him, because it's so open and
more of a bomber's course and he does better on a straighter
course. He's so straight it's scary. But I like his chances no
matter where he tees up.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who won the SCGA in 1988, '91 and '92, outlasted
arguably the hottest amateur in the country last July when he won
his fourth title by one stroke at tight and familiar Lakeside.
</P>
<P>
   In the final round, Steinberg shot his second 67 of the
tournament to finish 4-under-par 276 and nip Walker Cup participant
Jason Gore, who was coming off consecutive wins in the state
amateur and state open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have enjoyed the last one the most,'' Steinberg said.
``It was at Lakeside, where I had caddied since I was 15, and I had
the good fortune of having the club president caddying for me.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Steinberg is coming off a strong showing in the state
amateur at Pebble Beach, where he won medalist honors, then reached
the second round of match play before losing 1-up to eventual
champion Ed Cuff Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings on that,'' Steinberg said. ``I played
very well. And in the match I lost, I wouldn't do anything
different. I had just one bogey and broke par at Pebble Beach. But
I would have rather lost to him on Saturday (in the final) than on
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuff also will be at Members Club this week. Longtime amateur
standout Mark Johnson will be there as well, bidding for one of the
few titles to elude him in a 26-year SCGA career.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 44, won the SCGA's high school title in 1972 and has
since won the state amateur, Pacific Coast amateur, SCGA
mid-amateur three times and SCGA tournament of club champions four
times.
</P>
<P>
   Cuff, a 1984 U.S. Amateur quarterfinalist, could become the
first player in 56 years to hold state and SCGA amateur titles at
the same time if he wins this week. A consistently strong
contender, he has been a state semifinalist three of the past five
years, defeating Tiger Woods one year. He'll certainly be a prime
challenger to Steinberg's title defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth thinks if a small group were to be formed including
Steinberg, Cuff, Johnson ``and I'd like to throw my name in there
once in a while, I think the (SCGA) winner could come out of that
group very easily.''

THE DAY HAPPY TRAILS LED TO COWTOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was Feb. 2, 1958, and Americans fretted
about losing the space race to the Soviet Union's Sputnik. Fort
Worth _ ``Cowtown'' _ took a breather from the Cold War to welcome
a hero to many, Roy Rogers, who rolled into town with wife Dale
Evans, sidekick Gabby Hayes, and the Sons of the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final night of the Southwestern Exposition and Fat
Stock Show and Rogers was the host of a live telecast from the
rodeo, which NBC said easily beat out the 8 o'clock Sunday night
competition _ Ronald Reagan on CBS' ``General Electric Theater''
and ABC's ``Sid Caesar Show.'' NBC estimated the audience at 50
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands of the Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum sat a
13-year-old ninth-grader from Monnig Junior High, who had
worshipped Roy Rogers since he first saw the cowboy hero in
Saturday afternoon ``pitcher shows'' in Rising Star, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy, but Roy was the
epitome of the `good guy,' '' said Fort Worth City Councilman Jim
Lane, recalling an admiration that has wavered little over the
years, although he has stopped dressing like the ``King of the
Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really made me sad this morning when I heard he had died.
He was truly an American hero,'' said Lane, who owns a full-size
cutout of the singing cowboy, an official Roy Rogers lunch box,
saddle and other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Television's Channel 5, then known as WBAP-TV, supplied the
local crew, and NBC brought in a director for the Stock Show
performance of ``The Chevrolet Show's'' Roy Roger's Musical Review.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had been in town for a series of midnight-to-3 a.m.
rehearsals, held at the late hour because of the rodeo schedule,
said Johnny Hay, 79, a producer, director and on-air talent at WBAP
who helped out with cue cards during the Rogers show.
</P>
<P>
   The lettering, he recalled, was made extra large for Gabby, the
whiskered old-timer who, it turned out, didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his lines memorized,'' Hay recalled. ``It was Roy who
couldn't read them. He wouldn't wear glasses. So at the last minute
I had to redo all of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the broadcast, a 24-year-old Bob Watt Jr., now the
Stock Show's general manager, was told that the coliseum dirt was
``too red'' for the new color TV cameras. He scrambled to find
something to change the hue without making the soil unsuitable for
the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was found in cream-colored cotton seed hulls, a
feed filler, which he quickly spread the length and breadth of the
arena, the Stock Show chief recalled yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Rogers' live broadcast from the Stock Show went off
without a hitch except for the moment _ unseen by viewers at home _
when rodeo animals were released while six local dancers were still
on the coliseum floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were equipped to climb up a wall, but when a steer
comes at you, you do it,'' recalled Ed Holleman, 71, of Fort Worth,
a dancer who choreographed the routines. As for Rogers, ``I had not
been a fan _ until I met him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were literally millions who never met Rogers but
maintained a lifelong affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been a nut about Roy Rogers,'' Lane said. ``I have a
palomino and a Jeep. He was just your buddy. When Dale Evans came
here last year, I was lucky enough to be on the stage with her. I
told her that Roy and I rode a million miles together.''

 &HT;    Medicaid not paying for as much Viagra as expected
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Poor men are not going as wild over
Viagra as state officials had feared.
</P>
<P>
   So the state Medicaid's $12 million-a-year projection for the
impotency drug is shrinking to $3 million to $5 million a year.
That sounds like a lot of money, but it is just a blip in Florida's
$7 billion yearly Medicaid budget.
</P>
<P>
   For $5 million, about 10 percent of the state's 176,000 men on
Medicaid age 19 or older _ or about 17,000 men _ would get three
pills a month. Recipients can get up to four pills a month.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayer-paid coverage has resulted in a phone fury, said
Jerry Wells, state pharmacy program manager.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, people call to say impotency is a serious problem
and men need Viagra to help them feel better. On the other side,
callers are angry their taxes are being wasted.
</P>
<P>
   One day, two calls from the same senator's office were made to
Wells. One aide spoke against paying for the pills. Another wanted
to make sure a man who uses a wheelchair would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The state Medicaid program must cover the drug unless the
federal government decides the drug is being abused, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear with such popular drugs is that Medicaid patients will
trade their prescriptions for other drugs, services or cash on the
street, Wells said. There are no signs of that in Florida, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 44 days the drug was available, the state spent
about $2,700 a day, setting a $1 million yearly pace. So far,
13,819 pills have been distributed through 3,688 claims that cost a
total of $118,586.
</P>
<P>
   The state pays about $7.49 a pill but a $4.23 processing fee on
each prescription increases the price to about $8.58 a tablet.
</P>
<P>
   Wells expects the pace to still increase as doctors feel more
comfortable doling out Viagra and patients realize Medicaid covers
it.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast last year, the state paid 612 claims totaling
$260,000 for two different impotency drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, which helps impotent men achieve and maintain erections,
is much more popular because a pill is simpler and less painful
than treatments that involve placing suppositories or having an
injection in the penis.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug is not for everyone. Experts warn that Viagra,
tested on a few thousand men, could cause unknown side effects in
the hundreds of thousands of men now taking it. So far, health
officials haven't heard of any major problems in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center's emergency room,
cardiologist Dennis Hanney has seen two men who have been near
death because they took Viagra and had been on a long-acting
nitroglycerin prescription.

TEACHERS URGE UNION LEADERSHIP TO TRY AGAIN ON MERGER PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Minn., Mont., N.M.)   (fb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A day after rejecting a merger with the American
Federation of Teachers, delegates at the National Education
Association convention gave their leaders a green light to
negotiate a revised merger agreement more to the delegates' liking.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000 delegates to the convention, the Representative
Assembly, approved a resolution Monday that told the group's
officials to conduct a survey of why the merger was rejected and to
use that survey to guide the union in future merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of uniting America's educators in a single
organization is very much alive,'' said Bob Chase, president of the
NEA.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the delegates gave for rejecting the merger agreement
was that the governing structure of the new union would be less
democratic than the NEA, that the teachers federation was too
militant and that they were unhappy that the merger would make the
education association part of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Merger supporters were delighted by Monday's resolution, saying
it breathed new life into their dream of a united voice to fight
the many attacks against the nation's public schools and public
school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the delegates stunned the union's leadership when
just 42 percent voted in favor of the merger, far less than the
two-thirds required for approval. The merger would have created the
largest union in American history by combining the NEA, which has
2.3 million members, and the American Federation of Teachers, with
950,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's resolution stated: ``The Representative Assembly
affirms its historic commitment to the concept of unity with the
AFT.'' Although the resolution set no specific date to resume
negotiations, it made clear that the delegates favored a merger,
but were unhappy with specific terms of the merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The vote against the merger left the NEA chapters in Florida,
Minnesota, Montana and New Mexico in limbo because they were on the
brink of merging with the teachers federation affiliates in their
states.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NEA's rules, such statewide mergers are prohibited,
but the resolution approved Monday directs the union's leadership
to develop guidelines to quickly address the question of merging
the state affiliates of the two unions.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also voted for the two unions to extend their
agreement not to raid each other for members. In addition, the
delegates voted to continue the unions' joint council, in which
leaders from the two groups have cooperated in areas like teacher
quality.

MANY EVACUEES RETURN HOME AS FIRES BEGIN TO SUBSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Inserts new 7th and 8th grafs, and 5 new grafs near end,
beginning with ``One woman in Flagler County.'' Minor changes in
wording elsewhere.)  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. _ For an excruciating three days, an estimated
35,000 people waited in shelters and hotel rooms just outside
Flagler County, as a result of a mandatory evacuation while
firefighters battled the worst wildfires in Florida's history. On
Monday morning, evacuees collected their photo albums, cats, dogs
and other belongings and came home, most of them, to relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my house was gone,'' said Donna Kerney of Bunnell,
who had thrown a hose and running sprinkler on her roof and fled as
flames neared her neighborhood on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the vast majority of the evacuees, she went home
Monday and found that though parts of her house were burned and
smoke-damaged, it was still habitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the grace of God, it stood,'' said Ms. Kerney, a
37-year-old administrative assistant for the city of Bunnell.
</P>
<P>
   Flagler County's worst-case scenario, that three wildfires
burning out of control would merge and race eastward through the
county all the way to the Atlantic, evaporated in the last few
days. The residents' fear was washed away first by firefighters'
hoses and then by much-anticipated rain.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as the thousands of residents returned to their homes
after cancellation of the mandatory evacuation, some of them
driving through the rain they had prayed for, talk was more about
what might have happened than about what did. Only about 40 homes
were destroyed or damaged in Flagler County, officials said, by
wildfires that consumed almost 50,000 acres, most of it scrub and
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and state officials, while quietly celebrating the
rain and the gains against the fires, repeatedly warned residents
that the region was still unusually dry, fires still burned and
conditions remained ripe for more fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged a bullet'' in Flagler County and elsewhere in the
state, Gov. Lawton Chiles said. But he and other state officials
said residents must be ready to evacuate if the wildfires threaten
the region again.
</P>
<P>
   Several families lost everything when their homes went up in
flames, including Beatrice and Gerald Snyder, who celebrated their
47th wedding anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   Their home in Bunnell was reduced to ashes, along with memories
that spanned a half-century. They can rebuild their home, but
``that isn't going to bring back 47 years of stuff,'' said Mrs.
Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   But the news in most neighborhoods around northern and east
central Florida was better Monday morning, as firefighters and rain
continued to beat back wildfires _ though flare-ups continued in
some places, triggered by lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tide has turned to some extent, at least temporarily,''
said Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 95 and U.S. 1, the main north-south travel routes,
were reopened, though plumes of smoke from new and dwindling fires
continued to rise into the air in Flagler, Volusia and Brevard
counties.
</P>
<P>
   What the parched region had needed most, as wildfires raged
through palmettos, pines and sometimes homes, was rain. ``Every
little bit helps,'' said Ms. Kerney about the brief downpours on
Monday. ``But we need much more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters have said there is a 50 percent chance of
thundershowers for the region, and more rain is needed if
firefighters are to continue gaining ground. Less than 2 inches
fell in the region. Firefighters said it would take a downpour of
more than 10 inches to put out the remaining fires.
</P>
<P>
   But for many residents here, who had previously been ordered
from their homes by state officials, any good news was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The past few days ``have been pretty rough,'' said Tom Hubbard,
who manages the Bunnell Thriftway, the town's only supermarket, as
returning residents filled his store, going about the business of
living.
</P>
<P>
   But now the emergencies seemed smaller. The worries were more
about having enough groceries in stock than about whether the
store, which was not damaged, would fall victim to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far,'' he said, ``we've been able to supply everything they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials took time, during the respite, to count the cost
of the wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday evening, 58 fires still burned in Florida, pushing
the total of wildfires to more than 2,000 since May, and the number
of acres burned to 474,462.
</P>
<P>
   Property losses are estimated at $276 million.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 101 people have been injured, almost all of them
firefighters, and 161 homes have been gutted or badly damaged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only one person has died. An elderly man in a Flagler County
nursing home died from an apparent heart attack as he was being
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's miraculous that there haven't been more
deaths,'' said McKay.
</P>
<P>
   In Flagler County, people with ruined and damaged houses
wondered how they would pay for the repairs that insurance did not
cover.
</P>
<P>
   John Livingston, 36, came home to find his house damaged but
standing. The heat around the house was so intense that the roof
warped and now leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But he found out Monday that he might qualify for a low-interest
loan from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a godsend,'' he said. ``I'm glad they're here
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman in Flagler County came home from the evacuation only
to find a new fire burning just feet from her house.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorms that so many people had prayed for also
brought lightning strikes, which ignited many of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the sprinkling of rain over the last week, Monday's
storms wet the ground enough to balance the risk of new fires,
firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   As business owners worried over the loss of business on the
Fourth of July holiday _ the Pepsi 400 stock-car race in nearby
Daytona was canceled and many hotels refunded money to visitors who
did not want to lie on beaches choked with smoke _ others gathered
in churches over the weekend to give thanks for whatever was spared
from the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Churches in Daytona Beach were full on Sunday, as worshippers
from evacuated areas came to pray. One older couple attending a
service in Daytona, Sam and Betty Haralampus, lost their home in
Palm Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can start over at our age,'' Betty Haralampus told The
Associated Press, ``these young people should stop their crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerney, like many residents in Bunnell, is accustomed to
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the fires in 1985, and I was pretty much used
to it,'' she said. But this time, ``we didn't have much time to get
out.''

<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ This windswept capital in the Namibian
desert is not the kind of arena where Michael Jackson normally
plays. And 500 buttoned-down executives and finance ministers
talking tariffs are not his usual audience. But the singer came in
May, striding up a conference room aisle in full fedora, lipstick
and Sgt. Pepper jacket, with a pushy entourage trailing along, to
give a quick speech deploring ``the plight of the children of the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended: ``My new business partner, Don Barden, and I are going
to be putting our money where our mouths are. We're going to be
looking at global investments that will bring economic development
to people and improvement to the lives of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Gloved One to declare himself the Global One _ and
getting the staid World Economic Forum to make that its kickoff
speech here at one of its many regional meetings _ was one of the
quirkiest public relations coups southern Africa has ever seen. But
the versatile entrepreneur who managed it has some interesting
quirks himself.
</P>
<P>
   Donald H. Barden, 54, is one of America's wealthiest black
executives. He is the founder of a privately held conglomerate, the
Barden Companies, based in Detroit, which had estimated sales last
year of $110 million and was No. 14 on Black Enterprise magazine's
1998 list of 100 biggest black-owned industrial/service companies.
Barden is also one of a tiny few who have taken up a challenge
thrown down to African-American entrepreneurs by Ronald H. Brown,
the late commerce secretary: Come back to Africa and build a
business.
</P>
<P>
   Some might think Barden has a fatal attraction for risk. He does
not see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is a real sleeper,'' he said during a joint
interview with Jackson in a small office in his Windhoek
car-rebuilding plant. ``Once the free-market system permeates, this
continent will be one of the world's most dynamic markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most of Barden's risks were confined to the
American Midwest. He grew up as one of 13 siblings in Inkster,
Mich., outside Detroit. He was captain of his high school
basketball and football teams, but had to drop out of Central State
University in Ohio in 1963 because he could not afford the tuition.
Living with a big brother in Lorain, Ohio, he was a mover and a
laborer before opening a record store, then starting a label and
venturing into public relations.
</P>
<P>
   That was all before he, by chance, heard that a military
recruiting station near his office was looking for new space.
Barden helped it find a spot, and in that switch to real estate he
finally began to make some real money.
</P>
<P>
   Barden later founded The Lorain County Times, a weekly, sat on
the Lorain City Council and became a television anchor, where he
realized the profit potential in cable television. In 1983, after
wiring some small Michigan towns, he won the right to wire 375,000
Detroit households in partnership with a Canadian cable company.
</P>
<P>
   Barden sold his share of the cable television business for $105
million in 1994. He now owns five Illinois radio stations, an
Arizona software company and an Ohio real estate company that has
built jails and fancy suburbs. In 1995, he entered the gaming
industry; his riverboat, the Majestic Star of Gary, Ind., is
America's first black-owned casino.
</P>
<P>
   Barden doesn't shy from fights. In 1995, he took on Donald J.
Trump, publicly accusing him of ``extortion'' for demanding $25
million as part of a deal to share a wharf site in Gary. Nor is he
shy about sometimes using race to his advantage. He did so to win
the Detroit cable franchise, and last year he accused the city's
mayor of failing blacks and native sons by denying him a casino
license.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Barden's entry into Africa seems
counterintuitive. He chose Namibia, a country of only 1.7 million
people, instead of the obvious place, South Africa, with its higher
income and its population of 40 million. On top of that, Barden is
going into businesses he has never been in before: a General Motors
dealership and sales of canned food, drinks and mattresses. And his
target markets include some of the poorest, most forgotten people
in the world: the suffering millions of war-torn Angola and Congo,
the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   But there is method to his seeming madness. As Barden is quick
to point out, Namibia has excellent roads, railways and phones, a
benign if arid climate and a deep-water port at Walvis Bay. It has
had eight years of democratic government and a currency linked to
the relatively stable South African rand. And, most important,
little Namibia really, really wants him.
</P>
<P>
   Barden's connection with the country began in 1989, when he held
a cocktail party at his home for the ambassador of the South West
Africa People's Organization, the movement fighting to liberate the
country from South African rule. The movement succeeded in 1990,
and six years later he invited President Sam Nujoma to Detroit and
arranged a tour of a General Motors plant. GM was looking for a
route back into southern Africa, and Namibia was interested _ but
only if it got an assembly plant. The market was too small for GM
to bother with, but Barden suggested splitting the difference: if
the Namibian government would buy 800 GM vehicles through him, he
would build a plant to convert them to right-hand drive.
</P>
<P>
   That appealed perfectly to one of the pet peeves of Nujoma, a
sometimes cranky, sometimes jovial former guerrilla: his resentment
of South Africa. White rule is gone, but South African corporations
still dominate the regional customs union, and the high tariffs set
to protect their Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes and Toyota local
assembly plants make cars in the whole subregion very pricey.
</P>
<P>
   Kano Audley Smith, managing director of the Namibian Barden
operations, said he could import GM cars, pay the duty, convert
them and still charge $1,000 to $18,000 less than a comparable
model from South Africa. ``If they were to price their vehicles
realistically, we'd be in trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter questioned the deal with Barden at a recent news
conference, President Nujoma cut her off, saying testily: ``We want
American products, not ones from those whites in South Africa. We
don't want to give our money back to white colonials. The cars are
cheaper, too _ you can go check.''
</P>
<P>
   About 125 pickups, police cars and school buses have already
been delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Barden says he has spent about $16 million to put together the
Windhoek plant and to train workers. But the car operation is
merely a foot in the African door, he says. He and Jackson envision
``investments eventually in the hundreds of millions,'' and are
particularly looking for casinos, resorts and theme parks. South
Africa's three major cities are granting casino licenses right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go 50-50 on everything,'' said Jackson, who once looked
into buying Sun City, the Indiana Jones-style casino resort complex
built in South Africa by Sol Kerzner, the South African casino
magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Barden were a little vague on how that would help
children, but Barden recovered, saying, ``If you're involved in
creating wealth, it puts you in a position to help the world.''
Because Jackson is a role model, he added, his focusing on business
would encourage children to grow up and do the same, leading to
economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no disputing, for all the controversy that has
surrounded Michael Jackson, that he is indeed a role model for
children. The crowds that came out to see him even in tiny Namibia
were bigger than any crowds here ever before, including at
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Barden said their next investment would be warehouses in a new
tax-free zone on the Angolan border. Namibia may be tiny, but there
are millions of people in Angola, the former Zaire and western
Zambia with little access to goods because central African roads
are atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was crazy to seek out these markets _ Zaire had a
fierce civil war last year and a low-intensity war in Angola has
dragged on for 24 years _ Barden said: ``You think that if they
have a civil war, they're going to stop coming across the border to
buy goods? They still have to have food, mattresses, stereos,
refrigerators and beer, don't they? And they pay in diamonds _ that
is, they pay in cash they got from diamonds. In U.S. dollars.
That's pretty attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Namibians back him up on that. Most Angolans are poor, but
``we're used to seeing Angolans in the oil and diamond business
driving into Namibia in big U.S. cars to shop,'' said Philip H.
Namundjebo, an official in Namibia's offshore development agency.
</P>
<P>
   By investing in Africa, Barden and Jackson have become a rare
breed. Lots of American corporations send black executives to
Africa, but few black-owned companies have invested here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pioneer,'' acknowledged Millard W. Arnold, head of the
U.S. Commerce Department's Johannesburg office. ``He's been fairly
astute in maximizing an opportunity in a country like Namibia.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few other black-owned companies came. Ebony magazine has
a South African edition, for example, but is not widely available.
</P>
<P>
   With a 121 percent sales increase in 1997, Carson Holdings,
based in Johannesburg, which makes Dark and Lovely and Let's Jam
hair products, is doing better in Africa than its parent, Carson
Inc., is in the United States. It is run by Malcolm Yesner, a white
Zambian, but owned by an investment group headed by Roy Keith, a
black American.
</P>
<P>
   Procter Houston, another American, who arrived in 1995 to
distribute institutional furniture and says he is doing about $1.5
million in sales a year, said a ``second wave'' of black
entrepreneurs was landing in southern Africa now. He came out of
curiosity about the new government, he said, and found an amenable
environment. The newcomers, mostly engineers and computer
specialists, began arriving in the last year, partly thanks to
Arnold's efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some black investors, however, have been badly stung. Pepsi
South Africa, for example, which drew in celebrity investors like
Whitney Houston, Bill Cosby and Johnnie Cochran, just could not
make inroads into Coca-Cola's market dominance, and closed in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Barden seems unworried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about being here because Africa is our
homeland,'' he said. ``But we don't come in doing a lot of talk.
This isn't the first time I've built a building, or a new business.
We're here to get a job done, and make money.''

KAY THOMPSON, AUTHOR OF `ELOISE' BOOKS, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kay Thompson, an entertainer who became the author of
the hugely successful book ``Eloise,'' about a bratty child living
at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, died Thursday. She lived on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan with her goddaughter, Liza Minnelli.
She was taken from the apartment to Lenox Hill Hospital, but her
longtime lawyer Arthur E. Abelman said it was unclear where she
died. She was between 92 and 95, Abelman, estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a St. Louis jeweler, Ms. Thompson was a pianist
with the St. Louis Symphony in 1928. ``I was a stage-struck kid,''
she recalled later, ``and I got out of St. Louis fast.''
</P>
<P>
   She became a singer with the Mills Brothers on radio, an
arranger and singer with Fred Waring's Band and co-producer of
``Kay Thompson and Company,'' a CBS radio show. She also worked as
an arranger and songwriter for ``The Ziegfeld Follies'' and other
movies, and performed in nightclubs, singing with the Williams
Brothers from 1947 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   As The New York Herald Tribune reported in 1958, ``Eloise's
birth was unexpected. At rehearsals of her act with the Williams
Brothers, Ms. Thompson prized punctuality. Then one day she was
late. In a high, childish voice that she had never used before, she
made her apology. One of her co-workers said, `Who are you, little
girl?' Ms. Thompson replied, `I am Eloise. I am 6.' The others
joined in the game, each assuming a juvenile identity, and it
became a regular rehearsal pastime.'' The routine became a book
after Ms. Thompson began performing in 1954 in a one-woman show at
the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   While she was appearing in the hotel's Persian Room, she was
introduced to an artist, Hilary Knight, and he became the
illustrator of ``Eloise,'' which was subtitled ``A Book for
Precocious Grown Ups.'' Ms. Thompson wrote the book during a
three-month break from performing.
</P>
<P>
   Later she wrote three other books about Eloise, which were also
illustrated by Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two years after ``Eloise'' came out, 150,OOO copies
were sold. Looking back in 1957, Publisher's Weekly said, ``As
everyone who can read must know, Eloise is an overprivileged
6-year-old, the terror of the Hotel Plaza in New York. She is also
ill-mannered, ill-tempered and ugly. But she has her charm. She
often means well, and her mother neglects her. Even though you know
that you would do the same thing if she were yours, you can't help
finding this appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Bouchard, a senior publicist at Simon &AMP; Schuster, Ms.
Thompson's publisher, said that according to records beginning in
1983, 592,000 copies of ``Eloise'' have been sold in the United
States since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The other Eloise books are ``Eloise in Paris'' (1957), ``Eloise
at Christmastime'' (1958) and ``Eloise in Moscow'' (1959).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson also wrote ``Kay Thompson's Miss Pooky Peckinpaugh
and Her Secret Private Boyfriends Complete with Telephone Numbers''
(1970), illustrated by Joe Eula.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson founded Eloise Ltd., which made recordings and
other products related to the Eloise character. In later years, Ms.
Thompson acted in movies, including ``Funny Face,'' and on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said her first marriage, in the 1930s, to Jack Jenney, a
band leader, ended in divorce, as did her later marriage to William
Spier, a radio writer and producer.

ROGERS' MUSIC WILL FOREVER RIDE THE RANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever country music takes on pop overtones, doomsayers warn
that it's ``Happy Trails'' for good for the western branch of
``country-western.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roy Rogers was bigger than a passing trend, and so is the
sagebrush music he romanticized in the '40s and '50s. Roy Rogers'
music is as durable as an old saddle, and his status as both a
member of a musical group and as a solo artist helped make him an
icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He epitomized the cowboy image and romanticized cowboy song,
just as much as Gene Autry,'' said Bob Pinson, a researcher and
library acquisitions chief for the Country Music Foundation in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is the only person elected to the Country Music Hall of
Fame twice: He was inducted into the hall as a member of the Sons
of the Pioneers in the early '80s, then later in the decade as a
solo act.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded for RCA Victor and for Decca during his career. His
standards include ``Don't Fence Me In,'' ``I'm an Old Cowhand (From
the Rio Grande)'' (with the Sons of the Pioneers), ``May the Good
Lord Take a Likin' to Ya,'' ``California Rose,'' ``Rock Me to Sleep
in My Saddle'' and of course, ``Happy Trails'' with Dale Evans (who
wrote it), the Whippoorwills &AMP; Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Although to admit it might be blasphemy in many circles, Roy
Rogers' baritone had greater range and a melodic quality that
Autry's voice lacked. Roy's best can be found on Rhino's four-CD
``Songs of the West'' collection, issued in 1993. One of the four
discs is dedicated entirely to Rogers and Gene Autry, and various
cuts are scattered through the other three CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get hold of ``Roll On, Texas Moon,'' on the German
Bear Family label, you'll have a fine collection of songs from nine
of Rogers' 1940s films.
</P>
<P>
   How versatile was he?
</P>
<P>
   Rogers furthered the cause of yodeling while with the Sons of
the Pioneers in the '30s. His own composition, ``Cowboy Night Herd
Song'' (1937), helped set the standard for future warblers.
</P>
<P>
   He could even swing a little, although self-consciously, as
exhibited by ``On the Old Spanish Trail'' from the 1947 movie of
the same title, with Spade Cooley and His Western Swing Band.
</P>
<P>
   MCA and the Country Music Hall of Fame issued a fine Rogers
retrospective CD in 1992, covering his career from the Sons of the
Pioneers to World War II. RCA's more commercial ``Tribute'' album
in 1991 included Clint Black, the Oak Ridge Boys and Lorrie Morgan
doing duets with Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' last chart recording, in fact, was his duet with Black,
a single called ``Hold On, Partner'' with an imaginative Old West
video of the two on horseback. Roy, then in his late 70s, still
looked noble, and Black looked like a younger version of Roy, with
smiling, squinty eyes above that broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Rogers' most enduring musical legacy is as a founder of
the Sons of the Pioneers. Modern-day groups Riders in the Sky (with
Rogers sound-alike Ranger Doug Green singing lead) and Sons of the
San Joaquin, as well as the still-intact Pioneers themselves, have
made a cottage industry of Southwestern harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   And a subculture of cowboy singers and poets has idealized Roy's
simple values into a quasi-religion, and their music delves back
even deeper than movie cowboys' romanticized vision. People like
Michael Martin Murphey, Red Steagall and Don Edwards are Roy's
soulmate successors, leaving behind what they see as the
mesquite-choked, fenced range that is contemporary country.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers' greatest farewell, and the one to listen to now
(with a hankie) is his 1974 single ``Hoppy, Gene and Me.'' A
poignant tribute to the singing cowboy era, it scored on both pop
and country charts. No one has ever recorded a more gentle, more
loving message to his fans than this.

Powell deal creates crowd in Astros' bullpen
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ The Astros' trade for Jay Powell was hardly a blockbuster.
But it could be enough to shore up the shakiest area on the club.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the season, Doug Henry was the only proven
righthander in a bullpen that featured four lefties. That's no
longer a problem following Sunday's acquisition of Powell, who
helped the Florida Marlins win the World Series last fall.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a scarcity is now a logjam. The acquisition of
Powell, who won Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, gives the Astros
eight relievers, including four righthanders _ Henry, Powell, Bob
Scanlan and rookie Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Like most teams, the Astros opened the season with six relief
pitchers. They have carried seven the last two weeks and will
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That said, one of the current relievers will be forced out when
the Astros re-set the roster at 25 players Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're going to stay with 12 pitchers,'' general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``There has to be a reason to make a
move, and we haven't missed having an extra position player. With
our lineup, it's hard to get playing time for our bench players, so
it's a more prudent course for us to go with an extra pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent additions of Elarton and Powell appear to have
lessened the role of Scanlan, who could be the odd man out. At the
same time, carrying 12 pitchers might make it difficult for manager
Larry Dierker to find work for everyone in his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros fear that scenario, they might decide to return
the highly touted Elarton to Class AAA New Orleans, where he could
get regular work.
</P>
<P>
   But Elarton's two scoreless relief appearances probably were
enough to buy him some more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we make our move, that doesn't necessarily mean
we're going to stay that way for a while,'' Hunsicker said. ``We'll
just have to see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the corresponding roster move, the Astros' bullpen
should be better with Powell, whom the Astros acquired along with
journeyman minor-league catcher Scott Makarewicz in exchange for
highly regarded catching prospect Ramon Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was one of the Astros' two first-round picks in 1994. The
other was Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good trade,'' All-Star second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``We needed a little righthanded help in the bullpen.
We did really well in the first half and it's good to see them
(Astros management) add a player who might help us in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powell is a good pitcher. He throws hard, and he has a good
slider and sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Astros is more familiar with Powell than All-Star
left fielder Moises Alou, who played with Powell last season in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job for us in Florida last season, and I think
he'll do a great job for us in Houston,'' Alou said. ``He did very
well for us in the playoffs and it's always good to have players
who have done well in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to the playoffs this season, and Jay is a
guy who can help us get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker has been eyeing Powell, who will earn $320,000 this
season, since spring training. But the Marlins were reluctant to
listen to offers until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros believed they could afford to part with Castro
because New Orleans catcher Mitch Meluskey is closer to reaching
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity for us to add a good, young arm to our
staff,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think he'll be a nice complement to
Doug Henry in our bullpen. He gives us another good setup man that
we can use in the seventh and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Powell into a winning environment and giving him a
chance to work with (manager) Larry Dierker and (pitching coach)
Vern Ruhle is only going to make him better. We gave up a good,
young catcher in Castro, but we're trying to win this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker still would like to add a top-notch starter to the
rotation, but most players who fit into that category are
unavailable or too expensive.

MARKET PLACE: WALL ST. VIEW OF SAKS SALE _ NO BIG BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Stock chart for Proffitt's is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his deal to acquire the glitzy Saks Holdings
Inc., Brad Martin, chairman of Proffitt's Inc., the Southern
department-store chain, has given his company a major makeover.
Proffitt's shareholders, though, seem to view the merger as the
Wall Street equivalent of a fashion don't.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's stock fell $4 in heavy trading Monday after the deal
was announced. It closed at $36.6875, down 9.6 percent from its
closing price of $40.6875 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Saks' shareholders will get 0.82
share of Proffitt's stock for each Saks share. Proffitt's will
issue 52.5 million shares, putting a price tag of about $2 billion
on the deal. And the company will change its name to Saks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's investor reaction was a surprising putdown for Martin,
given that the company's share price has risen almost 60 percent in
the first half of the year. Since 1994, the company has acquired
five major department-store chains, and the stock has mostly gone
straight up. It bought Carson Pirie Scott, the Milwaukee-based
department-store chain, early this year without the stock missing a
beat.
</P>
<P>
   So why are investors stampeding out on news of the Saks deal?
</P>
<P>
   They seem to dislike a couple of aspects of the deal. Most
important is the price. In its bid for Saks, which includes 96
stores and a mail-order business called Folio, Proffitt's is paying
1.3 times the revenues of Saks in the last 12 months and 13 times
its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   That is much richer than Martin's past acquisitions. In the
Carson Pirie Scott purchase, for instance, he paid 0.8 times
revenues and nine times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. Getting retailers on the cheap has
worked well for Martin and allowed him to expand Proffitt's
business to 234 stores in 24 states as well as to increase the
company's earnings by 20 percent on average over each of the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving hard bargains has allowed Martin to keep operating
margins high as he melds operations and cuts overlap. Proffitt's
margins of almost 12 percent are well above the 7.4 percent
industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that the Saks acquisition will depress Proffitt's
earnings helped drive down the stock Monday. Although Proffitt's
said it expected the acquisition to add a penny or two to earnings
per share in the fourth quarter of 1998, and 3 to 5 cents a share
next year, some Wall Street analysts say the deal could dilute
earnings for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   If paying up is something new for Martin, so is buying a
high-fashion emporium like Saks. The other acquisitions by
Proffitt's, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., have been names few
on Fifth Avenue would recognize: G.R. Herberger's, based in St.
Cloud, Minn.; Younkers Department Stores of Iowa, and Parisian, a
chain found throughout the South. Buying a trendy store like Saks
not only may bring Proffitt's into the big time, but it may also
bring a greater chance of fashion flubs that can cause earnings
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   This was one reason Jeffrey Edelman, who follows retailing
stocks at Paine Webber, downgraded Proffitt's stock Monday from a
``buy'' rating to ``attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Longer-term there are some very interesting possibilities in
the acquisition,'' Edelman said. ``But Saks is not the traditional
department-store acquisition Brad Martin has made. The fashion
business adds more risk to the profile.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the purchase is another worry. For the 12 months
ended May 2, Proffitt's generated sales of $3.6 billion and net
income of $140 million. During that period, Saks Holdings had sales
of $2.3 billion and net income of $57 million.

   Jeff Glik, president of Glik's Stores, a department-store chain
with 57 outlets in the Midwest, said: ``Coming right on top of the
Carson acquisition in the spring, they're really stretching their
organization on this one. Brad Martin is the best in the industry
when it comes to working with people, but this one will be a lot of
work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Furthermore, this acquisition may not afford as much room for
savings as Proffitt's other buyouts. Martin said he expected cost
savings at the combined operations of $10 million to $12 million in
1998; $60 million to $70 million in 1999, and $75 million to $85
million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a
market research firm in New York, said: ``The reality is Saks is
not some underperforming laggard like Proffitt's has bought in the
past. So the question is: Can you squeeze a whole lot of expense
percent out of that?''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of the merger, according to Martin, is the
ability to sell the Saks catalog merchandise to the 5.2 million
credit-card customers of Proffitt's. But the recent experience of
Saks with its Folio catalog has been disappointing. Arnold Fishman
of Marketing Logistics Inc. in Highland Park, Ill., says Saks is
dead last among department stores in sales through stand-alone
national catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus sold $155 million by catalog last year;
Bloomingdale's by Mail generated revenues of $140 million;
Nordstrom did $115 million, and sales at Saks came in at just under
$100 million. ``Saks has grown very slowly over the past five
years,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the catalog potential, Proffitt's stock may remain
under pressure. Why? The matter of the big stake held by Investcorp
International of Bahrain. It and its affiliates own 18 percent of
Saks Holdings, and they hold 27 percent more for clients. Once
those shares are exchanged for 24 million Proffitt's shares, how
long will it be before they hit the market? Investcorp is known for
stakes in luxury-goods retailers, like Tiffany &AMP; Co., not in
mundane department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the 52.5 million shares to be issued and the stock that
Proffitt's already has outstanding, the holdings of Investcorp and
its affiliates and clients will amount to almost 17 percent of the
retailer's total shares. That's some potential sell order.

between species that otherwise look alike. Scientists have long

   SCI-ICE-SHEET (Undated) _ If the earth's temperature heats up as
mainstream scientists predict it will over the next century, the
average level of the world's oceans could rise by about a foot and
a half by 2100, and somewhat more after that, as glaciers partly
melt and the heating makes sea water expand, inundating many
low-lying coastal areas. But it would be trivial compared with the
melting or collapse of the huge West Antarctic ice sheet, the
Godzilla of the game of rising seas. This would loose so much water
into the oceans that they would rise by a truly catastrophic 16 to
20 feet. By William K. Stevens.

   SCI-AIDS-DIABETES (Undated) _ As disturbing and devastating as
the disfigurement may be to some people taking a protease inhibitor
for HIV, the cosmetic changes may be the least worrisome part.
Doctors are worried about more serious, even potentially fatal,
changes in fat metabolism. A small but growing number of studies
find that many such individuals have high levels of cholesterol and
lipids in the blood and other metabolic changes that may increase
the risk of diabetes. The findings are among those revealed at the
12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNS-HEALTH (Undated) _ This is New Year's week at your local
hospital, where July 1 marks a new beginning just as fraught with
symbolism and expectation as Jan. 1 elsewhere. Medical schools end
in June and hospital training programs start in July; last week
everyone in them lurched a step forward. Studies show the month is
no more dangerous than any others, but memories of the grueling
training linger.

   UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD TRIES TO STOP TOUGHER REGULATION
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to fend off demands for tougher federal regulation,
Union Pacific Railroad said that traffic congestion was easing,
capacity expanding and competition with rival carriers
intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   But many customers disagree. The industry's main regulator, the
Surface Transportation Board, has set Wednesday as the deadline for
complaints. The board will decide whether it should offer more
relief for the railroad's customers and tighter control over the
entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   THE SELLING OF THREE MILE ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   GPU Inc. is hoping to sell Unit 1 of Three Mile Island, which
was not involved in the nuclear-power-plant accident that occurred
in March 1979 when operators failed to close a pressure-relief
valve, allowing a million gallons of cooling water to escape and
causing the radioactive core to reach 5,000 degrees. It also wants
to sell the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in Forked River, N.J.
Analysts are speculating that one of the potential buyers is Peco
Energy of Philadelphia, which operates two nuclear plants in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Power, the United States' second-largest operator of
nuclear plants, has filed the first application to extend the life
of a nuclear plant. The three-unit Oconee nuclear power station in
western South Carolina has been producing power for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   FORD SALES JUMPED 9.8 PERCENT IN JUNE
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported a 9.8 percent increase in June car and light-truck
sales from June 1997, pushing total U.S. car and truck sales last
month to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 16.7 million,
its highest rate in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   GROWTH IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY SLOWS
</P>
<P>
   Business activity at nonmanufacturing companies in June expanded
at a slower pace than in May, the National Association of
Purchasing Management reported.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P 500 REACHES RECORD HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Investor optimism lifted stocks and sent the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index up 10.91 points, to a new high of 1,157.33. The Dow
Jones industrial average increased 66.51 points, to 9,091.77. The
Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily laden with technology
issues, rose 15.47 points, to 1,909.47, and is just 8.14 points
away from its April 22 record.
</P>
<P>
   30-YEAR BOND YIELD FALLS TO 5.57 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.57 percent,
from 5.60 percent Thursday, matching the low set on June 15 _ the
lowest it has been since the government began regular sales of
securities in 1977. The bond's price rose 12/32, to 107 31/32, with
much of that attributed to weakness in the Japanese yen compared
with the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   HEAT WAVE HURTS UTILITIES
</P>
<P>
   Two Midwestern utilities, Firstenergy and Illinova, said that
they had suffered huge losses from having to buy power on the open
market during the recent heat wave when prices surged. The
companies said the losses would result in lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   VIAGRA PRESCRIPTIONS AT 2.9 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, Pfizer's drug to remedy male impotence, broke all sales
records in its first three months, according to an industry
consultant. Prescriptions for Viagra from April through June
totaled 2.9 million, for estimated sales of $259.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   FAA PLAN ENCOUNTERS HURDLES
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is trying to replace its
aging nationwide network of radio beacons and other navigation aids
with a satellite-based system. But some aviation experts think that
the new system will not be reliable, and they want the government
to maintain both systems.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIMISM OVER APPLE COMPUTER
</P>
<P>
   When Apple Macintosh fans gather on Wednesday, many will be
optimistic because the company appears to have stabilized its
management team, cut costs, made some money and halted a
precipitous decline in market share.

LOUIS GOLDSTEIN, 85, MARYLAND COMPTROLLER FOR 40 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md.) (fb) 
By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Louis L. Goldstein, an indelible figure in Maryland
politics as well as one of the longest-serving state officials in
American history, died on Friday night at his home in Prince
Frederick, Md. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   As comptroller of Maryland for 40 years, Goldstein was the state
tax collector. He won his first four-year term in 1958 to start a
storied career, interrupted only briefly, in 1964, by his campaign
for the U.S. Senate. In the only election he ever lost, he was
defeated in the Democratic primary by the eventual winner in the
November general election, Joseph D. Tydings.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein _ ``Call me Louie,'' as he always insisted _ combined
a jovial personality and sharp financial skills to win re-election
as comptroller 10 times, usually without much of a fight from
either party. Just last month, he announced he would seek an 11th
term, and not a single Democrat stepped up to challenge him in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   He was so popular that Monday he became the state's first
elected official to lie in state under the Rotunda of the Maryland
Statehouse in Annapolis. A funeral was scheduled for Tuesday in
Prince Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   Generally credited for being a wise financial overseer, he was
fiercely proud of the state's consistent AAA bond rating for
Maryland, one of the few states with such a high rating, which
saved taxpayers millions of dollars in interest over the years.
</P>
<P>
   For all his financial abilities, Goldstein was best known around
the state as an indefatigable campaigner who traveled as many as
100,000 miles a year by car even in nonelection years. He gave as
many as 300 speeches each year and always had a pocketful of
gold-colored coins to give out, inscribed with the line he used to
close many of his speeches, ``God bless you all real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, campaigning in western Maryland, he drew quizzical stares
from a small crowd that had gathered to hear him in a rural town.
He realized later that he had inadvertently crossed into West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   At his office in Annapolis, he often answered his own telephone
and instructed secretaries not to ask who was calling, just put
through calls from anyone who wanted to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at his condominium in Ocean City, Md., in his last
interview, Goldstein discussed his political career and attributed
his success to advice given to him as an 11-year-old child by his
father, Goodman, an immigrant from Prussia who became a store owner
in southern Maryland. Young Louis worked in the store until he went
off to Washington College in Chestertown, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me to be kind, be polite, remember people's name,
remember their children and their backgrounds,'' Goldstein said.
``I still do that the same way, give people responsibility,
accountability and service. How can you beat that?''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Lazerus Goldstein was born on March 14, 1913, in Prince
Frederick after his family had settled there by chance. His father,
after receiving a peddler's license, was hired by a Baltimore store
and assigned the sparsely populated territory of Calvert County to
sell its goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no more of an idea what it was like where he was going
than astronauts going to the moon,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's interest in politics was sparked by radio accounts
of the 1928 presidential campaign between Herbert Hoover and Alfred
E. Smith. Goldstein said he worked his county for Smith, and four
years later he volunteered to campaign for Franklin D. Roosevelt.
By 1936, he said he began travelling all around the state for
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Goldstein graduated from the University of
Maryland Law School and began his own political career, winning
election to the Maryland House of Delegates. After one four-year
term, he joined the Marines to serve in World War II, and then
returned to politics in 1946, winning the first of three
consecutive four-year terms to the state senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election is tough,'' he said. ``In love, war and
politics, you never know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goldstein, at least, two of those three became rather
predictable. He was married more than 48 years to Hazel Horton
Goldstein, who died in April 1996. It was largely in deference to
her that he decided earlier that year not to seek a 10th term. But
after she died, he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very wonderful married life,'' he said. ``But she
would not have wanted me sitting on my back side. She would have
wanted me doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is survived by a son, Philip Goldstein of Chesapeake
Beach, Md., and two daughters, Louisa Goldstein of Baltimore, and
Margaret Janney of College Park, Md.

TRUE ROLE MODEL RIDES OFF INTO THE SETTING SUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was kid, I WAS Roy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   It was as simple, and as sublime, as that.
</P>
<P>
   I galloped a stick horse named Trigger around the house where we
lived in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Socks, my devoted collie-shepherd mix, was transformed into
Bullet and happily frolicked with me as we chased bandits out of
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   I daydreamed of the day I would meet my own Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Countless cool afternoons were spent in the darkness of the
Cactus Theater in downtown Carlsbad, watching Roy and Gabby Hayes
and the gang put the bad guys behind bars where they belonged.
</P>
<P>
   I combed my hair like he did, with that wave in the front. I
dismounted from my ``Trigger'' like he did. I even tried to sing
like he did, with that wondrous silky smooth voice and intense
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So when I heard Monday that Rogers, the ``King of the Cowboys,''
had died, my stomach did a slow flip-flop and then stuck in my
throat.
</P>
<P>
   I was fortunate to have plenty of excellent role models in my
family, but I wanted to grow up to be just like Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck off in the southeastern corner of nowhere in the early
'50s, I didn't know much about professional sports. Oh sure, I'd
heard of Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle and I would come to idolize
Hank Aaron and Eddie Mathews, but that was later.
</P>
<P>
   For at least half a dozen years, from the time I was old enough
to form my fingers into the semblance of a six-shooter and loop a
shoestring around a broomstick, turning it into a trusty palomino
steed, it was Roy Rogers who taught me as much as anyone about
right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He was Dudley Doright in our house long before the first TV set
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   My greatest lament today is that my own sons, growing up in a
far more complicated world, didn't have a Roy Rogers to emulate and
learn from.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize it at the time but Roy, with his bandana
knotted around his neck, his six-shooters tied low around his waist
and his guitar always handy at the campfire, was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry and Champion were OK and when television came along
with Hopalong, the Lone Ranger and the Cisco Kid, I certainly
watched. But none of them could touch Roy. He had a certain
charisma about him that simply eluded the rest of the silver screen
cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   That's why for a dozen years, between 1943 and 1954, he was the
No. 1 western star at the box office and starred in 87 films during
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Roy and Dale, Trigger and Bullet, Gabby and Pat, they were
household names across America. Sure, the movies were corny and
predictable, but when you were six and you sat in that darkened
theater, with your popcorn and your Coke, it just didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   All you cared about was that Roy and his crew were about to
teach the bad guys a lesson in good manners.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of shooting, but no blood was shed in a Roy
Rogers movie. There were no gaping wounds and if a bad guy died, he
did it discreetly. Most of the time Roy just shot the guns out of
their hands or walloped them in a good, old-fashioned fistfight.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, he disliked violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy,'' Rogers once said, ``our parents taught us
that hitting below the belt was a cowardly thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers never hit below the belt. Never.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those of us who grew up watching Roy didn't know then
that his real name was Leonard Slye, or that before he broke into
movies he was a truck driver and peach picker.
</P>
<P>
   We just knew that he represented what was right about America.
There was no gray between right and wrong in those days. Things
were as black and white as the hats the actors wore.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a far simpler time, before we lost the Kennedys and
Martin Luther King, before Vietnam and Watergate. We were lucky
then. We didn't grow up knowing about drugs, and HIV. There was no
movie rating system because it wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he quit making movies, Roy Rogers was still the same.
He and Dale had the All-American family, raising nine children,
several of them adopted. They believed in God and didn't apologize
for it.
</P>
<P>
   They lived, of course, in Apple Valley in California, where you
figured the sun was always shining, and you could always drop by
and visit Trigger at the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Old Trigger was gone but hardly buried. Roy had him stuffed and
posed, rearing on his hind legs, like he did at the end of so many
pictures with Rogers on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't bear to put him in the ground,'' Roy said, and
those of us who had been Roy Rogers ourselves, for a short period
in our lives, understood perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   I wish now that I'd done the same with that old stick horse of
mine.
</P>
<P>
   You don't ever say goodbye to a friend like that.
</P>
<P>
   You just say, ``Happy trails to you, 'til we meet again.''

HE TOOK TO THE SCREEN LIKE A COWBOY TO HIS SADDLE

c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man we came to know as Roy Rogers was down and out in LA
when an accidental meeting turned his life around.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Spencer and Bob Nolan, a musical duo on station KHJ, were in
the studio when Rogers, then known as Len Slye, flunked an audition
for a pop music program. They liked what they heard, so the duo
became a trio. But when Tim, Bob and Len added brothers Hugh and
Carl Farr and became the Sons of the Pioneers, they caught on in a
big way.
</P>
<P>
   They were different, limning western _ not country, not
hillbilly, but ``western'' _ songs, including many that have
attained permanence in our popular culture, including ``Tumbling
Tumbleweeds,'' ``Cool Water,'' ``Chant of the Wanderer.'' Roy
Rogers was in the ensemble only three years, but that was when the
Sons began recording with RCA Victor. Roy was their tenor, pure of
voice and strong when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republic Pictures was formed in 1935, with a
specialty in quickie westerns, those pointed at the
Saturday-matinee kiddie trade. Republic started with one bankable
cowboy star _ John Wayne. Then, the new company experimented
successfully with the concept of a singing cowboy: ``Tumbling
Tumbleweeds'' in 1935 was Gene Autry's first starring vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Autry movies proved so popular that Republic decided to
launch a second series with a warbling ranger. Seeking a ``new
face'' as well as a suitable voice, the company tabbed Len Slye as
the ``next Autry'' and changed his movie name to Roy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, after he had learned to ride a horse, ``Come On,
Rangers'' introduced Roy as a new star. Next came ``Under Western
Stars,'' and the verdict was in: Roy was a hit, and Republic would
continue to ``build'' its new and likable personality.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republic had not envisioned making major films, its
loan of John Wayne to Walter Wanger and John Ford for the epochal
``Stagecoach'' had brought unexpected stature to Wayne. So in 1940,
the company produced ``Dark Command'' as a superwestern, brought in
the renowned Raoul Walsh to direct, and assembled a star cast
including Wayne, Claire Trevor, Walter Pidgeon, Marjorie Main ...
and Roy Rogers as Trevor's troubled younger brother. He was swamped
by the other players' authority, so it was back to the quickie
mill, where his star continued on an upward trajectory until he
surpassed Autry in popularity and became ``King of the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a definite shift in the type of western in
which Roy Rogers appeared. His apprentice films usually were period
pieces, with Roy often a cavalryman. But his high-flying 1940s
entries were more sophisticated, with modern settings, elaborate
decor and Roy outfitted in custom-designed western regalia.
</P>
<P>
   The titles had a romantic ring _ ``The Yellow Rose of Texas,''
``Bells of Rosarita,'' ``Song of Nevada.'' The Sons of the Pioneers
of later edition were still around, giving musical support.
Automobiles were on the scene, but Roy usually rode to the rescue
or any other cliffhanger climax on Trigger, ``the smartest horse in
the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1944's ``The Cowboy and the Senorita,'' his leading lady for
the first of many times was Dale Evans, whom he married three years
later. They were etched as one of filmland's happiest couples, and
they certainly were resilient. When westerns dried up, after nearly
100 films, Roy and Dale formed their own TV company and rode to
fantastic business success in western products _ cattle,
thoroughbred horses, rodeos and a prolific restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew him said it couldn't have happened to a nicer
guy.

CLINTON TO SIGN DIRECTIVE AIMED AT CURBING HEALTH INSURANCE
ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to insert new 16th graf describing provisions of
Kassebaum-Kennedy bill) (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will punish health insurance
companies that deny coverage to sick people, in violation of a 1996
law, by excluding them from the lucrative insurance market for
federal employees, administration officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The law was intended to make insurance more readily available to
millions of Americans who change or lose their jobs. But federal
and state officials said they saw worrisome signs that some health
insurance companies were circumventing the law. They said some
companies discouraged sales to eligible individuals, charged very
high premiums or penalized insurance agents selling coverage to
customers with pre-existing medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a directive to be issued on Tuesday, Clinton will order the
Federal Office of Personnel Management, which negotiates health
benefits for federal employees and their dependents, to use its
purchasing power to ``insure that health plans come into
compliance'' with the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The main authors of the health insurance measure, the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law, were Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Kansas
Republican who retired from the Senate last year, and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's draft order says, all health plans that insure
federal employees will have to certify that they are complying with
the Kassebaum-Kennedy law in their private insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically,'' it continues, ``I direct OPM to take all
appropriate action, up to and including termination of a
participating health plan from the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program,'' if it finds that any insurer is violating the
letter and spirit of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal employee program is the nation's largest
employer-sponsored health insurance program, covering nine million
people through 350 health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has agreed
to inform the federal government of any violations found by state
officials. Glenn Pomeroy, president of the association, said, ``We
are pleased to work with the administration in a partnership to
make sure that everyone entitled to the protections of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law gets them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy, the insurance commissioner of North Dakota, said state
officials would be asked to inform the federal government whenever
they imposed fines or other penalties on insurers for violating the
standards set in the 1996 law. Most states have written the federal
standards into state law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intends to have the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which oversees state regulation of health
insurance, tell the Office of Personnel Management about any
insurance companies that flout the 1996 law in the states that have
not revised their laws. Missouri, California and Rhode Island are
among the states that have not revised their laws to conform with
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials said they could not immediately
identify companies that had violated the 1996 law. But state
officials said they would probably discover violations when they
investigate complaints or conduct routine examinations of insurers'
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action, the White House on Monday announced an
effort to help more than three million people get assistance in
paying Medicare premiums. The assistance is available to elderly
and disabled people with low incomes (up to $11,108 a year for an
individual and $14,888 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   Medicare premiums now total $525.60 a year and are expected to
increase over the next decade, to $1,268 a year in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new effort came in response to a highly
critical report by a consumer group, Families USA, which said that
the government was overcharging poor elderly people nearly $2
billion a year by deducting Medicare premiums from their Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said that
many elderly people did not seek the federal assistance because
they were unaware of it or feared they would be stigmatized for
going to welfare offices to apply for it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kassebaum-Kennedy law guarantees that people losing group
health insurance will have access to coverage in the individual
insurance market, regardless of pre-existing medical problems, but
it does not specify how much they may be charged. The law generally
guarantees that people moving from one job to another will be
promptly eligible for coverage through the new employer if the
company provides health benefits to employees.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill on Aug. 21, 1996,
he said, ``It will eliminate the possibility that individuals can
be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing medical
condition.'' He said the law would help up to 25 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, found that some insurers were shunning the very people
who were supposed to benefit from the law. Rep. Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn., said: ``I am outraged at the mockery that some insurance
companies are making of the law in some states. How can health
coverage be accessible if it costs $15,000 a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the law appeared to be ``working well for the vast
majority of Americans'' in the group insurance market, allowing
them to move from job to job without having to worry about losing
coverage. Most of the problems, he said, involve ``price gouging''
in the individual insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Kennedy introduced a bill to limit the premiums that
may be charged to people who leave their jobs and try to buy
insurance on their own. The limit would be 50 percent above the
rates charged to people in good health. Insurers vehemently oppose
such federal regulation, as do many Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have told agents that they will reduce
or eliminate the commissions they receive for selling insurance to
small groups or to people with medical problems. In March, the
Clinton administration sent a bulletin to insurers and state
officials saying it regarded such practices as a violation of the
1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Stokes Trautwein, director of federal policy analysis
at the National Association of Health Underwriters, which
represents 15,000 agents and brokers, said on Monday that despite
that warning, some insurers were still ``reducing commissions to an
abnormally low level'' for coverage sold to small businesses with
two to nine employees. ``This is contrary to the spirit'' of the
1996 law, she said.

AFTER JUDICIAL ODYSSEY, A SECOND TRIAL IN A NEW JERSEY OFFICER'S
DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of his alibi witnesses are dead, crucial evidence has been
lost and the police officers who arrested him have long since
retired. But after a 22-year legal odyssey that has taken him from
courtroom to prison to freedom and back again, Vincent James
Landano will go on trial again Tuesday for a murder he has
consistently maintained he never committed.
</P>
<P>
   Landano is charged with shooting a Newark police officer, John
Snow, during the robbery of a check-cashing office in Kearny, N.J.,
in August 1976. As he has since he was first arrested shortly after
the murder, he insists he was framed and was never anywhere near
the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of the Snow murder in 1977, Landano served nearly 13
years of a life sentence before he was ordered released by a
federal judge who ruled that the prosecution had suppressed
evidence that might have persuaded the trial jury to acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   Now a graying 58-year-old with a wife, Camille, a little dog
named Sparky, a newly purchased house in Manville and a steady job
as a paralegal, Landano said he expected to be vindicated and
regain control over his own life. ``I've been fighting for 22 years
_ half of my life _ and I'll be damned if they are going to beat
me,'' he vowed. ``I'm not going into it to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Landano was freed in 1989, a series of Hudson County
prosecutors have continued to pursue him, maintaining in court
hearing after court hearing that there was convincing eyewitness
and physical evidence of his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The ``interests of justice and fair play will be best served''
by presenting the evidence again to a grand jury, Donald Gardner,
an assistant county prosecutor, said in early 1996. Later that
year, a grand jury indicted Landano once again.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be heard by Judge Shirley Tolentino of Superior
Court in Jersey City, in a small windowed courtroom where for the
last month the lawyers have toiled to find jurors with no prior
knowledge of the case. Only last week, they assembled a jury pool
of 48 people, who will be winnowed down Tuesday just before opening
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Landano case has outlasted all the original judges,
prosecutors and defense lawyers and gained a special notoriety, not
only for its staying power but for the hostility that has grown up
among the players.
</P>
<P>
   At various times, Landano's lawyers have accused the prosecution
of coaching witnesses and planting evidence. Prosecutors have
demanded that judges order the defense not to discuss the case and
once elicited sympathy from a judge who scolded the defense for
trying to ``demonize'' the Hudson County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   And Landano, who since his release has worn an electronic device
that permits the authorities to monitor his movements, is as openly
bitter about his experience as he is steadfast about his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been done the wrong,'' he said. ``I haven't done the
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, the prosecutor, was not available for comment Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Landano was an unemployed construction worker trying to kick a
drug habit when he was first arrested in connection with the death
of Snow, a 23-year veteran of the Newark Police Department who was
shot at close range outside the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service in
Kearny.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, in uniform and in a marked patrol car but off-duty,
was apparently making a scheduled delivery of $46,000 to the owner
of the office. He drove up just as two men were robbing the office.
One of the robbers ran up to the cruiser, shot Snow through the
neck, jumped into a stolen car and fled with his accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Landano maintained he was never at the scene and
was being framed by members of a Staten Island motorcycle gang that
called itself ``The Breed.'' Landano said he did know one of the
gang leaders, a childhood friend named Victor Forni who was later
arrested and convicted of helping to plan the robbery. But he said
he never knew other gang members, although one of them named
Landano as his accomplice in the robbery and the gunman in the Snow
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed the first trial, the case took on a
new life with enough twists and turns to qualify for a
made-for-television script.
</P>
<P>
   Landano met a West Orange, N.J., lawyer who was visiting another
client in prison. The lawyer, Neil Mullin, was intrigued with his
story and took Landano on as a client _ and a personal crusade _
for free. ``It was my life's work,'' Mullin said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Landano's wife, who met him when she attended a
prison basketball game staged to benefit a charity she supported,
Mullin searched for holes in the case. Eventually, he found enough
to convince Judge H. Lee Sarokin of U.S. District Court that
crucial evidence had been suppressed by the prosecution, including
evidence that cast doubt on the credibility of some state witnesses
and showed that some had expressed doubts about their
identification of Landano.
</P>
<P>
   Then the name of Forni, the gang leader, reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after Landano had already been indicted for the second
time, documents were made available to the defense from a drug
trafficking investigation in Florida. They included a statement
from an undercover sheriff's detective who said Forni had bragged
to him in 1988 that he had ``killed the cop in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors have said they do not believe he was the gunman,
and Forni, who served eight months in prison for his role in the
robbery, is listed as a potential state witness in the new trial,
as are two of his former gang cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the witnesses from the first trial will be heard by
the jury only through their 22-year-old words, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some are dead, including three people who had testified that
Landano was with them at the time of the robbery and murder in
Kearny. So is the owner of the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service, who
was present during the robbery. One witness, who recounted the
motorcycle gang's past robberies, was found hanged in his prison
cell in what the authorities said appeared to be a homicide.
Physical evidence is missing, as are some tape recordings that
could have been of use to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Casteleiro, Landano's trial lawyer, said he could not talk
about specific trial strategy. But he said the passage of time
presented challenges to both sides, as even the memories of living
witnesses are hazier than before and the trail of the crime has
grown colder.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have looked to forensic tools that were unavailable
at the first trial, including DNA testing and high-tech computer
enhancements of photographs, but have not made any major
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Landano said he pinned much of his hope for acquittal on the
possibility that the jurors would hear what he has gone through for
the last 22 years. Tolentino has said either side may bring up in
open court that Landano has been convicted and that the conviction
had been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time did not stand still after 1976,'' she said last month in
pretrial arguments in court.
</P>
<P>
   Landano said he wants little more than to make that clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the truth _ to put to rest who didn't kill
Officer John Snow,'' he said last week. Then he added, ``Hopefully
who I am and what has been done to me will all become facts
presented to the jury.''

DUKE TESTS NUCLEAR AGENCY ON RENEWING PLANT LICENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duke Power, the United States' second-largest operator of
nuclear plants, filed an application Monday to extend the life of
its biggest nuclear plant, which has been producing power for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   No utility has gone through the long, laborious and expensive
process of having a license renewed by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and the application by Duke Power, a unit of Duke
Energy Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., is seen as an initiative whose
outcome could determine the future of nuclear energy in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's progress in getting the license renewed, which would
enable it to operate the three-unit Oconee nuclear power station in
western South Carolina for another 20 years, will be watched by
other utilities that must decide whether to seek renewal or
decommission their nuclear plants and build non-nuclear operations
to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   There are big stakes involved for utilities, consumers and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   For many utilities, nuclear plants are the cheapest generators
of electricity and have become more attractive as the industry
deregulates.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Colvin, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy
Institute, an industry trade and lobbying group, said most nuclear
plants could produce electricity at about 1.9 cents a
kilowatt-hour, less than natural-gas plants, which average about 3
cents a kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can beat any competitor coming at you,'' Colvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some utilities have chosen to decommission their aging nuclear
plants, which can be very costly. Building new plants is also
expensive. Consumers would probably bear most of the cost through
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   For environmentalists, closing older plants would reduce the
amount of nuclear waste that must be disposed of. It could also
result, however, in building more coal-fired plants, which emit
carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on the outcome, Duke has given itself a
great deal of lead time. By filing for a license renewal with the
NRC now, it hopes to complete the process in three years, well
before its 40-year license to operate the three units of its Oconee
Nuclear station expires in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Oconee, which was built in 1973, is capable of producing 2,538
megawatts of power. It has produced 24 percent of the electricity
used by Duke's 2 million customers in North and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tuckman, the executive vice president for nuclear
generation at Duke, said in a telephone conference Monday that the
plant would be a test case for the industry in how the licensing
procedure would work and whether the standards set by the
commission would be economical to meet.
</P>
<P>
   He said that before filing for its application, Duke had asked
other utilities to review and comment on it because they would have
to decide whether to seek renewals as well. If Duke encounters
difficulty in the renewal process, other utilities might decide not
to make a similar effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In April, another utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric, filed to
renew the license for its Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, which can
produce 1,875 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   And the largest operator of nuclear plants, Commonwealth Edison
of Chicago, a subsidiary of Unicom Corp., said Monday that it would
sell its six coal-fired plants, which have a book value of about
$1.1 billion, and use the money to improve the performance of its
nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC oversees 107 working nuclear plants that produce 22
percent of the nation's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has prepared for its renewal effort by consulting with the
staff of the commission on how to measure the wear and durability
of equipment in plants. Tuckman, however, said the process could
extend another three years, through hearings, inspections and
tests.
</P>
<P>
   He said the utility had already spent $8 million preparing its
filing, which will be delivered to the commission in Washington on
Tuesday. He said the utility expected to spend another $8 million

   Tuckman added that the plant had been continually upgraded
during its life and that the utility must demonstrate that it could
be maintained in good condition another 20 years after its license
expires in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The plant has generally had a solid safety record, but it had
some accidents in recent years. A steam line ruptured in 1995 and
seven workers were injured, several seriously. In 1990, a line
became disconnected from a reactor head and radioactive water
leaked but was kept and treated in the containment building.

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER DAMAGING DAMAGES BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leadership and the White House are rushing to win
approval of a new, slimmer product liability bill that omits some
offensive provisions from prior versions, but still retains their
main defect. Like its flawed predecessors, the new proposal would
cut back on the rights of consumers and weaken the ability of
juries in civil suits to punish the makers and sellers of unsafe
products.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars in campaign donations are pouring into
Congress, making this a fight between small-business lobbyists and
trial lawyers. But Congress' appetite for special-interest dollars
should not obscure the merits, or tempt senators to acquiesce to an
unwarranted rollback of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of ``reform,'' the bill intrudes into the
traditional legal domain of states by imposing national limits on
punitive damages over and above the compensation for actual harm
suffered. For small businesses with fewer than 25 full-time
employees and annual revenues of $5 million or less, the limit on
what an injured person could collect would be twice the actual lost
wages and medical expenses a person suffers, up to a maximum of
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound reasonable. But the bill's supporters exaggerate
the problem of unduly high jury awards while ignoring the value of
punitive damages in deterring dangerous practices. By lowering
small firms' legal exposure, the bill's practical impact would be
to increase the incentive for small companies, including those that
produce cheap ``junk guns'' lacking appropriate safety features, to
gamble on the continued manufacture of dangerous but profitable
products. At a time the nation should be moving to hold gun makers
accountable when they fail to protect against the foreseeable use
of their weapons by children or criminals, the measure moves in
exactly the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   No less troubling, the bill contains new standards for awarding
punitive damages that would also make it harder to hold larger
companies accountable for egregious misconduct. The supposed
ration-ale is to create a single nationwide standard. Instead it
would create a new kind of double standard in consumer rights.
There would be a cap on punitive damages for smaller businesses in
states that currently allow unlimited punitive damages. But states
that do not already impose such damages would not be required to
conform to the new national policy.
</P>
<P>
   Another flagrant double standard would deny construction workers
injured by defective machinery more than 18 years old any recourse
beyond their workers' compensation payments, while permitting
businesses to sue the manufacturer of the machinery to recover any
business losses resulting from the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, President Clinton vetoed a product liability bill
passed by Congress, declaring that it ``tilted the field against
consumers.'' So does this one, but Clinton has now sidled over to
the other side by striking a deal with the principal sponsors to
limit the punitive-damage cap to small businesses. With the White
House no longer willing to stand up for consumers across the board,
it is all the more critical that senators concerned about safe
products and a fair legal system take over the battle that Clinton
abandoned.

HIGH-SPEED FERRY SERVICE BETWEEN STATEN ISLAND AND MIDTOWN
MANHATTAN TO END
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Conn., N.Y.) (fb) 
By TERRY PRISTIN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A high-speed ferry service from Staten Island to
midtown Manhattan will be canceled after the last scheduled trip on
July 31 because it has not drawn enough passengers to break even,
the operator, New York Waterway, announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company had hoped to attract at least 400 commuters a day
when it took over the service in January from New York Fast Ferry,
which had been unsuccessful with the operation. After New York
Waterway took it over, only 200 commuters regularly took the
round-trip ride between St. George Ferry Terminal and West 38th
Street, said Pat Smith, a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The fares, which include bus service from the dock to midtown
locations, are $5 each way, $9 round trip and $150 for a one-month
pass. The ferry operates Monday through Friday, and the trip takes
25 minutes each way. The ferry leaves four times from Staten Island
in the morning and four times from Manhattan in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said this was the first time a route had been terminated
in the 11-year existence of New York Waterway, which operates eight
commuter routes in the New York metropolitan region and is the
largest privately operated commuter ferry service in the country.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, he said, the service has suffered from bad
publicity stemming from a lawsuit filed by Fast Ferry accusing the
city of reneging on several agreements, including a pledge to build
a covered dock on East 34th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, said that
commuters who had become accustomed to Fast Ferry's large and
well-appointed boats were disappointed by what New York Waterway
offered. ``They weren't able to satisfy the prior demand,''
Molinari said. ``They didn't have boats that were large enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, said that New York Waterway's boat had a
capacity of 150 people. ``There never was a problem of
undercapacity,'' he said. ``The problem was not enough people came
to use the service.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case when Fast Ferry began its service from
Staten Island to East 34th Street in January 1997, offering an
alternative to the Staten Island Ferry, which goes only to
Whitehall Street. By late spring of that year, 1,650 passengers
were using the service each day.
</P>
<P>
   But ridership dropped sharply after the public transit system
started its ``one-city, one-fare'' system in July, eliminating the
50-cent toll on the Staten Island Ferry and enabling commuters to
travel from Staten Island to their destinations in Manhattan on one
$1.50 fare.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the new system significantly lowered the cost of
commuting from Staten Island, Molinari said that price was not a
decisive factor in dooming the ferry service. ``There are enough
people living on Staten Island who can afford to _ and would prefer
to _ pay the premium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking issue with Molinari, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said
demand for the service was lacking. ``After six months,'' he said,
``it became clear that New York Waterway would have needed a city
subsidy to make this work. When we grant these licenses, the idea
is that we are not creating subsidized transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   While Staten Island commuters will have to make do with slower
service, others in Connecticut may get high-speed service next
year. Sea Conn LLC has said it plans to begin high-speed commuter
ferry service in the fall of 1999 to link New Haven, Bridgeport,
Stamford and La Guardia Airport to East 34th Street, Wall Street
and Battery Park City.

EDITORIAL: THE ILLUSION OF DEMOCRACY IN NIGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   The high-level American delegation that landed in Nigeria on
Monday is the latest in a stream of international visitors that has
so far included British and Commonwealth officials and the United
Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan. All have carried essentially
the same message _ that Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria's new
military ruler, should carry out a genuine transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a transition, but Abubakar is not the one to
manage it. The job belongs to Moshood Abiola, a civilian who by
most accounts won Nigeria's last elections, in 1993. When he
pressed his claim to the presidency he was jailed for treason. The
visitors have urged Abiola's release. But they have inexplicably
encouraged him to return to civilian life, which he has apparently
agreed to do, and let the military run things for the several
months, if not longer, it will take to organize fair elections.
Given the sordid history of past military rule in Nigeria, this is
a dangerous accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar has taken some reassuring measures since assuming the
presidency after the death of Gen. Sani Abacha last month. He has
released some 30 prominent political prisoners, including former
President Olusegun Obasanjo. He has also replaced some of Abacha's
crueler cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of political prisoners remain in jail, many who
have never even been charged. Previous military rulers also
released prisoners and replaced ministers when they took power. It
did not mean they were democrats. One was Abubakar's political
mentor, Ibrahim Babangida. In the 1980s he carried out some
important reforms. He held an election in 1993 featuring two
parties he created. But when the apparent winner, Abiola, was not
to his liking, he annulled the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola is expected to be released soon, but his freedom seems to
depend on his renunciation of the presidency. The military has no
business putting conditions on his release, nor should Washington
be seen as endorsing such a deal. It is naive to believe in
Abubakar's commitment to democracy at this point. The military has
earned the distrust of the Nigerian people.

KING JURY ADJOURNS AFTER FULL DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The jury in Don King's federal wire-fraud trial
adjourned Monday after its first full day of deliberations over
whether the promoter and his company defrauded a Lloyd's of London
insurance syndicate out of $350,000 by submitting a fake contract
for a canceled 1991 Julio Cesar Chavez bout.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors asked to see several exhibits _ including a $2
million contract sent to Lloyd's, which Chavez never signed _ and
for readings of testimony by Richard Hummers, a former accountant
for Don King Productions, and by King, when he testified on the
same charges in a 1995 trial, which ended in a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   The King testimony focused on what, if anything, he knew about
the $2 million contract and a rider, never seen by Chavez, that
called for him to be paid $350,000 in ``maintenance non-refundable
training expenses.'' Chavez signed a $1.5 million contract but
balked at fighting for that sum.
</P>
<P>
   King claimed no knowledge of the contract, but his lawyers in
the current trial say it nonetheless reflected an oral agreement to
pay Chavez $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jury heard a readback of testimony by King in which he said,
``There is never no problem when you're giving a fighter more
money.''

SUBWAY ADVERTISEMENT FOR NEEDLE-EXCHANGE PROGRAM PROVOKES DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The elegant hands, not quite touching, are
recognizable to any art lover familiar with Michelangelo's fresco
adorning the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which shows God
reaching forth to infuse Adam with life.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new subway advertisement, the divine hand extends five
hypodermic syringes for injecting heroin or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Through this month, 1,140 of the advertisements will appear in
New York City's subway cars to promote needle-exchange services
available in the city. The advertisement includes a telephone
number, (800) 361-9477, for drug users to learn where to swap their
used needles for new ones and be tested for HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing needles is the number one cause of HIV in New York
City,'' the ad says. ``If you shoot drugs _ please do not share
needles.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement's sponsor, Positive Health Project, an
HIV-prevention and needle-exchange center on Manhattan's West Side,
said the ad campaign was the first on public transit in the nation
to promote needle-exchange programs as an effective way to curb the
spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message that has already drawn objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even a disguised attempt to legalize drugs,'' Dr.
James L. Curtis, director of psychiatry at Harlem Hospital Center
and a critic of needle exchanges, said of the advertisement. ``It's
a frank and forthright attempt to bless the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Farrell, the executive director of Positive Health
Project, said education on needle exchanges was necessary in light
of statistics showing that New York City has an estimated 250,000
intravenous drug users, as many as half of whom have contracted HIV
by injecting drugs with tainted needles or having sex with others
who do. This exceeds the national average cited by Dr. David
Satcher, the surgeon general, who attributed 40 percent of new AIDS
infections in the country to contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' Farrell said, ``that the general public
understands that the needle-exchange programs are the most
effective public health initiatives in the city today in preventing
infectious diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 5,000 new HIV infections are diagnosed in New York City
every year, he said, and three-fourths of injecting drug users do
not take advantage of needle-exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said the advertisement was chosen by a ``focus group''
of drug users who were asked which of two posters was more likely
to entice them into a needle-exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Transit Authority is charging nearly $14,000,
its minimum rate for nonprofit groups, to carry the advertisements
in about 20 percent of its subway cars for a month, Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The money was provided primarily by the Drug Policy Foundation,
an advocacy group for more liberal drug policies that is itself
partly financed by George Soros, the philanthropist. Last year, he
donated $1 million for needle exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Needle exchange continues to be a contentious issue. In April,
President Clinton refused to provide federal money for needle
exchanges, despite a finding by Secretary for Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala that they reduced the incidence of HIV
without increasing drug use.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Needle exchanges have existed in New York City since 1992, when
the state waived the law prohibiting possession of syringes without
a prescription. New York state helps subsidize nine programs
operating in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find ways of expanding and supporting
syringe-exchange programs much more than we have,'' said Denise
Paone, research director of the Chemical Dependency Institute at
Beth Israel Medical Center, and a supporter of the new
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the opposite view was Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the
president of Phoenix House, a substance-abuse treatment and
prevention network based in New York. Last month, Phoenix House ran
subway advertisements carrying the message: ``Don't throw your life
away. Thousands of people like you have recovered from substance
abuse.'' It gave a phone number, (800) HELP-111, for addicts to
find treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said of the new needle-exchange advertisements: ``We
are offering health, fulfillment and freedom from drugs. They're
pushing the continuation of addiction and despair.''

EDITORIAL: RESHAPING THE TEACHERS' UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   Public education is under heavier attack today than at almost
any time in its history. Fearful of the voucher movements and
increasingly bad press, the two largest teachers' unions _ the
American Federation of Teachers and the National Education
Association _ are seeking to merge, thereby increasing their powers
to fight back. The merger efforts were dealt a setback Sunday, when
delegates to the NEA convention voted overwhelmingly against
merging with the teachers' federation. The merger, which may yet be
approved in some revised form, has been cast mainly in political
terms. But if the unions are to raise themselves in public esteem,
they need to lead the reform effort, not just follow it.
</P>
<P>
   With 3.3 million members between them, the AFT and the NEA would
together compose the nation's largest labor union. The two already
have great political clout and can often move legislation through
both Congress and many state houses. Sandra Feldman, president of
the AFT, and Bob Chase, president of the NEA, endorse reform,
seeking higher standards for teachers. But the plans have often
been stalled by local union leaders who fear defections if they
push to improve teacher performance too quickly. The gap between
national and local leadership seems particularly pronounced in the
NEA, whose membership prizes autonomy above all else.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between the unions has encouraged a retreat to
the lowest common denominator. Union officials argue that a merger
would make it possible for state and local union officials to
support reforms without fear of defection. But stimulating reform
will require more than a merger. For starters it will mean
developing strong and visible leadership on educational reforms _
and convincing the local organizations that they need to embrace
those reforms. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gun control advocates who want the firearms
industry to be held responsible for gun-related injuries or deaths
are threatening a fragile agreement on broad legislation that would
affect lawsuits against manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, scheduled for debate in the Senate this week,
would place a cap of $250,000 on the punitive damages that small
businesses would have to pay in cases involving faulty products.
The limit on damages, opposed by consumers, is part of a broader
product-liability bill that businesses have been seeking for nearly
two decades.

   The White House helped negotiate the bill after President
Clinton two years ago vetoed an earlier version that would have
capped damages paid by companies of all sizes. The new version
defines small businesses as those that employ fewer than 25 people
and have annual revenues of less than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates say that nearly one in five guns sold in
the United States is made by a small company, and that two of the
gun models manufactured by small companies rank among the 10
weapons most often found found at crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun forces fear that the punitive damage limits on small
businesses would derail their larger efforts to hold the gun
industry accountable, in much the same way as the anti-smoking
forces have stepped up pressure on the tobacco industry. Just as
those forces found their voice in the state attorneys general, the
gun control advocates hope that big-city mayors can carry their
banner with lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns have persuaded two Democratic senators to propose
exempting the gun makers from the protections offered by the bill.
That proposal could drive away supporters of the broader liability
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Reilly, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of
Small Business, said any changes in the language of the bill could
scuttle the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for gun manufacturers say caps on damages would affect
only a small percentage of firearms makers and are irrelevant
because these companies routinely win lawsuits contending that they
have negligently marketed their products. The manufacturers support
the product-liability bill as part of what they say is a
much-needed overhaul of the litigation process.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer advocates, including Ralph Nader, oppose the bill
on grounds that the measure makes it more difficult for consumers
to recover damages, the business community is split.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses view the proposed legislation as a relief from
excessive litigation. Even for larger companies, the bill would
raise the standards of proof for a consumer to be eligible to
recoup damages. But some large companies _ like chemical producers
and automobile manufacturers, which have substantial liability
exposure _ wanted the same protection against high punitive damages
that smaller businesses would receive.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could pose a political problem for many Democrats and
some suburban Republicans who want to be responsive to the concerns
of small businesses but whose support for gun control can be an
important distinction in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring the picture further are the competing interests behind
the bill: It is strongly backed by the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful lobbying group for small business,
while it is strongly opposed by the trial lawyers, who tend to make
large financial donations to Democrats. (Trial lawyers have been
particularly generous to Clinton, who in this case is going against
their wishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The White House helped negotiate the bill in an agreement with
Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and John Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the White House had ``bollixed'' the bill by making
proposals that it did not expect Gorton to accept. And two
Democratic senators _ Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Dianne
Feinstein of California _ worry that the bill would provide
unnecessary protection to a dozen small gun makers. They expect to
sponsor an amendment that would exempt the entire gun industry from
the limits. The bill already exempts tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those 12 firearms companies made 17 percent of the guns sold in
the United States between 1990 and 1995, according to the Violence
Policy Center, a nonprofit group in Washington that promotes gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, the 12 companies made 23 percent of the
.38-caliber pistols, which are the most popular caliber. And they
made two of the top 10 guns found at crime scenes, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official conceded that the bill's failure to
exempt the gun industry ``complicates things because the president
has been so strong on guns,'' but insisted this was not an
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   And other backers of the bill asserted that it offered no
substantive protection for gun makers. ``These are just folks who
don't like this bill and are looking for ways to tear it down,''
said Victor Schwartz, counsel for the Product Liability
Coordinating Committee, which has been seeking similar, if
stronger, legislation for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no situation where any of these gun manufacturers have
paid punitive damages anywhere near the cap,'' he said. ``It's a
completely bogus argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats in both the Senate and the House already oppose
the larger bill but on other grounds: They see it as anti-consumer.
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, told Clinton
in a recent letter that the bill was a ``grave mistake'' and would
limit consumer rights for the sake of a myth that businesses are
burdened by an excess of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the Violence Policy
Center, said that gun-control advocates are trying to formulate a
new legal line based on the tobacco cases _ not that guns are
defective but that the manufacturers are knowingly marketing a
dangerous product. Although the bill deals only with product
liability, she said that even this limit on lawsuits against gun
manufacturers would be a setback to the anti-gun movement.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, which represents the gun industry, said that the
bill would have little effect. And he dismissed the attempt to
mimic the success of anti-tobacco groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very important distinction between tobacco and
firearms,'' he said. ``When you use tobacco as it is intended to be
used, it is harmful; when you use a firearm as intended, not only
is it not harmful to the user, it can save the user's life.''

GM DEALERS JUGGLE SUPPLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As the strike against General Motors drags on,
dealers are either facing a shortage of popular models or banking
on their existing inventory to weather the production shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any Suburbans or Yukons and the next product
that will probably be hit is the pickup trucks,'' said George Pero,
sales manager at Parkway Super Center in Valencia, outside Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is one of GM's new superstores in the area, selling
Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick and GMC Trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some orders taken in April or May, and they are not
being filled,'' Pero said.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers have elected to wait out the strike because they
have already locked in the purchase price. If they choose to go
elsewhere for the vehicle they will probably end up paying sticker
price now that there is a shortage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership still has plenty of passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiations continued Monday in Flint, Mich., as the
strike entered its second month.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters is the fact the big automaker, which has
about a 13 percent share of the Valley area market, is in the midst
of a planned vacation shutdown so it could take up to five weeks to
get the dealer supply train running again once the strike is
settled and plants reopen.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, some dealers are hoping their inventory
will tide them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the strike with a huge inventory so we have
plenty of vehicles in stock,'' said Brad Jadwin, new car sales
manager at a Los Angeles Chevrolet dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Management at the dealership decided to bump up their inventory
a year ago, a move that seems to be paying off now. As of Friday,
there were about 282 new cars and trucks on the lot, roughly a
45-day supply, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has turned Steve Livingston, owner of Livingston
Motor Car Co. in Los Angeles, into a new car buyer.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago he bought 35 new vehicles from Los
Angeles-area GM dealers who had extra inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have inventory for about 120 days, so I'm in good shape,''
Livingston said.

PROSPECTS GATHER FOR FORMER CADET DAVID GRAHAM'S CAPITAL MURDER
TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Wearing bluejeans and boots, summer
dresses and business suits, nearly 200 Hill Country residents
jammed a Comal County courtroom Monday on the first day of jury
selection for former Air Force Cadet David Graham's capital murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to question jurors individually until next week,
prosecutors and defense attorneys scanned the crowded court,
searching for any signs of prejudice _ like crossed arms, scowls or
bowed heads _ among the potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   To select a panel of 12 impartial jurors for the high-profile
trial, District Judge Don Leonard will spend all week asking the
panelists about their knowledge of the charge against Graham, who
is accused of carrying out a December 1995 plot with his former
fiancee, Diane Zamora, to kill 16-year-old Adrianne Jones of
Mansfield, Texas. Graham, also of Mansfield, was a cadet at the Air
Force Academy and Zamora was a midshipman at the Naval Academy at
the time of their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action was limited to taking a roll call of about 200
residents summoned to appear and instructing them to return in
groups of 30 this week. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will be
allowed to question the panelists Monday and Tuesday, and opening
arguments will begin July 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not required that you've never heard about this case,''
Leonard told the group of prospective jurors packed in the
courtroom. ``It is critically important that you can set aside what
you've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 181 potential jurors summoned Monday, 20 were excused for
hardships such as medical conditions and pre-arranged vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black suit, striped tie and wire-rim glasses, Graham
stood up, shrugged and crossed his hands when he was introduced to
the prospective jurors. A dozen reporters from the Metroplex, as
well as Houston, San Antonio and New Braunfels, observed the first
stage of the selection process while more stood in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks, Graham and his mother, Janice Graham, embraced
over a waist-high barrier that separates the trial participants
from spectators. Bailiffs allowed Janice Graham, who sat on a seat
in the back throughout the day, to bring her son a cheeseburger for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   With a written statement from Graham detailing the slaying of
Jones, a gun found in his attic and Zamora's conviction, defense
attorney Dan Cogdell said getting an acquittal will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``But difficult cases are won every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish, the lead prosecutor,
also said the case will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a lot more difficult for us because everybody
expects David Graham to be convicted,'' Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said he expects a capital murder conviction and an
automatic life sentence for Graham, and joked that anything less
would be a ``kiss your sister'' compromise.

   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman was charged with child endangerment
Monday after police officers responding to a domestic dispute found
her three children unkempt and without food in a dirty apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokesman, Cadet Donald Stewart, said
officers responded to a dispute Monday morning at 183 Menahan St.,
in the Bushwick section, where they found a man having seizures.
After calling for an ambulance for the man, who was not related to
anyone in the apartment, the officers saw the squalid conditions in
the apartment and found the children _ a girl, 8, and two boys,
ages 1 and 6, Stewart said. The year-old boy, he said, had been
wearing a dirty diaper for ``a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers arrested the children's mother, Carmen Burnes, 31,
who was charged with endangering the welfare of a child. The
children were taken to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, where they
were examined and released to the custody of the Administration for
Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the agency, said officials
were checking the agency's records to see if Ms. Burnes had a
history of abuse or neglect. She said the children would be placed
in foster care.

ANGELS' ECCENTRIC STOPPER SET FOR ALL-STAR GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ During a recent Anaheim Angels game, manager
Terry Collins visited closer Troy Percival on the mound in a tight,
ninth-inning situation. After Percival got the last out for one of
his major-league leading 25 saves, he was asked what Collins had
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he said, to be honest with you,'' Percival
said.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, though, wasn't showing a lack of respect for his
manager. In fact, he said Collins' visit served a purpose by
allowing Percival to take a little breather and get his thoughts
together.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, like many of baseball's closers, enters a world of his
own when he's in a game. When Percival takes the mound, the tension
is high and the concession lines are short.
</P>
<P>
   Percival (1-3, 2.97 ERA) brings to the mound a fastball that is
consistently clocked at 95 mph, and he has a nasty breaking ball.
But stuff alone does not save games. A closer needs a certain
mentality to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just in a zone. You have to be,'' said Percival, who
will make his second All-Star game tonight in Denver. ``If you're
letting outside things get in your mind, you're not going to be
successful. You don't hear the fans, you don't hear the hitters.
You're focused in.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival, however, does not wait until the ninth to enter that
``zone.'' It starts much earlier. He usually drinks about seven or
eight cups of coffee throughout a game. And late in the game, he
starts his preparation ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the seventh inning, I start locking in,'' he said. ``I
get myself stretched, get myself ready. If it's a tight game, I
pretty much stop talking to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Percival learned to ready himself for a game, but
maybe more important is how Percival has responded to his two
losses and three blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from (former Angels closer) Lee Smith,''
Percival said. ``You're not going to be successful every time. And
when you're not, you have to deal with it. I wasn't good at that
when I first got here ... dealing with failure. But I've gotten
better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of closer it's easy to have confidence in,''
Collins said. ``Because if he has a bad night, he's the first guy
to say, `Give me the baseball tomorrow. I don't care what the score
is. Get me in the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see that mentality very often. Closers are always
under the gun. When they leave the mound, they've either done good
or done bad, they either saved the game or blew the save.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival served as Smith's set-up man in 1995, much as Mike
James has served as Percival's set-up man. Though James is on the
disabled list with a sore elbow, he remains Percival's best friend
on the team. The two met when James was traded to the Angels'
organization in 1994. They played together at Triple-A Vancouver
that year. And though they have little in common, something
clicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're completely opposite except for what we do here,'' James
said. ``If we met outside this arena, like a bar or something, we
probably would have fought. I'm a beach guy, he's a country guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival was born in Fontana, went to Moreno Valley High and UC
Riverside. James grew up surfing in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other day I tried to get him on a surfboard and he
said, `No way are you going to get a fat guy on a board. There
isn't a board big enough,' '' James said with a laugh. ``He's taken
me out to do some of the things he likes to do, like going out to
the sand dunes and going to the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival isn't fat. But at 6-foot-3, 230 pounds, he looks more
like a catcher than a pitcher. And in fact, he was drafted as a
catcher. But after hitting .200 in 29 games in Rookie League for
Boise in 1990, Percival was given a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Angels coaches Frank Reberger and Bob Clear liked Percival's arm
and asked him if he would switch to pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having no success catching,'' Percival said. ``I was
sitting on the bench catching. If you're sitting on the bench in
A-ball catching, you probably want to try something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival, though, didn't jump at the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't want to be a minor-league project,'' he
said. ``I asked them if they could get somebody in here that knew
what they were talking about and I'll throw for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitching coach Marcel Lachemann watched Percival and told
him what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If it was me, I'd turn in my (catcher's) gear,' ''
Percival said. ``So I walked in and turned in my gear 10 minutes
later.''

TRIAL OPENS IN N.Y. BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By DAVID ROHDE  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The defense lawyer for one of two men accused of
planning to set off a bomb in New York's subway system last summer
conceded in court Monday that her client did possess a powerful
explosive, but argued that the device was intended to defraud the
government of reward money from an anti-terrorism program and not
to inflict casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer, Jan Rostal, who is representing 24-year-old
Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, said in her opening statement in Federal
District Court in Brooklyn that Abu Mezer and the government's key
witness, Abdel Rahman Mosabbah, conspired to defraud the State
Department of up to $4 million in reward money.
</P>
<P>
   But Mosabbah betrayed Abu Mezer, she argued, by falsely
portraying him to the authorities as a terrorist in order to
collect the reward money himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it about mayhem and murder,'' Rostal asked jurors, ``or
about getting money through simple, new-fashioned fraud?''
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors portrayed Abu Mezer and his 23-year-old
codefendant, Lafi Khalil, as terrorists who traveled from New York
to North Carolina to build the bombs and were only hours or days
away from setting them off in a subway station when Mosabbah
courageously revealed the plot to law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nails and bullets were wrapped around pipes to inflict maximum
damage,'' a prosecutor, Bernadette Miragliotta, said referring to
the bomb. ``It was a bomb known as an anti-personnel device.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalil and Abu Mezer were arrested in a dramatic predawn raid on
a squalid apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, last July in which the
police have said they found a pipe bomb ``fully rigged and ready to
be detonated.'' Khalil and Abu Mezer were shot and wounded in the
raid, the police said, because officers opened fire when they
feared that one of the men was trying to set off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The July raid came after Mobassah, who had been living with the
defendants, flagged down police officers in the street and told
them about the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who were indicted last August on federal charges of
conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and related crimes,
face up to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miragliotta told the jury of four men and eight women that the
government would provide witnesses who saw Abu Mezer and Khalil
purchase the gunpowder, pipes, nails and other components used to
make the bombs from hardware stores, a local Wal-Mart and other
businesses in Greenville, N.C., in early July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She said a copy of a typewritten letter mailed to the State
Department on July 27, threatening to set off a series of pipe
bombs unless millions of dollars were paid, was attached to the
trigger device. Prosecutors have said the letter threatened a
series of attacks against American and Jewish interests and
demanded the release of jailed Islamic militants, including Ramzi
Yousef, who is serving a life sentence for masterminding the
bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Mosabbah took the stand as the prosecution's
lead witness and painted a chilling portrait of Abu Mezer. He
testified that Abu Mezer told him he opposed the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process and felt violence was the only
way Palestinians could reclaim their land.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Mezer, he testified, stated that violent attacks against
Americans were acceptable because the United States backs Israel.
The Palestinian lit gunpowder at one point in their apartment,
according to Mosabbah, and said he would ``burn them like this.''
When asked who, Abu Mezer replied ``the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rostal told jurors that the bomb and the letter were only
props in an effort by the defendants to defraud the government.
</P>
<P>
   She called Mosabbah ``an opportunist'' and pointed out that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation had flown his wife to the United
States and provided him with more than $70,000 in financial support
over the last 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   She also argued that Abu Mezer's statements to investigators
that he planned to set off the bombs were coerced by federal agents
while he was recovering from his wounds in Kings County Hospital.
Rostal told jurors that Abu Mezer was trying to impress people in
his hometown of Hebron on the occupied West Bank in Israel.

PALM FOUNDERS TO FORM NEW COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The two founders of Palm Computing, an
innovative Silicon Valley company that helped pioneer the market
for hand-held pen-based computers, have left the company.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dubinsky, president of the Palm division of 3Com Corp.,
the networking giant, and Jeff Hawkins, the division's chief
technologist, said Monday that they were leaving to found a company
that will license the Palm operating-system software. The two
executives said they had not yet chosen a company name or a new
location.
</P>
<P>
   Founded six years ago amid a wave of pen-based computing
start-up ventures, Palm survived initially because it had two
crucial features that other pen-based computers lacked: It fit
comfortably in a man's dress-shirt pocket and it synchronized data
easily with desktop personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Strategies Inc., a market research firm, has estimated
that Palm has sold 1.6 million Palm Pilots, and Dataquest has
reported that the company has a 63 percent market share.

A RECORD PACE FOR VIAGRA SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viagra, the Pfizer Inc. pill for correcting male impotence,
smashed all records in its first three months, according to IMS
Health, an industry consultant, which released numbers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   IMS also predicted that sales of Viagra would reach $1 billion
in the United States by March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptions for Viagra from April through June totaled 2.9
million, enough for estimated sales of $259.5 million, according to
IMS.
</P>
<P>
   Such huge sales appear easily to be a record. For example, one
of the leading drugs introduced last year _ Lipitor, a
cholesterol-reducing medicine from Warner-Lambert _ had sales of
$12.4 million in its first two months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were encouraged that prescription renewals remained
strong, despite reports of the deaths of some Viagra users. A
Pfizer spokeswoman stressed that the drug was safe when used
correctly. On Monday, the company criticized the Prudential
Healthcare unit of Prudential Insurance and Humana Inc. for
declining to cover the cost of Viagra because they said they
regarded it as unsafe.

LIST ATTESTS TO AREA'S HIGH-TECH GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Giving testament to the region's growing
technological heft, 18 area companies were identified Monday by
accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche as among the fastest-growing in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche's annual Technology Fast 50 list, which has
become a source of bragging rights among the Southland's
``digerati,'' identifies the fastest-growing technology-driven
firms in Southern California, pitting companies in Los Angeles,
Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties
against one another.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, a company must have been in business for at least
five years and have had 1993 revenues of $50,000 or more. Growth is
measured in revenues, and both public and privately held companies
are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   In the area, winners span biomedicine to telecommunications,
with 13 of the 18 firms located in the Los Angeles-area communities
of Chatsworth, Camarillo and Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do notice in that area there's a cluster,'' said Deloitte &AMP;
Touche spokeswoman Suzanne Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   While identifying this year's winners, the Big Five accounting
firm has not yet ranked the companies. A final list, including rank
and percentage growth, will be announced in September, Thompson
said. Last year's winners had five-year growth rates between 280
percent and 7,000 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the award has little practical effect on the business of
most honorees, it reflects the growing role of technology
regionally. It also can serve as a morale booster for employees at
firms that don't normally get a lot of public attention, said Fred
Deindoerfer, chief executive of Chatsworth-based International
Remote Imaging Systems Inc., one of this year's winners. IRIS makes
machines that rapidly screen urine samples for disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you take home to your family,'' Deindoerfer
said of the honor, ``but regardless, you still have to do your job
the next day.''

DEFENDANT IN BRAWLEY CASE SEES DEFAMATION SUIT AS `LYNCHING'
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ In his summation Monday, Alton Maddox told
jurors that the Tawana Brawley defamation suit was an effort at
``three judicial lynchings'' of the Brawley advisers, ``financed by
rich fat cats in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who has acted as his own lawyer during the case,
portrayed himself as a martyr to the Brawley cause, referring often
to his suspension from the bar because of an inquiry into his role
as Brawley's lawyer a decade ago. He portrayed the plaintiff,
Steven Pagones, as an agent of powerful New York City people _ whom
he did not identify _ who he said have contributed to Pagones'
defense. Those people, Maddox said, seek to use the Dutchess County
jurors to ruin him and the other two advisers, C. Vernon Mason and
the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the advisers' adversaries, Maddox said, was to
prevent the advisers from helping people like Miss Brawley, a black
15-year-old in 1987 who said that she had been raped by a group of
white men. ``We are here because we have stood up for the
oppressed,'' Maddox said, ``we have stood up for the poor, and now
it's time to be persecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   In a vividly personal closing statement, Maddox alternated
between eloquent appeals and folksy anecdotes, describing his own
childhood in the poverty of rural Georgia and confessing, with a
wry smile, ``I have an addiction'' to the television show ``Murder,
She Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even in the touches of humor, he refused to step away from
the inflammatory accusations he made about Pagones a decade ago.
After confessing to having an addiction to the murder mystery
series, he told the jurors he wished that the television detective,
Jessica Fletcher, could be here to help solve the case. Pagones, he
said, ``wants to get away with murder and be rewarded,'' with a
defamation verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the allegations he made a decade ago, Maddox said
Pagones was a legitimate suspect in the kidnapping and rape of
Brawley and in the shooting death of a friend, Harry Crist.
</P>
<P>
   He said the grand jury report that exonerated Pagones and found
that Crist had committed suicide was ``a fraud which really should
be thrown in the trash can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Maddox told the Brawley story from the advisers' vantage
point, he often seemed to be trying to connect with the jurors. He
appeared near tears as he told the jurors he believed that someday
there would be proof that Miss Brawley was attacked and that there
had been a huge cover-up on behalf of Pagones. ``No lie can live
forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Maddox, 53, it was a vintage performance. In the 1980s, he
was an omnipresent advocate in the racial turmoil of New York City.
But until the defamation trial began nearly eight months ago, he
had virtually vanished from the public stage. He often referred to
the fact that he can no longer practice law because of his
suspension as a result of the case.
</P>
<P>
   As he confidently walked the courtroom Monday, with his heels
clicking authoritatively on the wooden floor, he seemed happy to be
arguing a case again. At times, he referred to himself as
``Maddox,'' as he has often done through the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But often, too, he seemed to forget, and spoke more directly to
the jurors. ``I don't know what the outcome of this case will be,''
he said, his voice breaking. ``I know one thing: that I can hold my
head high.''

CHARTER PANEL TOLD TO SHIFT FOCUS OF WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an abrupt change of course, the chairman of New
York City's newly created Charter Revision Commission urged the
group on Monday to stop exploring contentious changes in the
balance of power in city government and to focus instead on a much
less controversial issue: campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Peter Powers, has been sharply criticized in
recent weeks for considering changes that could increase Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's authority at the expense of other branches of
the city government, particularly the Office of Public Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   But Powers insisted the about-face was not a response to the
criticism. Instead, he said that he had realized the commission did
not have enough time to consider so many changes this year, and
that certain issues needed consideration more urgently than others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to campaign financing, Powers said he would ask the
11 other members of the commission to focus on the questions of
whether to eliminate partisan elections for city offices and
whether to make membership on the City Council a full-time job. All
three issues have been among the commission's top priorities all
along, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want is to stay focused on the issues we can do at this
time,'' Powers, a former deputy mayor and longtime friend of
Giuliani, said Monday afternoon. ``We have to take some and leave
others out. I think the time is right to make a statement about
ending soft money in city elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes to the City Charter must be approved in public
referendums, and the commission is hoping to place charter
questions on the ballot this November, apparently to meet
Giuliani's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   He created the commission two months ago, primarily as a means
to block another referendum _ on whether tax money should be spent
on building a stadium for the New York Yankees in Manhattan _ from
appearing on the ballot. Under city law, a charter-related question
takes precedence over other ballot questions.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics have accused the commission of doing the
mayor's bidding, a spokeswoman for Giuliani said he had nothing to
do with Powers' decision to delay consideration of the most
politically charged issues. The spokeswoman, Colleen Roche, said
that Giuliani, who appointed the commission members, wanted them to
decide by themselves which issues were most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has said from the beginning that it will be the
commission's responsibility to decide what should and should not be
included in the referendum,'' Ms. Roche said. ``They are assessing
what is ripe for this election and what is not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics of the commission have been especially angry about
potential changes that could expand Giuliani's powers. In
particular, they have said they would resist changes to the budget
process and to the city's land procurement rules, both of which
could scale back the powers of the City Council and the community
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said Monday that the commission might very well consider
such changes in the future, but definitely not before November.
</P>
<P>
   The critics, who have been especially angry about proposals to
eliminate the Office of Public Advocate and the Independent Budget
Office, were cheered by Powers' announcement, which came in the
form of a brief memorandum to the other commission members.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they were still troubled by the makeup of the
commission, whose members all have ties to Giuliani. ``It's a
welcome recognition of the error of their ways,'' said Frederick
Schwarz Jr., the chairman of a previous charter commission, who
took the unusual step of disparaging the new commission's plans in
a letter to Powers last week. ``But it's still not a representative
commission and it's still not independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they still had plenty to worry about, especially
Powers' recommendation that the commission focus on whether to make
city elections nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking away partisan elections is a very serious change,
because you are depriving people of one of the chief ways of making
determinations on candidates,'' said Eric Lane, a professor at
Hofstra Law School who was the executive director of a 1989
commission on charter revision. ``If the commission members are
nonpartisan themselves, they will take a lot of time looking at
this issue.''

GERMANY'S ULLRICH OUT TO DEFEND TOUR DE FRANCE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Let's have no more jokes, please, about Jan Ullrich,
about how he will do his military service in his native Germany as
a blimp, and how, when his Telekom team shows up for a bicycle
race, he counts as two of the nine entries.
</P>
<P>
   True, Ullrich gained at least 20 pounds during the winter as he
chomped his way through banquets celebrating the first victory by a
German in the Tour de France. And true, when he showed up for the
first races of the year, in February, people worried that instead
of a bicycle with a titanium frame he should be riding something
made of a metal less likely to buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Always stocky, he weighed in after the winter revels at 183
pounds on his 6-foot frame, which explained his dismal results in
his first three months of racing.
</P>
<P>
   That is over now. The excess pounds have been sweated off. The
two cases of bronchitis and the earache that set back his training
are long behind him. His miserable April and his 78th-, 97th- and
134th-place finishes are memories.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Ullrich, who finished second and then first in
his initial two Tours de France, is back in form and hungry for
another victory in the world's greatest bicycle race. ``I'm at 90
percent now,'' he said a few weeks ago, ``and certain that I'll be
ready for the start of the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   There is scant reason to doubt him. In the Tour of Switzerland
last month, he showed that his time trial skills had returned, and
he stayed with all but the top climbers in the mountains. Then, in
the minor Route du Sud, he repeated his strong showing on ascents.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the two keys to his victory in the last Tour de
France: gaining minutes in the time trials and losing none to his
main rivals in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The formula should work just as well when the 85th Tour de
France starts its three-week journey on Saturday in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Dublin? Why not? The Tour de France has started outside the
mother country before _ in the Netherlands as recently as 1996, in
Spain in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   What's really new is that the start, usually at the beginning of
July, was pushed back a week because of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The later start means that the field in the roughly 2,392-mile
race, comprising 21 teams of nine riders each, will not finish in
Paris until Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Tour reaches France, in Brittany on July 14 after three
days in Ireland, it will follow a counterclockwise route, passing
through the Pyrenees first and then the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, the mountains are not as fearsome as they
have been. There will be two daily stages in the Pyrenees, followed
by a day off on July 23, and three in the Alps, but the first-rank
climbers have complained bitterly that this is not a course that
favors them.
</P>
<P>
   Not demanding enough, say both Richard Virenque, the Frenchman
with the Festina team who has won the top climber's jersey the last
four years and finished second over all last year, and Marco
Pantani, the Italian with Mercatone Uno who finished third last
year, won the Tour of Italy in June and is considered the dominant
climber in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Neither cyclist is an outstanding time trialer, as Ullrich is.
Because this Tour will have the customary two long races against
the clock _ 36 miles on July 18 and 32 miles on Aug. 1 _ Virenque
seems unlikely to repeat as one of the top three finishers. Pantani
is another case; he may be cool-headed enough to understand that
the riders, not the mountains, make the race.
</P>
<P>
   Other obvious contenders are riders in Ullrich's mold, if not
quite his class. They include Bjarne Riis of Denmark, Ullrich's
teammate and the winner of the 1996 Tour, but now a creaky 34 years
old. Abraham Olano, a Spaniard with Banesto, can climb and time
trial with the best, although not necessarily do both in the same
race. Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, has been unable to
get over the highest mountains in his last two Tours and so has
changed his training methods, possibly for the better. Michael
Boogerd, a Dutchman with Rabobank, gets stronger all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Two more riders who should do well are Alex Zulle and Laurent
Dufaux, both Swiss and both with Festina, which is led by Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   If they can all work together, they can take turns making
trouble for Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the prologue in Dublin, however, the defending
champion's main threat still appears to be his appetite. If he can
restrict himself to the 6,000 to 7,000 calories a day that most
bicycle racers consume, he figures to be in the yellow jersey by
the finish.

A LAWYER BORN ARMLESS IS UNIMPEDED BY DISABILITIES _ HIS OR
OTHERS'
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JOYCE WADLER  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fellow who had lost a leg in the subway and decided
to sue New York City Transit had the bad fortune to be confronted
in court by Jeffrey Samel, the lawyer for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Samel has no arms. Also, Samel is very good. Samel, taking notes
with a pen in his mouth, established, under cross-examination, that
the plaintiff had been drunk when he landed on the subway tracks
and that the plaintiff had lied, under oath, about his drinking.
Samel contended that the plaintiff had been seen falling _ some
witnesses said jumping _ in front of the train when it was 20 feet
away, that it was too late for the motorman to stop and that the
motorman also could not turn. A subway train, as Samel enjoyed
reminding the jury, has no steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   So compelling was Samel's argument that the judge dismissed the
case. Damages, therefore, were never an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wonders, isn't Samel's disability an issue?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't a lawyer with no arms the worst possible opponent a
physical-injuries lawyer could face in court?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard other lawyers, who haven't met me, are afraid of
me,'' Samel says, speaking with a lawyer's careful wording in his
offices in downtown Manhattan. ``That's what I've been told.
They're afraid my disability will negatively impact their case,
that the jury will never be able to award millions of dollars when
they see a person like me who is able to do everything. They start
out worrying about my disability. Then they see it's my abilities
as a lawyer they have to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of fellow 45-year-old Jeffrey Samel is: He
shakes hands, though his feels like cool plastic, because he likes
to do what everybody else does.
</P>
<P>
   This is Samel's most frequent case: A person, having had a few
drinks, leans over the tracks in a subway station to see if the
train is coming, falls on the tracks, and then sues the city. Samel
is often hired by New York City Transit.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, as in the case of an Emergency Medical Service
crew that failed to respond in time to save the life of an
asthmatic child who ultimately died, Samel represents the
plaintiff. (The case, he said, incensed him.) Most often, however,
Samel's clients are the defendants. This comes about, Samel says,
because he finds that many people who come to a lawyer regarding
physical injury are lying about the circumstances of their
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Samel does not believe his disability has won him clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the opposite,'' Samel says. ``I think there are
clients who have not come knocking on my door because they were
afraid the jury might think they were pulling a fast one, because
they were afraid how the jury would react.''
</P>
<P>
   Samel grew up in Queens. His disability was not caused by
thalidomide or drugs. It was an ``anomaly,'' a bad genetic toss of
the dice, yet Samel's parents, who owned a housewares store in
Manhattan, never treated him differently from their other two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught to believe that my disability never entitled me
to anything,'' Samel says. ``I wasn't special because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Samel graduated from New York University Law School in the top
10 percent of his class. By graduation, 70 percent of his class had
jobs. Samel, who got every interview he requested, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a professor to intercede, the dean said there was
nothing to be done, Samel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been somewhat angry about that,'' Samel says. ``I
hate the word `anger'. But disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Queens district attorney, John J. Santucci, was the
first to hire Samel. Fifteen years ago, Samel struck out on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible Samel chose the side of the defendant because he
had to go through life with a severe infirmity and has no patience
with people who might complain?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Samel says firmly. ``I cannot abide falsehood. I don't
have a lot of patience with people who try to exploit an injury,
but I'm as sympathetic to someone who is legitimately hurt as
anyone else. I would never say to a person who lost a leg, `Hey, I
don't have arms, come on, get over it,' that would be a foolish
thing to say. But a person who has lost a leg can still be
gainfully employed, can fall in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Samel has. Three years ago, he married the former Dorothy
Thurneau, one of the lawyers in his firm. They live in Manhattan
and enjoy New York things _ galleries, the theater. Samel has a
silver paperweight that spells the word ``love,'' in Hebrew, on his
desk. It is a gift from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about anger, about being forced to live without arms,
Samel denies he ever felt rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born this way, so I never had to adapt the way I did
things,'' Samel says. ``When I was 3 years old, I put crayons in my
mouth to draw. I did all the things other people could do, I just
did them differently. The same way you might say I do things in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one thing I couldn't do, in high school,'' he says.
``Everybody was taking driver's ed. and I couldn't. My father said,
`We'll go looking to fix up a car.' But I realized I would either
kill myself or somebody else, and since everybody around me could
drive me anywhere I wanted, it didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   More reflection.
</P>
<P>
   `` The only thing in life I regret, I can't play a musical
instrument. But I sing.''

 &HT;    State credit bills feature names such as Nordstrom and Macy's
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last spring, Zelda Carmon did some power
shopping, dropping $675 on merchandise from Victoria's Secret, a
popular lingerie and mail-order company.
</P>
<P>
   Carmon didn't have to pay cash for her apparel. Instead, she
used the American Express card she carries for official State of
Texas business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a convenience thing,'' said Carmon, a clinical
nurse at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Convenient and common, but clearly against state rules.
</P>
<P>
   All over Texas, state employees routinely use their state
American Express cards for personal purchases even though rules
restrict the card to business expenses such as airline tickets and
hotels, newly released state records show. The state reimburses for
business expenses but not for personal purchases, and it isn't
liable for unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman-Marcus. Macy's. Nordstrom. Lord and Taylor.
Bloomingdale's. Gap Kids. Toys ``R'' Us. JCPenney. Dillard's. Ross
Dress for Less. Blockbuster Video. Land's End. These and other
shops show up on state employees' American Express bills, according
to bills obtained under the Texas open records law.
</P>
<P>
   Charges for tanning salons, glamour photographs, liquor,
groceries and video stores also show up on the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who use the cards to buy things for themselves could be
prosecuted, but there appears to be little chance of criminal
charges. No one monitors credit card purchases at some state
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't monitor personal spending,'' said Richard Moore, vice
president for business affairs at the University of Texas Medical
Branch at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   American Express sends the medical school a monthly report of
employee charges, but that probably ends up in the trash, Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The UT medical school is not alone. Officials of UT's M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center and Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, whose
American Express billings were also obtained through open records
requests, acknowledge doing little to monitor personal purchases on
state charge cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the offices are beginning to crack down. They are randomly
monitoring purchases and sending warning letters to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Carmon said she did not know she could not use the charge card
for personal items. She ran up a $2,657 American Express bill in
March with nonstate purchases at a variety of stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't clear. It was a misunderstanding on my part,'' she
said. ``Now, I know we can't do that. I have corrected the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas General Services Commission recently reported that
state employees have run up nearly $2 million in overdue charge
card bills since 1991. Personal spending _ which historically
spikes in December _ has contributed to the debt, the commission
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million in debt is less than 2 percent of all charges by
state employees last year. In May, the state imposed a $200 limit
on retail spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas General Services Commission, which oversees the state
contract with American Express, relies on each state agency and
institution to monitor employee spending on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot be the conscience of these people carrying the
cards,'' said Tom Treadway, executive director of the General
Services Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Treadway has named a task force of key state agencies to improve
enforcement of the ban on personal American Express charges.
</P>
<P>
   At Treadway's agency, employees can be fired if they use the
American Express card for personal spending.
</P>
<P>
   State offices where enforcement has been lax view the American
Express card as an agreement between an individual state employee
and the charge card company. Under the state contract, state
employees undergo a credit check by American Express and are
responsible for paying for all charges they ring up. The state is
not liable for unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I to judge whether it was a personal expense or a
business expense?'' said Elmo Cavin, vice president for fiscal
affairs at Texas Tech Health Sciences Center.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say employees sometimes mistakenly charge
personal items on their state card.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nancy Ketchie, chief of human resources at M.D.
Anderson, said she accidentally used the state American Express
card in February to buy a $340 dog kennel for a puppy her nieces
and nephews had just received. The store had trouble processing her
personal MasterCard, and the young children were so excited that
the atmosphere became ``total pet store chaos,'' Ketchie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honest screw-up,'' she said. ``I pulled the wrong
card. I just looked for a green card.''
</P>
<P>
   An open records request for American Express charges at Texas
A&AMP;M University was denied. Texas A&AMP;M requested a ruling from the
Texas attorney general's office.
</P>

   Denise Gamino is a staff writer for the Austin
American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

 &HT;    Weiss' perfect world
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brody Weiss was sorry. He didn't mean to swallow the water in
the pool. But when you're almost 4, and it's a hot early-summer
day, well, there's nothing better than taking a big mouthful of the
cool blue water and spurting it high into the air.
</P>
<P>
   He never knew it would almost kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're blaming anybody,'' said his father,
Atlanta Braves shortstop Walt Weiss. ``It's an imperfect world.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours tonight, though, it will be as close to perfect
as Weiss could ever hope. Weiss is in his 11th major-league season.
He will play in his first All Star game, which happens to be at
Coors Field. That's where Weiss played the last four seasons with
the Colorado Rockies, and he also makes his permanent home in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the stands, along with his wife and two other
sons, will be Brody. It's a moment Weiss hasn't had much of a
chance to anticipate, and Monday he couldn't begin to imagine what
he'll think or feel.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to take anything away from the honor of playing
in an All Star Game. He appreciates the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's going to be one of the most special moments of
my career and of my life,'' Weiss said. ``But life and death put a
spin on it. There's no doubt I look at the game in a different
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just under a month ago, his wife, Terri, took Brody to a public
pool in suburban Atlanta. It was there Brody contracted the virus
caused by E. Coli bacteria when he swallowed water infected by a
sick child.
</P>
<P>
   The Weisses thought Brody just had the flu, so Weiss left on a
road trip. He was in Montreal when he got the call Brody had been
admitted to the hospital. His kidneys were only functioning at 50
percent. They would soon fail completely and he was put on
dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss returned to Atlanta and he and his wife spent quite a few
nights curled up on the seats in the hospital waiting room. There
is no treatment for the virus. It simply has to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance Brody could die. At one point, Weiss believed
that could be a reality. Brody became unresponsive and his body
twitched, a sign of possible neurological damage.
</P>
<P>
   They had to prepare themselves for the worst. And then, for
reasons Weiss won't question, Brody started getting better. Weiss
rejoined his team June 26. Baseball wasn't much escape. Weiss would
count the minutes until he could get back to the hospital to be
with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to be serious about it,'' said Weiss of playing.
``I tried to stay focused and I did okay. I realized I had an
obligation to the team and I tried to let my instincts take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Brody came out of intensive care - the same
day his father was named to his first All Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss would not have attended tonight's game if Brody was still
in danger. He's not taking any medication and is under no special
restrictions, though Weiss said he wouldn't be taking him to any
public pools for awhile. Brody just has to go in for blood work and
has become terrified of doctors and needles.
</P>
<P>
   He visited the family's doctor in Denver early Monday. The trip
from Atlanta was incredible. Rockies President and CEO Jerry
McMorris sent his private jet to get the Weiss family, even though
Weiss plays for the competition now. They've received tons of cards
and stuffed animals, many from Colorado fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an amazing guy,'' said Rockies left fielder Dante
Bichette. ``A lot of guys on the team are fathers. We knew what he
was feeling. It says a lot about Walt that everybody really came to
his aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is blessed. His son will make a full recovery. Weiss
himself achieved a professional status of which he'd completely
stopped dreaming. He is a religious man. He believes everything
happened for a reason and it wasn't up to him to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   Brody never asked why he was in the hospital. He never wondered
what was wrong with him. His parents eventually explained why he
was sick. And most of all, they made sure he knew it wasn't his
fault.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody swallows pool water, especially little boys on hot
days.

 &HT;    McGwire a power broker
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He is a man of Babe Ruthian dimensions, not just in
stature but in his swing.
</P>
<P>
   He is the Sultan of Swat on a good weight-training program and a
little creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, the first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, has
single-handedly brought renewed interest to baseball not only
because of the record he is chasing, but the way he has done it.
</P>
<P>
   He has 37 homers this season, more than halfway to the record of
61 set by Roger Maris in 1961. But unlike anyone else's, except
maybe Ruth's, McGwire's homers aren't just homers. They're
McHomers. Supersized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people understand what's going on here with this guy,''
said New York Mets All-Star Mike Piazza, among the best-hitting
catchers in history. ``I mean, he's one of the best, if not the
best, power hitter of all time. Obviously, I never saw Babe Ruth,
but it's hard to believe anybody ever hit them higher or farther.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is on pace to hit 70 home runs this season, and a few of
those he has hit have made history at the ballparks in which
they've landed.
</P>
<P>
   Maris broke the record of 60 set by Ruth in 1927. Some within
baseball wanted an asterisk next to Maris' name, because Maris had
161 games to set the mark, while Ruth had 154 .
</P>
<P>
   No one will question the legitimacy of a McGwire record. Most
weren't around when Ruth was doing his thing and have to rely on
clips to see his prowess at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to national TV contracts and endless sports highlights
show, everyone has a chance to see McGwire's prodigious homers each
evening. Everyone wants to know how far, how long, how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a phenomenon,'' said McGwire's teammate, Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   The demand is so strong, thousands of people show up at batting
practice just to watch, just to say they were there when he hit one
out of the ballpark, or up on the roof, or off the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   To see McGwire go where no man _ or baseball _ has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the balls he hits and the way he hits them, you don't
want to miss that,'' Baltimore Orioles third baseman Cal Ripken
said. ``You can relate, because you go to these places and people
show you where he hit them. And then you take your normal BP and
you hit a ball and you feel like you really got it, and it's still
about 200 feet short of where he hit it.'' ----
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how does he do it? There are a few major
leaguers around who can match McGwire in stature, including Toronto
Blue Jay Jose Canseco, his former teammate in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Canseco was the Bash in the Bash Brothers, the name by
which the two became known. McGwire hit 49 homers that season, his
highest total until hitting 52 in '96 and 58 last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Canseco had the brawn, the personality, the movie-star looks
_ and the tape-measure homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was over there, the guy who was hitting them so far was
Canseco,'' said Cardinals third base coach Rene Lachemann, who was
a coach with the A's. ``Mark is stronger than he was then, and he's
made certain adjustments. Now he turns major league ballparks into
Pony League fields.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had an almost pigeon-toed stance when he was with
Oakland. Now, he's opened his feet and stands more like a golfer.
This helps him swing more through the hips, as a golfer would, and
Lachemann said McGwire has a heck of a tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   He has shortened his stroke and has amazing bat speed to go with
his strength. According to Robert Adair, a Yale University
Professor of Physics who was dubbed Physicist to the National
League by then-Commissioner Bart Giamatti, most players hit the
ball with the sweet spot of the bat at a speed of 60-65 mph.
McGwire hits it between 70-75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And he's getting stronger. McGwire did not lift weights in '91
and thought that hurt him. He has lifted ever since.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's good health is another key. A sore left heel limited
him to 27 games in '93. In '94, he first had a stress fracture in
his left foot, then had heel surgery on the foot. He played in 47
games that season.
</P>
<P>
   He considered retiring during the spring of '96 when he tore the
plantar fascia in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his time away, he really came to understand how much he
loved the game,'' said Tony La Russa, who has managed McGwire in
Oakland and St. Louis. ``He came back with a renewed interest in
being professional, and now he keeps improving the mental side of
his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an advance scout's nightmare. He'll swing and miss a high
fastball, so you report that. The next time you throw a high
fastball, there it goes. Throw a breaking ball, swing and miss.
Next time you throw a breaking ball, there it goes. Throw him in _
people keep trying to crowd him _ there it goes. You've got to see
it to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn used to chat with McGwire
when either one of them would reach thefirstbase. They'd talk about
hitting, and most particularly, Vaughn's habit of releasing the bat
with one hand at the end of his swing.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was a straight, two-handed power hitter and figured he
didn't need to release. He already was sending balls over the
fences. Then a couple of years ago, Vaughn noticed something very,
very scary: McGwire was now fully extending his bat on the follow
through, releasing it at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Someone's in trouble,''' Vaughn said. ``The longer
you can keep the bat on the ball, you take it to another level.
That's what made his swing more devastating. That's when you hit
the light towers.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also said McGwire's trade last July 31 to the Cardinals _
and the National League _ could only help. The NL has a lower
strike zone. McGwire is a phenomenal low-ball hitter. He can lay
off the high pitches because they'll be called balls.
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting better to the gaps and is batting .310.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll kill anybody down low,'' Vaughn said. ``That's why he's
really going. Anything down low, it's damage. That's his stroke.
You cannot throw any low balls by him. You gotta bounce it by
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley remembers when, as Eckersley puts it, McGwire
was on ``Jump Street.'' A rookie. McGwire was like a big kid then.
But it doesn't surprise Eckersley, who played with McGwire for nine
years in Oakland and last season in St. Louis, that McGwire comes
off as reserved and almost surly at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hell of a lot more guarded now,'' said Eckersley, now a
reliever for the Red Sox. ``He sounds like a script. When he was a
kid, you'd hear the same story 20 times, he talked so much. That's
who he was. He's still like that deep inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley has an excellent perspective on McGwire, the Man, as
well as McGwire, the Mammoth Home Run Hitter.
</P>
<P>
   This is Eckersley's 24th season in the majors. He's pitched
against some of the best hitters of all time, including home-run
king Hank Aaron, who holds the career record with 755, and Reggie
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody like him,'' Eckersley said of McGwire. ``He's
the most awesome home-run hitter I've seen in my lifetime. I can't
imagine anyone being more powerful. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The two didn't play together for a year-and-a-half. Then McGwire
came to St. Louis, and Eckersley saw him hit balls at least 50 feet
farther than he used to.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's reaction to all the attention he's received is just
what Eckersley expected. Fifteen thousand people showed up before a
game at Houston to watch him take batting practice. McGwire said he
felt like a ``caged animal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it,'' said McGwire at the time. ``Baseball
is a team game, and the media seems to keep making it an individual
thing. I come out here because I love to play, but all this
(attention) I'll never understand.''
</P>
<P>
   What if McGwire just wants to practice hitting balls to right
field? Will the crowd boo? There's a reason it's called batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like a freak,'' Eckersley said. ``When I saw him last
year, I don't know if he was having fun. Not everyone is suited for
that (attention). Some are suited more just to hit home runs.''
-----
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is not happy with the way the season is going because
his team is not winning. The Cards are 40-46, 12 1/2 games out of
first place in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason so many players are pulling for McGwire. If he
hits a meaningless homer but the team wins, he'll tell reporters to
go talk to the players who mattered.
</P>
<P>
   When they lose, he's mad, no matter what he's done at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire gets the most attention, but he isn't alone in the
pursuit of Maris' record. Sammy Sosa (33 homers) of the Chicago
Cubs and Ken Griffey Jr. (35) of theSeattle Marinersalso are on
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the edge in the second half? Maybe no one. Sosa is more
of a free swinger and is a streaky hitter. Griffey tends to get
injured. McGwire is the most consistent, but he's had second-half
swoons. Last year he hit only 14 homers in July and August, and in
the past five seasons only 44 of his 167 homers came in those
months.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may just be a matter of whether the pressure and
distractions can get to McGwire. Eckersley, as much as he'd like to
see it, doesn't think McGwire _ or Sosa and Griffey Jr. _ will pass
Maris.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many variables, from injury to whether a team will
pitch to him later in the season. During his run, Maris actually
had some of his hair fall out from the stress, although he didn't
have the full support of his teammates _ most wanted Mickey Mantle,
also with the Yankees, to achieve the feat first.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone _ the players, the fans _ is rooting for McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better guy in baseball who can do it,'' Vaughn
said. ``I hope he attacks it and crushes it. He's the epitome of
slugging.''

 &HT;    A fitting end
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Yeah, an 18-hole playoff is inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   It also happens to be the right way to do things.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Golf Association, which is frequently maniacal
in adhering to its self-proclaimed mandate of protecting the
integrity of the game, does this particular exercise in a fair and
proper manner.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter that Monday's playoff for the U.S. Women's
Open championship eventually played itself out to a sudden-death
playoff lasting two holes, anyway. It doesn't matter, because the
18-hole playoff set it up.
</P>
<P>
   No sudden death in the immediate wake of the 72-hole event.
</P>
<P>
   No manufactured playoff of x-number of holes in some bastardized
compromise between sudden-death and full-form playoff formats.
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   And the show provided by a couple of 20-year-old women _
champion Se Ri Pak and amateur runner-up Jenny Chuasiriporn of Duke
University _ was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Please. Stop.
</P>
<P>
   Don't start with the theory that the fact that a college senior
almost won the Open is somehow an indictment of the talent at the
professional level of women's golf. It is not. Or that two
20-year-olds playing for the championship is such an indictment. It
is not.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the only amateur ever to win was Catherine Lacoste
in 1967. Second of all, not since Barbara McIntire in 1956 has an
amateur come as close as a playoff to winning.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, a woman named Nancy Lopez was an amateur when she
tied for second in the Open in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Chuasiriporn will someday turn out to be
a Lopez or even a good professional. Pak, though, sure is off to a
terrific start with two majors (she won the McDonald's LPGA
Championship) as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, quite simply, is an astounding talent. She has a
purposeful, proud, arm-swinging walk that is perfect reflection of
her resolve.
</P>
<P>
   She was four shots down to Chuasiriporn after five holes in the
playoff. At the 18th hole _ stuck in a hazard and staring at
possible defeat with the match tied _ Pak called on that resolve
and her capacity to think clearly in difficult situations to
salvage a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   She disdained a drop, played a shot out and across the fairway
while standing in water halfway up her calves and survived into the
playoff when Chuasiriporn failed to get up-and-down from just off
the green and could do no better than match Pak's bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost don't have chance anymore,'' Pak said of her strategy
at the 18th hole. ``Almost, I lose already. Just want to try ...
last hole ... last chance ... last day. Just want to try
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak and Chuasiriporn posted two-over-par 73s on a demanding
Blackwolf Run Golf Course, and hit an assortment of excellent shots
under pressure in the process. Sure, there were flaws _
Chuasiriporn's triple-bogey-6 at the sixth hole, several short
putts missed, the matching bogeys at the end of regulation _ but
there was mostly good golf.
</P>
<P>
   They hit fairways and greens. They made birdies (seven). They
competed is what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good pressure player,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``It was a
matter of one good stroke, and she got it first.''
</P>
<P>
   It came, oh, so smoothly on the 20th hole of the day at
Blackwolf Run.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with Pak surrounded by family, and Chuasiriporn greeted
by college friends bearing bottles of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with a couple of 20-year-old women being 20-year-old
women _ Pak with Disney head covers on her metals, and Chuasiriporn
with a Duke mascot Blue Devil on one of hers.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with Chuasiriporn admitting she hadn't been a fan of
Pak's when watching LPGA Tour events, but saying, ``I will be
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended with Pak taking the $267,500 winner's check from the
$1.5million purse that was hers, win or lose, because Chuasiriporn
is an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with Pak, born in South Korea, and Chuasiriporn, born
in Baltimore to Thai parents, sharing a cart ride back toward the
clubhouse for a tournament-ending ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great putt,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``Awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' Pak replied. ``I feel like ... I don't know what to
feel like.''
</P>
<P>
   They should have shared the champagne, toasted the present and
wondered about the future's promise.

 &HT;    Pak wins playoff
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Se Ri Pak told the truth all week.
</P>
<P>
   She has ``no nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof came Monday at Blackwolf Run Golf Course in a playoff for
the U.S. Women's Open crown.
</P>
<P>
   She climbed out of a hole (a four-shot deficit), a hazard (at
the final hole of regulation) and into history.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, a 20-year-old sensation from Daejeon, South Korea, won the
title with a come-from-behind performance against Duke senior Jenny
Chuasiriporn, another 20-year-old, and grabbed the second major
championship of her LPGA Tour rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanged two-over-par 73s before Pak ran in an 18-foot
birdie putt on the second hole of the first U.S. Women's Open
sudden-death playoff and ended an entertaining and astonishingly
competitive round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is unbelievable,'' said Pak, who became the youngest Open
winner in history and the second rookie to win two majors.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing she does in the future will be unbelievable, because
Pak, who won the McDonald's LPGA Championship earlier this year,
already has stamped herself as a force in her sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (LPGA), maybe some people thinking I am lucky,'' Pak
said. ``Know now maybe this best week. I want to be No.1 in golf
world. Now, dream is coming to me.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Open playoff was dramatic documentation of Pak's
emerging excellence.
</P>
<P>
   First, she steeled herself against Chuasiriporn's fast start and
her own slow one.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she steadied herself for a back-side run.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she set herself for victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give up ever, ever,'' Pak said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, who was attempting to become the first amateur to
win the Open since Catherine Lacoste in 1967, blasted out of the
chute with three birdies in the first five holes, including a
chip-in to start. That burst, coupled with a Pak bogey at the third
hole, built Chuasiriporn's four-stroke advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that wasn't enough for me,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``I had
to make it more. This course can get you, and it did.''
</P>
<P>
   She never stretched the lead ... never, in fact, made another
birdie. And the course got her immediately after that third birdie
when Chuasiriporn took triple-bogey-6 at the sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled a 9-iron into an unplayable lie, took penalty and
drop, hit onto the green and three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   A four-shot edge was down to one.
</P>
<P>
   Game back on.
</P>
<P>
   Pak bogeyed the eighth, though, and both bogeyed the ninth as
Chuasiriporn turned with a two-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, however, posted birdies at the 11th, 12th and moved ahead
for the first time with another birdie at the 14th. She bogeyed the
15th to create another tie, and then merely survived the 18th _ on
her own recovery and Chuasiriporn's wobble _ to reach the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Pak drove into the weeds on the embankment of a left-side water
hazard that is a waste bunker in Blackwolf Run's standard state.
She waded in, chopped out across the fairway, reached the green
with her third shot and then missed a par putt from 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, though, couldn't recreate Sunday's final-hole
magic where she rolled in a 40-foot birdie putt to catch Pak. This
time, she failed to get up-and-down from just off the green _ first
running her chip 12 feet past the hole and then missing the
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (putt) was the only time all day my hands were shaking,''
Chuasiriporn said. ``The chip came out a little hot and took away
any break I was playing. I thought (the putt) was going to be it. I
let it slip away there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, given opportunity to continue, closed it out with the
birdie at the second playoff hole and her second one in two visits
to the 11th hole during the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going in,'' said Pak, who was walking with
clenched fists before the ball reached the hole.
</P>
<P>
   She cried in the embrace of her mother and father as the Open's
fourth consecutive foreign-born champion _ Sweden's Annika
Sorenstam in 1995 and '96 and Gibraltar's Alison Nicholas last year
_ and its youngest in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I cry,'' Pak said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, finally, all the days of ``no nervous'' simply required
release.
</P>
<P>
   She's still just a kid, you know.

 &HT;    Sheffield wants nothing to do with Kendall
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Gary Sheffield didn't have any bruises on his face
Monday. That doesn't mean he's forgiven Pittsburgh Pirates catcher
and fellow NL All-StarJason Kendall for a fight they got into
during a game June 28 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has no intention of speaking to Kendall _ a guy
Sheffield doesn't want to see on any baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room for players like that in the game,'' Sheffield
said. ``You won't see me sitting next to him on the bench. He's not
my teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was crossing home plate when Kendall's helmet came
off. Kendall thought Sheffield intentionally knocked it off, and
started yelling profanities and calling him a cheap shot
(expletive) as Sheffield was going to the Dodgers dugout.
</P>
<P>
   A wrestling match ensued during which Sheffield said he tried to
pick up Kendall and got hit in the face with his shinguard, which
opened a cut near his eye. Sheffield said he's seen a lot worse
plays at home plate, that it was nothing intentional, and that he's
not the type of player who would do something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to show me up in front of 45,000 people,''
Sheffield said. ``I wasn't going to allow that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall feels situation is over and had nothing to say, although
he seemed surprised by Sheffield's comments. Both players received
three-game suspensions from NL President Len Coleman, and both will
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Their lockers were at opposite ends of the Colorado Rockies
clubhouse at Coors Field. Sheffield almost didn't have a locker
there at all. He didn't want to come to the All-Star game. He
hasn't been in Florida since he was traded from the Florida Marlins
on Friday, May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to get away from the game,'' Sheffield said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda called Sheffield into his
office and persuaded him to participate in the game. He told
Sheffield he'd only have to show up Tuesday, the day of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball wouldn't allow that. So instead, the
Dodgers flew his two daughters and his parents in from St.
Petersburg and his son in from Phoenix and will put them up at a
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat their players like God,'' Sheffield said. ``What
more can you ask for?''

HUNDLEY SCHEDULED TO PLAY ON SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since Todd Hundley underwent reconstructive
elbow surgery last September, the New York Mets had been reluctant
to say when their most popular player would be able to return to
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed Monday when general manager Steve Phillips
announced that Hundley would rejoin the Mets on Saturday and make
his first major league start in the outfield that night against the
Montreal Expos at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put into words how I feel, to tell you the truth,''
Hundley said Monday from Port St. Lucie, Fla. ``It's been such a
long road, a very tough road. To be able to get back in, to go home
and play at Shea, it's going to be the best day of the year for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan since spring training had been for Hundley to rejoin
the Mets somewhere near the All-Star Game break. Apparently, the
Mets decided that the former catcher was ready for major league
action after he demonstrated that he could make long throws from
the outfield with no discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's even getting outfield assists now,'' Phillips said of
Hundley, who threw out a runner at second base on Sunday night in a
Class A game and will now play two games later this week with Class
AAA Norfolk before rejoining the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's return comes at a crucial time for the Mets, who have
been in a slump for weeks and find themselves five games behind the
San Francisco Giants in the National League wild-card race, the
Mets' only realistic doorway into the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' biggest problems have been a shaky bullpen and an
offense that has remained surprisingly meager even after the
acquisition of Mike Piazza in May. Whether the arrival of Hundley,
who like Piazza is an all-star catcher and a bona fide slugger,
will give the Mets the jolt they need is an intriguing question.
Hundley has not faced major league pitching in more than nine
months and may or may not be ready to hit with authority in the
weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt ready, Hundley replied: ``Yeah, yeah,
yeah. My hitting is coming and my swing is back to where it should
be.'' He added: ``I feel good, I feel confident and I'm seeing the
ball. It's just a matter of me getting some quality strikes to
swing at.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Hundley will first play in Indianapolis with Class
AAA Norfolk on Thursday and Friday nights. At Class A St. Lucie,
where he was batting .214 after going 0 for 5 Monday night, Hundley
had not been getting that many good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the issue of how effectively Hundley will hit, and
how effectively he will play in the outfield _ he has been taking a
crash course in defense _ is the question of how Hundley will mesh
with Piazza, who, in effect, took away his job behind the plate
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who hit 71 home runs in the last two seasons for the
Mets, is expected to bat behind Piazza in the lineup and provide
him some protection. It might be the look of the middle of the
Mets' lineup for years to come _ and it might not be.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Hundley again refused to rule out the possibility
that he would want to catch after this season, which presents an
obvious problem should Piazza re-sign with the Mets. The common
assumption is that the Mets will give Piazza whatever he wants to
stay in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets also must decide how much money they may want to
commit to three other potential free agents _ Al Leiter, John
Franco and Dennis Cook, all of whom are having excellent years. In
addition, the Mets are saddled with millions of dollars of salary
obligations next year for three players _ Bernard Gilkey, Mel Rojas
and Brian McRae _ whom they would probably love to trade right now,
and probably can't.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Furthermore, there is no guarantee that Piazza wants to return
with the Mets. Phillips and Piazza's representatives are not
believed to have had any substantive contract talks yet, although
Nelson Doubleday, the Mets' co-owner, reiterated Monday his desire
to see both Piazza and Hundley remain with the Mets for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, absolutely,'' Doubleday said when asked if the plan was
still to re-sign Piazza. ``And we want Todd to spend the rest of
his life with the New York Mets. We just don't know what position
he will be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has two guaranteed years left on his contract after this
season. His fears that the Mets would turn around and trade him to
a noncontending team after re-signing Piazza led Hundley to ask for
_ and the Mets to agree to _ a limited no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Piazza again stated in a television interview
Monday what he has been saying all along: that he hopes things work
out with the Mets and he can re-sign with them but that he also
wants very much to play for a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is some question whether the Mets are just
that. After winning nine straight games from May 21-31 _ the last
seven after Piazza joined the team _ the Mets (44-39) were just
13-19 heading into the break, losing seven of their final nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   While Piazza is hitting .341 in 35 games since joining the Mets
on May 23, he is just 7 for 32 (.219) with one home run and seven
runs batted in with runners in scoring position. That says as much
about the Mets' inability to put men on base in front of him as it
does about Piazza's recent tendency to press with men on base.
</P>
<P>
   Can Hundley help change the Mets' production? In one sense, it
will be hard for him to do worse than the Mets' current starting
outfield _ Gilkey, McRae and Butch Huskey, all of whom are batting
lower than .250. But can he do better? And if so, enough to make a
difference for the Mets?

IN THE BRONX AND BEYOND, SUMMER CAMP CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MACARENA HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If 11-year-old Joey Antonio had his way, he would
spend the next six weeks of his summer at home in the Kingsbridge
section of the Bronx watching television, preferably ``Fresh Prince
of Bel Air.'' But his mother had a different plan.
</P>
<P>
   ```Joey,' she said, `we need to find a place for you to go to
camp,''' he recalls his mother, Carmen Aquino, telling him two
weeks before he finished sixth grade at New Covenant Christian
School. ``My mom doesn't want me to sit home and do nothing. She
just says TV is bad for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey, along with hundreds of other New York City children,
started his first day of summer camp. Some were driven an hour from
their homes to get to a camp. For others it was much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Joey only had to walk across the street to the Kingsbridge
Heights Community Center, where his mother enrolled him in a day
camp. He will be one of more than a million children in New York
state who will be attending overnight or day camps this summer,
said Adam Weiss, the executive director of the New York section of
the American Camping Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education, teaming up with community organizations,
also opened several sites Monday for its summer program,
Break-Aways Camps, which incorporates academics into the camp
experience for 1,300 students with the goal of improving their
school records. The program is free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   At Kingsbridge Heights Community Center, about 12 neighborhood
teen-agers and 20-somethings will spend the summer teaching
physical education, art, and computer and drama classes to 100
children ages 6 through 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make it too academic because we want to make
it fun,'' said the summer day camp's director, Michell Tollinchi,
24, who started working at the camp as a counselor when she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the surrounding community, the camp is not only a
lifeline for children, but also for parents. At Kingsbridge Heights
Community Center, about 90 percent of heads of households work, Ms.
Tollinchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aquino, Joey's mother, and other parents pay $575 to send
their children to Kingsbridge Heights Community Center for six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send him to camp so that he won't be laying around at home,
so he can have fun and interaction with other kids,'' said Ms.
Aquino, a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   Two-income households, and the resulting day care problems, have
caused a 10 percent annual increase in the number of children
attending camps nationwide in the last few years, said Weiss of the
American Camping Association.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the children who will spend their days at the camp are
Ian Pershad, 8, and his sister, Keshia, 11. Ian spent much of his
day Monday drawing a portrait of another camper, Marissa Rodriguez,
11, on an 11-by-14-inch sheet of white paper. He was stuck on the
nose for about five minutes, and he did not pencil in her long
brown hair until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa had similar difficulties. ``I can't draw his hat, and
his eyes are hard to draw because he's looking down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Keshia was also drawing a portrait of a fellow
camper, Lizette Tagle, 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more fun because at my grandmother's house I'd
be sleeping,'' Keshia said.

N.Y. UNIONS AND LOCAL GROUPS JOIN TO FORM A NEW POLITICAL PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By ABBY GOODNOUGH  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A coalition of labor unions and community groups
announced Monday that it was forming a new political party that it
hoped would prod Democratic candidates to pay more attention to the
organizations' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group, known as the Working Families Party, said
they were not cutting ties with the Democratic Party but were
trying to stop what they described as its recent drift toward a
more conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   They endorsed Peter Vallone, the speaker of the New York City
Council, who is a Democratic candidate for governor, saying that he
cared about working-class families more than the other Democrats
who want to unseat Gov. George Pataki, the Republican incumbent,
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the new party also said they were endorsing
Vallone for a more tactical reason: because they think that he is
the only candidate in the race for governor who can draw 50,000
votes on the Working Family Party's line, which would allow the
party to meet the legal requirement for it to retain a place on the
ballot in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Peter's record is a good one,'' said Bob Master,
political director for the New York region of the Communications
Workers of America, which led the effort to create the party. ``But
there is no question that there is also a practical consideration
here, which is that we need to back someone who can win the primary
and help us stay on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the new party is supporting Vallone rather than bringing a
new candidate into the mix, it will probably have little effect on
the Democratic primary, which is in September. But by supporting a
candidate whom it considers likely to receive the required 50,000
votes on its line, the party might draw enough attention to itself
to become a force in future elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, before the party can get on this year's primary ballot,
its leaders will need to collect 15,000 signatures. Master said the
party would begin doing so immediately. He said the unions that had
joined the party had at least 200,000 members and that some of
those members would help with the petition drive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Master added that the party _ which also endorsed State Sen.
Catherine Abate, a Democrat, for state attorney general _ would not
be endorsing a candidate for the U.S. Senate because leaders of the
various unions could not agree on one.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the new party said they also hoped to weaken the
influence of the Liberal Party, which is supporting Lieut. Gov.
Betsy McCaughey Ross, who switched from the Republican to the
Democratic Party last year. Labor unions and other traditionally
left-leaning groups have been increasingly disenchanted with the
Liberal Party since 1989, when it began supporting Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's been a long time since the Liberal Party
has really stood for anything,'' Master said. ``And obviously the
Liberal Party has a lot to lose if we emerge with a lot more votes
than they do in November.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond B. Harding, the longtime leader of the Liberal Party
in New York, said the emergence of the Working Families Party was
by no means a ``cataclysmic event.'' Harding said he did not think
the new party would hurt McCaughey Ross' candidacy because many
working-class voters still support candidates running on the
Liberal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone understands what is in the minds of working
families, it's the Liberal Party,'' Harding said. ``It's the
working families of New York City that elected and re-elected Rudy
Giuliani.''

SOUP'S GREAT, NOW GET OUT 
PUFF PARTY 
BENEFICIAL GIFTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Yeganeh, who was parodied in the sitcom
``Seinfeld'' for his soup mania, is still drawing rave reviews from
foodies. His Soup Kitchen International, on West 55th Street near
Eighth Avenue, was listed at the top of 38 New York restaurants in
``America's Best Meal Deals,'' a slim volume from the Zagat Survey
restaurant raters. Soup Kitchen International's meal-in-a-cup
scored a 27 on a 30-point scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soup is terrific,'' said Nina Zagat, who, with her
husband, Tim, edited the listing of 1,411 restaurants in 35 cities.
``The food is a 27. That's very, very good. If you can get 27 food
for $13, you're willing to put up with a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, Yeganeh's singular way of greeting and treating
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people in our office tell their tales,'' she said.
``People talk about how he was abusive, and how if you'd ask a
question about what's in it or why do I have to wait on line, the
guy would say, `Get out of here.' He's awfully sweet to Tim and me
when we go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't go by soon. As is his custom, Yeganeh has closed Soup
Kitchen International for the summer and is said to be out of the
country, looking for new recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Puff Party
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The main difference between St. Bart's at
Christmastime and the Hamptons on the Fourth of July was that there
were no yachts this time. Other than that, for a certain segment of
the partygoing population, the long weekend was about soirees given
by Ted Field, the chairman of Interscope Communications, and Sean
Combs, the rap impresario known as Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   For Field's party on Friday, beefy security guards turned away
would-be crashers. Those admitted to Field's rented estate in
Amagansett Revlon chairman Ronald O. Perelman; actor Mark Wahlberg;
director Penny Marshall, and ``downtown'' Julie Brown, a former MTV
veejay who came straight from a party that Playboy magazine had
given for her at a club in Southampton called Life's a Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Combs was also there, and clearly did not want to wait to have
fun. So he went to the deejay's booth and announced the guests by
name. ``Russell Simmons in the house,'' he said. ``Andre Harrell in
the house. Hamptons magazine in the house.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same guests were in Combs' house in East Hampton the
next day. Mike Tyson seemed calm as he waited to be served by a
Mister Softee truck that Combs had hired to sit in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, as in St. Bart's, the crowd's mantra was:
``Where are you going next?'' And at 8 p.m., Combs announced that
the party was over, to the relief of neighbors who had worried all
year that this year's party would be as loud and long as last
year's, which did not break up until after 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficial Gifts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, Finn M.W. Caspersen did not give away the
multimillion-dollar golden parachute he received from his old
company, Beneficial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But after Beneficial joined forces with Household International,
its main competitor in the consumer loan business, in an $8.6
billion stock swap, he decided he did not want to accept an offer
to be chairman and a director. ``I think you have to make clean
breaks in life,'' he said. ``They said, `You have some
charities.'''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J., and the Harvard
Law School are dividing $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Caspersen graduated from Peddie in 1959 and Harvard Law School
in 1966, after time out for an undergraduate degree from Brown
University. He said that his most unforgettable Harvard moment was
``when I got the acceptance letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have it,'' he said. ``I said, `I could end up in the
gutter, but I got into Harvard Law School.'''

SHUFFLING OF N.Y.C. SCHOOL BOARD REVIVES TALKS ON POLICE IN THE
SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JACQUES STEINBERG   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The formal installation of two new members of the New
York City Board of Education on Tuesday has prompted renewed talks
with City Hall over the long-idled proposal by Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani to put the police in charge of safety in some schools,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new members, Terri Thomson of Queens, who said she
has an open mind about the proposal, could provide the mayor with
the majority he has long sought. And both City Hall and board
officials said the possibility of a majority voting with the mayor
and against Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who opposes broad police
control in the schools, had prompted both sides to resume
negotiations. They said the framework of an agreement could be in
place perhaps by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, Crew and four of the board's seven
members have resisted the mayor's efforts to bring the troubled
school safety division under police control. The mayor said last
year that he would be willing to compromise; he proposed that the
police assume responsibility for safety in more than 100 of the
most violent schools. But talks bogged down over the concerns of
Crew and the board, including whether the board's safety officers
would become police employees and whether principals would have to
defer to police commanders in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday morning, however, the mayor will be dealing with a
board that has no clear stance on a police takeover. Two of the
four opponents to an expanded police role _ Luis Reyes of Manhattan
and Carol Gresser of Queens _ have been replaced by members named
by their respective borough presidents. The Manhattan
representative, Irving S. Hamer Jr., will continue to oppose a
broad takeover, according to Manhattan Borough President C.
Virginia Fields. But Gresser's successor, Thomson, and Queens
Borough President Claire Shulman, a sometime Giuliani ally, have
been far more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an opinion on this,'' Thomson said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said that since being selected in March to replace Gresser
beginning July 1, she has been researching the issue by talking to
parents and principals and reading the reams of reports
commissioned on the subject over the last decade _ including the
most recent, in 1996, by a mayoral panel that endorsed a police
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to keep an open mind on every issue,'' said
Thomson, 49, a vice president for community relations at Citibank.
``I am going to vote my conscience based on what is right for the
kids.''

ANALYSIS: FAMILIAR MISDEEDS PLAGUE NEW CHILD WELFARE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news articles carry eerie echoes of the old days.
Two girls are repeatedly raped by parents in a Brooklyn home deemed
safe by the city. An emaciated toddler hidden in a dark, airless
room nearly starves on a urine-stained mattress because his
caseworker fails to visit his foster home in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, these kinds of horror stories persuaded Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to create the Administration for Children's Services, to
put an end to sloppy child welfare investigations and family
assessments, and to insure that caseworkers would vigilantly
safeguard New York City's most vulnerable children.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, amid flashing cameras and barking questions, the
administration's commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, found himself
defending his agency's handling of those two recent cases, which
seem riddled with exactly the poor practices he vowed to eliminate.
A few days earlier, Giuliani publicly criticized the agency for
failing the Brooklyn girls by sending them home from foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Many people cannot help but wonder: What has truly changed?
</P>
<P>
   The unsatisfying answer, say lawyers, judges and caseworkers, is
that much has changed, but not enough to insure the safety of many
abused and neglected children. Nearly three years after its
creation, the Administration for Children's Services remains an
agency in transition, with its staff an awkward mixture of
committed, reform-minded caseworkers and negligent holdovers from
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some agency watchers are cheered by the changes under way, which
include aggressive hiring, more training and declining caseloads,
but they say it will take years for true reform to take hold.
Meanwhile, they say, some children will inevitably be harmed during
the city's watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are definitely moving in the right direction, but
realistically we're talking years from now in terms of systemic
change,'' said Monica Drinane, the lawyer in charge of the Legal
Aid Juvenile Rights Division, which represents the children in the
Staten Island and Brooklyn cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drinane said: ``Can we guarantee in the meantime that there
won't be cases like the ones we've seen these past few days? No, we
can't. But that doesn't mean we can afford to give up. Giving up is
not an option. How can we give up on children's lives?''
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the depth of the reforms could not come at a
more critical time. In three weeks, advocates for children will ask
a federal judge to appoint a receiver to take over the child
welfare agency. Despite Scoppetta's efforts, they say, New York
City still lags far behind where it should be. City officials, for
instance, still have no way to tell whether caseworkers are
actually making required visits or delivering court-ordered
services.
</P>
<P>
   Caseloads, which the city says have fallen to 16 from 27, are
still unevenly distributed. In Brooklyn, a supervisor said Monday
that workers have about 25 cases each.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, judges and lawyers for children say the city has
failed to devote enough money to finance desperately needed
services. Adolescents are in need of foster care beds, parents wait
months for drug treatment programs and children sleep in city
offices while officials scramble for beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed? Nothing's changed,'' said Marcia Robinson
Lowry, the executive director of Children Rights, the nonprofit
group that has sued the city on behalf of abused and neglected
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 2-year-old Staten Island boy, who weighed 18
pounds when he was discovered on Saturday, his caseworker failed to
visit him at all in June. She last saw him on May 14, and then she
went out of town. No one was sent to check on him in her place,
agency officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Another caseworker, who stopped to visit three other children
who also lived in the boy's foster home, noticed that the boy
looked looked thin on June 15. But she never checked his bedroom or
his weight, officials say. He was not her responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the sexual abuse case in Brooklyn, a caseworker was assigned
to see the girls twice a month. It is unclear whether she actually
did. It is also unclear whether city officials knew that child
welfare records show that the mother of the girls had been abused
as a teenager. The woman's aunt says she was raped by a relative
when she was 15.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its struggle to extend change from the top to workers on the
ground, New York City reflects the experiences of troubled agencies
around the country, which have stumbled in the march to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after officials in Missouri and the District of
Columbia embarked on aggressive improvement plans, they are still
struggling to serve the abused and neglected children in their
care, according to the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a
nonprofit research group, which has monitored the progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that one cannot hope to turn the performance of a
large, complex bureaucracy around in one year, or even three or
four,'' according to a study by center officials, who have also
served as child welfare experts for New York City officials and
lawyers for the city's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are slower than we would expect, and with New York
City being so big, it has to make it harder,'' Judith Meltzer, a
senior associate at the center.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Meltzer emphasized that some tasks should be completed
quickly, within six months or a year, including better training and
supervision and the development of a quality review program to
monitor the work of caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' she said, ``but it can be done.''

MAN KILLS HIMSELF IN HOSTAGE STANDOFF WITH POLICE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man held his ex-girlfriend hostage for an hour and
a half Monday in the Brooklyn plumbing business where they worked,
then apparently shot her before killing himself during a standoff
with police, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Zuleica Bermudez, 30, was listed in critical
condition Monday night at Bellevue Hospital Center. Co-workers said
that a month ago, Ms. Bermudez had broken up with the man, Robert
Wayne Jiles, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, Helen Henry, 25, jumped from a second-floor
balcony during the standoff and was treated for ankle injuries and
released at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn. All three
were employees of Dun-Rite Water Main and Sewer Contractors at
178-180 N. Ninth St. in Williamsburg, where the siege took place.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called at 11:25 a.m. by a report of an assault in
progress, said Chief Joseph Fox, a deputy chief for Brooklyn North.
When they arrived, Fox said, Jiles fired some shots and then
barricaded himself and Ms. Bermudez in an office on the building's
second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed North Ninth Street between Driggs and Bedford
Avenues, and four officers entered the two-story building. One
officer, climbing the stairs to help a fleeing woman, was forced by
gunfire to take cover in an office across the hall from the
besieged couple and eventually was freed by officers who sawed the
wrought-iron grille off the office window, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1 p.m., the officers heard several shots, and soon
found Jiles shot in the temple, Ms. Bermudez shot in the cheek, and
a .380-caliber semi-automatic handgun nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the couple, co-workers and Ms. Bermudez's ex-husband
described a relationship gone sour. ``Wayne was so quiet you would
never expect him to do something like this,'' said Eddie Santiago
Jr., 40, one of the company's 25 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bermudez, who was born in Panama and raised in Flatbush, had
apparently dated Jiles for about a year, and they had lived
together on South First Street in Williamsburg. She was a secretary
at Dun-Rite, and he did construction work on sewers, co-workers
said.

ENDING LONG SEARCH, KENNELLY FILLS 2ND SPOT ON DEMOCRATIC TICKET
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By MIKE ALLEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Ending a search so prolonged and public that
it threatened to become an embarrassment to her gubernatorial
campaign, Rep. Barbara Kennelly plans to announce Tuesday that she
has chosen a former state legislator as her running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Courtney, 45, a lawyer who retired from the State House
of Representatives in 1994, agreed Monday afternoon to be the
Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, one of Kennelly's
aides said. They are to make the announcement jointly on Tuesday in
Courtney's hometown of Vernon, east of Hartford, and then greet
voters at a diner, the aide said. In an effort to retain an element
of surprise about her selection, Kennelly confirmed Monday that she
had made her decision but would not say where she would announce it
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennelly, who is retaining her seat in Congress while she
campaigns, has trailed Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who is
seeking a second term, in polls and fund-raising. Her campaign
staff had made overtures about the second slot on the ticket to
several prominent Connecticut Democrats, and even a few obscure
local officials. All took themselves out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Her problem became such an open secret that last week a
political column in The Hartford Courant carried the headline,
``Wanted: Running Mate for Kennelly. Send Resumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, who was elected to the legislature four times, was
co-chairman of the House Human Services Committee and later
co-chairman of the Public Health Committee. He is known for being
liberal but practical, and received high marks for deft handling of
cuts to state programs for the poor, elderly and disabled during
the recession of the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   But he brings Kennelly's ticket none of the geographic diversity
that candidates often seek in a running mate. Vernon is just 13
miles from Hartford, where Kennelly is a lifelong resident.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, voters choose a governor and a lieutenant
governor as a pair. The current lieutenant governor, M. Jodi Rell,
will seek re-election with Rowland.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Party regulars had urged Kennelly to pick a running mate from
Fairfield County, home of many wealthy Democrats, or the New Haven
area, which is heavily populated. She had settled on a well-known
Fairfield County resident, Gene F. Eriquez, who is the mayor of
Danbury, but he developed a kidney ailment last month and withdrew
his name from consideration. Kennelly's supporters were especially
disappointed because Eriquez, an Italian-American, would have
brought ethnic diversity to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, party officials, who said they insisted on
anonymity because they did not want to spoil Tuesday's
announcement, said they were enthusiastic about the choice because
Courtney's legislative experience would help the ticket attack
Rowland's administration for its record on education, the
environment and public health.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket has quite a bit of ground to make up. In a poll
released last week by the University of Connecticut, Rowland had a
lead of 28 percentage points, 55 percent to 27 percent.

N.Y. CLOSED SCHOOL BOARD SESSION IS ASSAILED
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JACQUES STEINBERG   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Again raising the concerns of the New York State
official who enforces the open meetings law, the Board of Education
has scheduled a closed-door retreat Wednesday with Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew in Palisades, N.Y., 25 miles north of its
Brooklyn headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which was announced in a notice sent to reporters
on Monday, comes 11 months after the board met quietly at the same
location _ earning a verbal rebuke from the same official, Robert
Freeman, the executive director of the New York State Committee on
Open Government, a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the board, William C. Thompson Jr., said the
board had scheduled a closed, or executive, session at the IBM
Conference Center on Route 9W so members could escape distractions
like ringing phones. In an interview, he said that the board would
adhere to the letter of the law, discussing only subjects that are
permitted in executive session _ including personnel, contracts and
matters under litigation _ but not policy, which is prohibited. He
added that the board's counsel had the authority to cut off
improper discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman said the public has no way to monitor compliance.
For example, he said, a conversation about an ongoing lawsuit
concerning the special education system could veer into discussion
of the system's overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of human nature take over,'' Freeman said. ``And one
of the rules is that a group will drift into a new topic and that
new topic may not be among those that could validly be discussed in
private.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the board was violating the spirit of the law by
meeting so far from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the open meetings law is to encourage members of
the public and others to become familiar with the decision-making
process,'' Freeman said. ``How can they do that if meetings are
held outside their communities?''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the location was irrelevant because the meeting
would not be open to the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At their retreat last year, the board members discussed a
proposal by the chancellor's staff to limit the size and autonomy
of alternative schools, a policy discussion that Freeman said
appeared to violate the open meetings law. If the board had taken
any action that should have been taken in public, the action could
be invalidated by a lawsuit against the board.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in recent years, the board has been criticized
by parents and others for using closed-door sessions improperly. In
1993, the Public Education Association, a nonprofit advocacy group,
won permission from a state Supreme Court justice to examine the
minutes of such meetings.

COLUMN: HAPPY TIMES FOR METROHOLICS, BUT ...  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You could call Gene Russianoff a metroholic. To get
an idea of what a subway addict he is, consider how he ushered in
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Some people can be found in bars or clubs at midnight. But as
the third of July melted into the Fourth, Russianoff was standing
at the Union Street Station in Brooklyn with $63 in hand to buy the
new monthly subway pass that went on sale that very minute.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was going anywhere, except straight back home on
foot. But as a leader of the advocacy group known as the
Straphangers Campaign, he wanted to be in the delivery room, as it
were, for the birth of the new system of unlimited-ride passes that
is being trumpeted as a millenial change.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff even pondered hurling confetti at the token clerk,
but thought better of it. Just as well. You never know these days
if a festive gesture will become a quality-of-life offense.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to celebrate was understandable, though. Passes of
this type have long been the Straphangers' Holy Grail, and now they
are in hand. So is a big test of whether they will bring about the
miracles some are predicting. Russianoff acknowledged the point
Monday as he rode the No. 6 line from station to station to see how
the cards sold during the first morning rush they were in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting what we want,'' he said, ``and now we'll find
out if it makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki proclaimed the other day that the fare
discounts would empower the rider. That had a nice ring to it, and
will no doubt provide the governor with a campaign sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   But you might want to remember that it was the same Pataki who
depowered the rider a few years ago when he cut state subsidies for
New York mass transit by hundreds of millions of dollars. He took
away so much money, in fact, that he brought about the largest
increase ever in the subway and bus fare, an increase that proved
to be unnecessary and is effectively being scaled back now.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's political interests aside, some have described
the new monthly and weekly passes as innovations that will alter
urban life. That seems a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, being able to take as many trains and buses as you want is
exciting. But life-altering? It is a phrase better saved for truly
cosmic change in the subways, like whatever it takes to persuade
the jughead standing above you that it is boorish of him to munch
on pizza as the train lurches through the tunnel. That would
require a real miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the new passes are less lofty, and some lend
themselves to easy measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Will subway and bus ridership increase? That seems to be a
given.
</P>
<P>
   Will subway and bus service improve enough to handle the extra
load? That cannot be taken for granted. The masters of the
underground have not done nearly enough to handle the extra 400,000
riders a day produced by the 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 discount
that went into effect a year ago. So it is not unreasonable to ask
how bad the crowding has to get before they add more cars. Arms and
legs sticking out the doors as trains leave the station?
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious test is whether the new passes will lure
motorists out of their cars and onto mass transit. The Straphangers
Campaign and Pataki predict that will happen. But the discounts of
the last year have yet to do much good in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   While there are more subway riders, there are also more motor
vehicles than ever entering Manhattan, nearly a million a day
during the week. That no doubt is because these are good times, and
many more people are driving to work. Three cheers for the economy!
But the city center is choking on traffic, and political leaders
have done precious little to discourage people from driving into
town.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff argued that lowering the mass-transit fare is only
part of the solution. Better subway service is also needed, he
said, and stern anti-car measures like tolls on the East River
bridges. Those kinds of steps are not necessarily out of the
question some day, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Pollyana-ish thought,'' he said, ``but if these passes
can happen, maybe other changes can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But let us, like Scarlett O'Hara, think about that
tomorrow, and deal with a more immediate anxiety. Have you thought
at all about how to keep your monthly pass safe? Lose it, and it's
goodbye $63. That's real money.

DEVILS SIGN HOLIK FOR 3 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a week after losing Doug Gilmour to free agency, the
New Jersey Devils have signed Bobby Holik, their top-line center.
</P>
<P>
   Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello confirmed Monday that
Holik, a restricted free agent who was coming off his best season,
signed a three-year deal over the weekend. Terms were not
announced, but the contract is believed to be worth about $7.5
million. Holik, 27, earned $714,000 last season when he led the
Devils in scoring with 29 goals and 36 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Gilmour, the Devils' third-leading scorer last
season behind Holik and defenseman Scott Niedermayer, made signing
Holik imperative. Gilmour signed a three-year, $18 million deal
last week with the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Holik, whose plus-minus rating was plus-23 last season, had said
he would not attend training camp without a new contract, and he
could have requested salary arbitration next week if a deal had not
been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gillis, Holik's agent, said he was not surprised that an
agreement came so quickly. Holik was vacationing in Wyoming on
Monday and was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Holik's offensive production was overshadowed by a season-ending
slump that continued into the playoffs. After not scoring a goal in
the Devils' final 16 regular-season games, he did not have a point
in five games in their first-round playoff loss to Ottawa. He
missed one game in the playoffs because of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Other Devils who remain unsigned as Group II free agents are
Steve Thomas, Jason Arnott, Denis Pederson, Niedermayer and Petr
Sykora.

MAKERS OF ATHLETIC SHOES RETHINK STAR-POWER STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, Reebok International trusted that a
7-foot-1-inch behemoth named Shaquille O'Neal would shepherd the
company to global footwear domination. At the 1993 Super Show, a
sprawling sporting goods convention, the towering centerpiece of
Reebok's mammoth booth was a 15-foot photographic cutout of O'Neal,
the Orlando Magic's rookie center.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman, saw a limitless future for the
Shaq Attaq, the sneaker named for O'Neal, and a finite one for the
Nike Air Jordan shoes endorsed by Michael Jordan. ``I think Jordan
has three or four years of significance left, at the top,'' Fireman
said at the time. ``Shaq is next. We will use Shaq to catapult to
leadership throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But just last week Reebok waved goodbye to O'Neal, now a Los
Angeles Laker, convinced that he was not worth his $3 million
yearly fee. He simply had not delivered the rim-rocking marketplace
slam dunk that Reebok expected for its five-year investment. ``Even
when basketball sales were very good at Reebok, Shaq shoes didn't
sell very well,'' said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods
Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok is not the only athletic shoe company to rethink this
kind of endorsement strategy, or at least to wonder if paying
enormous sums to players will produce significant sales.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a major shift in the athletic shoe market, an $8
billion (wholesale) domestic business, especially in the
high-priced ``signature'' basketball segment. In this rare air,
companies once vied fiercely to sign the new face, the silky
silhouette or the hot attitude judged most capable of sparking
sales of the latest $100-plus pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an oversaturation of athletes associated with
signature product,'' said Howe Burch, vice president of marketing
for Fila America. ``It's too much of a good thing, like the stock
market correcting itself. Whether it's athletes' off-court behavior
or people unhappy with the business of sports, people are tired of
it and they vote at retail.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Jordans remain the only sure thing in the signature market.
While O'Neal's impact on sales has been decidedly un-Jordanesque,
so has Reebok's experiment with Allen Iverson and Fila's with Grant
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we've been impacted by the problems in the basketball
category,'' Burch said, ``whether it's Grant's shoe, Chris Webber's
shoe or Jerry Stackhouse's shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended March 31, Fila's parent company lost $8.7
million. When Nike posted a $67.7 million lost last month, its
first quarterly loss in 13 years, Phil Knight, the company's
chairman, said: ``It was not a good year by Nike standards, but
then our futures aren't very good either.'' Nike's Asian business
is in turmoil, and it is laying off 1,600 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok lost $3.4 million in its first quarter ended March 31.
Converse reported that sales of its basketball line tumbled 50
percent in its first quarter, which also ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's move to sever ties with O'Neal ``was a difficult
decision to make,'' said John Frascotti, Reebok's vice president of
sports marketing, but was apparently part of an evolving strategy
being adopted by other shoe companies: trim the ranks of well-paid
athletes and rely on the quality of the product. ``Consumers have
shifted away from being spoon-fed a formulaic approach to athlete
endorsement and are being more discreet,'' Frascotti said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is only the biggest National Basketball Association star
with whom Reebok has cut its lucrative endorsement ties. Reebok has
slashed its NBA roster from about 100 players to between 40 and 45.
Other casualties include the Milwaukee Bucks' Glenn Robinson. In
football, Reebok cut Dallas' Emmitt Smith; in baseball, it cut
Colorado's Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Converse has parted ways with the Knicks' Larry Johnson _
Grandmama, his cross-dressing alter ego, left the gym two years ago
with nothing but free shoes _ and with Latrell Sprewell after
Sprewell choked his coach at Golden State, P.J. Carlesimo. Nike
showed the door to Oliver Miller (except for some merchandise) and
told two dozen others they would get performance bonuses, not
guaranteed cash.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball shoes are the highest-profile products in most
companies' portfolios, so they get the most attention when business
turns down. Some companies and analysts say they believe consumers
are shifting their tastes to the so-called brown shoes, footwear
made by outfits like Doc Martens and Timberland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic shoe market is in terrible shape and the first to
go are the high-profile, expensive athletes,'' said Bob Williams,
president of Burns Sports, a Chicago-based service that matches
athletes with advertisers. ``The entire industry is in a bind
because research is finding that children aren't choosing athletic
shoes as their first choice, and leaving Nike and Reebok with their
pants down, trying to justify their expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the shoe companies had spent the past decade in a
follow-the-leader syndrome, bidding up the price for the
endorsement services of players whose ability to sell the products
were, at best, dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Dennis Rodman didn't work for Converse,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Jim Andrews, editor of the IEG Endorsement Insider, a new
monthly newsletter, ``They felt they had to sign up everybody, and
the consumer can't tell one from another.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Horan of Sporting Goods Intelligence, notes, the shift
in the basketball market is mainly at the high end.
``Moderate-price stuff is still selling well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the situation from a happy reserve is New Balance, the
Boston-based company that has largely avoided endorsements. New
Balance abides by a slogan it devised several years ago: ``Endorsed
by No One,'' partly because the company does not believe in the
concept and partly because of the risk in making such an expensive
investment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New Balance is shielded from the fallout of declining sales in
basketball shoes. More than one-third of its $650 million in sales
is in running shoes, with barely 1 percent in basketball, said Paul
Heffernan, the company's vice president for global marketing.
``Foot Locker once said to us, `You're not into hero marketing, so
you won't get big in basketball,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one on New Balance's small athletic roster stars in the
company's television commercials or print advertisements. The
runner Keith Brantley is the highest-paid New Balance endorser at
$40,000 a year. The company's $13 million advertising budget this
year (up from $4 million) is puny compared with most of his
competitors'. ``If the budget went up to $25 million, I'd be doing
the same thing,'' Heffernan said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, agents for major league athletes know not to call New
Balance. ``I got a call from Jackie Joyner-Kersee and someone from
auto racing, but the big-ticket players, they know we won't do
it,'' Heffernan added. ``Our competitors are mainly marketeers.''
</P>
<P>
   Big names do not endorse K-Swiss, either. The tennis shoemaker's
biggest names are the Australian doubles team Todd Woodbridge and
Mark Woodforde, and the retired Virginia Wade. ``Making superior
shoes is where we want to be,'' said Steve Nichols, chairman of
K-Swiss. ``Guys like Lendl and Sampras, I don't know if they sell
shoes. But we have literally thousands of endorsers _ the people
who've worn our shoes for years.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are still big bets being made on stars the
shoe companies believe will survive and prosper into the
post-Jordan era. Reebok is wagering $5 million a year on Iverson,
the Philadelphia 76er guard. Hill's deal with Fila pays him $80
million over seven years, and Adidas America is paying richly, but
less than Hill's deal, for the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who proved to
be more style than substance during most of his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got five young players with contracts we can live
with,'' said Sonny Vaccaro, a director of sports marketing for
Adidas America, referring to a group that includes Bryant, the
Boston Celtics' Antoine Walker and the teen-ager Tracy McGrady of
the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike's still a million miles away from us, but if Kobe is what
we think he is, he can really lead the next generation,'' Vaccaro
said. But the two-year-old strategy has not dramatically altered
Adidas' sales or earnings, he said. Other sports, like soccer, are
carrying the company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Converse has adopted a less expensive tack: signing
young players who are not as well known, like Cleveland's Brevin
