<HEADLINE> Zambian Border Residents Urged on Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian residents in Luapula
Province along the border with Zaire have been urged to be extra
vigilant and report all suspected illegal immigrants to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Luapula Province Deputy Permanent
Secretary Norman Chibamba in Mansa, capital of Luapula Province
today, according to Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba said that the security system has been over stretched
because of the wide border with Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said there is now a pressing need for effective and
constant monitoring on the Zambian border because of the danger
that some fleeing people from Zaire will use other illegal means
to enter Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to those who are harboring refugees ''not to allow
themselves to be used to these illegal immigrants. They should
report such suspected strangers to the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
As for the 1,000 refugees who had reportedly arrived in Mwense
district of Luapula Province over last weekend, Chibamba said
they went back to Zaire on Saturday after the situation in the
rebel-captured Kasenga improved.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees only stayed on the Zambian side for one
day. He denied that all the 1,000 were Zairean soldiers who were
armed heavily. There are two Burundi soldiers who are being
looked after along with seven Zairean soldiers, according to
Chibamba.

KIEV, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wu
Bangguo today met his Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Pinzenik, and
the two vowed to boost bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who arrived on Monday for a two-day visit, said the two
countries should promote cooperation in trade in line with their
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
He said there is great potential for trade cooperation due to
the two countries' complementary economies.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted mutual trust constitutes the basis for trade
cooperation, which has been fortified through frequent contacts
among leaders of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Pinzenik said the two governments should encourage businessmen
in the two countries to increase contacts.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Ukraine and China stood at 567 million
U.S. dollars in 1996, which put Ukraine as China's second largest
trade partner within the Commonwealth of Independent States.

But Ukrainian experts foresee a trade potential of 2 billion
dollars. There are more than 60 Chinese-Ukrainian joint ventures

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Parliament Decides to Scrap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Both houses of Pakistan's
parliament today adopted a key constitutional amendment bill,
scrapping controversial portions of the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment Bill, unanimously passed by the National
Assembly and the Senate in one day, divests the president of his
powers to dissolve the National Assembly and dismiss the
government.
</P>
<P>
One of the annulled clauses of the Eighth Amendment had
empowered the president to dissolve the National Assembly when "a
situation has arisen in which the government of the federation
cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary."
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment Bill also repeals an article of the
constitution regarding the appointment of provincial governors.
The governors would now be appointed on the advice of the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new bill takes away powers of the governor to
dissolve the provincial assembly and, through an amendment to
another article of the constitution, withdraws the powers of the
president to appoint "in his discretion" the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Committee and Service Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly after the passage of the
bill, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the unanimous adoption of
the bill had restored the spirit of the parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
The move was in fact a reflection of the consent of the whole
nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sharif announced in the Senate that a cross party
constitutional reform committee for reviewing the controversial
clauses of the constitution would be formed.
</P>
<P>
The committee would recommend a package of constitutional
reforms, he said, adding that in future all political parties
would be involved in matters of national importance.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, also chairperson of the
Pakistan People's Party, called the passage of the 13th Amendment
a positive step.
</P>
<P>
She said that a strong leadership was essential for the
increase of trade and exports and it would now be provided by the
office of the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of other political parties also lauded the revocation
of the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
It would help strengthen the country's democratic institutions
and put democracy on a proper path, they said.
</P>
<P>
The infamous Eighth Amendment was inserted in the constitution
in 1985 by the partyless parliament during the rule of the late
President Zia-ul Haq.
</P>
<P>
Its most controversial provision has since been used four times
to dismiss elected governments and has been a source of constant
political instability.
</P>
<P>
Under the Eighth Amendment, the president had discretionary
powers to dismiss the government and the National Assembly,
appoint services chiefs, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
committee and the chief election commissioner.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Immediate Resumption of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- France said today that the violent
incidents which have been taking place over the past several days
in the Palestinian territories showed "the emergency for the
immediate resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations."
</P>
<P>
A French foreign ministry spokesman said that a "return to the
past" of the situation in the Palestinian territories cannot be
ruled out, referring to the Palestinian Intifadha (uprising) in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinian militants were killed today by their own bombs
when they tried to make suicide bombing upon a school bus of young
Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip, while a Palestinian policeman
was killed today by Israeli security forces in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"These tragic events showed once again the emergency for the
immediate resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on all
the questions in suspense, political and on security, in order
that the concluded agreements be strictly applied," said the
spokesman, Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu of Israel said today that
Israel will not resume negotiations with the Palestinians "before
the Palestinian authority has proved in the field its will to
fight terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the decision by the Arab League to freeze the
normalization of relations between Israel and Arab nations, the
French foreign ministry spokesman said that the graveness of the
the situation calls for an immediate resumption of contacts
between Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes have been taking place on a daily basis between
Palestinians and Israeli security forces since Israel announced
its decision to build a new Jewish settlement in an Arab district
of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The United States has criticized the decision by the Arab
League, saying that the latter should help create an atmosphere
which is favorable for peace.

<P>
On the same occasion, President Karimov described his talks

<HEADLINE> Russian Politicians Divided Over Russia-Belarus Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian politicians have divergent
views on the Russia-Belarus Union Treaty, which was signed today
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarusian counterpart,
Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Boris Nemtsov, the newly-appointed first deputy prime minister,
warned Monday that the treaty should not hurt the people of the
two countries economically, politically or socially.
</P>
<P>
He said that it's better to leave a leeway to improve the union
treaty rather than being rash to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal
Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin (Yabloko), also said today that time was
not ripe for signing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that unification on the basis of the treaty is likely
to make the economic and political situation worse both in Russia
and Belarus, adding that the union treaty still needs details
added to all the provisions.
</P>
<P>
However, Speaker of the Russian State Duma Gennady Seleznyov
said today that the Russia-Belarus Union would be the first phase
of creating a confederation of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said that the Duma is likely to ratify the treaty
after a debate on April 9.
</P>
<P>
He added that the door to the Russia-Belarus Union would be
open to any other willing member nations of the CIS (Commonwealth
of Independent States).
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Lukyanov, Chairman of the Committee on Legislation and
Court Reform of the Duma, told the Itar-Tass news agency today
that the union is bound to be realized in any form despite
opposition from some people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the creation of the union is also a step
designed to counter the eastward enlargement of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Denying the claims that the signing of the treaty was
overhasty, Lukyanov said that everything had been planned a year
before and "we have been ready for the Russia-Belarus Union long
ago."
</P>
<P>
Sergei Dubinin, governor of Russia's Central Bank, said that it
would take at least several years to form a unified currency for
the Russia-Belarus Union and the Russian rouble is most likely to
become the single currency of the union.
</P>
<P>
He said that the signing of the treaty would not have immediate
negative economic consequences in Russia.

<HEADLINE> 13 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Fire Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Israeli soldiers were
wounded today when the bus they were traveling caught fire and
overturned after attacked by a petrol bomb thrown by Palestinian
protesters.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred this afternoon when the bus was
traveling on the road near a Palestinian refugee camp in northern
Ramallah, north of Jerusalem. The driver got burnt after the
petrol bomb attack and lost control of the bus, which crashed
down to the roadside and overturned.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said that 13 Israeli soldiers suffered
light to moderate injuries from the incident. They were
evacuated to a Jerusalem hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops immediately imposed a curfew in the area and
began investigation into the attack. Israel army denounced the
incident as a "serious escalation" of the Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli soldiers
continued today across the West Bank following two suicide
bombings in the Gaza Strip Tuesday and the death of two
Palestinians shot by Israeli border policemen in the West Bank
cities of Nablus and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, over 1,000 Palestinians held protests over the
death of a policeman who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers when
he took part in a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Israel stationed tanks, armed personnel carriers and snipers

violence. Nablus witnessed the bloodiest clash during late last
September's Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed, in which six Israeli
soldiers guarding the holy Jewish site of Joseph's Tomb were
killed by Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli woman was lightly wounded near Ramallah when her
car was hit by stones thrown by Palestinian protesters. An
Israeli girl was also slightly hurt near Bethlehem as her
mother's car came under stone attacks.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Pressure Israel Back to Peace Track: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt
Mohamed Sobeih said today that the Arab stance would pressure the
Israeli leadership to return to the regional peace track and
abide by agreements.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Egyptian T.V. program, he accused the
Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of
"destroying all bridges of confidence and poisoning the
atmosphere of peace."
</P>
<P>
He said the Arabs have stepped up efforts to pressure Israel
to reverse the decision last month to go ahead with a 6,500-unit
Jewish settlement at Har Homa in disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The recent move is the Arab League resolutions calling for a
freeze in relations with Israel and reactivation of the Arab
economic boycott of Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is an occupied Arab land, that is why Israel should
never be allowed to build, even one house, in it or to change its
demographic status," Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must understand that the Arabs would never give up or
forgo their rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
He described as very strong the recent European Union
statement calling upon Israel to respect international
resolutions so as to straighten things up.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official stressed the importance of the role
played by Europe in the peace process and urged the EU to cut its
trade transactions with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Europe can put an end to the Israeli arrogance and conceit
through curbing its trade relations with the Jewish state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to save Jerusalem from all measures that would change
its position and preempt serious negotiations on its status," he
said. "The resolution on Jerusalem approved by the Arab League
Council meeting Monday has carved out such a clear Arab stance."
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have decided to stop normal relations, revive
economic boycott, close down Israeli missions and withdraw from
Mideast multilateral talks, in the strongest concerted step they
have taken since the Netanyahu government took office last June.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected security cooperation with
Israel and demanded it to give up the Jewish housing project on
disputed land in East Jerusalem, where they want to establish a
future capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel said peace talks can not continue until Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat gave an effective red
light to violence, including West Bank stone throwing riots and
suicide bombings by Islamic militants.

<HEADLINE> Rabe's Tombstone Arrives in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The tombstone of John H.D. Rabe,
who witnessed the Nanjing Massacre led by invading Japanese
military forces, arrived in Nanjing today from Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The tombstone of black granite, 91 cm x 50 cm, will be placed
in the Jiangdongmen Museum for the massacre victims, said Zhu
Chengshan, director of the memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
Rabe came to China in 1908 and served as the general
representative of Germany's Siemens Company. He was elected
chairman of International Committee of the Nanjing Safety Zone
when Japan invade the city. He housed 250,000 refugees in the zone
and protected more than 10,000 women from being violated by
Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Rabe left China for Germany in 1938 and died in 1951. His
wartime diaries, in which he recorded in great detail the Japanese
soldiers' crimes, were preserved and made public by his
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
His relatives decided early this year to donate the diaries to
the museum.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered both its
strong and weak points in industrial development, thanks to its

<HEADLINE> Pollution Hampers Asia's Aquaculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Increasingly polluted waters,
razing of mangrove habitats and high cost of feeds have adversely
affected Asia's fast-growing fish-farm harvests, a FAO press
release said today.
</P>
<P>
In the past 11 years, Asia's aquaculture expanded sevenfold,
and five countries -- the Philippines, China, India, Japan and
South Korea -- supply 80 percent of the world's harvests, mostly
carp, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO).
</P>
<P>
However, these bumper harvests have entailed "environmental
pay-offs" that are becoming onerous, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
Other problems Asian fish-farmers face are disease outbreaks
because of poor water and soil condition and toxic contamination.
</P>
<P>
In some Asian countries and regions, their coasts are crowded
with high densities of cages and rafts. Restricted circulation of
ocean waters into and out of the East Asian seas makes them
particularly sensitive to environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
In some Southeast Asian countries, industrial complexes near
coastal areas spew sewage and chemicals into the waters.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these adverse factors, exports of shrimp and
fish products by South and Southeast Asian countries are falling.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the radical shrinkage of biologically-diverse
mangrove forests, this region today faces other threats:
salination of groundwater and farm lands, destruction of habitats
for "wild-seed" shrimp larvae and poorly-fished coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
Public perception of aquaculture might be damaged by the
irresponsible practices of some entrepreneurs who have caused
serious environmental degradation and social disruption, it said.

Government will make positive steps, together with China, to
fulfill those agreements, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Thai Prime Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and Thai
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, in a session of formal talks
here today, expressed the conviction that China and
Thailand should foster closer good-neighborly ties of all-round
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Li voiced satisfaction with what he called
"fruitful cooperation" between China and Thailand over the years.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chavalit as "an old friend of China," Li said he
expected the Thai prime minister's China visit to be successful,
and the friendship between the two countries and peoples to
further develop.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said he was happy to meet Li in Beijing. He told Li
that many government ministers and military officers have come
with him on the visit, with the aim of strengthening bilateral
cooperation in wide-ranging fields.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers observed that as diplomatic ties enter
the third decade, the two countries are enjoying sound political
relations along with smooth exchanges in economy, culture and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
The last few years have witnessed a large increase in the
bilateral trade volume, vibrant mutual investment and a good
beginning in financial exchanges, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers said they believe the sustained
economic growth of China and Thailand will produce more
opportunities and favorable conditions for bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li and Chavalit discussed ways to expand and deepen cooperation
in waterpower, railway, oceangoing transportation, mutual
investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese Government holds a positive attitude toward
cooperation in these fields, and supports efforts made by Chinese
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit noted Thai businessmen have a strong interest in
investing in China, and Thailand would like to see Chinese
enterprises take part in Thailand's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Thai prime ministers also authorized their
related ministers to further study and carry out specific projects
of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit congratulated Li on China's resuming exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1. He said he is confident in
Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return, the Chinese premier stressed, China
will guarantee Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and protect
the lawful interests of foreign countries there, including those
of Thailand, by unswervingly pursuing the "one country, two
systems" policy initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit reiterated the Thai Government takes the "one China"
stance -- a policy it has pursued over the years. Li thanked the
Thai Government for backing China's position on questions, such as
the Taiwan issue, that concern China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit was happy to see that China has become a full dialogue
partner of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations),
saying that it is recognized by the world that China is enjoying a
closer relationship with the organization and a higher status in
the international and regional arena.
</P>
<P>
Li noted China pursues a good-neighborly policy of peace and
attaches great importance to its relations with Thailand and
cooperation with the ASEAN. It is willing to work with Thailand
and other ASEAN nations for the peace, stability and prosperity of
the region and the world as a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit extended an invitation to Li for a second trip to
Thailand, which met with Li's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit arrived this afternoon on an official visit to China
at the invitation of Li.

<HEADLINE> Success, Problems Mixed in China's Social Guarantee System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Reform of China's social guarantee
has made marked progress in the past decade and more, but problems
still exist, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The original social guarantee system in China, established under
and tailored to a planned economy, no longer accords with the
needs of the country's socialist market economy, Du Jian, director
of Social Guarantee Department under the Ministry of Finance, told
an international seminar on social guarantee funds management,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the issue, China began to reform its old social
guarantee system in 1986. To date, China has launched an extensive
reform in introducing a pooling pension system for employees of
urban-based enterprises and implemented pilot pension schemes in
some rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China's other achievements in reforming social guarantee
include the establishment of an unemployment insurance system and
an overall social planning system for unemployment insurance,
reforms in the health insurance system, the setting up of the
social welfare network in urban and township areas, and the
strengthened administration and supervision of the management of
social guarantee funds, according to Du.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that a total of 89.93 million people
had been covered by the overall social planning system by the end
of 1995 -- about 79.3 percent of China's workforce in
enterprises. Meanwhile, the system had also covered 23.1 million
retirees, about 97.6 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, a total of 82.71 million enterprise
employees across China had been covered by the unemployment
insurance service, accounting for 72.8 percent of the total
workforce. A total of 1.53 million employees had received
unemployment relief.
</P>
<P>
Official data also show that the social guarantee system of a
minimum living standard had been introduced in about 100 cities
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of a rural economy, the all-round
implementation of a family planning program and the demographic
changes, the previous pension system featuring the family security
concept for the rural areas could no longer meet the needs of
Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Chinese government decided to introduce on a trial
basis in some prosperous rural areas a pension plan of personal
savings. By the end of 1995, the program had been tested in more
than 1,500 counties across China, covering more than 50 million
farmers.
</P>
<P>
After more than ten years of reform, a social guarantee system
with Chinese characteristics which is fit for the market economy
has taken shape, Du said.
</P>
<P>
"However, as China's administrative control system and economic
mechanism are undergoing reform and readjustment, the social
guarantee system faces many problems," he said, referring to
increasing pressures from an aging population and unemployment,
and also to the fact that the distribution of national income has
been more focused on the individuals, making the state finance and
enterprises relatively financially difficult.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank statistics, people over age 60 in 1990
accounted for an average of 6.8 percent of the total population in
Asia and 8.9 percent in China.
</P>
<P>
The ratio will be as high as 18 percent by the year 2026, when
China will have one quarter of the world's total elderly
population, the World Bank predicts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Put Forwards New Agricultural Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert recently put
forward a new theory for agricultural development that increased
benefits would accrue if farmers harvested stems and leaves
instead of seeds or fruits of some crops.
</P>
<P>
Yan Guangcai, a researcher in Beijing, said that plant stems
and leaves usually have much more nutritive value than the
traditional "crops"-- seeds or fruits.
</P>
<P>
"For example, if flowering soybean sprouts were gathered
instead of soybeans months later, and the fresh sprouts were
processed into good-quality fodders, the total benefit from per
unit land area would almost double," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The key technology of this `soybean sprout pattern' is to
process the fresh sprouts into all kinds of fodders without losing
much of their nutritive value. This has already been settled,
technically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yan said, the fodders produced by this means can decrease stock
raising cost by 30 percent, and save half the crops.
</P>
<P>
Yan said that in many places of China, crops can be only
harvested once due to climate reasons. But planting another crop
of soybeans during the short growing season after the wheat
harvest will increase the total output and the farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
"In flood-struck areas without enough time for another crop of
wheat, a crop of soybean sprout will be a wise choice," Yan
said.

<HEADLINE> HK Hosts Seminar on Occupational Safety, Health Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on occupational safety
 and health was held here today as part of a campaign to promote a
 proposed legislation extending safety and health protection to
the non-industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The Occupational Safety and Health Bill was introduced into the
 Legislative Council last December and is expected to be formally
endorsed in the second quarter of this year, Hong Kong
Commissioner for Labor Jacqueline Willis told the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"Once passed, we shall have an ordinance offering safety and
health protection to employees from all sectors," she said.
</P>
<P>
At present only workers of industrial undertakings are
protected, mainly through the Factories and Industrial
Undertakings Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation.
</P>
<P>
Willis said the new bill is necessary partly because of the
economic restructuring in Hong Kong. For the past decade or so the
 number of those working in the non-industrial sector has
increased by 45 percent to hit 1.8 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, "The number of accidents occurring in the
sector is also an area of concern." Injury cases from the less
hazardous sector made up one-third of all the injury cases
recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the passage of the bill, the Labor
Department initiated a promotion campaign, sending by mail to all
employers an Occupational Safety and Health Bulletin, a 12-sheet
advertisement at metro stations, a radio and TV announcement, and
posters and leaflets.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts from Britain, Australia and the Chinese
mainland also addressed the one-day meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government remains
totally committed and determined to do its utmost to put in place
the best intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the
territory, a spokesman for the Trade and Industry Branch said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reference made to Hong Kong's IPR protection in
the National Trade Estimates Report published by the US Trade
Representative on March 31, the spokesman said Hong Kong will
persist with its anti-piracy efforts under the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We will continue to work with copyright owners from
the United States and other countries and seek their support, such
as testifying in Hong Kong courts of law."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are very disappointed to see remarks in the report
claiming that the government action has had little demonstrable
impact."
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has taken vigorous enforcement action
against copyright piracy activities at the importation, storage,
distribution and retail level.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1995, he said, the quantity and value of seizures
in connection with copyright offenses in 1996 have increased by
186 percent and 22 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 144 people were imprisoned for such offenses compared
with only 18 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hong Kong Customs will continue to take vigorous
enforcement action to combat copyright piracy, adding that the
government has proposed in the Copyright Bill a number of new
legislative measures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Hong Kong will further increase the
manpower of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau of the
Hong Kong Customs by 24 posts in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Vows to Improve Services for Overseas-Funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipal Government vows
better services for overseas-funded enterprises to improve the
overall investment environment and attract more capital.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yucheng, vice mayor of Beijing, told local press today that
the foreign investment into Beijing witnessed steady increase in
recent years. Meanwhile, "it is the overall investment environment
rather than the preferential policy that counts more now for
overseas investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to improve the environment, relevant
governmental departments today announced to focus on curbing the
irrational administrative fares levied on overseas-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The levies in the future will strictly abide by government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The officials should show a unified certificate to the
enterprises and fill a form issued by the city's finance
department. The enterprises otherwise can refuse to pay the fares.
</P>
<P>
More works will or have been done in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, seven departments, including taxation,
finance, and customs, organized a unified annual checkup for
overseas-funded ventures, greatly simplifying the procedures.
</P>
<P>
Also, the city's foreign economic relations and trade
commission has organized service teams for the selected 40
projects with an investment over 30 million US dollars. "The staff
are designated to tackle any problem in the operation of these
projects," according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Lu revealed that the municipal government is to issue local
regulations to encourage the overseas investment in hi-tech
industry and give preferential treatment for multinational
corporations to set up their regional headquarters in Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Painted Pottery Not Imported: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Painted pottery was not an import
from the West; Chinese painted-pottery culture moved from the east
to the west to meet with Western culture somewhere between
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Mid-Asia.
</P>
<P>
This is a theory offered by Li Shuicheng, deputy director of
the Department of Archaeology at Beijing University, in his
doctoral dissertation. He even wrote the dates and routes of the
Chinese painted-pottery culture's movement westward.
</P>
<P>
Archaeological finds have shown that painted pottery originated
in China some 7,000 years ago. China is one of the origins of
painted pottery in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's painted-pottery culture was highly developed in the
Loess Plateau in the northwestern part of the country, due to the
prevalence of the Majiayao culture found in Gansu and Qinghai
provinces, also in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Li's dissertation on types of painted pottery known as Banshan
and Machang -- two phases of the Majiayao culture, dating back
some 4,000-4,600 years -- pioneers China's study on the Majiayao
culture, which was first discovered 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
His paper examines the change of shape and design of the
painted pottery. The alterations in shape are the result of
reformed technology, while design expressed the potters' view of
themselves and nature, Li says.
</P>
<P>
According to Li's study, the change of design on the painted
pottery came about more quickly than that of its shape, suggesting
a slow development in pottery-making technology.
</P>
<P>
Pottery-making skills dominated the area for a long period of
time, resulting in the popularity of painted pottery, Li says,
adding that painted pottery soon disappeared after hand
craftsmanship was replaced by the pottery wheel.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Enterprises Urged to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Four top-level governmental bodies
has jointly issued a set of regulations to further define the
responsibility of township businesses in the country's
environmental protection program, aiming at salvaging the
endangered natural resources in countryside.
</P>
<P>
Jointly promulgated by the State Environmental Protection
Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, State Planning Commission and
State Economic and Trade Commission, the regulations require the
country's government leaders at county and township levels to keep
responsibility for protecting the environmental quality, and for
setting limits for the discharge volume of industrial wastes.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also stipulate that all the township
enterprises should meet the country's limit on waste discharge by
the year 2000. The governments at all levels should strengthen
their supervision on the implementation of the regulations in
township enterprises, and help the enterprises readjust their
manufacturing capacity to reduce the waste discharge.
</P>
<P>
The regulations say that local governments should shut down the
over-polluting enterprises such as the low-yield tannery, paper
mills with an annual output of 5,000 tons or below, illegal
pesticide makers, and the mining and chemical plants with low
technical benchmarks. From now on, any approval of the enterprises
of this kind will be outlawed here.
</P>
<P>
Also, the importing, processing, and using of solid wastes from
foreign countries will be strictly forbidden in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
To tighten the control of water pollution in the country's
major lakes and rivers, the regulations ban the launching of
chemical pulp factories, tanneries, dyeing mills, brewerys, and
electroplating plants in the valleys of Huaihe River, Haihe River,
Liaohe River, Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, and Dianchi Lake.
</P>
<P>
Besides monitoring the township enterprises in the
anti-pollution drive, the regulations also require the governments
at all levels to provide financial support for the "model
conservation projects" which will play an exemplary role in
promoting the pollution control technologies in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Japan Top Court Rules Donation to Yasukuni Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Supreme Court today ruled
that the Ehime prefectural government's donation of public money
to the Yasukuni Shrine from 1981 to 1986 violates the Constitution
which stipulates the separation of politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
It's the top court's first decision on the donation of
taxpayer's money to the shinto shrine in central Tokyo, according
the Kyodo News Service.
</P>
<P>
The ruling said that the donation violates Article 20 of the
Constitution, which stipulates "The state and its organs shall
refrain from religious activity." It's also against Article 89
which prohibits any public property from being used for any
religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was made in response to a suit filed in 1982 by a
group of local residents in Ehime prefecture, southwestern Japan,
against then Ehime governor Haruki Shiraishi and several other
local officials for donating public money to the Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni Shrine houses the memorial tablets of Japan's war
dead since 19th century, including 14 class-A war criminals such
as Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made a
"private" visit to the shrine on his birthday, which prompted
strong protests from China, South Korea and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the Ehime officials to repay a total of
166,000 yen (1,300 U.S. dollars) donated from 1981 to 1986 as the
plaintiffs had demanded.

<P>
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's current account deficit
rose to 9.3 billion marks (5.6 billion U.S. dollars) in January,
more than double the 4.1 billion marks (2.47 billion dollars)
registered in January last year, the German Federal Office of
Statistics in Wiesbaden said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The office blamed the current account deficit mainly on the
widening capital and investment deficit, which rose to 5.4 billion
marks (3.25 billion dollars) from 1.5 billion marks (900 million
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Other factors included high deficit in the service sector,
especially in travel and cash transfers.

Boosted by stronger foreign demand, German exports expanded to
64.4 billion marks (39 billion dollars) in January, up 5 percent
over the same time last year. Imports rose by 3.7 percent to 58.8
billion marks (35.4 billion dollars).

</P>
<P>
"When a professional star takes a dive, millions of lesser
players dive with him.

"All players, stars and amateurs alike, must acknowledge once
and for all that they cannot expect the referee to be sympathetic
to their cause when they repeatedly seek to mislead him by
simulating fouls and other tricks.
</P>
<P>
"For such behaviour has a name, and not a very pleasant one:
cheating. And referees, for all their human fallibility, do not
cheat."

Blatter said that the video technology, if introduced, would
change the face of football "drastically and irrevocably".

<HEADLINE> Family Education Rules for China's Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Parents of China's 270 million
families will soon have a "guidebook" when they play the role of
educators at home.
</P>
<P>
The "guidebook" is a set of family education rules for parents
just issued by the State Education Commission (SEC) and the
All-China Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
The rules map out the most basic requirements of family
education for parents, including the parents' concept of family
education, attitude, and methods when they become teachers at home.
</P>
<P>
Parents are educating children for the country, said the rules,
and they should tell their children how to behave as upright
people. Parents are responsible to help children develop habits of
observing social ethics and increase their awareness of legal and
social responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The rules encourage parents to assign some chores to children
and support them to take part in public labor work. By doing so,
children are expected to be used to labor work and be
self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
Parents should love and care children and educate them
strictly. Parents should not spoil, spank, blame, or discriminate
against children. A fact that parents have to accept is that
children have their own independent personalities which need to be
respected. Children's legal rights and interests should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
An official from the SEC said here today that family education
is closely related to the national education and should be
regulated by laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
"The rules are a valuable attempt in regulating family
education," he said. China is turning to a more quality-emphasized
education from test-oriented one to release children from
intensive competition of examinations.
</P>
<P>
"We must have support from the parents to do so," he said. Once
the parents give up their strong wish of seeing their children
becoming extremely successful in life, children would have a much
more comfortable and democratic family atmosphere. School
education and family education would then be better combined and
become much more efficient, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rules asked parents to raise appropriate request toward
children's schoolwork in a proper way.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the rules were based on several Chinese laws,
including Marriage Law, Compulsory Education Law, Education Law,
Law on Protection of People under Age 18, and the UN Convention on
the Rights of Children.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
last summer showed that most Chinese parents really want to know
what are the best ways to tell their children what they should and
should not do, as over half say that they are not qualified
teachers at home.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 96.2 percent of the parents polled
expressed an interest in learning how to teach their
children. There were even 4.1 percent of them saying they just did
not have the ability to educate their children.
</P>
<P>
The SEC and ACWF expecte wide promotion of the rules and
encourage parents across the country to participate in the
competition of "excellent parenting".

<HEADLINE> Unique Oil Theory Boosts China's Oil Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an important
theory of the continental petroleum geology through 40 years of
research and experiments, which runs parallel to an influential
international theory on hydrocarbon formation of marine geology.
</P>
<P>
The theory has significantly boosted China's oil development,
said Li Tianxiang, chairman of the Science and Technology
Committee of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), in an
interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Using the theory, China has ascertained 27 large oilfields,
each with deposits above 100 million tons, including such
well-known oilfields as Daqing in northeast and Renqiu in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The official said that with exploration and practice, China has
finally developed layer-by-layer oil extraction technology,
stabilizing oil reserves with injected water, and using the
polymer-drive extraction method, which are comparable to advanced
methods used around the world.
</P>
<P>
Other major Chinese oilfields in the Bohai Bay areas, such as
Shengli, Liaohe, Zhongyuan, Huabei (North China), and Dagang have
developed rolling exploration technology, which has increased oil
exploration in the area.
</P>
<P>
So far the bay areas of the Bohai Sea have been found to have
proven oil deposits of 7.28 billion tons and annual crude output
of 61 million tons, making it the second largest oil and gas
production base after Daqing, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In the exploration of complex oil layers, China has come up
with a range of thermodynamic technologies to explore thick oil,
mainly by the use of steam.
</P>
<P>
The country has developed an annual thick oil output of 12
million tons, the fourth largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
A leading official with CNPC pointed out that China has set an
explicit target of proving 2.5 billion to 3 billion tons of oil
reserves by the turn of the century, and having annual oil and gas
output of 150 million tons and 25 billion cu m, respectively, by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, the official noted that China is launching
eight huge petroleum science and technology projects, and 32
technological developments nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Book on Ancient Lacquer in Hubei Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- An illustrated book on ancient
lacquers found in central China's Hubei Province, origin of
ancient Chu culture, has been published.
</P>
<P>
A combination of advanced coating and painting techniques in
the romantic style of the ancient Chu culture, they represent the
highest level of ancient Chinese lacquers.
</P>
<P>
With 300 color pictures, the book introduces some 114 lacquers
of the Chu State in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC), 33 from
the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), and 61 from the Western Han Dynasty
(206 BC-24 AD).
</P>
<P>
The lacquers include such a famous national treasure as a
colorful food container in the shape of a mandarin duck, as well
as some 60 lacquers unearthed recently which have never been open
to the public.
</P>
<P>
Attached to the book is an essay written by Chen Zhenyu,
director of the provincial Institute of Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
A latest achievement in the study of ancient lacquers, the
essay tells how the lacquers were excavated, analyzes the
lacquer-making techniques, and the evolution of shape, structure,
design, decoration, painting and colors.
</P>
<P>
An invention of the Chinese people, lacquers played an important
role in social life during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC),
Qin Dynasty, and the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). Lacquer was
replaced by porcelain after the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
Hubei boosts the largest number of unearthed lacquers because
the local traditional burial system -- sealing the burial rooms
with white clay -- helped to preserve the easily damaged
lacquers.

Mubanga as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that ''yes, it is
true that we have been receiving Zairean soldiers who are fleeing
the war. But they are not more than 100. The situation is not
something to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia expects an increased flow of Zairean soldiers
in the country as the anti-government forces led by Desire Kabila
are close on Zaire's second largest city of Lubumbashi.
</P>
<P>
But Luapula Province Deputy Minister Morman Chibamba warned on
Tuesday Zambians living along the border with Zaire to be extra
vigilant for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
He told the local people to report all suspected illegal
immigrants to the relevant authorities.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
today expressed the belief that so long as the entire Hong Kong
residents make concerted efforts and the principle of "one
country, two systems" is earnestly implemented, Hong Kong will
continue to maintain its prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation from
the Kowloon Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong led by its chairman
Tong Kwok Wah.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the efforts that the Kowloon Chamber of Commerce
has made in boosting Hong Kong's economy and promoting its smooth
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a major
event at the end of this century, which not only needs the
negotiations between the two governments of China and Britain, but
also the support from the six million Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong has experienced a 13-year-long
transitional period and its smooth return to the motherland is a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
After its return, he said the Chinese government will adopt
the principle of "one country, two systems" towards Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said Under the pre-requisite of one country, it is
imperative to safeguard China's reunification and love the
country. "Two systems" mean the practising of two different
systems.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the principle of "one country, two systems" is a
pioneering undertaking, fully considering the interests of the
state, the Chinese nation, and the whole of the Chinese people
including the Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Hong Kong residents that to implement the
principle of "one country, two systems" is precisely to
continuously maintain its existing social, economic systems, and
their way of life, retain its existing independent taxation
system, and continue to circulate the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
It has not only considered the customs of the Hong Kong
residents, but also the benefit to the country's economic growth
and the realization of its peaceful reunification, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Tong said the Kowloon Chamber of Commerce has actively promoted
its investment in the Chinese mainland for many years. It is now
throwing itself into the celebrations for Hong Kong's return and
later will make greater efforts to the region's stable transition,
prosperity, and stability.

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Cases On Rise In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Salmonella-related Food poisoning
cases had risen 47 percent in Australia's Queensland state over
the past three years, State Health Minister Mike Horan said today.
</P>
<P>
Horan said in a statement that it was estimated that more than
200,000 out of 3.2 million people in Queensland experienced a
salmonella-related food poisoning incident last year.
</P>
<P>
He said this was on the basis that for every single case of
salmonella notified to health authorities, there were around 100
cases not notified. Salmonella cases notified to Queensland health
authorities increased from 1367 cases in 1993 to 2,010 cases in
1996, according to him.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of national concern about the safety of food
following three serious salmonella outbreaks in Melbourne last
week, Horan called for increased vigilance by food handlers.
</P>
<P>
So far this year in just three months, 694 cases of
salmonella-related food poisoning have been notified in the state.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in salmonella-related food poisoning cases
highlights the tremendous need for increased vigilance along all
parts of the food chain," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also stressed, it was important that members of the
public understood how to best store and handle food because the
majority of food poisoning cases occur in the home.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Song Jian

</P>

with the paper.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Emgbang said the 500 youth from 15 to 25 years old were

<HEADLINE> China to Deepen Reform in Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China will further reform its
old-age pension system covering employees of city businesses,
making individuals shoulder a bigger part of the financial burden,
a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the old-age pension contributed by the
individuals will be raised gradually in order to reduce the
financial burden of the state and the enterprises, Du Jian,
director of the social security department of the Ministry of
Finance, said at an international seminar on social security funds
management, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
To gradually increase individuals' share of contribution and
free the government and enterprises from social burdens they are
currently shouldering is a major aspect of the reform in China's
pension system in urban and township enterprises, according to Du.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprise employees should contribute a growing amount of
money to a basic pension fund, but no more than 20 percent of
their salaries," he said. "Meanwhile, enterprises' share shall be
reduced accordingly year by year."
</P>
<P>
Du said that China should set a reasonable standard of pension
benefits, adding that the basic pension benefit should be reduced
from 83 percent currently to around 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The basic benefit offered by the public-funded scheme shall be
about 20 percent of the average wages and the benefit from
individual accounts will be paid by installments according to the
accumulated amount in the accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of China's reform in the pension scheme for
enterprise employees include expanding the safety net of basic
pension to all enterprise employees in urban areas, as well as
self-employed workers, and keeping part of the surplus of pension
funds for benefits payment while investing the rest in treasury
bonds, Du revealed.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China will
also promote the reform in unemployment insurance for enterprise
employees, expand the reform in the health insurance system,
improve the programs of social relief, social welfare and special
assistance, and establish and improve a social security fund
management system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ian Rolland, chairman, president, and CEO of Lincoln National
Corporation of the United States, noted that the social security
reform has been made a common, worldwide issue by three universal
trends -- an aging population, declining birth rates, and a longer
life span partly due to significant advances in medical technology.
</P>
<P>
World Bank reports have shown that 500 million people were
above the age of 60 just seven years ago, about nine percent of
the then world population.
</P>
<P>
But by the year 2030, the World Bank estimates, the people of
that age group will reach 1.4 billion, about 18 percent of the
total population. Of the new growth, half will be in Asia and one
quarter in China.
</P>
<P>
As a big country, China's decisions and processes in social
security reforms will have far-reaching effects, not only
domestically but internationally, Rolland said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar was co-sponsored by the Ministry of
Finance and Lincoln National Corporation, and attended by
officials and experts from China, the World Bank, the United
States, Chile, Singapore, Canada, and some countries in East
Europe.

<HEADLINE> No Shortcut to Normalize Pakistan-Indian Relations: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- There is no shortcut to
normalize bilateral relations between Pakistan and India, a
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for an integrated and structured approach
which would lead to the goal of cooperative and good neighborly
relations with India," he told a news conference when briefing
reporters on the Pakistan-Indian Foreign Secretary level talks
held in New Delhi late last month.
</P>
<P>
"For this, it is necessary to remove the root causes of tension
and anguish between the two countries," he said. "The centrality
of the Jammu and Kashmir issue in our relations should not be of
any doubt."
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman added that the very fact the Foreign
Secretary level talks resumed between Pakistan and India was a
"positive development".
</P>
<P>
"The round that has just been completed in New Delhi served to
clarify issues and we have come back to (the negotiating table)
with a better understanding of each other's point of view," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to believe there was any kind of breakdown in the
talks, (and) the dialogue between the two countries will
continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed hope that in the next session of
the Foreign Secretary talks Pakistan and India could "at least
agree on the agenda and mechanism for addressing all the
outstanding issues between the two countries meaningfully."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Foreign Secretary level talks aims to
prepare ground for meaningful talks between the two countries'
foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The New Delhi talks ended with no substantive progress, but
Pakistan and India agreed to continue their talks in Islamabad at
a date yet to be fixed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Stock Market Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading African finance
makers are discussing the African stock market as the ongoing
sixth session of the conference of African ministers of finance
entered a second day here today.
</P>
<P>
A deep impression on the discussions is that developing
African stock market is full of vitality after its birth on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
To date Africa has 16 stock exchanges, most are less than 10
years old. Sub-Saharan markets are more recent, and eight of them
being established in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
These include Botswana (1989), Mauritius (1989), Ghana (1990),
Swaziland (1990), Namibia (1992), Zambia (1995) and Malawi
(1995).
</P>
<P>
However, these stock exchanges have great vitality because
they adapt to economic reforms and market economies of the
African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, new markets are likely to emerge in
such countries as Uganda, Angola, Madagascar and Mozambique. A
regional exchange could also evolve in Cameroun for the central
Africa sub-region. The Abidjan Stock Exchange may assume a sub-
regional status to serve Francophone west Africa states.
</P>
<P>
African markets have made significant progress though they are
still young.
</P>
<P>
According to African ministers of finance, improvements have
been recorded in such indicators as market capitalization and
trading value, which grew by 73.58 and 152.78 respectively in the
five years ending 1995.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of African markets have continued to make
impressive price advances, falling within the top 10 best
performing markets in US Dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Cote d'Ivoire was the best performing global market.
Six of the best ten performing markets led by Kenya were African.
</P>
<P>
Interest in African markets is clearly rising as several
investment funds with focus on Africa have been estalished in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
Among them are the African Investment Fund, Alliance Capital
(an American investment company), Robert Fleming (a British
merchant bank), and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"That interest has been basically driven by reforms, growth in
some countries and the economic prospect of the region," said
Akamiokhor, director-general of the Nigerian Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
Of course, African markets have made positive developments,
but they are relatively small, illiquid, indeed at the
rudimentary stage of development.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, there are a total of 16 stock exchanges in Africa,
less than one-third of the number of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the total number of listings in African markets, at
under 2,000, is barely 10 percent and less than 5 percent of
emerging markets and world listings respectively.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and South Africa control 60 percent of listings. India,
with its 6,000 listed companies is three times of size of Africa.
These figures illustrate the fact that the limited number of
listings and the small size of the companies simply do not
provide enough choice for investors.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the meeting agreed that measures that governments could
take to hasten the maturity of African stock exchange markets
include strengthening the legal and regulatory framework,
establishing a proper institutional framework and training of
markets intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
Creating the environment for investment, both domestic and
foreign, is very crucial for the development of African
economies. This must also include an efficient capital markets in
which investors are protected.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Creates Many Jobs for S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
estimates that the country's increased tourism has created
162,000 jobs directly and indirectly in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The local daily "The Citizen" quoted Tourism Minister Pallo
Jordan as saying that the number of overseas visitors to South
Africa increased by 1.26 million in 1995 compared with 1994, an
increase of 34.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the number was 465,158 visitors, or 10.2 percent more
than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said the higher number of tourists brought in an
estimated increase of 7.5 billion Rands (1.7 billion U.S.
Dollars) in 1995, which was a rise of 107 percent in foreign
exchange compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 increase over 1995 was 1.5 billion Rands (340 million
U.S. Dollars) or 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said it was assumed that one direct and two indirect
job opportunities were created by each 33 additional visitors.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statistics, in 1995, 24,000 direct
and 48,000 indirect job opportunities were created, and in 1996
the figures were 13,000 direct and 26,000 indirect job
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservatives 14 Points Behind Labor, Poll Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) - Britain's ruling Conservatives
narrowed its gap with the opposition Labor Party in the latest
opinion polls to 14 points, the Guardian newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives climbed two points to 32 compared with last
month while Labor fell down two points to 46 points, according to
the Guardian/ICM poll, based on adjusted figures and taken over
the Easter weekend, just one month before voters go to the polling
stations on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that the latest sleaze crisis against the
Conservatives which dominated the past two weeks of electioneering
had not damaged the party as much as it originally feared, and
that strong economic figures were giving the party a boost.
</P>
<P>
But the finding also showed that public opinion wants the
Conservatives implicated in the "cash for questions" scandal to
quit as election candidates.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the pollsters whether Conservative MPs who have been
accused of taking cash for questions should stand as candidates in
the general election, an overwhelming 81 percent said they should
quit, with only 14 percent saying they should stand again.
</P>
<P>
Ten Conservative MPs are under investigation by a parliamentary
committee over allegations that they accepted undeclared cash in
exchange for asking questions in the House of Commons (lower
house).
</P>
<P>
So far, one Conservative MP implicated in the financial scandal
has resigned while two others quit their jobs in reaction to
accusations of involvement in sexual scandals.
</P>
<P>
When asked which of the party leaders would make the best prime
minister, 46 percent of the 1,200 pollsters chose Labor's Tony
Blair with Major on 32 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Pledges to Reinforce Co-operation with Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today
that China will reinforce its co-operation with Canada in various
sectors with an effort to achieve further promotion of bilateral
relations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, Li expressed the hope that the two countries will be
respectful and beneficial to each other, with closer coordination
on international issues.
</P>
<P>
"China and Canada are both Pacific Rim nations of great
influence, and since the forging of diplomatic ties, especially
during recent years, bilateral ties have witnessed substantial
progress in various fields," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has visited China twice,
and Li paid a visit to Canada in 1995. The exchange of visits
between leaders of the two countries have deepened mutual
understanding, and considerably accelerated the overall growth of
bilateral ties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade co-operation between the two countries has
advanced with expanding fields, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the two sides signed the contract on joint
construction of the third phase of the Qinshan heavy water nuclear
reactor, which the premier cited as the mark of a new stage of
bilateral economic and technological co-operation.
</P>
<P>
China and Canada have become important co-operative partners in
economy and technology, and China will strengthen its co-operation
with Canada in various fields, and develop economic and trade ties
based on equality and mutual benefit, he noted.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Students at the University of
Zimbabwe or those at any other tertiary institution have not been
asked to contribute towards their grants and loans but to meet
costs for their feeding and clothing during the year.
</P>
<P>
They would be expected to buy their own food and clothes and
provide money for entertainment while the government takes care
of their tuition, accommodation for those in halls of residence
and caution fees.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Higher Education Ministry Paul Mbambo told
yesterday the daily "The Herald" that no students will fail to
study at the University of Zimbabwe or any other institution as
the government is meeting all essential costs.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will disburse half of grant and loan
facility to institutions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the students at the University of Zimbabwe held
their class boycott in protest against the government's new
fee-paying policy. Under the policy, the government pays 50
percent of the fees while students have to provide the other
half.

<P>
PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The two suicide bombing attempts by two Palestinian
militants at school buses of Jewish settlers, and the death of two
Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers, all of which took place
on Tuesday, showed the incapability of Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu to contain violence in occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Harassed by the requirements of his ultra-Orthodox allies and
threatened with diplomatic isolation by the Arab League, Netanyahu
has proposed to form a government of national union to negotiate
with the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
-- Italy today began to put on trial Algerian national Djamel
Lounici, who is believed to be the main organizer of an Islamic
arms smuggling network in Europe providing logistic support to
Islamic militants in Algeria. Detained by Italian authorities
since May 1995, Lounici, 34, was accused of murdering seven
Italian seamen in July 1994 on their ship at the Algerian port of
Djendjen, near Jijel.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The finance centers of Europe were hit by the fall at the
Wall Street on Tuesday, with the stock index at Frankfurt falling
by 3.88 percent, Amsterdam by 4.4 percent, London by 1.5 percent
and Paris 2.85 percent, the biggest since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise of interest rates in the United States, and the fall
of the Dow Jones Index by 4.3 percent in two sessions, resulted in
a wave of selling of stocks in Europe, as the stocks were judged
over-valued after months of consistent rising.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Moves to End Liberia's Crisis in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), the broker of Liberian peace, made a
major go-ahead on Tuesday towards ending the crisis in the
induction of an independent electoral commission in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Disagreement over the chairmanship has twice delayed the
constitution of the commission, which has caused grave concern
from the international community over if Liberia's election can
be held on May 30 as scheduled with only about two months to go.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Chairman General Sani Abacha, who is also Nigeria's
head of state, has mandated Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Tom
Ikimi to go to Liberia to constitute an independent electoral
commission acceptable to both the Liberian people and the former
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi left here for the war-ravaged country on Tuesday,
accompanied by Major-General Victor Malu, commander of the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Two candidates have been nominated for the chairman of
Liberia's electoral commission, each appointed, respectively, by
the ruling Council of State Chairperson Ruth Perry and former
warlord Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Last week, General Abacha asked the Liberian provisional
authorities to induct the commission on April 2 so as to ensure
general and presidential elections be held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
It is against this background that Ikimi's tour to Liberia is
widely believed to be a mission to help the Liberians to meet the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached by ECOWAS heads of state in
Abuja, Nigeria last year, the electoral commission will comprise
ten members, including three aliens each from the United Nations,
the Organization of African Unity and the ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
A retired Nigerian diplomat has been appointed and left for
Liberia as representative of the ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The other seven members will each come from three former major
warring factions, youth's organization, women's group, trade
union and the coalition of political parties.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on UN to Lift Embargo Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called on the United
Nations to honor its obligations to lift the sanctions on the
country immediately, claiming that the embargo has lost all
legitimate and legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
This came in a message sent by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahaf to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, which was
carried in Iraqi newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the Iraqi foreign minister asserted that the
embargo laid on Iraq is not based on the international law and
are contrary to the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining the embargo has become a revengeful policy
exercised by well-known quarters that seek to destroy a whole
people and deprive them of their right to live," al-Sahaf said
in his message, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi top diplomat reviewed all the grave effects of of
the U.N. embargo on the sanctions-stricken country, coupling
them with testimonies of the U.N. agencies, as well as those of
other international organizations and non-governmental bodies
about the deaths and the sufferings caused by the embargo to
Iraqis, the children in particular.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. specialized agencies announced that 4 million Iraqis,
most of them are children below five, "suffer much both
physically and mentally, from malnutrition and the deterioration
of health services," said the message.
</P>
<P>
"The UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) has officially
announced that 4,500 Iraqi children aged below five die monthly
as a result of malnutrition, an acute shortage of medical and
laboratory instruments, and scarcity of medicines," the minister
added.

PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The continuous rise of the
extreme-right National Front (FN), headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen,
could make 7,000 to 10,000 French Jews to emigrate to Israel, the
Agence France-Presse quoted an Israeli immigration official as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenon frightens French Jews and I estimate that
7,000 to 10,000 among them could emigrate to Israel in the next
two years," said Yaguil Allouche, one of the leaders of the
semi-official institution of the Union of Jews in France and North
Africa (UNIFAN) in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said that French Jews who have just emigrated to Israel was
also due to economic and religious reasons, but these
mobilizations become second important when compared with "the fear
caused by the success of the FN," a party which spread xenophobic,
racist and anti-Semite propaganda.
</P>
<P>
UNIFAN said that 4,298 French Jews emigrated to Israel from
1990 to 1994, while in 1996, 2,103 Jews left France for Israel, a
10 percent rise over 1,855 in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government is pushing for
the early handover of Ferdinand Marcos' assets estimated to be
around 450 million U.S. dollars to the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Jean Pascal Delamuraz, Swiss Public Economic Minister, said
here today that the Swiss government has filed a motion of appeal
with the Federal Court to find an immediate solution to the
problem that has troubled the two countries for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz, who is heading a trade delegation for a three-day
visit to the country, said the Swiss government shared the same
view with Manila that a solution to the later Philippine
President's fund frozen in the Swiss Bank should be found "as
quick as possible".
</P>
<P>
"There are two fundamental realities which the Filipino people
should know, that we took the initiative at that time to freeze
the Marcos assets so that it would not go to just any claimants
and that the Swiss government has no interest in the money," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the judicial proceeding has already been
started in Switzerland and with the motion they filed, the Federal
Court will make a decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz, however, added that the Federal Court is a distinct
and sovereign body and that the government has no means to press
it to make a decision favorable to the Philippine government.

<HEADLINE> China, Canada Reaffirm Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada today reaffirmed
they will reinforce co-operation and promote bilateral relations
on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit, and seeking common
ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen this
morning held talks with visiting Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, who is here on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Qian noted, Sino-Canadian relations
have maintained good development momentum with satisfactory
results achieved in various co-operative fields. Meanwhile, he
noted, frequent exchanges of high-level visits have played an
important role in the promotion of Sino-Canadian ties.
</P>
<P>
Since their economies are highly complementary, the two nations
have made steady and fast progress in their economic and trade
co-operation, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Axworthy said that the Canadian government has
always given priority to its relationship with China, adding that
Canada, satisfied with the progress in bilateral ties, hopes to
increase high-level contact to further promote mutually beneficial
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of Hong Kong, Qian said the Chinese
government will unswervingly stick to the principles of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong," and
a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong and will implement the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, 1997, the Chinese government will grant exemption
of visas to those Canadian passport holders who make short-term
trips to Hong Kong, and specific arrangements will be made by the
HKSAR administration, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said Canada is confident of Hong Kong's future, and
Canada's recent announcement regarding the exemption of visas to
HKSAR passport holders who undertake short-term travel to Canada
is a strong proof of the confidence.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the mutually beneficial arrangements
made by both countries will be helpful for the reinforcement of
mutual trust, exchange of personnel, and expansion of economic and
trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on international
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Canadian Ambassador to China Howard Robert
Balloch, Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation Sun Zhenyu and Assistant Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi
signed, on behalf of their respective governments, two memoranda
on co-operative projects and an agreement on the purchase of real
estate for diplomatic uses. The two foreign ministers attended the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived here Tuesday on his official visit to China as
Qian's guest.

<HEADLINE> Private Capital Flow to Africa Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Private capital flows to
sub-Saharan Africa have increased from 1.3 billion U.S. Dollars
in 1990 to 11.8 billion Dollars in 1995, according to a latest
report by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The private capital flows to the region have surpassed the
total invested in either South Asia or the Middle East and North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the increasing momentum of private
capital flow would remain during the 1990s "as more developing
countries (in the region) improve their macro-economic management
and open their markets to competition from the rest of the
world."
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted, the new flows are highly
concentrated in southern African countries such as Angola and
South Africa as well as Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroun in west
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that many Sub-Saharan African countries
are still missing out completely on any form of private
investment.
</P>
<P>
The total debt of the region rose by about four percent in
1996 to 235 billion Dollars, a slow rate than in 1995 but still a
crippling burden to many poorest developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that tackling the debt burden of the
countries in the region remains one of the major goals set by the
World Bank.

counties in mountainous areas or on the alluvial plain.
</P>
<P>
Last year the lives of more than 600,000 poor people in the 10
counties were improved when they became the first group to benefit
from the implementation of this provincial aid-the-poor project.
</P>
<P>
This year the province will speed the project up by adding 30
million yuan worth of cash and materials to it.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China will hold its first computer
contest this month for university students using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Youth Daily" quotes an official with the
All-China Students Federation as saying that students from at
least 32 universities will take part in the contest.
</P>
<P>
Students will be asked to send software designed by themselves
to the Organizing Committee by mid-June. Debates on hot topics
regarding information revolution will be conducted on the
Internet, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Only 100 students will be selected for the final round in
Beijing later this year, and winners will be given a computer as a
prize.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 100,000 Chinese using
the Internet, but that only a few families in major cities have
bought computers. A computer with the Pentium CPU costs almost
half the annual income of an ordinary family in the 1990s.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Utah's Malone Named NBA Player of the Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone,
who moved into 10th place on the NBA's all-time scorers list last
month, was named on Tuesday the NBA Player of the Month for March.
</P>
<P>
Malone led Utah to a franchise-best 14-1 mark by averaging 31.0
points, 9.0 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game, while shooting .591
from the field.
</P>
<P>
The 12-year veteran, who ranked first in scoring and eighth in
shooting percentage among league leaders in March, surpassed
Jerruy West on March 19 to move into the Top 10 and is 294 points
behind Alex English for ninth place.
</P>
<P>
He also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Moses
Malone and Elvin Hayes on March 9 as the only players in MBA
history to score 25,000 points and grab 10,000 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
"I have always voted Malone for MVP, " said Utah head coach
Jerry Sloan. "In his whole career, he has only missed four
games. As hard as he works in the offseason, he should get some
credit. One thing I like about Karl is that there are no
sideshows, he just comes and plays hard."
</P>
<P>
Malone, who was nambed NBA Player of the Week twice during the
month, led the Jazz in scoring 14 times and scored 35 or more
points six times and 30 or more points 10 times. He had several
standout performances during the month including 41 points, seven
rebounds, six assists and two steals in a 111-104 win at Golden
State on March 3 and 41 points, six rebounds, four assists and one
steal in a 95-88 win over Detroit on March 7.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for NBA player of the Month were Chicago's
Michael Jordan, Denver's Antonio McDyuess, Miami's Tim Hardaway,
New York's Patrick Ewing, Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway, Phoenix's
Keven Johnson and Washington's Chris Webber.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel to Sign Land Transport Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel are planning to
ink a land transportation accord, local newspaper Daily News
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, due to be signed during Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy's official visit to Ankara, is aimed at easing the
transportation of passengers and goods between the two countries,
but no more details on the accord were reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord is expected to be implemented only when the
relations in the Middle East are "normalized," said the paper,
giving the fact that Syria lies between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister will arrive in Ankara next
Tuesday for a two-day visit to Turkey in a bid to develop the
existing friendly ties between the two states.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the accord comes shortly after the Arab League
has called on its members to cease the normalization of their
relations with Israel and renew the economic boycott of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the Turkish-Israeli agreement to be
concluded next week will draw strong response from Arab
countries, particularly Syria.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel in
February 1996 generated fear in Middle East countries that
Turkey was aligning itself with the Jewish state against Syria
and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara has requested the Israeli government to
review its policy on the building of new settlements in East
Jerusalem which led to renewed clashes and violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Fuel prices dropped slightly in
Uganda yesterday, reported the local daily "The New Vision"
today.
</P>
<P>
Of the three major fuels, diesel registered the most
significant price change, dropping by 30 Shillings per liter from
1,070 to 1,040 Shillings (about 1.05 to 1.02 US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Petrol dropped by 10 Shillings to 1,150 Shillings (1.12
Dollars) per liter, while kerosene fell by 20 Shillings from 860
to 840 Shillings (about 0.84 to 0.82 Dollars) per liter.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time in a row this year that fuel pump prices
have experienced a downward trend. This is contrary to the trend
in last quarter of 1996 when the prices rose in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to industrial sources, the latest cuts were a result
on an appreciating Shilling and a drop in world prices plus a
reduction in duties by the Uganda Revenue Authority.

JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Botswana and Mozambique have
made their stance clear that they would not prosecute former
South African soldiers who confess to having conducted the
cross-border raids during the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Botswana and Mozambican diplomats said on Tuesday in Pretoria
that their governments' approach towards the apartheid human
abuses would be to let bygones be bygones, a local daily "The
Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Botswana High Commissioner to South Africa, Oteng Tebape, said
while his government has not reached a final decision on the
matter, he did not foresee its calling for the extradition of
past perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
"This will have to come from individuals. It will not be a
government initiative," said Tebape.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambican Ambassador to Pretoria, Armando
Panguene, said his country has no intention of insisting on the
extradition of former South African soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Angolan military attache Andero Gonsalves also predicted his
government will "not be eager" to prosecute such soldiers, while
Zimbabwean Embassy official, Isaac Moyo, said his country will
address the issue once it arises.

(SADF) chiefs were reportedly concerned that SADF members opting
to apply for amnesty ran the risk of extradition if they

neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Arrest 50 Islamic Jihad Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police have
arrested 50 activists from the militant group Islamic Jihad,
which was believed to be behind at least one of the two suicide
bombings in Gaza Strip Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made overnight in the Gaza Strip after
Tuesday's two bombings near the Netzarim Jewish settlement killed
two Palestinians and wounded five others. Islamic Jihad has
claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials gave different versions of
the two incidents. Israel believed the two explosions to be both
suicide bombings which targeted Israeli school buses carrying the
settlers' children to school. Israeli security also said both
suicide bombers wore the uniforms of the Palestinian Preventive
Forces.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side said the second explosion was caused
by Israeli soldiers who threw a grenade from their military jeep
at a Palestinian taxi, wounding five passengers in the car and
killing one Palestinian policeman riding on a nearby donkey cart.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man called Israel Radio after the bombings to
claim responsibility for the two attacks in the name of the
militant Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, but a Hamas spokesman
in Gaza strongly denied its organization's involvement. He said
the explosions were Israeli plots to create rifts between Hamas
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Later another man called Israel Radio to claim the bombings in
the name of Islamic Jihad, saying the suicide bombers came from
the Jabal Abu Ghneim Unit of the organization. Jabal Abu Ghneim is
the Arab name of Har Homa in southeastern Jerusalem, where Israel
is building a controversial settlement which sparked the latest
round of tension and violence.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the explosions, both sides traded accusations
over the responsibility for the attacks. Israel reiterated its
demand on the PNA to crack down on terrorism, while Palestinian
officials blamed Israel for creating the current tension that led
to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's bombings came in the wake of the March 21 suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe which killed four people and wounded
dozens of others. Israel has since suspended peace talks with the
PNA and conditioned the resumption of the peace process on the
PNA's promise to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert amid
intelligence warnings of more terror attacks since the Tel Aviv
bombing. Security experts believed that the two failed attacks
Tuesday would only increase efforts by Palestinian terrorist
groups to improve their image by staging successful
bombings.

</P>
<P>
Local media often referred to the lynch imposed by WNBF rebels
on their captives.
</P>
<P>
Security officers said they were bothered by the rooms of
jails and lack of enough food for expanding number of WNBF rebels
handed over to them.
</P>
<P>
"On average, we receive 20 WNBF rebels per day," said an
intelligence officer of 409 brigade in the north-western
district.

<HEADLINE> Regional Autonomy System Suited to China's Realities: Buhe (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buhe stressed that the leadership of the Communist Party of
China is vital to the system of regional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Had it not been for the Chinese Communist Party, there would
not have been the emancipation of the Chinese people of all ethnic
groups, nor the equal, united relations of mutual help among the
ethnic groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only by maintaining the unity of the motherland, can the
regional autonomy system be enforced, and the rights of equality
and autonomy be realized, and the rapid economic, social, and
cultural progress be made," Buhe added.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, only by rigorously enforcing this system,
could the equal rights and autonomy rights of ethnic minorities be
guaranteed, the initiatives of ethnic minority people be brought
into full play, and the national unity and common prosperity of
various minorities be better maintained and safeguarded," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what should be done with respect to regional
autonomy work in the future, Buhe said that the system must
continue to improve, to consolidate and develop the harmonious
relations among all the ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Focus should be placed on legislations on ethnic affairs, and
efforts should be made to comprehensively enforce all the autonomy
policies with the help of law, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Law on Regional Autonomy should be revised under the
new situation of building a socialist market economy, and relevant
supplementary legislation should be sped up, the senior lawmaker
said, stressing that "more importantly, supervision over the
compliance of laws on ethnic affairs must be intensified."
</P>
<P>
Buhe said that the Party and the government have paid great
attention to the development of ethnic minority groups, and have
adopted a series of preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
With joint efforts of all the Chinese people of all ethnic
groups to reform and open up, the economic gap between the areas
inhabited by ethnic minorities and prosperous coastal regions
generated by geographic, historical, and other reasons shall be
narrowed, Buhe said.
</P>
<P>
"And the coming century for all the Chinese people of all
ethnic groups will be brighter and better," he pledged.

prefectures, and 121 autonomous counties in the country. Of the
160 million population living in those autonomous areas, 45
percent are of ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Buhe said that under the unified leadership of the state,
regional autonomy has been implemented in all the areas where
ethnic minority people live in a compact community.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic minorities, accounting for 8.98 percent of the
country's total population, have 439, or 14.69 percent of deputies
to the NPC, China's top legislature. Even the minority with the
smallest population has its representative in the lawmaking body,
Buhe said.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, a great number of officials from the ethnic
minority groups have surged, according to the senior official, who
added that there are 2.4 million such people so far working for
the Party, government, legislative and judicial bodies
nationwide.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan railway workers in
Nairobi, Nakuru, Mombasa and Kisumu went on strike on Tuesday to
demand their March salaries, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Nakuru, a town to the north of the capital Nairobi, more
than 1,500 workers of the Kenya Railways Corporation downed their
tools and staged a sit-in at the branch offices over their
delayed salaries.
</P>
<P>
Railway operations came to a standstill yesterday morning when
workers and staff converged outside their district headquarters
in Nakuru, demanding to be addressed by the District Manager,
Herman Kirika.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the workers, Branch Chairman of the Kenya Railways
Workers Union Peter Mumbe said that the retrenchment of more than
30 percent of the staff over the last two years has not made
things any better.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the corporation had been delaying
in paying workers' salaries since April of last year and workers
have not been paid their March dues.
</P>
<P>
In Mombasa, a coastal city in the east of the country, some
500 railway workers gathered at the Mombasa Railway Station in
the morning and rejected an appeal by the management that they
continue working until Wednesday when their salaries are expected
to be paid.
</P>

Workers complained that they had been getting their salaries
late for the past three months.
</P>
<P>

downed their tools and staged a sit-in yesterday morning when the
corporation failed to pay them their March salaries.
</P>
<P>
The workers staged a peaceful sit-in outside the District
Traffic Superintendent's office.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi, employees at the Central Workshop downed their

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here today with Willie Brown Jr., mayor of San Francisco in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of Brown's efforts for promoting friendly
ties and cooperation between China and US.
</P>
<P>
He said that since San Francisco is the international trade and
finance center along the Pacific coast in the US, as well as the
door to trade with the Asia-Pacific countries, it has played an
important role in Sino-US trade.
</P>
<P>
The city is also one of the places in the US where lots of
Chinese live, thus having established long-term and good ties with
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco became twin city of Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, soon after China and the US established
diplomatic ties in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Brown's current visit will push forward San
Francisco's cooperation with Shanghai and other cities of China.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that as a mayor who was elected 15 months ago, he
would continue to further the existing good relations between San
Francisco and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would continue to promote Sino-US
relations, especially the exchanges and cooperations between
business circles of San Francisco and China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brown and his party are here at the invitation of Shanghai
Municipal Government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Told to Earnestly Enforce Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Responding to criticisms from the
top legislature this March, President of the Supreme People's
Court Ren Jianxin has told courts nationwide to take effective
measures for earnest law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Ren issued the call at a recent meeting of the Supreme People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Fifth Session of the Eight National People's
Congress (NPC) concluded last month approved the work report of the
Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
"While affirming the work of courts, deputies to the NPC also
put forth quite a number of criticisms and suggestions, which were
mainly centered on the problems of earnest in law enforcement,
efficiency, and the proficiency of judges," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, earnest law enforcement and up-grading the law
enforcement proficiency level shall be the central task of courts
across the country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the Supreme People's Court will lead a law
enforcement inspection tour starting this month through the end of
June, attended by NPC deputies, to some localities.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, a top advisory body, will also
join the party.
</P>
<P>
Focus will be placed on local and departmental protectionism,
unfair judgement, and abuses of judicial power for personal
gain.
</P>
<P>
He called for relevant departments in the Supreme Court to take
up responsibilities to "clean" the courtrooms, and help to foster a
contingent of jurors and judges "able to stand all tests."
</P>
<P>
He urged all the court staff to study the new Criminal
Procedural Law and the Criminal Law and effectively use them as
weapons in dealing with crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Courts across the country should be further disciplined, and
their work efficiency improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed that hope that court staffs, with their
responsibilities to the Party and the people in mind, earnestly
perform their duties to make new contributions to the country's
reform, opening up and modernization drive by providing effective
legal guarantees.

<HEADLINE> Israel Transplants African Tree To Negev Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists are working
with African colleagues to acclimate the Zachum tree to the
Negev Desert in southern Israel, reported The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
The researchers of Ben-Gurion University believe that the
tree, which is native to Central Africa containing a high
percentage of edible oil, has great economic potential if
the transplantation is successful.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at an international workshop on agricultural
development in arid regions organized by the university, which
is noted for its successes in desert economic research.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ze'ev Weisman said that the Zachum tree is valuable
because it produces chemical compounds that serve as a source
of hormones and steroids. He added that it was in ancient
times used for ritual and nutritional purposes and can be
used in the pharmaceutical industry in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The first plot of Zachum trees was planted this week at
Sde Teiman near Beersheba, a major city on the brink of the
Negev Desert.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are urged to find ways to counter
non-tariff barriers being introduced by some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The issue was the spotlight at an ASEAN cooperation meeting in
Bangkok held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some developed countries, like the United States, Japan and
Australia, are tending to use sanitary standards to block imports
of food from Asia, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has to find ways to ensure its exports of five major
agricultural products - frozen chicken, frozen prawns, tapioca,
canned tuna and pineapple - to retain the market, Petipong
Pungbun, deputy permanent secretary of the Thai Agriculture and
Cooperatives Ministry, was quoted as saying by the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members should join hands to voice their complaints at
the World Trade Organization on the non-tariff barrier issue,
according to Ajva Taulananda, chairman of the working group for
ASEAN agricultural goods promotion.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN brands should be established through improving the
quality of its food products, said Ajva, who is also a member of
the executive board of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He also urged ASEAN to set up an agency responsible for
standardization of agricultural product quality.

<HEADLINE> SEC Strict Administration on College Enrollment in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's top education body has
urged its colleges to detail their tuition costs when issuing
school admission plans in 1997, the first year of China's new
comprehensive system under which students pay for their own
education.
</P>
<P>
Colleges must not overcharge the students who are scheduled to
matriculate this autumn, an official from the State Education
Commission (SEC) said at a recent annual work meeting on college
enrollment in Taiyuan, the capital of central China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
No college has the right to refuse qualified applicants without
good cause; random application refusals have occurred in the past
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Provincial college enrollment departments are entitled to act
on behalf of the violating colleges to accept new students, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Some professional training colleges will start to enroll new
students from polytechnic, vocational and technical schools, whose
mainstream graduates previously are not for higher learning.
</P>
<P>
But the students' majors in colleges should be suitable to
their professional training, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also ruled that only art or sports-oriented schools can
organize independent enrollments in accordance with the SEC
regulations, the official said. The list of these particular
schools will be issued by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, more than 660 colleges among the country's
total 1,035 had adopted the self-pay system.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, all students recruits will pay their college tuition
-- one-fifth of their total expenses during college life.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Control Risky Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will apply
tougher standards to regulate finance and securities firms engaged
in venture-capital investments.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new rules of the central bank are aimed
at keeping finance and securities businesses on safer ground by
discouraging risky lending.
</P>
<P>
A company providing venture capital will have to set aside
provisions for substandard assets if the venture fails to yield
dividends in its first year, according to a Bank of Thailand
official today.
</P>
<P>
If the performance of the venture declines relative to the net
worth of the company, then the finance and securities firm must
set aside more provisions, as providing venture capital is highly
risky, especially when the economy is slow.
</P>
<P>
The need for additional provisions will be a burden for finance
and securities firms and should thus deter them from engaging in
risky ventures, according to Vicharn Amornrojanapong, chief of the
bank examination and analysis department of the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Problem loans on which interest is not being paid are now
classified as substandard assets. The new framework will set
stricter definitions.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the loans of debtors who are able to pay
interest but their businesses lose money for three years will be
classified as substandard assets. The central bank is willing to
apply some leniency, examining details on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Margin lending could be classified as substandard if customers
do not place promissory notes or cash as collateral.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will look into details of long-term
investments in ventures such as utilities or infrastructure firms,
since these typically do dot yield good returns for several years
initially.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Orders More Crackdown on Patent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has ordered state
agencies to step up crackdown on rampant patent violations to
prevent retaliation from the United States and the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also approved requests that agencies responsible
for enforcement report their progress directly to the prime
minister every month, according to a government house press
release issued today.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the International Economic
Policy Committee, chaired by Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan,
reported that patent violations existed in the country and that
suppression had been ineffective.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve Thailand's image, the cabinet required the
Foreign Ministry and the Commerce Ministry to keep Thailand's
major trading partners, such as the US and the EU, informed of
crackdowns that Thailand takes against patent violators.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, US officials hinted that they were not
happy with Thailand's patent violation situation and that Thailand
might be moved from the watchlist back to the priority watchlist
in the US forthcoming annual review because of lack of efficient
measures and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
European Union officials will also visit Thailand to seek
information on violation of musical product patents in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the US government listed 46 countries (including
Thailand) and regions and four trading groups that maintain
"harmful trade barriers" against American firms, including
copyright and patent violations.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will take 30 days to select specific
countries and regions from the list for further negotiations and
possible sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition to Probe Fall of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition, the
Nepali Congress (NC) party, has decided to find out what had
really led to the fall of the government under its party leader
Sher Bahadur Deuba last month.
</P>
<P>
A meeting held here Tuesday, the party's Central Working
Committee formed a three-member panel to investigate the very
reasons behind two NC MPs' absence from a lower house voting on
March 6.
</P>
<P>
The two MPs' absence directly led to the defeat of a confidence
vote for the NC-led coalition government in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government resigned after it failed to prove majority
parliamentary support with only 101 lower house MPs voting in
favor, two votes short for the required majority to pass the
confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The NC party Tuesday directed the newly-formed panel to submit
a report within 15 days in connection with the fall of the Deuba
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports here said that Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the
National Democratic Party (RPP) managed to lure the two NC MPs
away from the house voting in order to bring down the Deuba
government.
</P>
<P>
Chand, a senior RPP leader, later formed a new three-party
government by forging a coalition with the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and a small party.

<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- One passenger was killed and many
have been stranded in a snowstorm in the mountainous area of
central Romania.
</P>
<P>
The blizzard began on Sunday and has paralyzed one of the
country's most important highways. Many cars and buses were
trapped in one-meter-thick snow.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a rainstorm struck northern Romania, damaging
electrical equipment and cutting electricity to 130 villages and
towns.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, part of a cargo ship, the Tismana, sank into
the Danube when the storm turned it upside down.
</P>
<P>
Phone lines in the capital city could not work because
underground cables were affected by accumulated water, and a lot
of big trees were pushed over by strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attributed the storm to an invasion of cold
currents from Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasts said the climate in Romania would not warm up
for two or three days.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Stability in Albania is in the
interests of the Balkan region and Greece, a senior Greek official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Aleksander Filo, secretary general of the Greek Foreign
Ministry, who arrived in Tirana today for a two-day visit, said
his country is preparing to join the U.N.-approved multinational
force which will go to Albania to protect humanitarian relief
operations and help the country restore order. Greece, which
shares its northern border with Albania, is sending a battalion to
participate the multinational army.
</P>
<P>
Filo's visit, the third by Greek officials since Albania was
rocked by unrest last month, is seen as a move to help Albania
overcome its current troubles and to strengthen cooperation
between the two countries based on established mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Today Filo met Albanian President Sali Berisha, Prime
Minister Bashkim Fino and other ministers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Friday authorized the dispatch
of a 2,500-strong European-dominated multinational force led by
Italy to Albania for three months to carry out relief operations.
</P>
<P>
Albania has repeatedly asked for foreign military assistance
since massive protests, sparked by the collapse of pyramid savings
schemes, turned into armed revolt earlier March. More than 150
people have been killed in the violence.

<HEADLINE> Polish MPs Face Fines for Failing to Declare Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- One third Poland's members of
parliament are likely to be fined a month's pay for failing to
declare their personal financial and property interests within the
required deadline, the parliamentary news center told the press
today.
</P>
<P>
Under a law on the duties of parliamentarians approved last
year, lawmakers must register their financial interests including
bank savings, real estate, and shares in companies before
March 31 every year, and at the beginning and end of their
parliamentary life.
</P>
<P>
Personal economic activities and posts held in companies
also need to be declared.
</P>
<P>
The law bans members of parliament from using public property
to carry out business or financial activities, and from holding
top jobs in publicly quoted corporations.
</P>
<P>
Members who break the law or make false declarations will be
penalized and may face a prison sentence of up to five years, the
regulation says. Those who fail to declare in time will lose their
wages and subsidies for a month, which works out at 2,600 zloties
(about 867 U.S. dollars).

KUNMING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has established relations with over 60 countries and regions and a
dozen international organizations for science research projects.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover a whole range of areas such as industry,
agriculture, forestry, biology, energy resources, environment,
geology, astronomy, and electronics.
</P>
<P>
The number of personnel involved in the projects is growing at
an annual rate of 20 percent. By the end of last year, six million
yuan had been spent on international programs. Most programs are
going well, according to Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
China's first high-energy gamma point source cosmic ray
observatory, a joint project with Hong Kong and the United States
in the provincial capital of Kunming, has prospects of becoming an
international observatory.
</P>
<P>
The study of the evolution of igneous rocks and tectonic magma
in Yunnan, which has complicated geological and geographic
conditions, has led to some interesting discoveries, as has
research in limnology in the limestone area of central Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Thorough Probe Needed on Refugee Boat Disaster: Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Alberto Dini
and Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta today reiterated the need
for a thorough and transparent public inquiry into Friday's
sinking of an Albanian boat in the Adriatic in which more than 80
refugees were missing.
</P>
<P>
They told a joint session of the Senate foreign and defense
committees they hoped the inquiry would refute allegations that
the boat was rammed by an Italian naval vessel.
</P>
<P>
"There is unanimity in the government to make sure
that the verification of the facts is pursued with rigorous
criteria and with total transparency," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta told parliament that he had invited Albanian navy
experts to join investigations into the disaster and promised a
full and open inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Previous media reports and some Albanian survivors claimed the
refugee boat was deliberately rammed by Sibilla, an Italian navy
vessel.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister denied the allegations, saying that it was
still too early to speak about the cause of the sinking before it
was fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta supplied a detailed reconstruction of the incident,
repeating the Italian navy's contention that the Sibilla
approached the Albanian boat slowly from behind after its repeated
attempts to contact the boat were ignored.
</P>
<P>
He said the Albanian boat then veered unexpectedly to one side
and hit the Sibilla before it began sinking.
</P>
<P>
But Andreatta denied the incident would affect Italy's aid
plans for Albania.
</P>
<P>
Air and sea reconnaissance operations continued today in
the area where the boat sank while patrols continued along
Albania's coast.
</P>
<P>
Albanian refugees have been pouring into Italy over the last
two weeks, fleeing from the unrest and violence that has gripped
the country since January when protests erupted over the collapse
of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands lost their life
savings.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council agreed on Friday to send a
Italian-led multinational protection force of about 5,000 troops
to Albania to protect emergency aid operations there.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Sails into Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Swiss teenage sensation Martina
Hingis sailed into the third round of the 926,250 U.S. dollars
Family Circle Cup in Hilton Head, South Carolina, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Swiss breezed past Barbara Rittner of Germany
6-0, 6-4 to join fourth-seeded American Monica Seles in the third
round, who lost to Hingis in the Lipton Championships finals last
week.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who replaced Germany's Steffi Graf at the top of the
WTA Tour rankings on Monday, extended her unbeaten streak in WTA
Tour matches to 27 as she seeks her sixth title of the year.
</P>
<P>
The former world nubmer one Seles, now ranked fifth, posted a
6-3, 6-3 win in 57 minutes over Wang.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded two-time champion Conchita Martinez of Spain had a
much tougher time than Seles before pulling out a 6-7, 6-4, 6-3
second-round victory over qualifier Olga Barabanschikova of
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
In a first-round encounter, Jennifer Capriati upset 11th-seeded
fellow American Mary Joe Fernandez 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 in a match that
featured 18 service breaks.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Capriati, who won the third-set tie-break 7-3,
had reached the final here in 1990 as a 14-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Martina Hingis, who became the world's top-ranked
player on Monday, was set to play the tournament's first-ever
night match against Germany's Barbara Rittner later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Continue Navy Patrol Despite Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The sinking of an Albanian refugee
boat last Friday would neither stop the Italian navy patrol in the
Adriatic Sea, nor alter its plans to lead a multinational
protection force to the troubled Balkan country, the Italian
military sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said he has asked his
Albanian counterpart Shaqir Vukaj to name a panel of experts to
investigate the accident with the Italian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the two defense ministers are expected to sign
final agreements reached last week between the two countries'
navies on patrolling the Otranto Channel and some technical
matters related to the patrol.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta dismissed the criticism that Italian navy ship
deliberately rammed the Albanian boat.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely shameful even to think that the Italian
vessel had the deliberate intention of ramming the Albanian boat,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Crowded with about 120 refugees, mostly women and children, the
Albanian vessel sank on Friday night after colliding with an
Italian navy ship, leaving four people dead and 83 others
missing. Only 34 people were rescued.
</P>
<P>
The accident put in doubts the Italian naval interdiction
patrols which began late last month after some 13,000 Albanians
flooded to Italian shore in an uncontrolled exodus from their
chaotic homeland.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta and Vukaj will also discuss the international
protection force (IPF) to be sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the 5,000-strong IPF will be Italians, while
France, Spain, Greece, Austria, Turkey, Romania, Hungary and
Slovenia have also promised to contribute.
</P>
<P>
The IPF has been given green light by the United Nations
Security Council and has the blessing from the European Union and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Italian General Luciano Forlani, currently commander of the
third armored corps base in Milan, will be the commander of the
IPF.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials from the contributing nations are scheduled
to have a meeting in Rome Wednesday, which will also be attended
by Vukaj.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy's policy of military intervention has aroused
criticisms from within the government majority alliance.
</P>
<P>
Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Communist Refoundation Party
which gave Prime Minister Romano Prodi's government its majority
in the Lower House, said the mission "would only aggravate the
Albanian situation" and would expose Italian soldiers to danger.
</P>
<P>
Green party's Luigi Manconi contested the navy patrols, saying
he would fight "until the government changes its mistaken and
irresponsible position which has caused and will continue to cause
suffering."

zone in the city's suburbs reported a total income of 7.58 billion
yuan in 1996, up 66 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major science research and education bases in
China, Xi'an has hundreds of research developments and patents
annually and has become a center of overseas investment in
northwest China, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Since the industrial zone was approved as a national level
industrial development area in March 1991, local authorities have
spent more than four billion yuan on infrastructure, and have
improved the investment environment to meet market economy demands.
</P>
<P>
Investors from more than 20 countries and regions, including
the Untied States, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, the Republic
of Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, have settled in the hi-tech
industry zone. And thanks to the infusion of funds and technology,
hi-tech industries have become a backbone of the zone, in
electronic information technology, bio-pharmaceutical engineering,
energy saving techniques, and new materials.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh left here for China this morning on an official visit
at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
The four-day China trip, up till Saturday, is the Thai prime

six other ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's 120-strong entourage includes Foreign Minister

<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's consumer price index
(CPI) for the first quarter of this year was 4.4 percent higher
than a year before.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest figures released today by the Business

inflation was between 7.3 percent to 7.4 percent.
</P>

by 5.6 per cent and 3.4 percent respectively, according to the
department's statistics.
</P>
<P>
Prices of rice, pork, chicken, seafood, milk, books, oil,

<HEADLINE> Manila, Washington Spat Over Pork Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is seeking
compensation from the Philippines for the country's refusal to
open its market to American pork and poultry products, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary
Cesar Bautista as saying that negotiations could prevent a
full-blown trade dispute between the two countries, which have
just recently resolved a tiff on Philippine garments exports to
the US.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said his department is open for negotiations with the
U.S. Trade Representative on a "compensation package" but the
form, either in cash or in another product, will be decided by the
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said recently that
there is no trade barrier but that Filipinos do not like the taste
of frozen pork.
</P>
<P>
However, the US alleged that the Philippine government's
allocation system for pork imports has unduly favored local pork
producers since they are the ones given the allocations to import
and are therefore likely to protect their market by not importing.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines should start opening its pork and poultry
market to American imports in 1995 but it only began to do so in
1996 with small trade volumes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement last month to expand
Manila's garments exports quota after it filed a suit before the
World Trade Organization, protesting Washington's new
country-of-origin rules on textile and apparel imports.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. provision which took effect last July stipulated
that home furnishings and made-up textile goods would not be
considered Philippine made unless the raw materials were locally
sourced.

<HEADLINE> NAM Still Relevant in Post Cold War Era: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was
still needed by the international community in the post cold war
era, said Nana S. Sutresna, head of the NAM Executive Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian ambassador-at-large said Tuesday in Padang, West
Sumatra province, that Indonesia will continue to support NAM,
despite criticism that the organization is out-of-date and
ineffective in dealing with international problems, especially the
Arab-Israeli dispute, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there is little NAM can do to help resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict, but said that all NAM members support
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign loans and economic problems faced by developing
countries indicated that NAM programs which prioritize economic
development in developing countries ... are still needed in order
to cope with the world's poverty problems," he added.
</P>
<P>
The acceptance of NAM as an international organization can not
be seen apart from Indonesia's role in making various adjustments
to the progress of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
During its chairmanship from 1992 to 1995, Indonesia had
consistently striven to solve the foreign debt problems that
burdened NAM members, Sutresna noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
expressed the hope that poverty will be eliminated by the end of
the seventh five-year development plan in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"Fighting poverty is the most important means of overcoming the
social gap," said the president in a written statement read out by
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in Dili, East Timor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the total number of those living in
poverty was on the decline, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, data showed those living below the poverty line
reached 25.9 million or 13.7 percent of the total 200 million
Indonesian population. By 1996, this figure had fallen to 22.5
million or 11.3 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
"We are still trying to reduce the incidence of poverty through
the use of presidential decrees for the under-developed village
program (IDT)," said Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian economy grew by 7.82 percent in 1996. "This
growth, although below that of the previous year (8.2 percent), is
still high enough when compared to the projected annual growth of
7.1 percent," the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
With the 7.82 percent growth rate, the income per capita
managed to increase from 1,039 US dollars in 1995 to 1,140 dollars
in 1996, Soeharto added.

<HEADLINE> Woolly Best to Get Quality Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua)-- China has launched a nation-wide
quality competition for woolen sweater products to promote the
country's wool industry, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
All woollen sweaters with pure new wool marks are eligible for
the competition, and by October experts will choose 10 to 15
enterprises whose products meet international standards in raw
materials, processing technology and final product quality.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to cultivate China's famous brands in wollen
sweaters and enhance China's market share in the world market,
said John K.H. Sheung, operations manager of International Wool
Secretariat (IWS) China Branch.
</P>
<P>
The wool mark, one of the world's most recognized apparel
marks, is owned by IWS and applied to those products reaching IWS
standards.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has had more than 400 enterprises licenced to use
the pure new wool mark, 200 of which are woolen sweater
enterprises, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that China has more than 3,500 wool knitting
enterprises each with annual sales exceeding one million yuan
(120,480 US dollars). However most of the enterprises are small,
and as a result, there is no wollen sweater brand which covers a
considerable domestic market share.
</P>
<P>
The competition, co-organized by IWS and the China Wool Textile
Association, is expected to established industrial leaders for the
woolen sweater industry, said Zhang Bingcheng, head of the
association.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong investors are being
encouraged to put more funds into the burgeoning consumer market
of Guangdong Province, according to a senior provincial trade
official says.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that cooperation between Guangdong and Hongkong
will be further strengthened after the return of Hongkong to the
embrace of the motherland on July 1," said Ji Liqing, director of
the Guangdong Provincial Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We especially encourage Hongkong investors to finance more
retail, wholesale, distribution and warehouse projects," Ji noted.
</P>
<P>
Investors, many from Hongkong, have built over 300
supermarkets, department stores, convenience shops, and warehouses
in Guangdong. Hongkong has set up numerous joint ventures and
solely-owned enterprises in Guangdong which sell about 30 percent
of their products locally.
</P>
<P>
"The funds, technology and advanced management brought in by
overseas investors are badly needed by Guangdong," the director
explains.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong is one of the most attractive markets in China. Last
year, retail sales of consumer goods totalled 270 billion yuan,
accounting for over one tenth of the country's total," he

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities are keeping a
sharper eye on the production and sale of agricultural machinery
as the summer harvest approaches and agricultural equipment
suppliers say they will provide better service for farmers.
</P>
<P>
China's 15 largest harvester makers on Monday jointly issued a
warranty of quality, saying they guarantee quality products and
after-sale service.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yuan'en, director of the Ministry of Machine-Building
Industry's (MMI) Agricultural Equipment Department, noted that
total output of the 15 manufacturers accounts for 95 percent of
the country's harvester output. "Their actions will have a
profound impact on the combine market, markedly improving the
reliability of the products in the marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The combine market has seen a sharp increase since
1994. Statistics from MMI indicate that last year 24,000
harvesters of different sizes were produced, an increase of 150
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
China's farm machinery industry last year had an industrial
output value of 85 billion yuan and sales of 81.2 billion yuan,
ranked just behind automobile and electric machines in China's

HARBIN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province will spend 61.2 billion yuan on state-owned enterprises
by the year 2000 to reshape the industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
The governor, Tian Fengshan, says that it is a strategic move

"Most of the money will be spent on technology, know-how, and
equipment to help adjust the industrial structure of the local
economy," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial plan, priority will be given to
automobile, electronics, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and food
processing industries, which are expected to become pillar
sectors of the local economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province will try to make high-tech industrial output value
contribute four percent of the province's total, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province will take steps to make it a

<P>
To help realize the plan, the province will open further to

BEIHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Beihai, a port city in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will provide marine
tourism services for the Vietnamese cities of Haiphong, Mong Cai
and Ha Long this May.
</P>
<P>
The ship services will be available every Tuesday and Friday,
local sources say. Beihai is now authorized to issue exit and
entry permits for tourism at the Sino-Vietnamese border.
</P>
<P>
As a leading tourist city on the Beibu Gulf, Beihai receives
1.5 million tourists a year. Tourism development was hindered
somewhat in the past because the city was not authorized to issue
the permits for tourists who wanted to visit Vietnam directly and
had to go via Dongxing City.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Obliterates Moscow's Monument to Last Tsar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A bomb destroyed Moscow's only
monument to Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin denounced the bombing
as a senseless act.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that people can have different comments on
Nicholas II himself, but the brutal behavior (the bomber's) can
never wipe out a country's history. He believed that the police
would make every effort to search for the bomber.
</P>
<P>
The 10-meter bronze statue, completed last May by a Russian
artist, was blown to pieces at about 6.30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Police were still gathering the pieces in late afternoon,
though at first they treated the alert as an April Fool's joke.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas was overthrown 80 years ago when the Bolsheviks took
power.
</P>
<P>
But with the collapse of the former Soviet Union, public
attention began to transfer to the monarchy. Even the resurgent
Orthodox Church is considering making Nicholas a saint.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: British Election Campaign in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Just one month away from the
general election, the candidates of the two major parties in
Britain are gearing up their efforts to become the host of No. 10
Downing Street in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major, whose Conservative Party was behind
the opposition Labor Party by 20 percentage points in opinion
polls, set off for north London this morning, trying to shake off
the sex and financial scandals that had dominated the first
two-week campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Three Conservative officials resigned last week over
allegations of personal impropriety or involvement in a
cash-for-question row in parliament. Two more Conservative MPs,
allegedly involved in sexual and financial scandals, are under
strong pressure from other party members to quit.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is booming, and what we have to do is to make sure
nobody changes it," Major told a crowd of people in a Croydon DIY
store.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Party leader Tony Blair also set off today on
a pre-election tour to woo the crucial middle-class floating
voters. Apparently, both parties, eager to move back to daily
issues such as education and economy from the sleazy scandals,
regarded today as the formal start of their campaigns for the
election. The past two weeks of electioneering was dominated by
dirty scuffles of the two parties and kept in low key.
</P>
<P>
"I feel the responsibility... But there is also a sense of
excitement, of what we can achieve, of what we can do. The whole
of my political life has been a preparation, if you like, for this
period of time," 43-year-old Blair told reporters on his way to
Northampton in central England, the first stop of the nation-wide
meet-the-people tour.
</P>
<P>
"Judge our policies on what they are, not on what the Tories
(Conservatives) say they are. Our policies are mainstream, costed,
sensible, better for Britain," Blair told a news conference before
boarding his "battle bus" that will take him to 60 towns and
cities.
</P>
<P>
Labor has gained great advantages out of the sleazy issue,
claiming it underlined the need for a change in British politics
and the fact Conservatives had been warped by holding power for so
long. The Conservatives has ruled Britain over the past 18 years
since Margaret Thatcher beat the Labor in 1979 election.
</P>
<P>
Major's poorly-started campaign got a boost today from
Thatcher, who launched a vigorous attack on Blair and the
"boneless wonder" of the new Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of Mr Blair's strategy in creating the boneless
wonder that calls itself New Labor is to reassure the electorate
in its illusion. But illusion it remains," Thatcher said in an
article which was published in today's Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Countering the attack, Blair, who is bidding to become UK's
youngest prime minister of this century, urged the voters to put
their trust in his party. "Be strong, be of good courage, put your
trust in us and we will repay that trust 1,000 times over in the
years ahead."
</P>
<P>
In another attempt to win over the voters who seems more
favorite for the Labor, Major said today he remained ready to hold
a television election debate with Blair.
</P>
<P>
The televised debate, which would be the first in British
electoral history if held later this month, now seems running to a
dead end after the two parties disputed over the format of the
debate. Both charge the other side for responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"We the Conservative Party have accepted the terms of the
broadcasters' proposals as they stand even though they are not
perfect from out point of view," he told a campaign news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe Major has nothing to lose from the
debate while Blair has little to win.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. increased sharply by 2.3 percent in February, the biggest
gain in 11 months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that spending on residential,
non-residential and government construction totaled 603.8 billion
dollars in the month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The gain of the U.S. construction spending in February was led
by an increase of 4.1 percent in public spending, the strongest
since last September. Residential spending advanced by 1.2 percent
with single-family construction gaining 1.5 percent. The spending
on non-residential construction increased by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the spending in January was down by 0.3
percent other than 0.4 percent announced one month ago.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a string of stronger-than-expected
government economic reports.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic reports have led analysts to believe that
the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will further raise the short-term
interest rate this year to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the tightening of U.S. monetary policy,
along with increases in long-term rates set in markets, should
eventually put a damper on the highly rate-sensitive construction
sector.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Exchange Accusations Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials exchanged accusations over responsibility for the two
suicide bombings in the Gaza Strip today.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinian suicide bombers prematurely blew themselves up
early this morning in two separate spots near a Jewish
settlement, but both missed their targets and caused no Israeli
casualty. In the second explosion, a Palestinian taxis was
damaged and five Palestinian passengers inside the car were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
A man who claimed to belong to the militant Islamic Resistance
Movement Hamas later made an anonymous call to Israel Radio's
Arabic Service to claim responsibility, but a Hamas spokesman in
Gaza denied the organization's involvement and held Israeli
agents responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government immediately blamed the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) for failing to prevent the attacks, which
it alleged were targeting the buses carrying Israeli children to
their school.
</P>
<P>
"This is a return to the most heinous kind of crimes which
inflicted the peace process from its beginning. Unless the
Palestinian National Authority does something about this, or
unless they clamp down on terrorism, the peace process is in real
danger," said Bar Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the explosions, Netanyahu convened a urgent
meeting of the security establishment to discuss the
situation. Netanyahu said the latest attacks showed that the PNA
was not doing enough to crack down on terrorism, a condition set
by the Israeli prime minister on reviving the deadlocked peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak disclosed that one of
the suicide bombers wore the uniform of Palestinian security
forces. He said that the incidents underscored the importance
of the security cooperation between the two sides in fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials rejected Israel's accusation of the PNA's
failure to prevent the attacks. PNA Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahman
blamed Israeli soldiers for throwing explosives at the Palestinian
taxis in the second alleged suicide bombing. PNA President Yasser
Arafat also accused Israel of being responsible for the second
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat held the Israeli
government responsible for creating the current tension which
pushed the peace process into a "major crisis." He said the
Netanyahu government was escalating the situation with continued
unilateral decisions and settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
The current tension was triggered by Israel's decision to
build a settlement in East Jerusalem on March 18. Stone-throwing
Palestinian protesters have been clashing with Israeli soldiers
across the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Two more Palestinians, including a Palestinian policeman taking
part in demonstrations, were killed by Israeli soldiers on the
West Bank today, bringing to three the Palestinian death toll
in the latest round of violence.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombings came in the wake of the Hamas suicide bombing
in central Tel Aviv on March 21, which killed three Israeli women
and the bomber and wounded dozens of others. Israel has since
suspended peace talks with the PNA in order to pressure the
latter to launch a long-term crackdown on terrorism.

<HEADLINE> 8 Killed in Car Accident in Upper Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Eight persons were killed and nine
others injured when a truck rammed into the rear of the minibus
they were travelling in southern Egypt, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials were quoted as saying the accident happened Monday
night when a truck hit the taxi cab which was heading for Cairo,
the capital of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The victims were reportedly supporters of the ruling National
Democratic Party returning from a pro-government gathering in
Aswan province, about 800 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest in a string of serious traffic accidents in
recent years. In January, an ill-fated bus fell from a bridge in
northern Cairo into the muddy shore of the Nile, killing 39
passengers and injuring at least 29.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- One South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militiaman was killed and five others wounded today in an attack
by guerrillas of the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God,
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
announced that its fighters launched attack on an SLA patrol at
10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) in the western sector of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas used machineguns and rockets in the attack on
a road between the towns of Harfa and Al-Joubbein, destroying a
vehicle, killing and wounding all the SLA militiamen inside, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli-backed militia confirmed the clash between
guerrillas and the Israeli troops and the SLA militia in the
western part of the border strip at noon, in which one SLA
militiaman was killed and five others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone in
1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
guerrilla attacks. Israeli also trained and armed the SLA militia
to patrol the border strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops in the positions of Ali Taher and Babsheh fired
artilleries at vicinities of Nabatieyh Fauqa and Kfar Tibnit at
3:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT), damaging four civilian houses in the
village of Kfar Tibnit and causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that the Israeli
position of Ali Taher was attacked this afternoon by guerrillas,
and no faction has claimed responsibility for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon, and
make the area the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, which has killed six Israeli soldiers and wounded 30 others
since this year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Raises Civil Electricity Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) --In accordance with a government
resolution Russian regional energy commissions today started to
raise electricity tariffs for residents and reduce it for
industrial consumers, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted first deputy head of the federal energy
commission Nikolai Boiko as saying that the electricity tariffs for
Russian residents will be no less than the average cost of
production, transmission and distribution of electricity in a
region.
</P>
<P>
The regional commissions are instructed to gradually reduce and
then eliminate cross-subsidies, Boiko said.
</P>
<P>
This step will cut the tariffs for electric locomotives and
industry by 30 percent, while the industry will save about five
trillion roubles a year.
</P>
<P>
According to Boiko, the current cost price of electricity is
200 roubles per kilowatt/hour in Russia, while the tariff is
205.8 roubles.
</P>
<P>
The tariff for residents is 63 roubles per kilowatt/hour of
electricity. It is planed to raise the tariff for residents to 225
roubles and, in some areas, to 250-270 roubles.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the amount of the tariff in regions depends on
electricity source, communications and other factors.
</P>
<P>
The Russian federal energy commission said that the increase of
the electricity tariffs for residents will be taken into account
of people who receive low incomes and will reach their maximum
only after the reform of housing and communal services.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Condemns Israeli Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The legislative Palestinian
Council (PC) President, Ahmad Queria (Abu Ala), today condemned
the Israeli government for its closure policy that impeded the
normal work of the Palestinian legislature.
</P>
<P>
Queria has failed to convene a session of the 88-member
council in the West Bank city of Ramallah because there was no
quorum since those Gaza council members were barred from
traveling to Ramallah due to the border closure, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Queria said that the Israeli measures are aimed at blowing up
the peace process. He vowed to make every effort to revive the
PC work so as to foil the plans of the Israeli government to
obstruct the process of establishing an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Some PC members from the West Bank held informal discussions
on the current political situation. Haidar Abdul Shafi called
for suspending the work of the council until all members show up
in Ramallah. Most other members expressed their opposition to
his idea, stressing that the council should continue its normal
functions and deal with ongoing events as they happen.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, PC member and member of Palestinian negotiating
team, sternly criticized Palestinian National Authority
Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo for his meeting with a
senior Israeli official in Jerusalem Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Asfour described the meeting as irresponsible, adding that it
breached the Palestinian decision not to hold any meetings or
contacts with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for everyone to abide by the Palestinian and Arab
decisions regarding freezing normalization," he said.

Dayton Agreement, but this is not enough.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks at his meeting with visiting High

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Participants of the Sixth
Session of the Conference of African Ministers of Finance
discussed here today the issue of challenges of the African debt
problem.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, leading African finance policy makers,
including ministers of finance and central bank governors,
reviewed the issue of the African debt problem. Their discussions
were centered on the debt initiative for heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCS), launched by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The initiative targets 41 of the world's most highly indebted
countries, 33 of which are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The debt situation in Africa seriously impedes the continent's
development, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of fianance were particularly vocal on the
question of debt-to-export ratios, arguing that their commodity
exports were dominated by multinationals to whom accrued a large
proportion of export earnings. The World Bank and the IMF should
therefore desist from considering the market value of exports in
their calculations, they said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's debt is now estimated at more than 340 billion dollars,
while the debt servicing payments amount to 24 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's meeting were Executive Secretary of the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) K. Y. Amoako,
Uganda's Finance and Economic Planning Minsiter J.
Mayanja-Nkangi, World Bank Vice-President Jean-Louis Sarbib,
African Development Bank Vice-President Ferhat Lounes, and IMF
Deputy Director A. Basu.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Israeli Charge of Formenting Arab Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today rejected Israel's harsh
accusation that it has instigated other Arab countries to take a
tough line against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Israel's decision to
begin construction of a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem is
to blame for the current peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli measures were behind the Arab League's resolution
calling for a freeze in relations with Israel and reactivation of
the Arab economic boycott of Israel," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He brushed away Israel's criticisms of Egypt for urging Arab
parties to halt normalization steps with Israel and bring back the
economic boycott as a mere publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
"These are attempts to evade the responsibility and will never
influence Egypt's stance," he emphasized, adding that Egypt will
not comment on "such diatribes."
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to immediately reverse the decision this month
to go ahead with a 6,500-unit Jewish settlement at Jabal Abu
Ghneim or Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We have to save Jerusalem from all measures that would change
its position and preempt serious negotiations on its status," he
said. "The resolution on Jerusalem approved by the Arab League
Council meeting Monday has carved out such a clear Arab stance,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have decided to stop normal relations, revive
economic boycott, close down Israeli missions and withdraw from
Mideast multilateral talks, in the strongest concerted step they
have taken since the hardline Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu took office last year.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused Israel of sabotaging the peace
process by building a Jewish housing project on disputed land in
East Jerusalem where they want to establish a capital.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Netanyahu's description of the resolution as
"political or diplomatic violence" indicated that his assessment
of the regional situation is "wanting and incomplete."
</P>
<P>
"Salvaging true peace, rather than a lame peace which is meant
to serve interests of one country, has always been our objective,"
said the top Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of mounting tension between the two countries,
Netanyahu heaped harsh criticism on Egypt today, accusing it of
double-dealing and inciting the Arab world to gang up on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"To my regret, Egypt is playing a leading role in the
incitement of the Arab world, in the political struggle the Arabs
are waging against us and not just from today," he told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in an interview with
an Israeli newspaper, called the Har Homa housing plan as "the
most dangerous thing conceivable" that has sparked a new round of
violence, including West Bank stone throwing riots and suicide
bombings by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the project continues, no one will be able to
contain the festering situation any more. "Why do you add oil to
the fire?"

<P>
LUANDA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the country's ruling party, urged
here today for earliest solutions to military problems in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Issues such as enroling fighters of the former rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) into a
unified army and a national police force should be solved as
soon as possible, MPLA said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued after a senior MPLA meeting, called on
the UNITA lawmakers and politicians to assume office on schedule
set by the Joint Committee Overseeing Angola's Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
MPLA urged the National Assembly to approve the bill on the
special political status of UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
It called for the efforts to set up national administrative
structure around Angola in time, saying the move would strengthen
people's belief in peace and create conditions for the free
movement of people and goods in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government should be active in creating conditions
for UNITA and other opposition parties to operate countrywide
without limitation, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Only with such conditions, next talks between Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos and Savimbi might be successful, the
communique added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Business Failure Rate in UK Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of business collapsing
in Britain dropped by nearly 10 percent in the first three months
of this year, according to Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, the business
information group, today.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mellor, senior analyst at the group, said: "We had
feared that an increase in company liquidations might bring a host
of smaller firm bankruptcies in its wake.
</P>
<P>
"This has not happened yet. But, with the business climate
being so competitive, it remains to be seen if the decline in
business failures continues throughout the year."
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the number of business
failures including companies, partnerships and sole traders was
10,329, 1,101 fewer than in the first three months last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was caused mainly by a 13.7 percent reduction in the
number of larger companies going into liquidation, Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet said.
</P>
<P>
However, the drop in business failures is spread unevenly, with
every region having a decline except the West Midlands (27.4
percent) and Scotland (25.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
The number of business failures in London was barely changed:
1,714 failed in the first quarter of 1997 against 1,789 in the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet also said, the number of liquidated companies
fell from 5,237 in the first quarter of last year to 4,517 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The number of bankruptcies among smaller businesses fell 6.1
percent in the same period, it added.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth to Slow Down in Kenya: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said today that Kenya might register a decline in economic growth
and a possible increase in the rate of inflation this year.
</P>
<P>
Opening the sixth session of the seventh parliament here this
afternoon, Moi noted that his government was compelled to divert
resources from other projects to cope with the just-ended
drought.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the management of natural disasters put a
considerable strain on the available resources although it was
necessary to facilitate speedy mobilization of resources to the
affected people.
</P>
<P>
However, Moi told members of parliament that famine relief was
a temporary measure and there was need to develop the
anti-natural disaster capacity of people in drought-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
He urged the members to focus more on the real issues facing the
country aimed at improving the well-being of the Kenyan people
and to set aside narrow sectarian interests.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that the current famine facing the Kenyan people due
to the prolonged drought in most parts of the country is an issue
which transcended narrow sectarian interests.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had experienced a prolonged drought since the second
half of last year and the government early this year declared it
a nationwide disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has decided to allocate about 110
million U.S. Dollars to import relief food to feed some 2.5
million people affected by the drought.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
avoiding to cite the real cause of recent violent clashes in the
Middle East, called on Tuesday to restore the environment of
security and of confidence between the Israelis and Palestinians
so that the peace process could be pushed forward.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his meeting with King Hussein of Jordan at the
White House, Clinton said "this is a difficult time for the peace
process" and he had a lot to talk about with the king, who arrived
in Washington on Tuesday via New York.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians on the West
Bank have continued for 13 consecutive days, in which
Palestinians, outraged by Israelis bulldozers moving into Arab
east Jerusalem to break ground for Jewish housing constructions,
went on to street for demonstrations against the move that was
obviously in violation of the Oslo agreement, and were confronted
with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Dodging about a question whether Israel's attempt to establish
the Jewish settlement was the "real cause of violence," Clinton
said what the Israelis and Palestinians have to do "is to restore
the environment of security and of confidence so we can go forward
with the negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that, unambiguously, a precondition of going
forward is a commitment to zero tolerance for terrorism, for
making the best effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he held extensive meetings with U.S. peace broker
Dennis Ross on Monday and again on Tuesday to discuss the volatile
situations in the Middle East. Ross was dispatched to the region
last week to hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to salvage
the tottering peace process because of defying of
Israeli-Palestinian agreements. But he returned to Washington
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters he had some ideas on dissolving the
recent crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We've got some ideas about it, but I want to talk to the King
about it first. And you may be sure we're working on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein told reporters that he hopes to discuss with
Clinton what further steps could be take to achieve the goal of
peace in the Middle East through negotiations, which have been
broken down because of Israel's decision to build the Jewish
settlement in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was the last of four Middle East leaders coming to
washington for talks with Clinton on the peace process. The first
who came here was Netanyahu, who then was followed by Arafat and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Try to Get Free from UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has mapped out
plans to ensure the country is not censured at the current
session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, a
presidency source said today.
</P>
<P>
The plans are in the light of the recent aborted trip of the
U.N. Human Rights Commission rapporteurs that might draw calls
for punitive actions against Nigeria, the source said.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken necessary steps to check any harsh resolution
against us during the current session of the commission," the
source was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the government will show at the
session the extent to which Nigeria has gone for cooperation with
the rapporteurs.
</P>
<P>
The information to be made available would guide the delegates
attending the session in arriving at any decision on Nigeria, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is not worse than what it was last year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been under the fire of the West for its alleged
poor human rights record, particularly following the execution of
nine minority nationality activists in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, the United States and Canada have since
imposed sanctions against the western African country, while the
Commonwealth has suspended its membership for two years.

<HEADLINE> BBC-Discovery Joint Venture Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The BBC's 500 million-plus US
dollars joint venture with Discovery Communications of America
will not start before June -- six months later than forecast --
delaying the launch of new international channels until early next
year.
</P>
<P>
The Times today quoted BBC sources as saying that "more time
was needed because the venture had become much broader and more
complex than originally expected".
</P>
<P>
In September, when the two sides revealed they were in talks,
they said they hoped to reach final agreement by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deal is designed to build up the corporation's commercial
income by exploiting the BBC name in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
It will do so by creating new subscription-TV channels that
will be shown on satellite and cable systems and through joint
program developments.
</P>
<P>
The venture with Discovery will be similar in concept to the
one formed two weeks ago with Flextech, the cable and satellite
programer that is ultimately controlled by Tele-Communications Inc
(TCI), America's beggest cable company.
</P>
<P>
The BBC-Flextech joint venture gained exclusive UK and Irish
rights to much of the BBC's programming archives and will invest
about 224 million US dollars to launch eight channels in the
Autumn.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Steel Giants Merger Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A merger between Germany's two
biggest steel concern -- Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch went into effect
today, resulting in the world fifth-biggest steekmaker with an
estimated annual production of 15 million tons of steel.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by overcapacity at home and cheaper imports from
eastern Europe and Asia, the two companies agreed last week to
merge their steel operations up from April 1. The accord has
already been approved by the supervisory board of Thyssen, and an
endorsement by its Krupp counterpart, due in May, is believed to
be a sheer formality.
</P>
<P>
The merger was prompted by Krupp's announcement of a hostile
takeover bid for its larger rival Thyssen last month. After mass
labour protests and strikes, as well as political uproar, Krupp
dropped its hostile takeover plans on March 19 when it became
clear that the two were prepared to merge on friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
Under the merger accord, Thyssen will hold a controlling 60
percent stake in the merged entity, called Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG.
Thyssen's chief executive, Ekkehard Schulz, will assume its top
management post.
</P>
<P>
About 6,600 jobs will be phased out in the coming five years
due to the incorporation and annual cost-savings of about 550
million German marks (about 329 million U.S. dollars) are expected
to be achieved from the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> Irish Economy to Sustain Further Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Ireland is set to
remain the strongest in the European Union (EU), with a further
growth of 6 percent in 1997, according to the latest Bank of
Ireland poll.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey suggest that low interest rates
combined with improving economic conditions internationally will
underpin sustained growth in the Irish economy throughout the rest
of this year, press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
Some 77 percent of Irish business leaders expected to report
increased turnover in the current year, with 65 percent basing
their expectations on continued growth in the country's economy
over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which reflects the views of 178 senior Irish
executives in various sectors of the economy, shows that 43
percent of companies are planning to recruit additional staff.
</P>
<P>
Jim Powell, Bank of Ireland's chief economist, was quoted as
saying that the results were consistent with further evidence from
various sectors of the Irish economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that the economy is enjoying another very
good year and growth of 6 percent is easily achievable. The level
of confidence reflects the very benign interest rate situation and
also the improvement in external economic conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
In overall terms, the survey pointed to a very optimistic
picture for the Irish economy this year, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABIE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al Hojeilan said today that
Jerusalem is the principal cause of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan, at the end of his two-day visit here, urged the Arab
states to unify their efforts to confront the present challenge,
referring to the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has come across great difficulties since two
weeks ago when Israel carried out its Jewish settlement plan in
East Jerusalem, a place the Palestinians see as the capital of
their future state, despite fierce opposition and criticism from
the world, particularly the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan was received here this afternoon by UAE President Sheikh
Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
He praised the UAE attitude in support of Arab causes including
that of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan is visiting the UAE within the framework of a GCC tour
to follow up the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the
GCC summit in Doha last December. He had earlier visited Qatar
where he had a meeting with the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa Al Thani.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's new special military unit,
known as the Kommandos Spezialkraefte (KSK), officially entered
service today, ready for worldwide deployment to deal with
emergencies such as hostage crises and terrorist attacks, the
German Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The first 20 KSK soldiers, out of a planned group of 960, have
become fully operational at their headquarters in the southwestern
German city of Calw. The full unit is due to be completed by the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The main mission of the KSK is to free hostages but they are
also expected to obtain "crucial information" from international
crisis or conflict areas as well as to counter "subversive
forces."
</P>
<P>
Soldiers applying for joining the elite unit are subject to
tough entry tests. Their maximum age is limited to 38.
</P>
<P>
The new unit, which is under the command of the German armed
forces Bundeswehr, will run parallel with another special unit,
called GSG 9 run by the German Bundesgrenzschutz border police.
The latter is allowed to be deployed only within German territory.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the KSK was envisaged after Germany suffered
the embarrassment of not having appropriate forces to rescue 11
employees of the Deutsche Welle state radio station who were
trapped in Rwanda during the civil war three years ago, according
to reports of the German news agency DPA.
</P>
<P>
Bonn had to ask Belgium to send its paratroopers to evacuate
those people.

ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette will start a two-day official visit to Turkey Wednesday
to exchange views with Turkish officials on Turkey's bid for its
full membership of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
De Charette is on visits to Azerbaijan and Armenia, which are
troubled by the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. He will inform Turkish
officials of the results of his visits to the above two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia News Agency today quoted diplomatic sources here
as saying that De Charette's visit to Turkey means that "Turkey is
perceived as the most important country, which can make
contributions to the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh question
together with co-chairmen of Minsk Group in OSCE."
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia stopped their long conflicts in 1995
over the possession of the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which seeks
sought independence from Azerbaijan. But the two sides'
negotiation efforts failed to make progress last year on the
status of the region in the future and the conditions for the stay
of the peacekeeping troops of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
OSCE Minsk Group started a three-day meeting today on the
Nagorno-Karabakh question in Moscow with the participation of the
parties concerned.

De Charette is expected to reiterate French support for
Turkey's bid for full EU membership during his stay here.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Launches New Campaign for Gender Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Persons
Fund (UNFPA) announced today a new initiative under the banner
theme of "Men are Women Too" for gender equality.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the UNFPA is proposing a world conference on
the subject. To be called "Women 2" in reference to the Fourth
World Conference on Women in 1995, it will have a parallel
process.
</P>
<P>
Men will form the majority of the delegations, though they will
usually be led by a woman to ensure consistency. They will have
equal access to a 12-chapter platform for action covering topics
heretofore closed to men such as child care, family health,
education, responsibility for food, fuel and water and making sure
they arrive home before the pubs close, according to the UNFPA.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA set up a new Division for Engenderment Empowerment
and Development for the initiative. "There is a whole world of men
out there who should also be participating in the development
process, driving us towards food security, protecting the
environment, ending poverty and leading us down the road to a
sustainable future," said A. P. Rillfoal, chief of the new
division.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The locations of deployment of the
the multinational security force in Albania were a matter to be
decided by the countries participating in the force, said a Greek
Foreign Ministry official today.
</P>
<P>
George Papandreou, alternate foreign minister of Greece, told
reporters that from the outset, Greece had not set as a condition
for participating in the force that Athens would decide where its
contingent was to be stationed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Greece had proposed its troops be based in
central Albania because Athens believed it could make a
particularly important contribution there.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that this position reflected the
responsibility with which Athens was confronting the issue of the
ethnic Greek minority, about 300,000 living in southern Albania,
and Greek-Albanian relations in general.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the United Nations gave the green light for the
formation of a 5,000-strong force, half of which will be deployed
and half held in reserve, to protect humanitarian relief
operations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 Greek troops are expected to participate in the
U.N.-mandated operation which will last for three months.
Countries such as Italy, France, Spain, Hungary, Romania and
Turkey will also send troops to the strife-ridden Albania.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Law Goes Into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The new immigration law went
into effect today as scheduled after a U.S. Court of Appeals
rejected a U.S. district judge's ruling that would have delayed
the implementation for four days.
</P>
<P>
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) spokesman Brian
Jordan said the U.S. Court of Appeals, acting on an appeal by the
Justice Department, overturned at 1 a.m. the ruling of Emmet
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El
Salvador, and Costa Rica were meeting with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to make a plea that no collective deportations
are carried out under the law enacted today.
</P>
<P>
The ministers met Monday with Attorney General Janet Reno, who
repeated the Clinton administration's line that there will be no
massive deportations.
</P>
<P>
Sullivan had ruled in favor of the American Civil Liberties
Union and immigrants' advocacies who argued the INS had had no
time to polish the regulations to implement the 1996 Immigration
Reform Act, and that the public and immigration lawyers didn't
have a chance to comment on the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials had said Sullivan's decision would cause
"wide-scale confusion (and) significantly undermine" the
administration's ability to enforce the new law.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of immigrants, mostly from Latin America
and the Caribbean, fear they will be rounded up and deported.
</P>
<P>
The new immigration legislation combined with the 1996 social
welfare reform denies social services to illegal immigrants and
sharply reduce benefits to legal residents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends US Vetoes to UN Israel Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today defended his U.N. chief's move to veto two Security Council
resolutions condemning Israel's decision to build a Jewish
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The vetoes did not evidence support in the United States for
the decision to the building to go forward at Har Homa (in east
Jerusalem)," Clinton said during a photo session with King Hussein
of Jordan at the White House.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a question from a reporter who believed the
U.S. move was "a departure from long-standing policy" for the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We vetoed the resolutions for two reasons," Clinton said. "One
is we don't think that they're very helpful to the peace process;
and second is there was language in both resolutions which we
believe prejudiced the final status negotiations against the
Israelis."
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with King Hussein of Jordan at the White
House, Clinton said "this is a difficult time for the peace
process" and he had a lot to talk about with the king, who arrived
in Washington today via New York.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians on the West
Bank have continued for 13 consecutive days, in which
Palestinians, outraged by Israelis bulldozers moving into Arab
east Jerusalem to break ground for Jewish housing constructions,
went on to the street for demonstrations against Israel's move
that was obviously in violation of the Oslo agreement, and were
confronted with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Dodging about a question whether Israel's attempt to establish
the Jewish settlement was the "real cause of violence," Clinton
said what the Israelis and Palestinians had to do "is to restore
the environment of security and of confidence so we can go forward
with the negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that, unambiguously, a precondition of going
forward is a commitment to zero tolerance for terrorism, for
making the best effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he held extensive meetings with U.S. peace broker
Dennis Ross Monday and again today to discuss the volatile
situations in the Middle East. Ross was dispatched to the region
last week to hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to salvage
the tottering peace process because of defying of
Israeli-Palestinian agreements. But he returned to Washington
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also did not rule out a plan to send Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the Middle East "at a right time."
</P>
<P>
"I certainly want her to go.... We want it to be a trip that
will actually be part of a strategy designed to move the process
forward," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters he had some ideas on dissolving the
recent crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We've got some ideas about it, but I want to talk to the king
about it first. And you may be sure we're working on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein told reporters that he hoped to discuss with
Clinton what further steps could be take to achieve the goal of
peace in the Middle East through negotiations, which have been
broken down because of Israel's decision to build the Jewish
settlement in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was the last of four Middle East leaders coming to
Washington for talks with Clinton on the peace process. The first
who came here was Netanyahu, who then was followed by Arafat and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian-Sudanese relations are
still beset with some differences, Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali

</P>
<P>
Taha, at a news conference this evening before leaving for

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government, Rebels Initial Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
initialed a peace agreement with the rebels, who have broken away
from their leader John Garang, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The final signing is expected to take place on April 10 in
Khartoum, capital of Sudan, Egypt's MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed a week ago, has not met all the rebels'
demands, as it was agreed that the transitional period will be
four years. But the report did not say where the agreement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
Government sources were quoted as ruling out the idea of
conducting a referendum on self-determination in south Sudan,
replacing it by a "yes or no" option on getting the south unified
with the north,
</P>
<P>
In case the majority are in support of unification, the two
sides should meet with each other again to look into the measures
to be taken, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The MENA report said the Sudanese government has rejected that
the headquarters of the proposed coordinatory council be seated
in Juba on the southern tip of the country, advising the
signatories to locate the council in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging in the war-torn country since the
beginning of this year between the government forces on the one
side and the northern opposition parties of the National
Democratic Alliance and rebel troops of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army led by John Garang on the other in the Sudanese
eastern and southern border areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The first joint venture between
China and Tanzania in the industrial field, Tanzania-China Friendship
Textile Co. Ltd, was officially launched here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Industries and Trade William Shija and Chinese
Ambassador to Tanzania Xie Yukun cut ribbon at the launching
ceremony here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Adressing at the function, Shija highly commended the Chinese
government and people for their brotherly assistance to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Shija recalled that China helped Tanzania build the Friendship
Textile Mill of Tanzania in 1968. Its production had been good up
to 1980. However, he said, the production has declined in the
1980s and the 1990s, due to lack of funds and poor management.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government agreed to help rehabilitate the
mill, and the Dieqiu Textiles Company of China decided a year ago
to run the mill jointly with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to a contract, signed in March, 1996, Dieqiu owns a 51
percent share while the Tanzanian government has a 49 pecent share in
the joint venture, Tanzania-China Friendship Textile Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his belief that the joint venture,
to be managed by Chinese experts, will be
successful because China is one of the advanced countries in
textile industry in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Xie Yukun called for scientific
management, discipline, deligence and co-operation to enhance
production in the company.
</P>
<P>
He said the joint venture would also help cement the existing
ties between China and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The General Manager of the company, Yu Kaiming, callled on the
government to reduce the 30 percent sales tax on textiles, saying
it was too high.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to properly tax textile importers.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people attended the launching ceremony. They
included Deputy Minister for Industries and Trade Shamin Khan,
other high-ranking officials from the ministry and the Chinese
Embassy, and representatives of workers of the textile factory.

<HEADLINE> New York City Sees Continued Decline in Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- New York City, which experienced
a sharp drop in crimes last year, saw continued decline in crimes
in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports of seven major crimes -- murder, rape, robbery,
assault, burglary, grand larceny and car theft -- dropped by 15.6
percent over the same period of last year, according to
preliminary police statistics released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Murder and car theft, two of the crimes that most frightened
and annoyed New Yorkers, dropped more precipitously than any other
major crimes. A total of 194 people were reported killed during
the first three months of the year, a 27 percent decrease over the
corresponding period of last year. And 13,004 cars were reported
stolen during the above-mentioned period, down 20 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Criminologists noted that the decline of crack, the economic
upturn and the more aggressive policing strategies are the major
factors that attributed to the continued decline in crimes in the
city.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Hong Kong Immigrants to Return to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Hong Kong Chinese
who have immigrated into Canada in recent years are returning to
Hong Kong, the Financial Post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10,000 people will return to Hong Kong
this year, mainly from Vancouver, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the emigration is everywhere in Vancouver. Scores
of 1-million-dollar homes and exclusive apartments are up for sale
and members of the Chinese community talk about friends and family
members who have decided to go home.
</P>
<P>
Most seem to be recent immigrants who have not been able to
adapt or graduates who see better career opportunities in Hong
Kong. Many are returning to find work or to take advantage of Hong
Kong's buoyant real estate and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"People are gaining back confidence and they would obviously
prefer to do business in Hong Kong rather than in Canada," said
William Yee of Vancouver's Chinese Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
As the exodus gathers pace, fewer wealthy Hong Kong immigrants
are arriving in Vancouver, said the Canadian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the authorities granted 1,500 investor class and
entrepreneur class visas to Hong Kong residents with declared net
assets totaling 2.9 billion dollars. But only 574 visas were
awarded in the first nine months of 1996, involving assets of 756
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The property market has already felt the effects of wealthy
Chinese returning to Hong Kong. Scores of homes are up for sale
and prices have dropped as much as 20 percent in the city's
upmarket west side, where many Chinese settled.
</P>
<P>
There are about half a million Hong Kong immigrants in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Arab States Request UN Special Session on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Arab states requested an
emergency special session of the U.N. General Assembly to consider
the illegal Israeli actions in occupied east Jerusalem and the
rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, a U.N. spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Fred Eckhard said that chairman of the Group of Arab
States put forward the request in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nasser bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, ambassador of Qatar and chairman
of the Group of Arab States, asked for convening the emergency
special session pursuant to General Assembly resolution 377 (V),
known as the "Uniting for Peace" formula.
</P>
<P>
He said in the letter that Arab states believed "the illegal
Israeli measures represent a threat to international peace and
security as they endanger the Middle East peace process and are
also in violation of international law and relevant Security
Council and General Assembly resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the two successive vetoes cast by the United
States on March 7 and 21 in the Security Council to prevent action
on Israel's plan to build homes on occupied land.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly adopted a resolution on March 13 by 130
votes to two with two abstentions, calling on Israel to abandon
the building project.
</P>
<P>
The special session would be called within 24 hours when the
secretary-general determined that the majority of the member
states supported the request, Eckhard noted.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials estimated that the special session might take
place next week, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges US to Return to Road of Dialogue, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Alternate Representative of the
Chinese delegation Li Baodong today urged the United States to
return to the road of dialogue and cooperation by putting an end
to all actions of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In exercising the right of reply to a speech made by William
Richardson, US permanent representative to the UN, at the 53rd
session of the Commission on Human Rights, Li said, "The US
representatives have a bad habit. They are fond of pointing their
fingers at other countries' affairs, as if the US is the master of
the world and all countries have to listen to it. This is
anachronism."
</P>
<P>
"The US representative probably forgot that the human rights
situation in the US today is far from brilliant and the scourge of
racism is still running rampant," Li pointed out. "This is a fact
that even the US government itself cannot but admit. Isn't it more
advisable that the US representative takes more care of his own
domestic affairs and puts his own house in order?"
</P>
<P>
Li said, "The US representative remarked in his address that
the US would not seek confrontation with China. We welcome this
desire of non-confrontation. However, it is in the same address
that he flagrantly provoked confrontation. This is most
unfortunate and self-contradictory."
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue and confrontation are incompatible, and you can't
have both," Li stressed. "If the US really has the desire to cease
confrontation, it should manifest it in concrete deeds by putting
an end to all actions of confrontation and returning to the road
of dialogue and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Richardson was also counterattacked by countries like Cuba,
Iraq and Myanmar, which he named in his speech.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned With Protection of Indigenous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Adviser of the Chinese delegation
Long Xuequn said today that China is deeply concerned with the
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples although there are
neither indigenous people nor indigenous issues in China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Long said, "The indigenous issues are a product
of special historical circumstances. By and large, they are the
result of the colonialist policy carried out in modern history by
European countries in other regions of the world, especially on
the continents of America and Oceania."
</P>
<P>
"As in the case of other Asian countries, the Chinese people of
all ethnic groups have lived on our own land for generations. We
suffered from invasion and occupation of colonialists and foreign
aggressors," Long said. "Fortunately, after arduous struggles of
all ethnic groups, we drove away those colonialists and
aggressors. In China, there are no indigenous people and therefore
no indigenous issues."
</P>
<P>
However, Long said, "The Chinese government and people are
deeply concerned with the protection of the rights of indigenous
peoples. We sympathize with their unfortunate experience in
history and we follow with concern their situation today."
</P>
<P>
Long said, "The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
will constitute another important instrument of the UN in the
field of human rights. It will provide an important guidance for
the international community and state governments in promoting and
protecting the rights of indigenous peoples."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Long pointed out, "Without a definition of
indigenous peoples and a scope of application for the declaration,
it will be difficult to prove the special necessity to draft the
declaration and to ensure that the special rights specified in the
declaration be accurately applied to the genuine indigenous
peoples."
</P>
<P>
Long said that the Chinese delegation hoped that the working
group in charge of drafting the declaration would, taking into
account views of all parties concerned, endeavor to reach a
consensus text and submit it to the commission for adoption at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation has actively participated in the work
of the working group," Long said. "We are ready to join other
delegations and organizations of indigenous peoples to continue
our efforts in the drafting process and in protecting the rights
of indigenous peoples."

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for 68.2-Mln-Dlr Humanitarian Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today appealed
for 68.2 million U.S. dollars to meet the humanitarian needs in
Sierra Leone following five years of civil conflict, which
formally ended with the signing the Abidjan peace accord on
November 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Department of Humanitarian
Affairs, about 517,000 out of the estimated 1.6 million displaced
people have returned to their areas of origin since late last year
when the government of Sierra Leone, UN agencies and
non-governmental organizations began to make joint efforts to
promote the advantages of timely resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian program reflected in the appeal, for the
period from March 1997 through February 1998, is designed to
promote the consolidation of peace and to assist the affected
population in attaining higher levels of self-sufficiency.
Accordingly, food aid will be provided to sustain people displaced
or impoverished by the war, to facilitate their return to their
communities and to support them while they strive to produce their
own sustenance. Similarly, direct benefits such as nutritional
supplements, vaccines and educational services for displaced
children will be combined with measures to build up the local
capacity for the delivery of these services.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian activities are aimed to provide a basic
foundation for the National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction Program launched by the government of Sierra Leone
in September 1996. The appeal is designed to provide a basic
safety-net for the war-affected and returnees, while the program
establishes conditions for people to resume their livelihoods.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Indicates Personal Commitment to Mideast Pease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
indicated he would personally intervene in the recent crisis in
the Middle East, caused by Israel's earthmovers entering east
Jerusalem for Jewish housing construction, so that the peace
process could be salvaged from breaking down.
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared personally to do anything I can to get this
process back on track and move it forward, but I think the less I
say about it, the more likely I am to have some success in doing
that," he said after his 45-minute meeting with King Hussein of
Jordan at the White House, at which they conferred on how to halt
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians on the West
Bank have continued for 13 consecutive days, in which
Palestinians, outraged by Israelis bulldozers moving into Arab
east Jerusalem to break ground to build 6,500 Jewish homes, went
on to the street in protest against Israel's move that was
obviously in violation of Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements,
and confronted with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to try to keep the lid on things over there.... It
is not going to be easy," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said he looked forward to meeting Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu if he could come to Washington this weekend to
confer with representatives of the American Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said earlier that it was not certain if
Netanyahu would make the trip, but Clinton said, "I understand
he's coming and I certainly hope to see him. I expect to see
him.... I think it's important for us to talk and I's glad he's
coming."
</P>
<P>
At the start of his meeting with King Hussein, Clinton told
reporters that he had some ideas on dissolving the recent crisis,
and he would first confer the king before making any announcement.
</P>
<P>
"We've got some ideas about it, but I want to talk to the king
about it first. And you may be sure we're working on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said before his meeting with King Hussein that it was
"a difficult time for the peace process."
</P>
<P>
King Hussein agreed, saying: "We are certainly passing through
a difficult stage."
</P>
<P>
Clinton would not say that Israel's attempt to establish the
Jewish settlement was what a reporter called "the real cause of
violence," but only emphasized the necessity of restoring "the
environment of security and of confidence" in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that, unambiguously, a precondition of going
forward is a commitment to zero tolerance for terrorism, for
making the best effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he held extensive meetings with U.S. peace broker
Dennis Ross Monday and again today to discuss the volatile
situations in the Middle East. Ross was dispatched to the region
last week to hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Netanyahu in an attempt to salvage the tottering peace process
because of Israel's defying of peace agreements. But he returned
to Washington empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not rule out a plan to send Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the Middle East "at a right time."
</P>
<P>
"I certainly want her to go.... We want it to be a trip that
will actually be part of a strategy designed to move the process
forward," the president said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein told reporters that he hoped to discuss with
Clinton what further steps could be taken to achieve the goal of
peace in the Middle East through negotiations, which have been
broken down because of Israel's decision to build the Jewish
settlement in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein was the last of four Middle East leaders coming to
Washington for talks with Clinton on the peace process. The first
who came here was Netanyahu, who then was followed by Arafat and
Egyptian President Hosni [0;1;7mMubarak[0;1m.

<HEADLINE> US B-2 Bombers Becomes Operational: Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. B-2 "stealth" bomber,
capable of dropping conventional and nuclear bombs, has become
operational, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the planned 21 planes have been delivered to
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure the U.S. taxpayers that this is the most
up-to-date heavy bomber flying in the world today. It has stealth
capability," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The two-billion U.S. dollar planes, designed to foil radar,
were capable of worldwide missions carrying 900 kg conventional
bombs that are guided to their targets by space satellites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force originally planned to purchase 50 such
bombers, which were designed during the Cold War period against
the former Soviet Union, but decided to buy 21 due to the high
expenses of the plane and the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force has made the decision that 21 planes will be
enough for them to meet their needs in conjunction with other
heavy bombers we already have," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force currently has nearly 100 B-1 bombers, and
several hundred B-52 bombers still in operation, according to
the spokesman.

<P>
BONN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one war orphans who were
evacuated to Germany from the war-torn Bosnia over four years ago
returned to their home country today, said German media reports.
</P>
<P>
The 31 orphans, aged between five and 10 years, were among the
42 children evacuated from Sarajevo in August 1992 in a
controversial move sponsored by two local parliament members of
the eastern German Saxony-Anhalt state. The other 11 had already
returned home earlier.
</P>
<P>
The two German local parliament members had been criticized at
that time for organizing the evacuation single-handedly without
advice from the German federal government and the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Two babies were killed by
sniper fire during the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Escorted by their German teachers, the 31 Bosnian children were
flown by a chartered plane from Berlin to Sarajevo where they will
start their new life with the help of the German teachers, German
television reports said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, all the boys and girls, who had been
educated in German kindergartens and schools, received intensive
lessons on their mother tongue. They were also prepared to adjust
to the new environment with the help of psychologists.

<HEADLINE> US, EU End Talks on Meat, Poultry Without Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced
today imposition of meat inspection standards on the European
Union countries' meat and poultry after the two sides failed in
their negotiations on meat and poultry shipments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman made the announcement
that could curb as much as 300 million U.S. dollars of meat and
poultry shipments from the 15-nation EU in the wake of talks on
common requirements, a "veterinary equivalence arrangement"
concluded without agreement. The bilateral talks had continued for
almost three years.
</P>
<P>
The measures that could cause as much as 1 billion dollar loss
in the meat and poultry trade between the United States and the
Western European market.
</P>
<P>
The EU had also requested the United States and other countries
must meet its new standards taking effect today and thus threaten
millions of dollars worth of U.S. meat and poultry exports.
</P>
<P>
EU spokesman Gerard Kiely said as much as 700 million dollars a
year in American meat product exports could be disrupted by the
new European food safety criteria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agriculture secretary also acknowledged that the new
European rules will adversely affect U.S. exports to the Western
European nations.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, as previously announced, the United
States, as of April 1 will begin to implement a system that will
require EU meat exports to comply with U.S. inspection
requirements," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had warned that EU meat and poultry would be
subject to U.S. inspections, which would disrupt shipments to the
United States. EU exports to the United States exceed 300 million
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Members of the EU are Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

<P>
The Dow climbed 27.57 points to close at 6611.05, regaining a
bit of the nearly 300-point loss it suffered in the previous two
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Optimistic investors seized on a small part of a report from
the National Association of Purchasing Management released this
morning. But the purchasing managers' index of overall economic
activity rose. In addition, the federal government reported the
highest construction spending increase in 11 months and the
Conference Board's leading economic indicators index posted its
biggest gain in a year.
</P>
<P>
But there is no consensus among investment professionals that a
more protracted decline looms.
</P>
<P>
Yet the market has stood some violent selloffs over the past
year and ordinary investors have barely flinched, keeping stock
and viewing price pullbacks as buying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The recent selloff began with concerns that the Federal Reserve
would raise interest rates to forestall inflation, which it did
last Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Khan Advances in British Squash Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Jansher Khan beat Ireland's Derek
Ryan to move one step closer to the defence of his British Open
title in Cardiff on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the legendary Pakistani suffered a startling
defeat to Ryan in the British League match but there was no doubt
who was the master this time as Jansher won 15-7, 15-6, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
Ryan took Jansher to a hard four games a year ago, but although
the contest lasted only two minutes short of an hour on this
occasion he never looked like discomforting Jansher.
</P>
<P>
The first game was peppered with lets and long rallies, Jansher
going to 5-3, 8-4,and 13-6 before taking it characteristically,
punctuating a rally of stealthy sparring with a sudden fierce
kill.
</P>
<P>
That game lasted 25 minutes and sapped Ryan's strength. It
needed a late run of four points by him to add respectability to
the scoreline.
</P>
<P>
Jansher next plays Australian qualifier Joe Kneipp.
</P>
<P>
In a noisy match which sometimes threatened to disturb
proceedings on the next court, Kneipp beat 15th seeded Paul
Gregory in straight games 15-12, 15-11 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a dispute over the rules led to the world number four
from England Chris Walker reaching the second round without
hitting a ball.
</P>
<P>
His opponent Martin Heath of Scotland withdrew with a foot
injury, and the English Squash Rackets Association tournament
manager Don Sanderson was prepared to replace him with Billy
Haddrell of Australia, according to the lucky loser rule in the
manual.
</P>
<P>
But John Nimick, the Executive Director of the Professional
Squash Association which runs the circuit, invoked a separate
rule which says a player withdrawing on-site at a tournament is
entitled to his loser's prize money points.
</P>
<P>
These were duly given to Heath even though the world number 19
said he was prepared to forgo them.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who recently posed nude because even as England number
one he does not have a shoe or clothing contract, will therefore
play his opening match in the second round against Wales' David
Evans.

killing three people on board. air terminal's authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The transport plane skidded up to a highway on which, no vehicle

Airport authorities said the plane made a normal south-north
landing but apparently the runway was not long enough for it to
come to a complete stop so it overran the strip and crashed
against part of the "Camosa" bridge and then dropped onto a two-lane
highway leading to the capital city.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has suspended Portuguese
referees from international matches until a dispute between the
country's referees' association and soccer federation is settled.
</P>
<P>
"The dispute between the two associations has led to a
situation where FIFA decided to suspend the referees from
international duty," FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the dispute is settled the situation will be
reviewed."
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in of the seven-strong referees' council of the
Portuguese Soccer Federation in March was suspended against its
wishes after the referees' association lodged a complaint in a
civil court over an appointment.
</P>
<P>
The referees' association said in the complaint that Avelino
Ferreira Torres was not eligible for a seat on the council because
he did not have a "clean record".
</P>
<P>
Ferreira Torres was suspended from administrative duties for
six months in 1990 for allegedly making unethical remarks in a
press interview.
</P>
<P>
Both national associations are holding talks to resolve the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Herren said the immediate impact of the FIFA ruling was that
Portuguese referee Jorge Monteiro Coroado would not take charge of
the World Cup qualifier between Lithuania and Romania in Vilnius
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He has been replaced by German Edgar Steinborn.

producers in Latin America and the world, even though its current
production is 750 kilograms.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona has refused to
rejoin his Argentinian side Boca Juniors blaming the team's
sponsors for his decision.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old former World Cup winner, who was sent home in
disgrace from the 1994 World Cup after testing positive for drugs,
had said on Monday night that he was on the verge of returning to
the club, whom he had not played for since August because of a row
with the club president Mauricio Macri.
</P>
<P>
However, he laid the blame for his change of mind at the feet
of Nike, whose kit the team wears, saying that he would find it
difficult to wear the strip anyway but that his contract with a
rival of Nike's, Puma, would not allow him to appear at press
conferences in Nike kit.

<HEADLINE> Officials in Northwest China Held Accountable For Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region is fighting its last and decisive battle to
eradicate absolute poverty by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 officials are sent to China's poorest Xihaigu
area, responsible for poverty relief of over 500 villages, and
they will not leave the areas before sound alleviation has been
ensured, according to Zhou Shengxian, vice-chairman of the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
The region has reduced the number of its poverty-stricken
population to 760,000 over the past years, and is to help another
200,000 shake off poverty this year. Efforts will be focused on
villages which have less than 500 yuan of income and 150 kilograms
of grain per capita annually.
</P>
<P>
Concern from the society-at-large contributes to the work. More
than 11.3 million yuan were donated to the area last year. And
top priority is given to spreading agro-science, infrastructure
construction, and labour force transfer, to help the poor develop
production.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Military Region and the Regional Department of
Geology and Mineral Resources carried out a program of drilling
100 wells to aid the poor and a "special-water-prospecting-plan"
in the area last year, respectively, and drilled 102 wells for 94
villages to provide clean water for 200,000 rural residents and
two million head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,200 wells were drilled, 70 kilometres of high
voltage electricity transmission lines erected, and some 566 ha of
farmland improved in the area last year, the vice-chairman says.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The governments of
Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay today expressed their protest
against the Brazilian policy on import restrictions.

Last week, the Brazilian government announced restrictions on
the financing of imports in order to reduce its trade
deficit. Importers will have to pay for all of imported goods
immediately.

Brazil's three partners in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).

Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez postponed his visit
to Brazil today to protest against the Brazilian decision.
</P>

Uruguayan Economy Minister Luis Mosca said that the Brazilian
restrictions will affect more than half of its country's exports
to Brazil. The restrictions will harm Uruguay's textile and
clothing manufactures whose exports to Brazil totaled 831 million
U.S. dollars in 1996.
