<HEADLINE> France Denies It Will Boycott D.R. Congo Aid Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- France today denied that it will
boycott the international conference on providing aid to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo).
</P>
<P>
It is a "completely false" rumor that France will boycott the
meeting that will be held in Brussels Wednesday, said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
"It is false to say that France opposes, puts a spoke in the
wheel, boycotts, or is negative in regard to this meeting of
Brussels. It will participate in the meeting," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The D.R. Congo expelled last week a first secretary of the
French embassy in Kinshasa, Eric Lubin, for "activities
incompatible with his status." In retaliation, France also
expelled a first secretary of the embassy of D.R. Congo in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Anne Gazeau-Secret said France has no prejudice toward the
D.R. Congo and will listen to the request for aid from the
D.R. Congo government.
</P>
<P>
"We will be as attentive as others to the display of the plan
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and to the analysis of its
need in terms of assistance and proposals of aid for this country
which has been ravaged by a certain number of conflicts in recent
years," said the foreign ministry spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The D.R.Congo government said in a document issued before the
conference that it needs 1.29 billion U.S. dollars, including 728
million dollars of foreign aid, for its "emergency program" of
reconstructing the country which was ruined by the "predatory
power of Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko."
</P>
<P>
The Brussels conference is sponsored by the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Ceremony Marks Opening of New Railway Project in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in the city
of Xingyi in southwest China's Guizhou province today, to mark the
opening of a new railway line that links the capitals of Guangxi
and Yunnan, both in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng sent a message saying that emphasis should be
placed on safety and punctual, good service, and Vice-premier Zhu
Rongji sent a letter of congratulations.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Zou Jiahua also congratulated builders, scientific
and technical personnel as well as people of various ethnic groups
along the rail route on behalf of the State Council, thanking them
for their work on the country's most technically sophisticated
railway project.
</P>
<P>
The railway will boost economic growth in southwestern China
and further increase the unity of various national minorities, and
called it another milestone in man conquering nature.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders paid a great deal of attention to the progress
of railway construction. Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Zou
Jiahua visited construction sites several times and got directly
involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
The 899.7-km railway runs from Nanning, the capital city of the
southwestern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to Kunming, the
capital of Yunnan Province, and has a trunk line to Hongguo in
Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
It cost 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars), and passes
through perilous mountain areas and crosses torrential rivers,
with an altitude change of more than 2,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The new railway and the Three Gorges Project constitute part of
a national strategy of tapping the economic potential of central
and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoxi, a senior economist, said that the central government
plans to inject 600 billion yuan (72.3 billion dollars) to 800
billion yuan (96.4 billion US dollars) into the western part of
the country during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), and 43 percent of the state's leading projects will
be there, and a large number of programs financed by foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony was attended by representatives of the
Ministry of railways, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the China
Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Pak Senate Chairman Assumes Office of President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senate Chairman
Wasim Sajjad today assumed the office of president, following the
resignation of President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pakistan Constitution, the 56-year-old Wasim
will act as president until a president is elected within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Wasim, who was born on March 30, 1941, was elected Senate
Chairman four times. Graduated from Punjab University in 1961,
Sajjad had been practicing law at the High Court and the Supreme
Court since 1966 and appeared in a large number of cases of
constitutional and legal importance.
</P>
<P>
He held the cabinet portfolio as federal minister for justice
and parliamentary affairs from September 28, 1986 to December 1,
1988.
</P>
<P>
He acted as president of Pakistan on several occasions during
the absence of the president and also during the critical period
when Ghulam Ishaq Khan vacated the office of president on July 19,
1993 when there was a vacuum of leadership in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari has formally tendered his resignation
soon
after addressing a news conference here this evening, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The 23-word resignation letter has been sent to Speaker of the
National Assembly Ellahi Soomro, they said, adding Leghari left
his
office for residential quarters of the Presidency immediately
after
signing the letter.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who assumed his office as president four years ago,
told a
crowded news conference here this evening that he received today a

summary to disqualify Chief Justice Sajjad and appoint the senior
most
judge of the Supreme Court as the next Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing president said he had no option but to sign it.
But,
instead, he decided to quit.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to resign for the supremacy of the judiciary
and the
constitution of the country," Leghari said, adding an official
announcement of his resignation will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
The nerve-wracking tussle between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and
Chief Justice Sajjad reached its climax today when Sajjad
suspended this
morning the 13th amendment to the constitution passed by the two
houses
of Parliament in April, which clipped the presidential power to
dismiss
an elected government.
</P>
<P>
However, minutes after Sajjad's order, a rival 10-member bench
of the
Supreme Court declared his order invalid because he has been under

suspension.
</P>
<P>
Leghari's resignation also came hours after his meeting with
the
powerful Chief of the Army Staff Jahangir Karamat, who has been
acting as
the mediator in the four-month-old confrontation between the
government
and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Supreme Court issued the conflicting
orders
today, Karamat also met with Prime Minister Sharif earlier in the
day.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The development of the
Russian-Belarussian Union should not depend on "political trends,"
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said at the meeting of
the union's Executive Committee in Minsk today.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax reported from Minsk that Chernomyrdin, who arrived
there today, said that when discussing the Russian and Belarussian
strategic interests, "we must learn to maintain calm and remember
the objective of making our cooperation more efficient."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the two nations' efforts must be focused on the
economic sectors "ensuring the creation of a single economic space
in the long run."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin outlined the new joint economic programs which
include developing "dual use" technologies, manufacturing
equipment for flax, and producing and processing peat.
</P>
<P>
According to him, almost 90 percent of the budget totaling 660
billion Russian rubles (110.88 million US dollars) will be
allocated for developing and implementing joint programs.
</P>
<P>
Today's committee meeting adopted a resolution on creating a
single investment space. An advisory council on investment policy
was established under the committee to pursue this objective.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee approved new principles for imposing
tariffs on electric and heating power to ensure stable operation
of the two countries' energy sectors. An agreement was reached on
unifying approaches to determining transportation tariffs.

LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Over two million people in
Nigeria, or nearly one fiftieth of its population, are living
with the HIV virus, while about 103,000 AIDS-related deaths have

<P>
Speaking at a press briefing Monday in Abuja commemorating

our attention on the fate of our children and young people in a
world where HIV infection is increasing at an alarming rate," he
added.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 61 miners were killed
in a methane gas explosion today at Zyryanovskaya coal mine in
Novokuznestk, Kemerovo region, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Six miners with burns and other injuries have been treated at a
local hospital, while rescue workers continue to look for the
remaining miners.
</P>
<P>
The explosion reportedly occurred in the early hours today
during the shift change while 130 people were working in the
mine. About 67 miners in coal layer number 14 were involved in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Many of the coal miners in other sections escaped serious
injury, the agency quoted a coal industry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
It could, however, be one of the biggest mining accidents in
Russia in decades, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who is visiting in Stockholm, sent a message of condolence to the
relatives of the coal miners killed and injured in the accident.

<HEADLINE> Defendant: Libya Not Behind 1986 Bombing of Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Defendant Musbah Abulgasem Eter
said today in a Berlin court that Libya was not behind the 1986
bombing of Berlin's La Belle discotheque in which three people
were killed and more than 200 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Revoking alleged confessions, Eter said on the third day of the
trial that he and the four other defendants in the case had not
carried out the attack on the haunt of American military
servicemen, neither had the bombing been backed by the Libyan
embassy in East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Blaming Libya for the incident, the United States had ordered
air strikes in revenge against Tripoli and Benghazi, causing
dozens of deaths including the adopted daughter of Libyan leader
Moamer Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that a senior member of the Libyan secret
service in Tripoli had ordered diplomats in East Berlin to carry
out "an attack that would kill as many U.S. military personnel as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Eter, a 40-year-old Libyan diplomat, said that another group
was responsible for the disco bombing on April 5, 1986, which
comprised two Italians and a Libyan who was later murdered.
</P>
<P>
According to him, defendant Verena Chanaa took a bag with only
a dummy bomb inside to the disco, but the bag was later exchanged
with explosives by the above-mentioned group, a move not approved
by the Libyan embassy.
</P>
<P>
In the trial two Palestinians, Yasser Chraidi, 38, Ali Channa,
38, and Ali's ex-wife Verena, 38, are accused of three counts of
murder, nine counts of attempted murder and one count of causing
an explosion. Eter and Verena's sister Andrea Haeusler, 32, are
charged as their accomplices.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Eter made a detailed statement at the German
embassy in Malta in summer 1996 implicating both his co-defendants
and Libya in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
He was set free after confessing a role in the attack and
helping police solve the case, but he vanished when charges were
preferred and was arrested in Rome in last August.
</P>
<P>
Defending the version he gave in court, Eter said he had not
been correctly understood when questioned by police because of a
bad interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Eter giving his present testimony, presiding judge
Peter Marhofer said Eter might also be guilty of direct
involvement in the bombing, which would make mitigation unlikely.

<HEADLINE> UN to Send Observer Mission to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is expected
to send an observer mission to Sierra Leone, if a report of the
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is approved by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
A report of the News Agency of Nigeria said today that the
drafting of the report is now in progress and is expected to be
completed by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Work on the report started after the return to New York of two
technical teams sent by the secretary-general to explore ground
for deployment of an observer mission to Sierra Leone, the report
quoted a U.N. secretariat source as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general's report is expected to recommend the
form, size and scope of mandate of the proposed observer mission,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which
has been brokering for Sierra Leone's return to peace and
democracy since the May 25 coup, demanded in November that the
U.N. sends an observer mission as a form of support to the peace
effort in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's permanent representative to the
U.N., James Jonah, said the disarmament of the Sierra Leonean
army and its ally, the former rebel group of the Revolutionary
United Front will start on December 4, even though the U.N.
observer mission will not be in place by then.
</P>
<P>
Jonah, who is representing the ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah explained that the disarmament is primarily the
responsibility of the ECOWAS peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG,
according to the Conakry agreement signed between ECOWAS and the
Sierra Leonean junta led by Major Paul Johnny Koromah.
</P>
<P>
Besides the disarmament, the agreement also provided for the
restoration of the Kabbah government, the granting of amnesty to
Koromah and his comrades and the resettlement of refugees and
displaced persons.

<HEADLINE> France to Compensate Jews Robbed by Nazis by Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- France will compensate the Jews
robbed by Nazis during World War II in France by itself through
re-distributing the 2.2 tons of gold expected to be returned to
France by what remains of a wartime Allied commission in charge of
recovering gold from Germany after the war.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States today decided to establish an
international fund to compensate the Jews robbed by Nazi Germany
during the war at the conference on the compensation of the Jews
which is being held in London from today until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 337 tons of gold recovered by the Allied countries from
Germany after the war, only 5.5 tons still remain in the bunks of
an Allied tripartite commission in charge of re-distributing the
robbed gold to countries occupied by Germany.
</P>
<P>
France, Britain and the United States are members of the
commission, which was set up in 1946 and is headquartered in
Brussels. The gold recovered by the Allies is kept in the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the creation of the fund, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said that the remainder of recovered Nazi
gold can be re-distributed to Jews either through the fund in a
multinational way or on a national basis.
</P>
<P>
France claims the right to 2.2 tons of the remaining 5.5 tons
of gold and expects the commission to return them to France within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The French government will then re-distribute these gold to the
families of Nazi victims through the Jewish community in France.
</P>
<P>
A special commission was set up by the former government of
Alain Juppe in February to study how these gold should be returned
to the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
France has not excluded the possibility of contributing to the
international fund for compensating Jews robbed during the war,
while the United States has agreed to contribute 25 million U.S.
dollars and Britain has also agreed to contribute.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Visit to Strengthen Sino-Mexican Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that his current visit to Mexico is intended
to strengthen China-Mexico friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the Mexican Senate, Jiang said he was
here "with the aim of deepening understanding, enhancing
friendship, looking forward to the future and developing
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He said the people of Mexico, home to the ancient Maya-Azteca
civilization, has won world-wide acclaim for its efforts towards
progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang briefed the audience on China's efforts of
reform and opening-up, the resumption of sovereignty over Hong
Kong, and the convening of the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"A more developed China will make greater contributions to the
lofty cause of world peace and development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said Sino-Mexican friendship dates back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Since the 16th century, the Mexican port of Acapulco had
witnessed the frequent visits of merchant ships loaded with
chinaware and silks, opening a magnificent chapter in exchanges
between the two peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China-Mexico commodity trade further developed in the 18th
century and Mexican silver coins flooded in coastal China,
becoming a currency in wide circulation for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Chinese laborers went to Mexico, their number
reaching 30,000 at the start of the 20th century. They contributed
their wisdom and energy to the development of Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
For contemporary China-Mexico relations, Jiang noted the
continuous progress in bilateral exchanges and cooperation in
various fields since the two countries established diplomatic
relations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Mexican lawmakers for their efforts in

peoples but also conducive to peace, stability and development in
the Asia-Pacific and the world at large," he added.

<P>
A number of agreements on bilateral cooperation in consular
affairs, sports, social sciences and economy were also signed
during the visit, consolidating and deepening the friendly
cooperation between the two nations, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> China Values Ties With Latin America, says Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin called today for strengthened cooperation between China and
Latin America, saying that they share responsibilities in
promoting world peace, development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the Mexican Senate, Jiang said, "China
has all along attached importance to the strengthening of friendly
cooperative relations with countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean, including Mexico."
</P>
<P>
"Both China and the Latin American nations are developing
countries," Jiang said. "Long histories, ancient civilizations,
similar development experiences and other common points have
closely linked us together."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that Sino-Latin American economic
and trade cooperation has broader prospects with the wider opening
up of the countries and expanding cooperation in such areas as
science and technology and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, China has established diplomatic relations
with most of the Latin American countries. Friendship between them
has developed continuously with mutual understanding enhanced and
areas of cooperation expanded.
</P>
<P>
These developments, Jiang said, have laid a sound foundation
for even wider cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang came to Mexico on Saturday on a five-day state visit from
Canada, where he attended the fifth informal leaders' meeting of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vancouver and then
paid a four-day state visit.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Cooperation Between Developed, Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today called for closer cooperation between developed
and developing countries and earlier establishment of new
international political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at Mexico's Senate, Jiang said the
cooperation between developed and developing countries should
serve the principle of guaranteeing a fair, equal and
non-discriminatory way for the developing countries to
participate in the decision-making of the world economic operation.
</P>
<P>
The aim of such cooperation is to achieve common development
and prosperity of all the countries in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries should respect and take into account the
interests of the developing countries, and provide necessary
support for developing countries to achieve sustained development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In return, the rapid economic growth in developing countries
will provide developed countries with broader markets and help
them develop sustainably at a higher level, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should view and handle the economic relations between
developing and developed countries from such dialectical and
historic perspective," he noted.
</P>
<P>
With profound changes in the current world, maintaining peace,
seeking cooperation and promoting development have become the
major stream of the times, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
With the growing trend of political and economic
multipolarization in regions and the world at large, the
adjustment of relations among big powers is underway, and the
status and influence of the developing countries are
strengthening, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the old unfair and irrational international political
and economic orders are still infringing upon the interests of the
developing countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the present situation, it is necessary for all the countries
in the world to promote economic cooperation and cultural
exchanges among themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the need of the times to comprehensively strengthen
South-South cooperation, improve South-North relations and
establish a fresh political and economic order in the world, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The 5th APEC informal leaders' meeting has just concluded, he
said, and the growth of APEC has been a good try for developing
and developed countries to promote economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people ardently love peace and long for
development," he said. China attaches great importance to
enhancing unity and cooperation with other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China will as always develop its trade ties, economic and
technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges
with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Mexico Saturday for a five-day official
visit.

<HEADLINE> France Refuses to Back New NATO Integrated Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- France today abstained from a
vote at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on introducing a new
integrated military commanding structure to the alliance, because
it is insufficient for giving more European identity to NATO,
reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
"We cannot associate ourselves with the decisions of approval
for the new structure, in its present state, but we guard not to
make obstacle," AFP quoted French Foreign Minister Alain Richard
as saying during a meeting with his NATO counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new structure fails to reach a new balance in
responsibilities between Europeans and Americans as France wished.
But he also said that France will continue to increase its
military activities within NATO.
</P>
<P>
"France wishes the alliance to pursue its adaptation," said
Richard in reference to a re-examination by NATO of its strategic
concept after the end of the Cold War, and the creation of an
organism in charge for carrying out peace-keeping missions within
the general staff of NATO.

<HEADLINE> UK Disabled People Discriminated Against on Job Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Disabled people in Britain are
discriminated against on the job market and most of them remain
unemployed, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The research by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People
found deafness a bigger obstacle to getting a job than having a
criminal record or a history of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The study said that 77 percent of those interviewed call
blindness a major obstacle and 64 percent say deafness a major
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, having a criminal record scored 61 percent, a
history of drug abuse 60 percent, manic depression 51 percent and
being wheelchair-bound 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The institute's chief executive James Strachan said that the
vast majority of deaf people want to work, but because of a
combination of complacent employers, unsympathetic colleagues and
redundant legislation, they remain unemployed or, at best,
underemployed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Labor government has promised tougher
measures to enforce disabled people's rights and is providing 195
million pounds (331.5 million US dollars) under the
welfare-to-work program for pilot schemes to help sick and
disabled people.

<HEADLINE> Pak Constitutional Crisis Takes New Turn with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The worst ever constitutional
crisis in Pakistan has taken a new twist as President Farooq
Leghari resigned today from his office.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, the eighth president of Pakistan since the country's
independence in August 1947, formally tendered his resignation
this evening after refusing to sign a reference against Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as recommended by the government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who assumed his office four years ago, announced his
decision at a crowded press conference held at the Presidential
House earlier this evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that he received a summary from the government that he
should disqualify the Chief Justice and appoint Justice Ajmal Mian
as acting Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
"The President has no option but to sign such summary. But I
will not exercise that option because I hold certain principles
above self- interest. And therefore I have decided to resign,"
Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of President Leghari came amid a political and
constitutional deadlock which gripped the country a week ago with
Chief Justice Sajjad and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at the center
stage.
</P>
<P>
During the four-month-old crisis, the out-going president
seemed to have been sandwiched between the warring government with
a heavy mandate and an aggressive Chief Justice Sajjad whose
authority was lately challenged by a majority of his own
colleagues on the bench.
</P>
<P>
The nerve-wracking tussle between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and Chief Justice Sajjad reached its climax today when Sajjad
suspended this morning the 13th amendment to the constitution
passed by Parliament in April, which clipped the presidential
power to dismiss an elected government.
</P>
<P>
However, minutes after Sajjad's order, a rival 10-member bench
of the Supreme Court declared his order invalid on the ground that
he has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Hours after Leghari's stepping down, Senate Chairman Wasim
Sajjad this evening assumed the charge of acting president till
the election of Leghari's successor by the two houses of
parliament and four provincial assemblies within 30 days as
provided in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Experts here noted that the next president from the ruling
party would help government get rid of the estranged Chief Justice
who has also lost support of the majority of his colleagues in the
apex court.
</P>
<P>
However, Sajjad's aide made it clear in a telephone interview
that the Chief Justice is not prepared to resign and will attend
the court on Wednesday as usual.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest developments, Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain said "it was a victory of democracy, institutions
and principles of parliamentary sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"The Army played a very positive role in stabilizing the
situation and I feel it is a sign of maturity in Pakistan's
political system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President's resignation has already triggered heavy buying
activity at the Karachi stock market, which has remained under
severe depression during the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The 100-Index of Karachi Stock Exchange closed up 2.04 points
to 1789.22, dealers said.

<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has pledged to
contribute an immediate 4 million U.S. dollars to the
international fund for Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the international conference on Nazi gold opening in
London this morning, U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat
made the announcement of the U.S. contribution.
</P>
<P>
"I want to announce the decision of the United States
government to deposit 4 million dollars in the fund as a
down-payment," Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the total U.S. contribution to the fund
will be increased to 25 million dollars over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who
formally announced the establishment of the international fund to
be based in New York, said that the British government will
contribute 1 million pounds (about 1.7 million dollars) to the
fund.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, representatives from over 40
countries and non-government organizations would focus on where
the Nazi gold came from, what happened to it and what steps taken
to compensate victims.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Foreign Debts Stand at 29.9 b Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's total foreign debts
stood at 29.9 billion U.S. dollars in last June, local daily Salam
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), the
daily said that the figure also included foreign commitments which
were signed with foreign countries but were not implemented so far.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the confirmed foreign debts until June
was 15.836 billion dollars, about 1 billion less than the figure
by March 20, the end of last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the due foreign debts would be 4.902 billion
dollars in the coming Iranian year beginning on March 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's trade, the report said that the
country's total oil and non-oil exports were valued at 22.496
billion dollars and its total imports 14.973 billion dollars in
last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of the current Iranian year, the
country's exports reached 4.861 billion dollars while its imports
were 3.992 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In October, CBI Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh announced that the
bank has paid off 75 percent of its arrears and only 3.6 billion
dollars has remained from Iran's total rescheduled debts which
should be paid next year.
</P>
<P>
Iran was hit by sharp oil price falls in the world markets in
1993 and was forced to reschedule its overdue foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, higher oil prices and stringent
economic measures helped ease the pressure of foreign debt on the
country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Stresses Establishment of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today stressed that an
independent Palestinian state will be established in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after his meeting with visiting
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali in the West Bank city
of Ramallah, Arafat said that he hopes Jerusalem will be the
capital of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also asked Jordan's King Hussein to ensure the
implementation of the Hebron accord signed by PNA and Israel in
January which included three-phased, once-a-half-year Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Arafat said that PNA will declare statehood
in 1999 - if need be unilaterally - at the end of the five-year
interim period of autonomy. His words set off a wave of strong
reaction from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that
if Arafat unilaterally declares a Palestinian state, he will
announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and other
territories in response.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Majali underlined principles of
Jordan's position, which committed Jordan to supporting the
Palestinians and their efforts to build national institutions and
establish their state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the latest developments of the
peace process on the Israeli-Palestinian track and Israel's latest
decision on a conditional troop pull-back from West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Majali stressed that Jordan believed any Israeli withdrawal
from the Palestinian lands should be based on the agreements
previously concluded between the Palestinians and Israel.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Condemned for Laying Landmines Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is condemned by Angola's
joint commission for peace process here today for laying mines
again in areas cleared of mines.
</P>
<P>
David Wimhurst, spokesman for the UN Angola observation group
said that the commission has found nine cases of citizens being
injured by landmines in central Angola's Kuito City.
</P>
<P>
He said that the re-laying of mines would reduce international
community's aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Angola would attend the conference for
total banning of anti-personnel landmines to be held in Ottawa,
capital of Canada on December 6, when more than 120 countries
would have their representatives there.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the countries which has most of the landmines
in the world.
</P>
<P>
UN statistics show that the country has about 10 million mines
scattered on its land.
</P>
<P>
So far, only about 5,000 landmines have been cleared and a lot
more work is required to clear the rest in the ground.

<HEADLINE> SFOR to Stay at Present Force Level Till Next June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) will stay in Bosnia at the current
force level until the end of its peace-keeping mandate, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana said today.
</P>
<P>
But the Western military alliance did not make any decision on
whether and how to maintain a military presence in the former
Yugoslav republic beyond June next year though an initial exchange
of views was made at the NATO defense ministers meeting on the
possibility of a follow-on force to consolidate the peace
implementation process.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council will have to consult non-NATO
contributing countries to the SFOR before the final decision is
taken after the peace implementation conference and the NATO
foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
The peace implementation conference will be held next Monday
and Tuesday while the foreign ministers meeting is slated for the
week after.
</P>
<P>
A number of questions remained to be answered before NATO makes
its decision on its future role in Bosnia, said Solana at a
post-defense ministers meeting press conference.
</P>
<P>
NATO has tasked the North Atlantic Council, the executive body
of the 16-nation alliance, to develop a political-military
guidance for the NATO military authorities to consider a range of
options for a possible follow-on force after the SFOR's mandate.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of defense from the 16 NATO member states reviewed
the 12-month point of the SFOR's mission in Bosnia and all
ministers underscored the outstanding job the SFOR is doing as
Solana put it.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that the SFOR has provided vital support to
key civil implementation activities such as the municipal
elections, the parliamentary elections of the Republika Srpska and
the restructuring of the Bosnian media and police.
</P>
<P>
But the NATO chief said that much more has to be achieved
before peace can be truly self-sustaining in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has planned a phase-out withdrawal of the SFOR troops, now
at 34,000, for the post-election period leading up to next June
when the peace-keeping mission expires.
</P>
<P>
United States Defense Secretary William Cohen said that U.S.
President Bill Clinton made no decision on the U.S. participation
in the post-mandate military presence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has to justify the new mission after considering issues
such as national interest, cost, military morale and how-to, said
Cohen at another press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are in favor of resorting to police forces to
keep Bosnia in order.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense secretary urged the European allies of NATO to
contribute more to training the police force in that the Americans
are making a financial contribution to the International Police
Task Force in Bosnia with a ratio of 5-1, according to Cohen.
</P>
<P>
What in need is a highly efficient and well-trained police
force in Bosnia to avoid a permanent military presence in the
Balkan country, said the U.S. defense secretary.

<HEADLINE> Movement Pushes for Israeli Pullback From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli peace movement
today pressed ahead with its call for a unilateral Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon, where it is bogged down in a brute
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, opposition lawmaker and
former senior minister, Yossi Beilin, who recently formed the
Movement for a Peaceful Departure from Lebanon (MPDL), outlined
his group's plan for Israel's unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The MPDL based its proposal on two principles: Israeli troops
pull back to the internationally border in accordance with
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 and Israel takes necessary
steps to ensure maximal security of its residents along the
northern border.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said his movement proposed a timetable for the
withdrawal from Israel's self-styled security zone in south
Lebanon within six months after proper preparations for better
defense of its northern border are made.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 10-15 kilometer wide strip along the
border to buffer attacks from Islamic militants who vowed to fight
till the end of Israeli occupation of the area. The zone is
patrolled by 1,200 Israeli troops and 3,000 South Lebanon Army
which is trained and armed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said the arrangements include ensuring the well-being of
the South Lebanese Army, which helped Israel combat Hezbollah
guerrillas, after Israel's departure, and setting up electronic
fence, military outposts, minefields and patrol along the border.
</P>
<P>
During the period of troop redeployment, he said, Israel should
make serious efforts to reach agreements and understanding with
Lebanese government, whose troops will be asked to take
responsibility in south Lebanon, according to his plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel must make clear to Syria and Iran, believed
to be the major supporters of the Hezbollah guerrilla force, that
Israel will hold them responsible for any cross-border attack
against Israel after the withdrawal, Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
If attacked from across the border, Israel retains the freedom
to act in any place and with any means, including returning to
south Lebanon, to secure the safety of its northern residents.
</P>
<P>
Islamic resistance forces of Lebanon have been fighting to
drive the Israelis out of the area, where the armed clashes have
caused heavy casualties to Israeli soldiers every year.
</P>
<P>
This fueled heated debates in Israel over the need of getting
out of south Lebanon voluntarily since the so-called security zone
has become a death trap.
</P>
<P>
Beilin contended that with the redeployment, Israel will free
itself from the quagmire in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his movement has gained popular support since
its founding among various sectors of the society. Its 3,400
members include lawmakers from both the ruling coalition and the
opposition, activists of the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of Israeli soldiers has risen to 112 since the
beginning of this year, including 73 killed in a collision of two
transport helicopters near the border.

<HEADLINE> SPD Confident in Taking Over Power After 1998 Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOVER, Germany, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Oskar Lafontaine,
leader of Germany's main opposition Social Democrats (SPD), today
voiced firm confidence about the prospects for his party to win
the 1998 elections after 15 years out of power.
</P>
<P>
"Today we can say we are back: we are the future governing
party of Germany," he said while addressing the three-day SPD
convention beginning today.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, who is the premier of Saar state, was reelected SPD
chairman at the meeting today with 463 "yes" votes out of 499
ballots cast. He became SPD leader two years ago and has been
praised for rebuilding the party's shattered unity.
</P>
<P>
The SPD lost the last four elections to Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who is seeking a
consecutive fifth term.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that the SPD, in a leftist coalition with
the environmentalist Greens Party, could defeat Kohl's
center-right government if a vote were held currently.
</P>
<P>
However, the SPD has not yet decided on its candidate for the
September 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine, badly beaten by Kohl in 1990, wants another chance
while Gerhard Schroeder, SPD premier of Lower Saxony state, is
also seeking the candidacy.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed to ban all discussion on the issue until after
Lower Saxony state elections next March. Schroeder has said he
will give up if he loses more than 2 percent of support in the
state election.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is more popular outside the SPD and known for his
more conservative, pro-industry views, while Lafontaine is a
traditional supporter of Germany's elaborate social welfare state.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine criticized in his speech today the Kohl government's
reform efforts to reduce sick-pay and loosen restrictions on
companies' dismissing employees.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile reiterated the SPD support for the strengthened
role of the European Union in reducing the record 20 million
unemployment in EU countries. He added that the SPD wanted to cut
short working week hours in order to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder is scheduled to address the SPD convention Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Arafat Against Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel today warned that
Palestinian declaration of independence will lead to Israeli
unilateral steps to annex part of the occupied territories in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
If Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares an
independent Palestinian state, Israel will announce annexation of
the Jordan Valley and other territories, said Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a talk with coalition partner
Tsomet lawmaker Eliezer Zanberg Monday night, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he will not act to annex Jordan Valley now
for fear of violating the signed agreements, which call for the
settlement of the final status of the occupied territories through
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel will not freeze the construction of
settlements, because settlements "are proper and legitimate" even
according to the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told
reporters today that Israel has the capability to take unilateral
steps if Arafat declares an independent state.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to elaborate measures Israel might take in case
of a Palestinian declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis were responding Arafat's remarks that if Israel
fails to honor its commitments to the Oslo accords, an independent
Palestinian state will be declared by the end of the process in
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Israeli threats, Arafat said today at a joint news
conference with visiting Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali that a Palestinian state already exists, and what he hopes
only is that its capital will be Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russian Defense Chiefs Meet on Further Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense ministers today
met their Russian counterpart at the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council meeting to pledge their further commitment toward military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was the first formal meeting after the NATO-Russia Founding
Act was signed on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers discussed the development in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, military-to-military cooperation and nuclear
transparency in an effort to bring concrete substance to their
commitment to build a lasting peace in the Euro-Atlantic area.
</P>
<P>
One NATO source said that the Western military alliance
considered it good news that Russia was satisfied with the
peacekeeping operations so far in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers welcomed close working relations that
have been developed between NATO and Russia for the implementation
of the military aspects of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to draw on the practical experience gained from
Bosnia in pursuing their commitment to consultation and
cooperation in the field of crisis management and conflict
prevention in the future.
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction was shown at the meeting, according to the same
source who preferred to remain anonymous, for the steps that have
been taken to implement the 1997 NATO-Russia work program such as
the beginning of practical work in the newly established joint
working groups on peacekeeping and civil emergency planning and
disaster relief.

<HEADLINE> IOC Sticks to Sex Test for Women Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The random sex test for women
athletes will be carried forward by the International Olympic
Committee despite waves of calls to scrape the current gender
testing, authorities reaffirmed in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The IOC officials fear that it will be impossible to hold
separate events for men and women in the future if the sex of an
athlete is not tested strictly.
</P>
<P>
IOC medical chief Prince Alexandre de Merode reaffirmed on
Wednesday that Olympic chiefs were not ready to change their minds
on the controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to change. The majority of people in the IOC
want it to stay," de Merode said after an IOC meeting here.
</P>
<P>
However, IOC doping expert Arne Ljungqvist recommended to end
the chromosome test for all female athletes since the 1968 Mexico
City Olympics because it has been outdated by rapid advances in
genetics.
</P>
<P>
Ljungqvist, a senior member of the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF), said the test is not useful because
there are men with chromosomes like women and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
He said the IAAF abandoned gender testing in 1992, followed
suit by the Commonwealth and World University Games, and only five
of 34 Olympic federations still conducted gender tests at their
own world championships.
</P>
<P>
IOC officials said the debate has come about because of the
major legal problems in Norway in forcing women to take sex tests.
</P>
<P>
Currently, testers analyse cells scraped from the inside of the
cheek to determine the sex of an athlete.
</P>
<P>
About one in 400 females in Atlanta tested male but all were
cleared by subsequent physical examinations.
</P>
<P>
However, physical examinations will cause problems with an
invasion of privacy in such routine examinations.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Upholds Ruling on Oil Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
today upheld its earlier decision to nullify the country's
nine-month oil deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
In the court's resolution, the motions filed by the Office of
the Solicitor General and five oil firms for reconsideration of
the court original ruling were denied for lack of merit.
</P>
<P>
The court struck down the law as unconstitutional again, saying
some of its provisions violated the constitutional prohibition of
monopolies and unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
The court said it is its "unyielding duty to uphold the
supremacy of the constitution, which provides a shield to the
economic rights of the Filipino people especially the poor."
</P>
<P>
With this finality, the oil industry will now go back to
government control after about nine months of free market play.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil deregulation law, which ended 20 years of
government control of the oil industry, the government withdrew
its huge subsidy to the industry and the country's three main oil
firms can adjust oil prices freely.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling has generated widespread concerns among the
government and the business community, which feared it could
worsen the country's already-gloomy economic situation and scare
away investors.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has urged the Congress to pass a new oil
deregulation law to strengthen investors' confidence in the
country's economy.

opposition Social Democrats (SPD) today proposed that Bonn should
establish stand-by troops aimed at taking part in United Nations
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The SPD approved the German participation in UN peacekeeping
operations at a three-day party convention that opened Tuesday in
Hanover.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution the SPD confirmed UN blue helmet missions under
certain conditions as "a successful instrument to secure peace
either prior to or after hostilities."
</P>
<P>
It meanwhile suggested a reduction in the 340,000-strong German
armed forces, the Bundeswehr. Without specifying the cuts, it
rejected a proposal to reduce the Bundeswehr to 150,000.
</P>
<P>
The SPD also warned that the Western military alliance North
Atlantic Treaty Organization should not become a global
intervention instrument.
</P>
<P>
Except for defense of the its 16 member nations, NATO must not
be allowed to involve in any operations without approval from the
UN or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The SPD also urged the United States to give Europe a bigger
say in the NATO command structure.
</P>
<P>
Expressing support for the NATO eastward expansion, the SPD
however stressed its opposition to any upgrading of the armed
forces in former East Bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
It views the NATO enlargement as an opportunity to reduce the
conventional forces in Europe, according to the resolution.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspection Continues in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. arms inspection in
Iraq entered its 12th consecutive day today since the weapons
experts were allowed to return and resume work in Baghdad late
last month. No incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency, 11 inspection
teams of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, today set out for declared and
sudden visits to Iraqi industrial, trade and scientific sites.
</P>
<P>
Hussan Mohammed Ameen, director general of Iraqi National
Monitoring Department, the Iraqi counterpart of UNSCOM, said the
Iraqis have been very cooperative, with no delays or problems
reported.
</P>
<P>
Two groups were helicoptered to inspect suspected weapons
sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq's "credibility and cooperation" lay bare the
"false U.S. allegations which aim to maintain the embargo on Iraqi
people and represent a deliberate flagrant violation of human
rights."
</P>
<P>
On October 29, Baghdad threatened to expel American inspectors
on the UNSCOM team on charges of spying and hindering the lifting
of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions against Iraq, setting off an
Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Since returning to Baghdad on November 21, U.N. arms inspectors
have steered clear of "sensitive" areas - presidential palaces
which the Iraqis say are signs of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Head of UNSCOM, Richard Butler, will visit Baghdad at the end
of this week in a bid to persuade Iraq to allow inspectors into
those "off-limits" sites.

<HEADLINE> Official Language Unpopular in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The official language of Ukraine,
which is Ukrainian, remains unpopular in many areas despite
efforts by the government to encourage its use, the Ukrainian News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian language is more widespread than the official
language in the areas of science, technology, business and
sports," the report quoted Deputy Prime Minister Valeri Smoly as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Smoly added that some government organs tended to ignore the
Ukrainian language instead of using it. He referred to the
parliament of the Crimean Republic which recently adopted a law
declaring Russian the official and business language in the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Russian, regarded as a minority language in Ukraine, is the
most common tongue in both everyday life and the scientific
community. Even Ukrainian President Lenoid Kuchma is reported to
be much more fluent in Russian than in Ukrainian.
</P>
<P>
"All the Ukrainian residents are brought up with poems by
Pushkin, but it has suddenly become foreign literature," said
Vasyl Minolovich, a teacher in a Kiev driving school. "It's
extremely ridiculous and sad if you think about it."

<HEADLINE> Afghan Women Ask Return of Legitimate Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan women, who have
endured tremendous hardships, demand restoration of their
legitimate rights, head of the Afghan Women Organization Khadija
Balkhi said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on Afghan peace in Iran's central city
of Isfahan, Balkhi said "The Muslim women of Afghanistan only seek
to restore their legitimate, civil rights and have no ambitions
for government posts."
</P>
<P>
According to the official new agency IRNA, the three-day
conference opened Monday were attended by hundreds of famous
political, religious and military figures of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the continued bloodshed in the war-torn country,
Balkhi said "the people seeking to strip the Afghan women of
their legitimate rights are opposed to the prevalence of Islamic
rule in the society."
</P>
<P>
She called on leaders of Afghan factions to cease hostilities
and think about the fate and miseries of homeless Afghans.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, exiled Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani told
the conference that a comprehensive peace in Afghanistan could be
achieved only through the help by all countries, specially Muslim
states, as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
All individuals and groups in Afghanistan, even the Taliban
which fought into Kabul and seized power more than a year ago,
should participate in the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the anti-Taliban United Front has no opposition to
peace and at the same time does not insist on monopolizing power
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said that any decision reached through negotiations
would be acceptable to the United Front, but any attempt to
disintegrate the country would face defeat.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support to the proposal for holding a peace
conference on Afghanistan, hoping that all the groups would
participate in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference today, head of the Afghan National
Understanding Council Pir Seyed Gilani called for identification
and trial of war criminals in Afghanistan by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Gilani said he supports the proposal to form a fund by the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) in order to help the
Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
He said the aid collected at the OIC summit should be offered
to the U.N. bureau in Afghanistan as well as the Afghan refugee
camps based in Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran's representative to the meeting Alaeddin Boroujerdi on
Tuesday blasted the Taliban for its absence in the Isfahan
conference, saying this indicated that the group was not for peace
and stability in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Stresses Cooperation with CIS States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that Russia attaches great importance to
integrational cooperation among the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Broad integrational cooperation with member countries of the
CIS has been and remains the top priority of Russian policy, said
Chernomyrdin at a meeting of the coordination council of
power-wielding structures in CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin noted that this cooperation is based on similar
and various interests in economic and social development, national
security and international activity.
</P>
<P>
Russia is making efforts to ensure that integration in the
Commonwealth framework becomes part and parcel of the entire
system of economic management, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has prepared a decree "on
Russia's urgent action to step up and deepen integrational
processes in the CIS," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government is preparing proposals and measures
relating to all aspects of an economic integrational policy.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include the coordination of structural and market
transformations, the stepping up of interstate coordination of
foreign economic activity, and perfection of balance and payment
relations, as well as the settlement of problems of debt and
harmonization of the tax policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin indicated that the CIS summit on January 23, 1998,
"Will be a milestone in the Commonwealth development."
</P>
<P>
Russia will concentrate on creating free-trade zones in the
territories of CIS member-countries and on the development and
strengthening of the Customs Union, Chernomyrdin said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily" will carry an
editorial tomorrow to congratulate on the Congresses of
Non-Communist Parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the meetings were held at a time when
the nation is studying and implementing the guidelines of the 15th
National Party Congress, half a century after the multi-party
co-operative system under the CPC leadership was established.
</P>
<P>
China has eight non-Communist Parties: The Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League,
the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China
Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and
Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiu San
Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.
</P>
<P>
This is the last national congress of these Parties and the
federation this century, it says. They worked out guidelines, set
goals, approved constitutions, elected new leaders, all of which
will be significant for developing the patriotic united front.
</P>
<P>
The meetings benefitted long-term co-operation with the CPC and
helped the country improve multi-party co-operation under CPC
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The editorial goes on to say that China's central task now and
in the coming years is to unite people with the guidelines of the
15th Party Congress and to reach goals set by the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Non-Communist parties and All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce have studied the guidelines and their work will help
the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
These parties and the organization will get their members to
study Deng Xiaoping Theory conscientiously, participate in and
discuss government and political affairs, and get involved in
democratic supervisory work, says the article. In this way, it
adds, they will make a greater contribution to rejuvenating and
reunifying China.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, today passed in the first reading a draft
resolution on amnesty for 435,000 prisoners, including 35,000
serving sentences in detention facilities, according to the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Duma is to vote on the resolution in three hearings. The
document does not require voting in the Federation Council. It
takes effect on the day it is made public.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, those eligible for amnesty are people of
pension age, mothers of young children, pregnant women and
patients with tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said on Tuesday that the amnesty
is not applicable to persons convicted for murder, rape, bandit
attacks and other heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, president Boris Yeltsin sent a letter to the
Duma explaining that the amnesty was needed "not only for
considerations of humaneness," but because of extremely scarce
budget donations to Russian jails.

It says that the Non-Communist parties and the Federation have
chosen the correct path over the past half century and subjected
themselves under the leadership of the CPC, keeping to Marxism,
Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, and have
followed the socialist road with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
They will be able to move along the road of multi-party
co-operation and political consultations under the leadership of
the CPC by learning from their experiences.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the leaders elected at the congress
will have a historical responsibility and need to study the style
of the previous generation of leaders to continue the tradition
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party co-operation and political consultation are the
country's basic political system and an important part of the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As long
as this system is continued and improved, the CPC leadership will
improve, socialist democratic politics will be consolidated, and
the cross-century goals will be reached.
</P>
<P>
The article calls for further improvements in the system and in
political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation
in and discussion of political affairs.
</P>
<P>
The non-Communist parties and the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce, and persons with no party affiliation must
be allowed to play a role in state political and social affairs,
and to do their job independently in accordance with the
Constitution and their own constitutions, it says, so co-operation
between the CPC and non-Party personnel will further increase and
relations will become even closer.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Real GDP Grows 0.8 Percent in July-September Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's seasonally adjusted gross
domestic product (GDP) grew 0.8 percent in the July-September
period from the previous quarter, an annualized rate of 3.1
percent, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The GDP for the April-June period shrank at a revised annual
rate of 10.6 percent, the biggest contraction rate in 23 years,
because of a decline in personal spending following the
consumption tax hike from 3 to 5 percent on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Japan's July-September GDP totaled an annualized 483,209.6
billion yen (about 3.766 trillion U.S. dollars) after adjustment
for inflation and seasonal factors, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand pushed up Japan's GDP for the period by 0.9
percentage point as the negative impact of the consumption tax
hike faded, while external demand reduced GDP growth by a negative
0.1 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Among GDP components, personal consumption, which accounts for
about 60 percent of the GDP aggregate, rose 1.6 percent in the
period from the previous quarter, the EPA said, adding that
corporate capital spending, another engine of the economy, also
marked a 1.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment declined 10.5 percent from the previous
quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly fall, but public
investment posted a 1.3 percent rise, following a 0.5 percent
increase in the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The GDP deflator, the key inflation gauge, rose 0.9 percent,
following a 0.7 percent increase in the previous period, the EPA
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the report, Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka said that he finally sees a "bright sign" for the future
course of the economy through the 0.8 percent growth in GDP.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is an indication of economic recovery, but the
government will keep a close watch on the economy, Mitsuzuka said.
</P>
<P>
Private-sector analysts, however, said the data indicates that the
economy has entered a recessional phase, noting the recovery in
personal consumption is still sluggish.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Leghari's Exit, High Cost for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The worst ever constitutional
crisis in the history of Pakistan has taken a new turn when Farooq
Leghari stepped down from the presidency Tuesday with almost one
year of his five-year term still to go.
</P>
<P>
It is by no means an unexpected development to many of those
who were following closely the political crisis that an epic
tussle between the executive and the judiciary has finally taken
its toll in the resignation of Leghari as head of the state and
actual exit of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
It may well be seen as a high cost for a solution of the
constitutional crisis which has been gripping this South Asian
nation for almost four months.
</P>
<P>
The day of December 2, 1997 attracted worldwide attention as
the four-month-old nerve-wracking constitutional crisis reached
its climax.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty in the political landscape of Pakistan was
created Tuesday morning by the issuance of two cause lists by the
two opposing groups in the country's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
A three-member bench led by Chief Justice Sajjad suspended the
13th Amendment to the Constitution which was passed by the two
Houses of Parliament in April this year to deprive the president
of the powers to dissolve the National Assembly and to dismiss the
government.
</P>
<P>
As a counterattack, a rival 10-member bench of the apex court
issued an order a few minutes later that the ruling by the
three-member bench was invalid on the ground that the appointment
of the chief justice had already been suspended by the Quetta and
Peshawar benches of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented high drama in a divided apex court made the
already chaotic political situation more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Speculations and rumors like the dissolvement of the National
Assembly and impeachment of the president were being spread in the
capital city. Although people here had been caught in an agonizing
game of guessing as what was going to happen, every one was
certain, however, that the situation in the country was not to the
benefit of any one.
</P>
<P>
Farooq Leghari said at a press conference late Tuesday
afternoon that the whole crisis was "self-created", "unnecessary"
and "hurtful" to the country.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, the eighth president who formally tendered his
resignation since the inception of Pakistan half a century a go,
believed that the political crisis could have been avoided had the
government listened to his advises during the whole process.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Leghari, who assumed his presidency in
November 1993, had been sandwiched between the warring government
with a heavy mandate and an aggressive chief justice whose
authority has been challenged by a majority of his own colleagues
in the court.
</P>
<P>
The immediate reason for Leghari's resignation seems to be a
government demand that he sign a notice which would have
discharged Chief Justice Shah and replaced him by most senior
judge of the apex court Ajmal Mian.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here are of the view that the actual reason
for Leghari's exit is more than that. The resignation of the
president itself indicated the depth of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Now, Pakistan has again an acting president and at the same
time an acting Chief Justice -- a scenario which is nothing new to
the Pakistani people who have experienced ups and downs in the
country's politics during the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
It may be said that Leghari's exit came as a big relief to the
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is facing charges
on the Contempt of Court.
</P>
<P>
However, it would be premature to believe that the
constitutional crisis is over as the loss done to the country's
economy and the judiciary cannot be restored in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Administrative Reform Panel Unveils Final Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's
administrative reform panel today released a final report of
recommendations for streamlining the country's bureaucracy that
skirted crucial reforms of the Finance Ministry under pressure
from the ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
The report, drawn up by the Administrative Reform Council
headed by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, centers on
reorganization of government ministries and agencies to build a
"more simple, efficient and transparent" government.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting an agreement by Japan's ruling parties to postpone a
decision on the issue of whether to strip the Finance Ministry of
its money market-related functions, the report made no reference
to specific functions of a reorganized Treasury Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The final report laid out a rough blueprint of a new
administrative system for the next century under which Japan's
current 22 government ministries and agencies will be reorganized
into 13.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to start preparations for the
reorganization after the cabinet gives the green light to the
proposal at a special session Thursday morning, Sadatoshi Ozato,
head of the Management and Coordination Agency and acting chairman
of the panel, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The government will decide on fundamental principles of
administrative reform by the end of this year and submit a bill to
the Diet (parliament) around mid-March next year with a view to
launching the new system in January 2001, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business leaders welcomed the report, saying it is
significant as it presents measures to enhance the power of the
prime minister and the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Pele Predicts Brazil to Win Fifth World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Soccer legend Pele predicted on
Wednesday that Brazil will win its fifth World Cup although the
European teams will dominate the finals next year.
</P>
<P>
"I can see Germany, France, Spain, Italy and perhaps England
contending the semi-final places along with Brazil," said Pele.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, Pele won the first of his three World Cups as a
17-year-old when Brazil became the only country to win the
tournament outside its own continent.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the eight quarter-finalists in 1994 were the European
sides, but Brazil eventually took the unprecedented fourth title.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Germany nor Italy are playing well now but they always
seem to get it right on the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Brazil, its biggest problem was the fact it has only played
friendly matches since its victory in the United States, apart
from the 1996 Copa America.
</P>
<P>
Besides, coach Mario Zagallo, who played alongwith Pele in the
1958 and 1962 World Cups, has not decided on his defence and
midfield, said Pele.
</P>
<P>
In his view, South Africa and Yugoslavia could spring a
surprise in the World Cup, saying "I just have the feeling South
Africa could do a Cameroon."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Roger Milla led Cameroon to a marvellous quarter-final
defeat against England.

<HEADLINE> China's Water Conservation Policy And The National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Industrial Policy on
the Water Conservancy Sector, formulated by the Ministry of Water
Resources and State Planning Commission, is intended to reduce the
gap between supply and demand, make better use of water resources,
and increase the flood controls.
</P>
<P>
According to a press conference on the policy held by the State
Planning Commission today, in recent years, frequent floods have
caused enormous losses, half of China's cities face fresh water
shortages, and there are serious water pollution problems in many
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The policy has three aims: one is to determine the water
conservation projects and increase funds resources; a second is
setting water charges to make them more reasonable; and a third is
getting people to conserve fresh water and protect water resources.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation is important for basic industries and the
nation's economy, and the country needs to make better use of
water resources and put more investment into water conservation
projects.
</P>
<P>
These are divided into Type-A that have social beneficial
results and include water control, irrigation, and drainage
projects and get funding from the central and local governments,
and Type-B, with economic benefits, involving water supply,
hydro-electric, and reservoir projects, which use non-government
financing from enterprises that are responsible for their
operation.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Condemns Rise in Kidnapping in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today said the current rise of kidnap-for-ransom cases in the
country is "deplorable and condemnable".
</P>
<P>
"The current rise of kidnap-for-ransom cases, including the
last ones where the victims themselves were killed, is really
deplorable. It is condemnable in terms of the actions of the
perpetrators of these dastardly acts," Ramos said in his weekly
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos ordered Philippine National Police Director
General Recaredo Sarmiento to submit a progress report on the
police's anti-crime campaign in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
He also summoned law enforcement agencies to "return to the
basics" of crime-fighting to "neutralize" lawless elements and tap
the community to the utmost to fight against kidnapping gangs and
other criminal syndicates.
</P>
<P>
"The community is not to be blamed here. It is the officials,
the authorities that must work extra hard, because they are
responsible at bottom line in strengthening the community
network," Ramos added.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' remarks came after five Chinese-Filipino residents were
kidnapped Tuesday in the northern Philippines amid the mounting
protest from the Chinese community against the government's
failure to curb the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Chinese-Filipinos Tuesday attended the funeral
protest march of the 25-year-old Gordon Tan, who was killed when
resisting his kidnappers on November 24. Chinese shops and schools
were also closed in parts of Manila in protest.
</P>
<P>
Police statistics showed that in the first 10 months of this
year, there were 124 cases of kidnapping for ransom involving 193
victims nationwide, mostly wealthy Filipino-Chinese businessmen.

NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua)-- The Union Cabinet of the
United Front (UF) government decided to recommend dissolution of
Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) in its meeting here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Indrajit Gupta is expected to carry the cabinet
decision to President K.R. Narayanan later this evening.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra told newsmen after the
cabinet meeting that the decision to recommend dissolution was
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
A last-ditch effort for a compromise between the UF and
Congress by keeping the Dravida Kunnetra Kazhagam (DMK), one of
the UF constituents, failed with the Front leadership ruling out
such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
The Congress insisted on demanding removal of the DMK from the
UF government for its indictment in the Jain Commission interim
report on former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The Gujral government did not recommend dissolution of the
Lower House when it tendered its resignation following the
withdrawal of support to it by the Congress on November 28.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Struggling Sports Lisbon signed
a two-year contract with Vicente Cantatore, former Chilean
national coach, the Portuguese club said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Argentinian-born coach will take over Sporting on Monday,
that has been without a coach for a month when Octavio Machado
quit on November 2 after a sad opening in the Portuguese first
division.
</P>
<P>
The club lost to lowly Leca last weekend with a record of four
wins, five draws and two losses and slid to fifth on the table.
</P>
<P>
It has also been kicked out of the quarterfinals of the
European Championships League after its defeat of 3-2 by Monaca
last week.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old Cantatore, who coached Chilean national soccer
team in 1979-80, made Cobreola Chile's double title-holder before
he led Spanish club Valladolid to a UEFA Cup place.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economy Gathers Pace in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy picked
up a fair bit of momentum in the third quarter while still
managing to keep a lid on inflation, according to data posted
today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
</P>
<P>
Economists said lifts in private sector expenditure and
dwelling construction had helped support an expansion in the real
average measure of gross domestic product, or GDP, of 1.5 percent
in the quarter and 3.6 percent over the year to September.
</P>
<P>
The outcome was above the median market forecast of a rise of
1.1 percent in the quarter and 3.4 percent over the year, and the
strongest in the series since September quarter 1995.
</P>
<P>
As well, the June quarter GDP result was revised upwards to 1.4
percent, compared to 1.2 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said also that the implicit price deflator for GDP,
which is a broad indicator of price pressures, fell 0.1 percent in
the quarter -- its first fall since June 1994. Over the year it
was up 1.7 percent, almost mirroring the underlying inflation
measure monitored by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
But a shadow remains over the outlook for the economy into
1998, with a fall back in growth in Asian economies certain to
have a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
"As we go into 1998 we don't think it will be all smooth
sailing and that momentum will be interrupted, firstly, by the
Asian impact and, secondly, by still subdued employment growth,"
said senior economist Peter Osborne.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in private consumption we saw in quarter three will
not be sustained unless we see a clear pick-up in employment from
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Bank economist Nigel Stapledon said that today's data
in any case support a no-change monetary policy stance by the
Reserve Bank of Australia. The central bank has remained quiet on
policy since it cut the cash rate to 5.0 percent in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
But Stapledon held that a rate cut in 1998 could not be ruled
out completely.

<HEADLINE> 4 Soldiers Killed in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Military sources in the
diamond-rich Kono District in the eastern Sierra Leone claimed
that Kamajor militiamen launched an ambush Tuesday in which four
soldiers and a 24-year woman, Nester Lewis died.
</P>
<P>
Kamajor casualty was not reported in the shoot out. Kamajors
are militiamen which backed president T. Kabbah whose civilian
government was toppled in a May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
And west African countries last month signed a Conakry peace
agreement with the military junta in which the latter promised to
restore the Kabbah regime next April and start disarming all
forces beginning in December in the country in exchange for an
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, fighting took place when a convoy of
a member of the military government's Supreme Council of State,
George Adams was ambushed along the strategic Kono-Tongo highway.
</P>
<P>
A Kamajor detachment allegedly opened automatic fire on the
three vehicles and many of the passengers abandoned the cars and
fled into the bush. Adams walked some 12 miles to safety.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors combed the area after the attack and rounded up
four soldiers and reportedly asked for diamonds, resulting in
killing the four soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown today, the military government accused Kamajors of
killing at random during the ambush, saying, "it violates the
Conakry peace plan which called for an immediate cessation of
hostilities by all sides in the Sierra Leone conflict."
</P>
<P>
However, the Kamajor high command in Kenema today denied it
had anything to do with the recent spate of bloody attacks and
ambushes in the southeastern region of the country.
</P>
<P>
At least some 50 civilians and 20 soldiers have died in recent
clashes in which the military claimed that over 90 Kamajors have
also lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Yet a Kamajor spokesman told Xinhua, "we are only defending
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Some people say the military junta has tried to use the ambush
and other clashes with Kamajors as an excuse to refuse to be
disarmed in accordance with the Conakry agreement.

<HEADLINE> Meeting: Israel Biggest Threat to Islamic World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic countries regard
Israel as the biggest threat to the Islamic world due to its
aggressive policies, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Zarif said here today.
</P>
<P>
As spokesman for the eighth summit of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held here December 9-11, Zarif told
reporters that the on-going OIC experts meeting reached the
conclusion that Israel poses the biggest threat to the Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
Zarif said that the issue of Middle East peace process was one
of the hot topics discussed by experts, and participants of the
meeting believed that the Middle East crisis could be resolved
only through the full restoration of the rights of the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
"This is the stance taken by the Islamic Republic of Iran," he
said, adding that the Middle East peace process would remain
deadlocked if the problems of the Palestinian people are unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that the Palestinian people should have the
right to determine their own fate, terming the repatriation of
the Palestinian refugees to their hometowns, the return of the
occupied land including Jerusalem, southern Lebanon and the Syrian
Golan heights as the main topics of the Middle East peace
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the consideration of the current situation in the Middle
East, Zarif said, the Islamic countries called for a lasting peace
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
About the works of the OIC experts meeting, Zarif said that so
far the participants have reached agreements on the agendas for
the meeting of OIC foreign ministers and the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
About 30 draft resolutions were adopted so far, he said,
mainly on the issues of Cyprus, Kashmir, Bosnia-herzegovina,
rights of children in Islamic countries, rights of women and
supports for the Muslim minorities in non-Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the crisis in Afghanistan, Zarif said that the
OIC experts meeting reiterated to recognize the government of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani as the sole legal government in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Pakistan have jointly raised a proposal
for the OIC summit and the United Nations also proposed a
recommendation for cooperation of Afghanistan's neighboring
countries to restore peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
About the issue of Bosnia-herzegovina, Zarif said that the
most important issue in the view of the OIC members was the
implementation of all resolutions concerning the establishment of
peace and stability in the Balkan region.

<HEADLINE> Chairwoman of Chinese Kuomintang Speaks about Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- He Luli, chairwoman of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said
recently in Beijing that she will try her best to work for a
prosperous and reunified China.
</P>
<P>
He Luli has been involved in politics for 13 years and is a
vice-chairwoman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). At the recent Ninth
RCCK National Congress, she was re-elected chairwoman of the RCCK,
which was formed in 1948.
</P>
<P>
When she was young she wanted to be a doctor and studied at
Beijing Medical University and still has quite strong feelings
about her old profession. But, like many other people in the past,
she complied with the demands of the country and was elected
deputy head of the Xicheng District of Beijing in 1984, and after
1988, was elected vice-mayor of Beijing Municipality twice.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I'd prefer to be a paediatrician if I had the choice
again," she told Xinhua in a recent interview, because the
profession had taught her a sense of responsibility, but her
pragmatic work style and political achievements won her the praise
of Beijing's citizens.
</P>
<P>
She was born into a Sino-French family and speaks both English
and French. Her father, He Siyuan, studied in the United States,
Germany and France, and was mayor of Beiping (Beijing) under
Kuomintang rule. Her mother is French.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of
all the Chinese, including the Taiwan compatriots, and a wish of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great forerunner of the Chinese democratic
revolution, she said, expressing the hope that far-sighted
Kuomintang members in Taiwan will adhere to Sun's unfulfilled wish
and make a contribution to the reunification.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Travel Trade Representatives Invited to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 representatives of
the travel trade from 22 countries today were warmly welcomed by
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
The group is on a five-day rediscovery program, Hong Kong
Salutes the World, organized by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
as an advertising campaign for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the guests at a reception held at Government House,
Tung noted that Hong Kong is a unique travel destination for
visitors.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong entered a new era on July 1 this year, we are
building a Hong Kong that will be even more prosperous and
vibrant," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will ensure that Hong Kong's tourism
industry is supported by adequate infrastructure and facility, he
said.
</P>
<P>
An example is the plan to set up a 100-million-HK-dollar (12.8
million U.S. dollar) International Event Fund next year,
strengthening Hong Kong's status as the event capital of Asia.
The fund will support the staging of 50 international events in
Hong Kong in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also working closely with the tourism promotion
authorities in South China and other cities to enhance Hong Kong's
position as the gateway to the many attractions in the inland
areas, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the downturn in the local tourism sector, the HKTA
and link industries have made concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Cathay Pacific, a leading airlines company in Hong
Kong, offered special air fares for foreign tourists coming to
Hong Kong. The promotional package, joined by local hotels,
restaurants and retailers, received enthusiastic response across
the world.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Expects Bumper Cocoa Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cocoa growers in Ghana, one of
the world's leading cocoa producing countries, are looking
forward to a bumper harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
They say the weather is favorable for the 1997-98
(October-September) crop, forecast to reach between 350,000 and
400,000 tons, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
"There has been enough rain and after the rain the weather has
been glorious in terms of drying," one village chief in Ghana's
key western district on the border with Cote d'Ivoire was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"For all the problems, this year's harvest will be better than
last year," he said, referring to delays in cocoa payments and
higher pesticide costs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast Ghana's
1997-98 crop at 350,000 tons after 324,000 tons in the previous
season. Local buyers have said the total could be as high as
400,000 tons, closer to the 1995-96 level.
</P>
<P>
The report also attributed the good harvest to the renewed
enthusiasm of farmers who were given a boost by Ghana's decision
to raise its cocoa price by 50 percent for this year to 1.8
million cedis a ton, making farm maintenance more worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
But farmers at western district continued to complain of
financial problems after the government doubled the price of
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
They also complain of being paid up to 10 weeks late by buying
companies.

<HEADLINE> China To Salvage Warship Sunk During Anti-Japanese War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua)-- China plans to raise a warship
sunk by the Japanese navy just over a hundred years ago in the
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
The "Zhiyuan" was found in waters off Liaoning Province along
with three other warships, and salvage plans are being worked
out. It was involved in a fight against invading Japanese warships
in 1894 and was sunk by torpedoes as it headed for a Japanese
warship in a suicidal dash after it had run out of ammunition. The
captain and 700 sailors died in the battle.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 is regarded as an
humiliating event for China because it was defeated by Japan and
also forced to accept a series of unequal treaties and to pay
large amounts of reparation.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, curator of the Chinese History Museum, views the
salvage work as significant because the ship is historic evidence
of the Japanese invasion and of the weak and corrupt government of
the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xushang, a former deputy commander of the Chinese navy
who is in charge of the salvage operation, said the salvage and
the accompanying memorial to be built can give a sense of
patriotism.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Union Launches Nation-Wide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Trade Union started
this morning an open-ended general strike in protest against
government plans for wages reform and privatization, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some 700,000 workers took part in the
strike, which paralyzed large sectors of national economy. Most of
government offices and companies were shut down as well as offices
of municipalities and local authorities. Hospitals, the
telecommunications sector, banks, post offices and other services
were also affected.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in a Trade Union battle against
government economic reform plans, which have sparked fears that
worker's rights would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 clerks and municipal workers launched a two-day
strike on last Sunday against cost-cutting measures taken by local
authorities and they resumed work only after the National Labor
Court issued a back-to-work order.
</P>
<P>
Today's strike was trigged by the words of Israeli Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman on Monday describing the striking workers
as "exploding bombs" and enemies from within.
</P>
<P>
In response to Neeman's assault, Trade Union Chairman Amir
Peretz Tuesday declared the strike at an emergency gathering of
thousands of union members in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman has called for a resolution for
the dispute between the Treasury and the Trade Union in order to
"prevent the collapse of the economy and services." Israeli
Manufacture Association estimated the damage from today's strike
at 53 million shekels (about 15 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a parallel development, the National Labor Court is
considering the government's request to issue back-to-work order
to the striking unions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drops Again on Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today
continued its downward spiral to hit a new four-year low, with
anxiety over the Asian currency crisis swamping
stronger-than-expected national accounts data.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed the session at 67.52 U.S. cents from
67.83 U.S. cents locally late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Intra-day it fell to 67.35 U.S. cents, the lowest level since
December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The local currency had strengthened mid-session to its high of
68 U.S. cents following the release of GDP figures by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Australian real gross domestic production on an average basis,
GDP(A), rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 percent in the September
quarter, making an increase of 3.6 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The result was better than market expectations of an increase
in GDP of about 1.1 percent, which would have brought the annual
growth rate up to about 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange manager Peter Whitley said
there had been heavy selling of the major Southeast Asian
currencies again today.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the better-than-expected GDP numbers, Australia
continues to be caught up in the Asian debacle," Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
"The selling of the Australian dollar is a knee-jerk reaction
to what is happening in Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar finished steady
at 87.02/12.
</P>
<P>
It was also at 1.2012 German marks, from 1.2052 Tuesday.

HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A new joint clearing facility
will be installed to speed up the processing of Hong Kong dollar
checks issued by banks in Hong Kong and presented in neighboring
Shenzhen, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said today.
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the facility, which will take effect on January 2,

facility will enhance and facilitate the economic and financial
links between the two cities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Prudent Opening of Financial Market Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Financial specialists and
policy makers said that opening of financial markets, though an
inevitable trend in the globe today, should be carried out in a
prudent manner.
</P>
<P>
In his closing remarks at the Second Conference on
International Financial Centers, an organizing official summed up
the discussions in the past two days by saying that financial
markets in developing or transitional economies should be opened
step by step in line with the economic development stage of those
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of capital market should be extremely prudent,"
warned Lu Hongjun, chairman of the International Financial Centers
Association. He pointed out that two fundamental elements led to
the recent financial crisis in Asia -- economic bubbles and
defects in financial system.
</P>
<P>
An open financial market and the free flow of capital are
desirable to create a vibrant financial center, but at the same
time, these centers should build up sound and efficient financial
system to stand the test of financial turbulence, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
He urged financial centers to establish sound and efficient
financial institution system, financial market mechanism, and
financial monitoring and supervisory framework.
</P>
<P>
A topical issue at the conference was on the Asian financial
jitters that first occurred in Thailand in July, then spilled over
to other parts of Southeast Asia, and in mid-October swept across
Northeast Asian countries like Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has thrown life ropes to
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bail out their
battered economies with multi-billion-U.S. dollar rescue programs.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference were full of confidence in the
future economic growth in Asia, said a resolution passed today at
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Financial specialists and policy markers from all over the
world presented dozens of papers at the meeting on capital flows
and financial integration in the globe, reforms of China's
financial system, Hong Kong's role as an international financial
center and others.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference was reform, transition and
consolidation of Asian financial centers to meet competition and
challenges in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the International Financial Center Association,
the World Bank and the IMF, the first such conference was held in
Shanghai, China, three and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
The organizers announced today that the third conference will
be held in New York, the United States, in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Artists Called on to Create Better Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangen, head of the
Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, told a group of artists at a China Federation of
Literary and Art Circles forum in Beijing today that artists need
to create works of art that serve the people and socialism.
</P>
<P>
Art is an important part of revolutionary development, he said,
and the first task of artists is to implement the policies of the
15th National Party Congress and to use Deng Xiaoping Theory to
create fine works of art.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that artists must follow the principle of serving the
people and socialism and letting a hundred flowers blossom and a
hundred of schools of thought contend.
</P>
<P>
He said that society must be put first in culture and the arts
and artists' work honored and artistic democracy promoted. The
masses are the key to a robust culture and artists should reflect
their heroic deeds and the reforms, opening up and moderization.
</P>
<P>
He called on artists to produce works of art that celebrate the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
in 1999, because artists are the "engineers of the human soul" and
should study hard, read more, and improve themselves.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Opposes Israel's Cruelty on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is consistent
with its policy of opposing Israel's cruelty on the Palestinians,
Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Leo Michael Toyad said today.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia will be consistent in its policy of not recognizing
Israel as long as the Palestinian conflict is not settled
amicably," he said in Parliament during Question Time, according
to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move by his government to allow the Israeli
cricket team to come to Malaysia recently did not mean that
Malaysia was beginning to soften its stand against the Tel Aviv
regime and the visit was allowed to show the Israeli government
that Malaysia opposed them based on principle and not on trivial
matters.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia still played an active role at international
level to resolve the prolonged Palestine-Israel conflict.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's support for the Palestinian cause voiced at
international forums was in accordance with the United Nations
resolution so as not to contravene the stand taken by other
pro-Palestine countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said though Malaysia supported the Palestinians in seeking a
peaceful settlement to their cause, it did not provide military
aid but helped rebuild their economy and infrastructure facilities
destroyed during the war.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Unveils Medium-Term Budget Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has unveiled
budget projections for the next three years, which has given
priorities and contingencies and spending increases to education,
social services and the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that the release of the policy by
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel Tuesday represented an important
step toward the openness of government budget policies and the
adoption of a three-year, rather a one-year budgeting cycle.
</P>
<P>
"For too long, budgets have been made behind closed doors,"
Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy statement, government spending in the
next fiscal year would rise to a projected 202.1 billion Rand
(41.5 billion U.S. Dollars) from the 186.8 billion (38.5 billion
Dollars) in the present fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue would rise 9.9 percent to 178.1 billion (36.7 billion
Dollars) from this year's 161.9 billion (33.4 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) was forecast to grow three
percent in the next fiscal year, four percent in the following
and five percent in fiscal 2000-01. GDP growth this year is
estimated at less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was put at 7.5 percent in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government would be committed to containing the deficit
within four percent of the GDP this year and further reducing it
to 3.5 percent next year and to three percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The new feature of the policy would be the introduction of a
10-billion-Rand (2.1 billion Dollars) reserve fund, which would
make room for emerging new policy priorities and ensure funds
were available to deal with unexpected disasters.
</P>
<P>
The reserve would consist of two elements -- a policy reserve
and a contingency reserve. The contingency reserve would be two
billion Rand (410 million Dollars) in the next fiscal year and
the policy reserve three billion (620 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government would spend more on fighting crime, education,
welfare and health.
</P>
<P>
Spending on crime fighting would increase by about 9.5 percent
a year, from 18.3 billion (3.8 billion Dollars) this year to 24.1
billion (4.97 billion Dollars) in 2000. The annual growth in
spending on education would be 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The plan is expected to be tabled in parliament on March 11.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Concerns Land-mines in Great Lakes Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has expressed concerns over the increasing use of
land mines in the Great Lakes region, particularly in Burundi and
the border regions of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, Michel Sidibe, UNICEF
representative in Burundi, said that "from October 1996 to
October 1997, 49 incidents of land mines were reported in
Burundi," with some 40 people killed by land mines.
</P>
<P>
Since February this year, he said, there have been many more
reports of plantings and explosions mainly in the capital city of
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNICEF Uganda report, land mines have maimed
and killed hundreds of young children and adults since the
beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, increasing numbers of women and
children have been killed and injured by mines in Kitgum district
in northern Uganda where the rebels have deliberately planted
mines to target the local civilians.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the West Nile areas of Moyo, Arua, Nebbi
and Ajumain bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo had also
been affected by land mines.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,
Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their
Destruction, or the Ottawa Treaty, is being signed by various
countries beginning from today.
</P>
<P>
Shahida Azfar, Director of UNICEF's Eastern and Southern
Africa Regional Office, was quoted as describing the signing of
the treaty as a significant move toward eradicating land mines in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the land mines kill and maim some 26,000 men,
women and children each year all over the world with women and
children constituting 30 to 40 percent of all mine casualties.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official predicted that some 27 African countries
would sign the Ottawa Treaty today and tomorrow in Ottawa,
Canada.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Blames Foreigners, Corrupt Elements for Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate tonight refused to resign from the leadership
and blamed the political crisis engulfing his government on
foreigners and corrupt elements.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to the nation, Skate said his fight to
stop the cancer of corruption in PNG had triggered the setting-up
of bribery allegations against him, the Australian Associated
Press reported today in a dispatch from Port Moresby, the
country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Although refusing to name names, Skate said he had received
information from international sources that an Australia-based
organization might be behind a conspiracy to destabilize his
government.
</P>
<P>
He said he had made a request to the Australian High Commission
in Port Moresby to investigate the organization and he would pass
on to them any information he received, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
"Do not expect me to run away like a dog, I have done no
wrong," Skate said in a prepared address. "I will not let any
foreign interest destabilize my government."
</P>
<P>
In his first public statement since returning to the country at
the weekend, Skate defied the call from the Opposition for his
resignation, saying he would not resign and promising to pursue
other allegedly corrupt deals involving senior politicians.
</P>
<P>
The Skate government is now split with his former coalition
partners, Pangu and the Peoples Progress Party, defecting to the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
Skate Sunday sacked the parties' respective leaders, former
deputy prime minister Chris Haiveta and former livestock minister
Andrew Baing.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister accused them of being behind a conspiracy to
discredit him after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired
videotapes last week showing him allegedly authorizing bribes
through Internal Affairs Minister Thomas Pelika.
</P>
<P>
Another of the tapes showed Skate bragging that he was the
godfather of Port Moresby's criminal gangs and ordering the
killing of a man. The prime minister said later he was drunk when
he made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
Both tapes were secretly filmed by a disaffected former PNG
government adviser, Australian businessman Mujo Sefa.

<HEADLINE> Work of Sino-British Group Enters New Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The mission of the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) is coming to an end, allowing the JLG's
work to enter a new phase in the next two years, said Ambassador
Wang Guisheng, China's chief representative to the group.
</P>
<P>
Wang made his remarks today at a joint news conference by chief
JLG representatives from China and Britain. The conference was
held right after the two-day 41st session of the JLG, the group's
first meeting since Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the two chief representatives held a
joint press conference. The two shared the view that the joint
press conference itself implies the proper resolution of the Hong
Kong issue, and Sino-British relations have started a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the future work of the JLG is to resolve the
remaining questions prior to Hong Kong's return and to further
implement the agreements between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transfer of power and steady transition were
accomplished in Hong Kong five months ago, he noted, and the
principles of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy have been
carried out.
</P>
<P>
The existing capitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong
remain unchanged, which has won favorable comment from the
international community, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the resolution of the Hong Kong question should
first be attributed to Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one
country, two systems" and at the same time to the concerted
efforts of the Chinese and British sides.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the two sides held discussions on
Vietnamese refugees and boat people staying in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the problem is caused by Britain which used to make
Hong Kong the primary harbor for Vietnamese refugees, and that
China regrets that the problem was not settled before July 1.
</P>
<P>
Alan Paul, chief representative for the British, said that his
country is content with the implementation of the "one country,
two systems" principle and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The next JLG session will be held in London.

world's sixth largest oil producer, will be much higher than the
government had expected in the 1997 budget, The Vanguard
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government in the budget projected an oil revenue of 243
billion Naira (one dollar equals to 22 Naira, according to the
official exchange rate), with a base price of 17 dollar per
barrel and an OPEC export quota of 1.865 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, however, projected that Nigeria's revenue from
crude oil export may stand at well over 300 billion Naira (about
13.6 billion dollars according to official rate) by the end of
the year, due to favourable prices and higher-than-quota export.
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 months, OPEC's basket of seven premium crude,
including Nigeria's bonny light have been averaged at 20 dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the newspaper said, Nigeria's actual crude oil
export is much higher than the OPEC quota, except in March, when
the export averaged 1,710,293 barrels.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted figures from the Ministry of Petroleum
Resources as showing that in January, the country's export was
about 1.94 million barrels a day without condensate, which is
outside the OPEC quota, and 2.054 million barrels a day with
condensate.
</P>
<P>
In February, the crude oil export stood at 1.92 million
barrels a day without condensate. With condensate, it was 2.4
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The figure in March was the lowest, with an export of 1.71
million barrels a day without condensate, or 1.8 million barrels
a day with condensate.
</P>
<P>
The export came to the highest in April, when the daily export
hit 2.48 million barrels without condensate, otherwise it was
2.54 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Between May and July, the daily export with condensate run
from 2.03 million barrels to 2.22 million barrels. It dipped a
little in August to 1.97 million barrels.

<HEADLINE> 39,000 Postgraduates to Join Job Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- About 51,000 postgraduate
students will complete their education at Chinese universities
next year.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 12,000 will return to their work units, which
leaves 39,000 to find jobs, the State Education Commission (SEC)
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) stipulates that under
China's policies, most postgraduates can adopt a "two-way choice,"
that is to say, students can choose their jobs and employers can
choose the students.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for postgraduate students is expected to
increase in 1998. Supply falls short of demand in most of the
majors and supply exceeds demand only in a few majors, such as
history and archeology, according to an SEC official.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the needs of Chinese colleges,
scientific research institutions and state-owned high-technology
enterprises, the SEC official said.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is dedicated to guiding postgraduates to where they are
most needed and is encouraging them to go to central and western
China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The SEC will hold talent exchange fairs on Dec. 19 in Shanghai
and Dec. 24 in Beijing to help place the students.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Warns Transition Saboteurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha vowed on Tuesday that the military government would
resist any attempt by any individual or group to derail the
transition to civil rule program toward a successful handover on
October 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
"Let me also assure you that this administration considers the
transition program and democracy as crucial to nigeria's
evolution as the true giant of Africa," Abacha said at a national
conference on national reconciliation and the political
transition program.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the National Reconciliation
Committee, was held in the capital Abuja four days ahead of the
election of the state houses of assembly due the forthcoming
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The coming election, to be monitored by some independent
foreign observers, is an important step of the transition
program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, national assembly election will begin next
April, while both governors and president will be elected in the
July-August period, with the president put in place on October 1.
</P>
<P>
According to Abacha, the conference is important to the
transition program because "we strongly believe that
reconciliation as opposed to discord, hatred, violence and war,
is fundamental to the success of the political transition program
of this administration".
</P>
<P>
He also announced that his regime has succeeded in restoring
peace, law, order ans stability to the country although it cannot
claim "there is total absence of discord".
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Abacha's appeal for national
reconciliation is part of his efforts to create a favorable
environment for next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In a series of speeches he made recently, Abacha promised to
improve the national economy and create more jobs. He also
launched the country's first long-term socio-economic development
program code named vision 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under the blueprint, Nigeria will be transformed into a
developed country by the year 2010 with per capita income
reaching 1,600 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
All this, in addition to the support of the army and his
favorable position as head of state, is expected to help Abacha
defeat other presidential candidates if he wants to do so.
</P>
<P>
There are only several months to go before the election and
Abacha has not signaled his intention to run for presidency.
Neither have the five registered political parties produced their
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Some of the parties have earlier said they either would invite
Abacha to be their presidential aspirant or have extended the
invitation.

<HEADLINE> Germany Sees Major Slowdown in Exports to Japan in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's remarkable export boom
to Japan in recent years has come to a halt in 1997, the German
federal statistics office announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data released by the Wiesbaden-based
statistics office, German exports to Japan suffered a 1.2 percent
drop in the second quarter of this year after a modest increase of
2.3 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
These represented a major turnaround in a long-term trend after
Germany saw its exports to Japan jump by 13.6 percent in 1994, 5.2
percent in 1995 and 12.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The steady expansion of Germany's exports to Japan in recent
years have combined with a virtual stagnation in Japan's exports
to Germany in the same period, which has helped Germany to reduce
its traditional trade deficits with Japan from 16.2 billion marks
(9.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994 to 12.9 billion marks (7.3
billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japan now takes in some three percent of Germany's total
exports, making it the country's second-largest export market
outside Europe, just after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Largest Outbreak of Suspected Monkeypox Reported in D.R. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 511 cases of
suspected monkeypox were identified between February 1996 and
October 1997 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, former
Zaire, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
This constitutes the "largest reported outbreak of suspected
monkeypox" ever, WHO pointed out in a press release issued here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the most recent investigation, 419 suspected cases were
identified in 78 villages in five health zones of Katako-Kombe and
Lodja. Serum has been collected from over 300 cases, while
crusted scabs and vesicular fluid have been collected from 19
cases with active disease.
</P>
<P>
Human monkeypox is a severe systemic disease clinically similar
to smallpox. It is a rare sporadic zoonosis caused by the
monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus enzootic among mammals,
including monkeys and squirrels, in the rain-forest of western and
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Clinical disease in the outbreaks after February 1996 has been
milder than that reported in outbreaks during the 1980s, WHO said,
but the person-to-person transmission has been higher, as
confirmed in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Report to be published
on December 5.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will meet South African President Nelson
Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki during her visit next
week, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to South Africa from December 12 to 14 is
part of her six-nation African tour, which is focused mainly on
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said
Albright's visit would be partly contributed to preparations for
a state visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton in the first half of
1998.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Pretoria said Tuesday that
Albright has requested meetings with Mandela, Mbeki and Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he expected the meeting with Mandela to be
a courtesy visit, while her talks with Mbeki will entail "nuts
and bolts issues."
</P>
<P>
The two countries are at loggerheads concerning South Africa's
arms sales and relations with countries like Iran, Libya and
Cuba, which were labeled by Washington as "rogue states".
</P>
<P>
The United States accused these countries of sponsoring
terrorism and was trying to isolate them internationally.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of Washington's disapproval, Pretoria insisted on
developing good relations with these countries on the ground that
they had supported the struggle against apartheid led by the
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Libya twice in October and awarded Libyan
leader Omar Muammar Gaddafi with the Order of Good Hope, South
Africa's greatest honor for foreign citizens.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Explores Cooperation Between China, Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUANZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Experts and scholars attending
an international symposium held in this eastern China port city of
Fujian Province have expressed confidence in expanding economic
and trade relations between China and Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-day "China and Southeast Asia" symposium, which
closed today, was jointly sponsored by United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO), UNESCO China
National Committee, Fujian Province and Quanzhou governments.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and overseas scholars said that -- because of
historical and geographic reasons -- economic and trade relations,
and maritime cooperation between China and Southeast Asian nations
long have existed and gradually developed into a trade network.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from the French College of Far East Studies said the
South China Sea region's role in the history of Southeast Asia is
as important as that of the Mediterranean is in the history of
western civilization.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoliang, a professor with the Institute of Southeast Asian
Studies of Xiamen University, said that as the economy of
Southeast Asian countries develops rapidly, coupled with an
expansion of a global economy, China has become one of investment
target countries for enterprise groups from Southeast Asian
countries to carry out transnational operations.
</P>
<P>
While calling for a combination of competition and mutual aid
in economic development and expanding maritime cooperation between
China and Southeast Asian nations, some Chinese experts predicted
an expansion in the long-existing friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium also discussed the role of
overseas Chinese in advancing the economy of Southeast Asia and in
promoting economic and trade exchanges between China and Southeast
Asia, as well as the impact of the handover of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Indian Researchers Recover Nylon from Old Tires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua)-- Indian researchers at the
Shriram Institute for Industrial Research here have developed a
new technology to recover nylon from used tires, Press Trust of
India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
Traditional technologies recycle rubber from worn-out tires
which is used by rubber reclaimer industries.
</P>
<P>
The waste left after rubber reclamation consists of cord waste
(magus) which comprises 15-20 percent of tire. This rubber in
which nylon is embedded is used to recover nylon. If left
untreated, it causes environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Nylon content in magus varies between 45 and 60 percent
depending on the efficiency of rubber reclamation process.
Laboratory scale tests on recycling magus to obtain nylon have
given impressive results with good economic potential.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang Says Farewell to Steelyard Scales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang banned the use of
steelyard scales in public markets on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau in the
capital city of northeastern China's Liaoning Province banned
sales and the use of steelyard scales in urban areas in a bid to
protect the interests of customers. Venders found in violation of
the regulation will be subject to fines ranging between 500-2,000
yuan (60-240 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"I no longer have to worry about vendors manipulating
steelyard scales," said a happy middle-aged female shopper buying
groceries at the May 1st Store.
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive and portable steelyard scales have long be popular
with venders in Chinese markets. However, unscrupulous vendors
have discovered numerous methods to cheat customers by
manipulating the scales.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from Shenyang's Technological
Supervision Bureau, measurements on public scales must be clearly
visible to both buyers and sellers, and the requirement is common
international practice and the vast majority of countries have
banned the use of steelyard scales.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Urged to End Nurses' Strike Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Medical
Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has urged the government
to immediately enter into dialogue with nurses to end their pay
strike which has crippled most public hospitals in the country.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory technicians and clinical officers joined the strike
on Tuesday, the fifth day of the strike and two days after the
government issued an order asking all nurses to immediately
resume work or face the sack, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The unregistered KMPDU blamed the government for mishandling
and fueling the strike "by their empty rhetoric", saying the
nurses' grievances are genuine and the government should solve
the problem through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The impression being created by the government that doctors
and paramedics can deal with the situation was false and
misleading, said a statement issued by KMPDU on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The strike by nurses automatically means that doctors are
technically on strike," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The nurses reiterated that they will go on with the
strike which started from Friday, until their demands for
minimum monthly pay of 30,000 Shillings (484 U.S. Dollars) and
better allowance are met.
</P>
<P>
The strike, reportedly backed by newly-registered opposition
party Safina and the Kenya Medical Association, simmered the
political atmosphere as it took place on the eve of the December
29 general elections.

<HEADLINE> China Commemorates Late Hong Kong Patriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese personnel in scientific
and educational circles held a meeting here today to mark the 90th
anniversary of the birth of the late Hong Kong patriot, Wong Kwan
Cheng.
</P>
<P>
This year is also the 10th anniversary of cooperation between
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the K.C. Wong Education
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Wong Kwan Cheng, a successful Hong Kong industrialist, had
concerned himself with educational and social welfare causes on
China's inland areas as well as in Hong Kong. He had donated to
more than 20 schools and institutes, including the China Welfare
Fund for the Handicapped, Soong Ching Ling Foundation and China
Cancer Research Foundation.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Wong contributed 100 million U.S. dollars to establish
the K.C. Wong Education Foundation to support inland scholars for
study and research abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, CAS and the foundation began cooperating to provide
financial assistance to researchers from colleges, universities
and research institutes for attendance at international academic
conferences and for overseas research. The foundation also
encourages overseas Chinese scholars to work in the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yongxiang, president of the academy, said at today's meeting
that CAS will continue its cooperation with the K.C. Wong
Education Foundation to carry forward Wong's patriotic spirit and
to make unremitting efforts to train more scientists and
technicians for China.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the foundation donated one million
U.S. dollars to CAS to set up a post-doctoral fund, and another
one million Hong Kong dollars (130,000 U.S. dollars) to the Purple
Mountain Observatory in Nanjing to train scientists specializing
in research on the planets.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: CHT Peace Accord Can Be Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited peace agreement
on the Chittagong Hill Tracks (CHT) tribal issues signed in
Bangladesh Tuesday is certain to be implemented because it is in
the interest of the whole country, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The historic document put an end to a bloody, guerrilla warfare
that lasted for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been praised by both the ruling party leaders
and supporters and the CHT tribal leaders and tribal people. They
share the view that the accord would help achieve all-round
development of the CHT, and Banglee and tribal people will live in
peace together and make contribution to the national economic
development.
</P>
<P>
But they also cautioned that hard and persistent efforts must
be made to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The whole country must sharpen their vigilance against all
kinds of conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the implementation of the
accord, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said right after the
agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, chief of the Parbatya Chattagram
Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) and also a signatory to the accord,
said, "It is a difficult task to sign a treaty and a much more
difficult job to implement it."
</P>
<P>
The ruling party, Awami (people's) League, will surely face
those who will try to create disturbances in opposing the accord,
some observers said.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held a
Standing Committee meeting Tuesday night, strongly criticizing the
present government for signing the accord and calling it as
"anti-national, unequal and anti-constitution agreement".
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the current political situation, the meeting
called for greater unity of all the nationalist patriotic forces
"to save the sovereignty and independence of the country". The
meeting also decided to form a review committee to examine the
legal aspects of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the BNP will likely announce tougher action programs
against the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, temporary camps of the army and other
security forces in the CHT will be closed, with only three
cantonments and three border-force garrisons remaining. This might
cause some problems such as social order and security and more
commodity smuggling along the border with India.
</P>
<P>
The government, in accordance with the agreement, will provide
50,000 taka (about 1,100 U.S. dollars) to each member of the PCJSS
who will return from India and exempt the members from outstanding
bank loans. This means that a large amount of money will be needed
for tens of thousands of tribal people. It is a heavy task for the
government to accomplish, some analysts commented.
</P>
<P>
Though there are some difficulties ahead for implementing the
agreement, the present government will surely try by every
possible means to cherish the hard-won achievements in resolving
the CHT issue.
</P>
<P>
Some changes might take place in the political situation in
this South Asian country because the opposition party and its
supporters will take tougher action programs against the
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace accord will be surely implemented because it
is in the interest of the country, observers said.

<HEADLINE> 140 Woman Die in Childbirth Daily in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 140 women die everyday or
one dies every 10 minutes during childbirth in Nigeria, bringing
the total number of such deaths to over 50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
This large number of prenatal deaths is symptomatic of the
parlous state of Nigeria's health care system, according to a
medical expert.
</P>
<P>
Also symptomatic of the declining state of the health care
system is the fact that Nigeria has one of the highest child
mortality rates in the world, said Professor Adetokunbo O. Lucas,
a consultant to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's child mortality rate is at 19 deaths in 1,000
births, higher than Cameroun, Ghana, Kenya, not to mention
developed countries like Britain and the United States, he said
during a lecture on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Describing Nigeria's health care sector as being in crisis,
Lucas said, "Nigeria's hospitals are veritable death traps;
instead of relieving pain, they intensify it; there is shortage
of drugs; equipment has broken down, no water supply; we are, as
a nation, not as healthy as we should be."
</P>
<P>
Lucas, seen by Nigerians as world-renowned medical
practitioner and scholar, attributed the poor state of the health
care system of the country to inadequate revenue allocation, and
the decline in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
To remedy the situation, he called for a re-alignment and
cooperation among the five key players in the health care sector
-- the people, the public sector, the private sector,
professionals and other partners, in addition to reasonable and
sizeable increase in the health budget.

<P>
ALMA ATA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Officials from 16 Asian
countries began a meeting here today to discuss measures to
promote mutual trust and cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart
Tokayev said that a system of dialogue and cooperation should be
established in Asia to guarantee the region's stability and
continued development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said such a system is essential because conflicts still
exist in Asia and many countries are divergent on issues such as
arms control and disarmament.
</P>

The meeting was first proposed by Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev at the 47 U.N. General Assembly in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Parliament Calls for Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese National Assembly
(NA) has urged the government to cut spending in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnam Investment Review, Vietnam's
over-spending this year is expected to be equivalent to 4.8
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, the the government must keep its over-spending within
3.5-4 percent of the GDP, Vice Chairman of the NA's Economic and
State Budget Committee Ngo Dinh Giao said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Vietnam's total revenue in 1998 is expected to
increase by only four percent but its total spending is set to
rise eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The NA deputies said that the government should spend more on
investment rather than on extravagant items.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government use foreign investment more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Nguyen Sing Hung told the NA that state
administrative expenses will be slashed by 15 percent compared

<HEADLINE> Former Chinese Vice Premier Praises China-NZ Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Huang Hua said here today that the Chinese
government has all along attached importance to its relations with
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks at a ministerial lunch held in his honor
and to mark the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Huang Hua signed on behalf of the
Chinese government the communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are gratified to see frequent exchange of visits
between leaders of the two countries and steady growth of our
economic relations and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he mentioned the visit to New Zealand in June
this year by Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the upcoming
visit by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hua also recalled the attendance by NZ Deputy Prime
Minister Winston Peters of the functions on Hong Kong's return to
China in July and his friendly remarks about the event. In
September, Peters visited China and Prime Minister Jim Bolger has
just concluded a visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that an outstanding feature of the China-New
Zealand relations is the rapid growth of economic relations as
well as marked increase of trade.
</P>
<P>
For the past six years or so, two-way trade has been growing at
an annual average of 23.8 percent and the total trade volume hit a
record high of 634 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Located in the Asia-Pacific, both China and New Zealand are
members of the APEC and ASEAN Regional Forum, thus sharing
extensive common ground in promoting regional trade and economic
cooperation and safeguarding regional security," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"Relations of long-term stability and mutually beneficial
cooperation between the two countries not only serve the common
interests of the two peoples, but also facilitate the maintenance
of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at
large," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the lunch were NZ Deputy Prime Minister
Winston Peters and Foreign Minister Don Mckinnon.

<HEADLINE> Idea of Security Zones Discussed at Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The newly formed Israeli
government committee planning for a troop redeployment in the West
Bank met for the first time here today and discussed an idea of
setting up security zones.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed November 30 by the cabinet and also
called mini-cabinet, is headed by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, with Foreign Minister David Levy, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Intrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon as
its three other members.
</P>
<P>
Sharon attended today's meeting with his own map delineating
two "essential security zones," one parallel to the Jordan River
and the other east of the 1949 armistice line.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Valley zone, according to Sharon's map, would be 20
kilometers wide and the strip east of the armistice line
overlooking the coastal plain 7 to 10 kilometers wide.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said Tuesday night that these zones are necessary to
enable the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to cope with the
inevitable establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The narrower zone along the western hill slopes of the
West Bank would protect Israel's most densely populated region,
while the wider zone spanning the Jordan River Valley would
separate the Palestinian state from Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said he is prepared to spell out in detail his
geographical, strategical and political concepts to the other 3
members of the cabinet team charged with demarcating the depth
and location of the second-stage troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Those sectors of the proposed security zones which are
populated by Palestinians would be tantamount to "islands" within
an Israeli-controlled sea, he said, adding that the IDF would
maintain total control of security within them, but the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would provide their non-Israeli
residents with schooling, health services and other civilian
needs.
</P>
<P>
The underlying idea, in Sharon's opinion, is for Israel to cede
as little territory as possible in this second troop redeployment
process while being prepared to give up that much more in the next
phase.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestinian statehood, Sharon said he is sided
with the government's opposition to the Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But as a realist, he said, it is impossible to ignore the facts
on the ground or bury one's head in the sand.
</P>
<P>
"The Oslo Accords mean Palestinian statehood...that the
Palestinian Authority has diplomatic missions in 100
countries...and its passports are accepted worldwide, including the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for today's meeting, Mordechai gathered top
defense officials and IDF brass in his Tel Aviv office
Tuesday to mull various options for the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
His plan for a troop pullback from the West bank calls
for establishing "three blocs of Palestinian-controlled regions"
focusing on Jenin and Nablus in the north and Hebron in
the south and some Jewish settlements surrounded by Palestinian
rule.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the peace movement group "Peace Now" called for
the evacuation of 25 Jewish settlements from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip and for 50 percent of the West Bank to be
handed over to the Palestinians as part of the interim
agreement before final-status talks begin.
</P>
<P>
The plan on redeployment formulated by the committee will be
handed over to the cabinet for approval, and it would take
some time for the committee to draw up the redeployment plan.

<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Judged in Bordeaux for crimes against humanity, former Vichy
official Maurice Papon affirmed that he had saved 130 Jews from
deportation to Nazi death camps. An inquiry by Liberation proved
that this is a lie. Through tracing the history of the 130 people,
it appears that Papon had never taken any initiative in writting
off their names from the list of deportation. Moreover, 120 of them
were not Jews.
</P>
<P>
-- The London conference on Nazi Gold opened Tuesday, wavering
between the role of a judge and a historian. More than 240 experts
from 40 countries responded to the British invitation to shed light
on the gold robbed by the Nazis, washed by neutral states, and
recovered by the Allies without doing justice to the victims of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro, the Minister of National
Education, Research and Technology Claude Allegre said that the
Socialist Party is entering a period of ideological transition which
will neither lead it toward a Communist Party nor toward a
conversion of Blairism (in reference to the New Labor movement of
Tony Blair). ``Lionel Jospin tries to invent a new way which passes
neither by liberalism nor by the old moons of Socialism,'' he said,
adding ``modern Socialism'' stresses ``good government'' rather than
``big government.''
</P>
<P>
-- The French judicial authorities began to investigate the
multi-billion financial loss of the public insurance group GAN as
early as the spring this year. The Minister of Justice Elisabeth
Guigou said at the National Assembly on Tuesday that ``the fight
against financial crimes is a priority for the government.''

</P>
<P>
This is the fifth commercial launch of rocket Proton.

<HEADLINE> EU's CO2 Emissions Up 1.7 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union-wide emissions
of carbon dioxide from fuel combustion in 1995 were 1.7 percent up
from the 1994 level, European Report said today.
</P>
<P>
The journal quoted EU's statistical agency, Eurostat, as saying
that EU member states disgorged a total of 3,048 million tons of
carbon dioxide in 1995 despite efforts to curb CO2 emissions.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the EU countries spewed 2,997 million tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere, compared with 3,088 million tons
recorded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau said seven of the 15 EU
member states saw a fall in 1995, but it was not enough to offset
rises totalling 69.2 million tons in the other eight member states.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the seven member states totalled 18.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The trend in Germany, the EU's largest producer of CO2
emissions, is still down, despite a 1.7-percent rise in industrial
production in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg posted the biggest fall in 1995 with an 18.7 percent
decrease due to the closure of blast furnaces in the country's
iron and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
The largest rise from 1994 to 1995 was Portugal's 7.9 percent,
although its emissions still formed some 1.6 percent of the EU
total.
</P>
<P>
In the European Union, the largest emissions rise was the 2.9
percent resulting from electricity generation. Thermal power
stations are responsible for over 30 percent of the total
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 rise of CO2 emissions was due to ever-increasing
demand for electricity, up 12.9 percent over 1990.

MAPUTO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kaire Mbuende, Executive
Secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
announced here today that the regional grouping is in need of 27
million tons of grain to eliminate the after-math brought by the
El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique News Agency quoted the visiting secretary as
saying that a part of the grain could be imported from outside
the SADC, while some be purchased from countries such as Zimbabwe
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the grain, he said, port construction in
Mozambique and South Africa should be enhanced to be facilitated
for grain transport.
</P>
<P>
He cited Beira Port and Maputo Port in Mozambique and Port
Elizabeth in South Africa as good ones for loading and oo-loading
the aided grain.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende also revealed that SADC member states have been
holding regular consultations to make common strategies for
eliminating the losses caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
"The southern African region is studying on more appropriate
measures to reduce drought damages," he said, adding that a
meeting was held last month in Botswana to discuss an
anti-drought plan for SADC countries.

<HEADLINE> Restructured Coal Enterprise on Track With Market Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The market, for the first time in history, emerged at the
barometer high-level decision-makers used to control and adjust
production. Mines under the administration, formerly nothing more
than inert coal producers, were granted more rights and allowed to
play a more active role in marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
The reform added great impetus to the enthusiasm of producers.
The Qianjiaying Mine, for example, sustained successive years of
heavy losses after entering operations in 1988. Operators
responded to the system transformation by dispatching teams to
"seek new markets", with said teams attempting to attract
customers rather than simply waiting for them to place purchase
orders.
</P>
<P>
The Majiagou Mine underwent a surprising transformation
following the reform. The mine, which recorded losses of 24
million yuan in 1996, reversed its loss-making situation and
earned profits of 2.27 million yuan for the first ten months this
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the work force in Kailuan exhibited greater
efficiency. By the end of October this year, it had transferred
some 8,282 employees to new positions, and had terminated the
employment of 5,808 temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
Four years of arduous efforts have yielded notable returns. The
administration earned profits in 1994, with only three of
Kailuan's ten mines operating in the red, compared with the eight
loss-making operations in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The administration's taxes and profits have continued to rise
in ensuing years, with profits for the January-October period this
year soaring to 62 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
One noted Chinese economist referred to an investigation of
Kailuan by noting that the ultimate reason for state enterprises
operating in the red can be summarized as the "market
inflexibility syndrome." According to the economist, "Changing all
of the habitual operational methods in place under the planned
economy has been a painful process. Nonetheless, those who have
completed restructuring ahead of their counterparts will survive
and will win out in the market economy."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kailuan Coal Mining
Administration, formerly the major loss-making enterprise in
China's coal industry, is once again earning profits following
management restructuring geared to the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Kailuan, which was established 119 years ago, is China's
largest coking coal producer. The administration operated under
the rigid planned economic system which for decades required
enterprises to engage in the "planned" formulation of everything
from production targets to building kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
The administration found itself unable to remain in step with
the changing situation accompanying the transition to a market
economy. Kailuan began operating in the red in 1986, with losses
soaring to 297 million yuan by 1990, the largest loss volume for
any enterprise in the nation's coal mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Just as many other state enterprises, Kailuan suffered what has
been called the "big enterprise syndrome" -- industrial giants
with an excessively large redundant work force. Kailuan hit a peak
employment level of 130,000 people, with some 50 percent of
employees working for subsidiary units or logistic departments.
</P>
<P>
The addition of some 50,000 retirees and over 30,000 temporary
workers to the active work force meant that the livelihood of
close to 200,000 people depended on a single nonrenewable resource
-- coal.
</P>
<P>
Kailuan's management team decided to tackle the complicated
problem and stop the downward slide by comprehensively
restructuring the administration's management system. The target
centered on letting all workers help shoulder the burden and face
the mounting pressure from the market.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Cabinet Expanded with New Partner's Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa today expanded his cabinet to 47 members in a
reshuffle which brought the Nepali Congress (NC) into the present
coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the reshuffle, cabinet portfolios were re-allocated among
the prime minister's National Democratic Party (RPP), the NC and
the Nepal Sadbhavana Party (NSP).
</P>
<P>
According to a notice issued by the King's Principal Press
Secretariat, the 47-member new cabinet also included five
independents.
</P>
<P>
The NC, which toppled the former coalition government on
October 4 with the support of the RPP's Thapa faction and decided
to enter the new government in late October, shared a total of 23
portfolios including home, information and communications
ministers while the RPP held 17 posts including the key ones of
finance, defense, foreign affairs and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The NSP was given the posts of local development and forestry
ministers.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the NC delayed its entrance mainly
due to differences with the RPP over the allocations of
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Though Thapa, who is also president of the RPP, had agreed to
take only nine cabinet posts for his party, his followers have
snatched 21 portfolios after the first cabinet expansion on
October 13. And worse still, they are reluctant to vacate their
seats.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Thapa had mulled over splitting some
ministries to create more posts to maintain a balance between the
ruling partners, which is crucial to his coalition survival.
</P>
<P>
However, the idea came under attack from administrative
experts, who said that the expanding government will only lead to
waste and ill coordination.
</P>
<P>
Adding more ministries to appease supporters is not novel in
Nepali politics. Former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba once
added five ministries for his disparate coalition partners,
swelling his cabinet to a record of 48 members.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that under agreements, leadership of the coalition
government will be shared by the NC and the RPP, and Thapa will
hand over the leadership 10 months after taking over as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Today's move is believed to get the NC ready for general
elections scheduled for 1999.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ports to Use Electronic Data Interchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 3 (Xinhua) -- All major ports in ASEAN
countries will be using the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in
their daily operations by the year 1999, Malaysian Deputy
Transport Minister Wira Mohd Ali Rustam said today.
</P>
<P>
The EDI, where data on goods handled can be communicated
between ports through computer, would speed up ship movements and
the handling of cargoes in the region, he told reporters after
opening the 23rd ASEAN Port Association (APA) meeting in Petaling
Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
He said at present only the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA)
and Malaysia's Klang Port Authority were using the EDI in their
operations.
</P>
<P>
By using the EDI, the Singapore Port could clear goods within
24 hours while Port Klang does so in 48 hours, he said, adding
"But we will improve the EDI system at Port Klang eventually to
make it as efficient as the Singapore Port."
</P>
<P>
By the middle of next year, Malaysia's Penang and Pasir Gudang
ports would also be covered by the EDI, according to the deputy
minister.
</P>
<P>
Besides Singapore and Malaysia, ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) also comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Chip Firms Face Cost, Technological Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Semiconductor
Industry Association urged its members today to work together to
meet cost and technological challenges in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
When chip firms move to produce more complicated chips, the
cost and complexity of developing new technologies escalate, the
association said in a 196-page report.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the current cost for building a new plant to
develop semiconductors ranges from one to two billion
U.S. dollars, but will double in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pace of introducing new generation of technology
has accelerated, said the report, pointing to the fact that there
are now four or five possible ways to make chips with ultra-small
features, but none of them is economical.
</P>
<P>
Since massive investments on research and development are
needed, the report urged chip makers to join hands to tackle the
increasing costs as the industry approaches the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicted other future challenges, including
getting to an even more condensed circuitry size on a silicon
wafer, moving from aluminum to copper interconnects to speed up
the electrical flow, and developing new packaging and designing
technologies.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Official Stresses Need to Maintain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean officer has
called on the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
countries to maintain the existing peace through strong military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved by continuing with peace-keeping
missions whenever the need arose, said Trust Maphosa, Deputy
Secretary for Defense who is responsible for policy and
procurement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maphosa was addressing a technical meeting to develop
peace-keeping exercises in the region and enhance military
cooperation and confidence building measures in the sub-region.
At least 11 SADC member countries were represented at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, an initiative of the South African National
Defense Forces, was held in Harare because Zimbabwe successfully
organized Exercise Blue Hungwe in Nyanga of eastern Zimbabwe
early this year.
</P>
<P>
The idea to rotate the exercise followed Zimbabwean President
Mugabe's call to make it an annual exercise rotated among nations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Maphosa said that it is important to note that as officers
from the region, they are faced with the task of examining the
strengths and weaknesses of the past peace-keeping exercises and
assisting each other in the preparation and planning of Exercise
Blue Crane.
</P>
<P>
Army brigadier Andre Bestbier, head of the South African
delegation, said the exercise will benefit all SADC countries'
armed forces as the idea of regional peace-keeping is fast
gaining support around the world.
</P>
<P>
It is vital that if anything props up in the SADC region, the
leaders have suitable peace-keepers ready for deployment.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Predicts Stronger World Economy After Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan today predicted the global economy would
come to be stronger after some Asian countries overcome their
financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with economists at the
Economic Club at New York tonight.
</P>
<P>
However Greenspan noted that a large number of Asian nations
should reshape their banking systems and open up their markets to
resume the rapid growth rates in the last years.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the ongoing Asian financial crisis, Greenspan
said that a "temporary slowdown or pause" in that region was
perhaps inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"While the adjustments may be difficult for a time, these
crises will pass," he said, stressing that "stronger individual
economies and a more robust and efficient international economic
and financial system will surely emerge in their wake."
</P>
<P>
"In most developed nations, banking systems appear reasonably
solid. Japan has been somewhat of an exception, but there have
been some positive signs there as well," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian financial crisis is likely to help remove
governmental colors in the investment system of many Asian
countries, where finance played a key role in carrying out the
state's objectives.

million U.S. dollars worth of subway equipment from the United
States and mobile telecommunications networks worth 18 million
U.S. dollars from Finland.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to increase technology and equipment imports
next year, Shanghai will make a greater effort to absorb the
imported technologies and improve the quality of its products,
said local officials, adding that they hoped the imports would
help increase the city's output value, pre-tax profits and export
volume.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 236 college graduates from
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, had been
enlisted for military service by the end of November, an increase
of 120 enlistees on the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
An official from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) recruiting
center said the city government has adopted favorable policies for
college graduates entering the military, including larger
subsidies, higher ranks and priority employment opportunities
after their enlistment period.
</P>
<P>
The chance to realize a dream of becoming a soldier and
relieving pressures accompanied with finding a job after
graduation were also factors contributing to the rising number of
college graduates opting to enlist in the military, according to
today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has recruited more than 630 college graduates from
across the country over the past 11 months and plans to raise
significantly the number during 1998.

<HEADLINE> Securities Markets Promote Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's securities markets have
expedited state enterprise reform by functioning as a channel for
fund-raising and transforming the management modes of listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 181 companies, or 35 percent of 512 key state
enterprises, have been so far listed on the nation's stock
markets, with some 50 percent of 120 trial state enterprise groups
also gaining listings.
</P>
<P>
"This serves as a clear indication that China's fledgling
securities markets have done their share in raising funds for
cash-strapped state enterprises and prompting them to introduce
management practices in line with the market economy," according
to one economist.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and last June, the markets enabled the state
sector to raise 41.5 billion yuan in funds for 285 key state- or
province-level projects, as well as 25.6 billion yuan for 165
technological renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
The markets have also promoted the efficient use of social
resources by expediting mergers and acquisitions of state
enterprises, in addition to revitalizing state ventures with cash
shortfalls, but good market potential.

LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., one of
the U.S. biggest computer makers, is launching a global consortium
with major financial companies to establish electronic banking and
commerce on internet, the company reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move, which was called the First Global Commerce
initiative, will open electronic commerce's doors for more
traditional merchants and counter an aggressive drive into the
electronic commerce arena by International Business Machines
Corp., which has launched an advertising campaign aimed at
attracting businesses into its camp, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The consortium includes Electronic Data Systems Corp. of
Dallas, Hewlett-Packard and its Verifone commerce unit, the Royal
Bank of Canada, Sumitomo Credit of Japan and the banking of major
card vendors such as Visa International and Mondex, the report
said.
</P>

According to a survey company, business over the Internet will
soar to more than 220 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2001, over

<HEADLINE> China to Push Deeper Reforms in Rural Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Collectively owned enterprises in
rural China should change their existing unitary form of
organization to gain vitality, Vice Agricultural Minister Wan
Baorui said here today.
</P>
<P>
The reform would be carried out in various forms under criteria
favorable to promoting production growth, increasing the overall
strength of the socialist state and raising the people's living
standards, Wan said at the national conference on rural industrial
development which opened today in Hefei, capital of Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
All organizational forms such as share-stock partnership, stock
cooperatives, enterprise groups, leasing and mergers should be
utilized boldly, he said, but efforts will be taken to prevent
rushing headlong into mass action or practicing a single form.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that the limited stock company is a suitable ownership
form for large- and-medium-size enterprises or enterprise groups,
while the stock cooperative is a good form for medium- and
small-size firms as it combines the advantages of public and
private ownership.
</P>
<P>
He described mixed ownership as an effective form because it
can build a polarized investment pattern and make the rural
industrial enterprises optimize resources and production elements
to keep abreast of the market economy and socialized production.
</P>
<P>
The structural reforms will proceed in an orderly way and will
be completed in the next few years, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister also outlined principles of capital
circulation, upgrading of the product mix, cooperation between
eastern and western China and small town construction.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Farmers Benefit from Mobile Classroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- In some remote towns and
villages in northeastern China's Liaoning Province, farmers could
be seen going in or out of a large van parked beside vegetable
fields.
</P>
<P>
Called a mobile classroom, the specially equipped van run by
Liaoning TV University has won favor with local farmers for its
video recorders, TV sets and a library of more than 700 videotapes.
</P>
<P>
The tapes are not for entertainment, but for learning
vegetable-raising techniques.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yancai, deputy head of Liaoning TV University, said that
his university uses the van in remote villages and towns to help
farmers learn through watching videotapes.
</P>
<P>
He said staff members in the van also answer questions from
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jie, a farmer at Sankuaishi Village, was worried about his
tomato crop, which was suffering from a disease. When the van
arrived near his fields, he learned how to overcome the disease.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that my tomato output will increase by 10 percent,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The van started its rounds in May. It contains 2,000 video
materials about farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
So far the van has gone to four cities and 20 towns and
villages where more than 4,000 farmers have used its resources.

<HEADLINE> Central China Farmers Benefit from WFP Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A World Food Program (WFP)
project, coded WFPCHA3779, has considerably improved the living and
production conditions for farmers in six counties of central
China's Hunan and Hubei provinces.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qingquan, a farmer in Huayuan County in Hunan's Xiangxi
Tujia and Miao Nationalities Autonomous Prefecture, is one of the
successful examples, according to local government sources.
</P>
<P>
Liu turned less than a hectare of arid farmland into irrigated
field in 1991, and began to reap nearly 5,000 kilograms of grain
annually. Now his family no longer worries about food, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The program provided 7,779 tons of wheat free of charge to the
prefecture during the last five years, while the province
allocated 50 million yuan to support the effort.
</P>
<P>
The project area now has six reservoirs, four pumping stations
and 3,069 kilometers of irrigation canals. The forest coverage in
the area has raised from 25.8 percent to 33.4 percent at present
and more than 9,000 hectares of farmland have been improved.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 32,000 farmers have received technical training and
nearly 90 percent of the households in the area have learned how
to use practical and new techniques.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Relief Pattern in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The pattern of the Poverty
Relief Program in southwest China, a project funded with World
Bank loans, has proved effective and is spreading to more areas
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The new pattern centers on the injection of funds into a number
of sectors in recipient areas, including agriculture, rural
industry, infrastructure, education, health care, and labor
exportation sectors. The new pattern replaces the former practice
of allocating funds to a single sector.
</P>
<P>
Rural Chinese citizens have exhibited "great enthusiasm" for
the pattern, especially for measures introduced to improve
education, health care facilities and access to potable drinking
water, according to a World Bank representative, who also expressed
gratitude for efforts the Chinese government has made to introduce
the new pattern of poverty relief nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank launched the Poverty Relief Program in southwest
China in July, 1995, and plans to provide a total of 200 million
US dollars in low-interest loans for a 20-year term for Yunnan and
Guizhou provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey revealed that most popular projects with rural
residents included projects to upgrade infrastructure, as well as
projects to improve education and health care. However,
respondents indicated that labor export and agricultural projects
offered the greatest benefits.

</P>
<P>
Deputies from ethnic minority groups accounted for some 80
percent of the total.

officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the regional government dispatched more than 3,000

<HEADLINE> 1997 to Be Hottest Year for Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- This year, 1997, is going to
set a record for Singapore as it will turn out to be the hottest
year ever since 1929 when climate records started being kept here,
the Straits Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the nation's Meteorological Service, it said that with
less than a month to go to the end of the year, this year's annual
mean temperature is likely to hit 28.2 degrees Celsius, compared
to the fact that the mean temperature was 26.8 degrees Celsius in
the previous 36 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, this year will be the first year that Singapore's
mean temperature exceeds 28 degrees Celsius, a rise of three
degrees from about 30 years ago when the average temperature was
25.2 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Service said that a lack of rain and clouds
induced by El Nino is driving temperatures up here. The El Nino
phenomenon is caused by the warming water in southern Pacific
waters. It occurs with varying strength every two to seven years,
lasts up to 18 months and affects weather patterns all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
The last time the El Nino hit Singapore was in 1994. This year,
it was said to be partly responsible for the bush fire in
Indonesia, which caused heavy haze that affected the entire
region.
</P>
<P>
A Meteorological Service spokesman was quoted as saying that
the dry weather conditions are expected to last into the first
half of the next year as El Nino will peak around April before
tapering off. A return to near normal weather conditions is
expected only in the second half of 1998, he said.

<HEADLINE> Five More Kenyans Killed in Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Five more people have been
killed by floods since Tana River in eastern Kenya burst its
banks three days ago, bringing the death toll to at least 15, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Four of them were said to be pastoralists who were swept away
by the floods when they attempted to save a camel from drowning.
</P>
<P>
Another victim, identified as Mohammed Alio Ibrahim, drowned
at Modagashe, Garissa District, the report quoted a senior
provincial administration official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 6,000 people in Tana River district had
to be evacuated for fear that they might be swept away by the
floods, District Commissioner John Litunda said Tuesday when
urging aid agencies to assist the government in providing food,
medicine and shelter for the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
North Eastern Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu was also
forced to be evacuated from his residence in Garissa Town on
Tuesday to escape the surging floods.
</P>
<P>
The Tana River, the longest river in Kenya, swelled suddenly
on Monday night and engulfed a police station, law courts,
governmental buildings and untold residents' houses. Currently
half of the Garissa town is submerged.
</P>
<P>
The town now is threatened with more disasters if the river
continues to swell at the current speed and residents there have
been asked to move to areas outside a seven-kilometer strip along
the river.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been compounded by continuous torrential
rains and the opening of flood-gates of the four dams of the
Kindaru power project.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Accelerated Sales of Consumer Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The sales volume for consumer
goods is expected to grow during the fourth quarter this year,
according to today's China Securities.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the retail sales volume to register an
annual growth of 10.7 percent and hit 708.4 billion yuan during
the next four months, up 9.7 percent on the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the likelihood of accelerated growth in
sales of consumer goods to a substantial reduction in import
tariffs on October 1, and a recent cut in bank interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Tariff reductions will promote a prosperous consumer goods
market by stimulating the export sector and will lead to lower
production costs for domestic goods," according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Lower bank interest rates are also expected to boost the
consumer goods market. The consumption index for the next three
months is expected to rise 1.85 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> California Stresses Basics in Math Teaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- How to teach math: Is it
right to make math more fun and interesting while downplaying
calculating exact answers? How much emphasis to put on the
fundamentals -- skills such as memorizing multiplication tables or
mastering formulas for finding the volume of a cone?
</P>
<P>
A bitter battle between advocates of more traditional
drill-and-practice approach, and supporters of a new program
emphasizing world problems and team solutions in California has
resulted in a first-round upshot this Monday.
</P>
<P>
The California Board of Education has endorsed a new math
standards for kindergarten through seventh grade to emphasize
correct answers and practices while discouraging the use of
calculators.
</P>
<P>
The new standards call for California's public school students
to memorize multiplication tables in third grade and master the
age-old routines of borrowing and carrying while adding and
subtracting. Long division, a skill that some educators believe is
obsolete in an age of calculators, would once again become a
staple starting in the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
Although California's 1,000 school districts with 5.5 million
school children are not required to abide by the first statewide
math standards, they will be highly influential because they will
help shape new textbooks and the statewide standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
The new standards indeed present a sharp shift from the math
methods that began taking hold in California in the mid-1980s,
which later were blamed for the State's low standing on National
assessment of Educational Progress exams. They are also blamed for
the fact that over half of the students admitted to the California
State University system are found to need remedial math classes
that cover elementary and intermediate algebra.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Cohen, a math professor at Stanford University, said that
students who reach the new standards will be far better prepared
mathematically than most of California pupils are today.
</P>
<P>
However, the debate is going on. Opponents say that the new
standards overemphasize basic skills while downplaying the need
for students to also understand math concepts and be able to use
then to solve problems that don't fit a standard formula.
</P>
<P>
Dan Fendel, a mathematician at the State University-San
Francisco, insisted that students who master the standards will be
adept at only part of mathematics -- number crunching. he opposed
the decision to ban the use of calculators on statewide tests --
even for computing square roots, saying that for anybody to take a
square root without a calculator is "the height of absurdity."
</P>
<P>
As teachers, scholars and political leaders across the country
have been closely following the debate, California's new standards
will set the national agenda on approaches to instruction.
</P>
<P>
The state board will also act on standards for the upper
grades, which is expected to arise equally contentious debate over
the content for the middle and high school grades.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Closer Sino-Mexican Business Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin called here this evening for closer business links between
China and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner given in his honor by Mexican
entrepreneurs, President Jiang said the Chinese government
attaches importance to developing economic and trade ties with
Mexico and is ready to work together with the Mexican government
and businessmen for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and Mexico are major developing countries and trade
giants in the world. Their economies are supplementary to each
other, their potentials great and the prospect bright for more
economic cooperation," Jiang told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived in this Mexican capital on Sunday night for
a state visit, urged Mexican entrepreneurs to make investments and
do business in China, and encouraged the Chinese business circles
to do the same in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Mexico established diplomatic relations in
1972, bilateral trade has grown rapidly and economic and
technological cooperation has made a "good start," Jiang said,
citing the undergoing feasibility study on bilateral cooperation
in the fields of agriculture, textile and tractor assembling.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade grew to 539 million U.S. dollars in 1996
and is expected to reach 700 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang met his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo, on Monday
to discuss bilateral ties and major international issues. The two
leaders have agreed to establish partnership of overall
cooperation well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Enhancing cooperation in trade and economy between China and
Mexico is not only in conformity with the fundamental interests of
the two peoples but also of great significance for the prosperity
and progress of Asia and Latin America," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president hoped Mexican businessmen would continue
to contribute to the promotion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the Chinese economy will sustain a growth of
8 percent or above by 2000, with its export and import totaling
400 billion dollars, which will provide the world with a potential
marketplace worth 700 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has lowered its average import tariffs to 17 percent from
23 percent since October 1 this year, Jiang said. By 2000, it will
further decrease to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is scheduled to wind up his visit on Wednesday. During
his stay here, China and Mexico signed agreements on cooperation
in consulate affairs, sports, social science and agriculture.

DHAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The standing committee of the
main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held an
emergency meeting Tuesday night strongly criticizing the

anti-constitution agreement" with the leaders of the tribals in
the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), sources from the BNP said today.

</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) today refixed the buying and
selling rates of the greenback at 62.75 rupees and 63.35 rupees
respectively from Tuesday's 61.25 rupees and 61.85 rupees.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was once exchanged at a rate of 1:63.85 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the Indian rupee fell further against the dollar Tuesday,
the Nepali rupee, which is pegged to the Indian currency at a
fixed rate of 1.6:1, has to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth time for the Nepali rupee to be devalued
since August 27, and the currency has fallen by 6.05 rupees since.
</P>
<P>
The NRB, the country's central bank, has so far floated 44.1
million dollars to prop up the currency.
</P>
<P>
But it was cautious this time of request for market
intervention by floating 8.25 million dollars, a local newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the request of the commercial banks is not a
genuine one but a speculative move to benefit from the ailing
rupee. It asked these banks to furnish necessary documents in
support of their demand.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the NRB intervened in the market without
hesitation at the request of the Federation of Foreign Exchange
Dealers Association, a body of 11 commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> World Landmine Conference Opens in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 countries are
expected to send their delegations here to attend the treaty
signing conference to ban the use, production, stockpiling and
transfer of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
Canadian External Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy told the
opening forum of the conference here today that there would be
"more opening signatures than almost any other treaty ever
negotiated."
</P>
<P>
The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway in
September, will be open for signing here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 120 countries have agreed to sign, Axworthy said at a
media briefing held after the opening forum.
</P>
<P>
"This treaty is a testament to the political will and
determination that has inspired this process from the very
beginning," said Axworthy. A year ago he asked an anti-landmine
meeting to return to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning landmines.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the minister warned, "the ban convention will be
meaningless unless we implement it -- unless we use it as point of
departure and commit ourselves once again to work together to
eliminate all anti-personnel mines."
</P>
<P>
"The challenges are clear," Axworthy said. Participating
countries must now work together to clear mine fields, provide
assistance for victims and ensure compliance with the treaty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Canada is expected to be the first to put its
signature on the treaty, followed by Norway and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to
witness the signatures.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Host UFO Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Brasilia will host the
1st World Forum of Ufology from December 7 to 14, the Rio de
Janeiro-based Periodico de Comercio daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The term ufology refers to the Unidentified Flying Object, or
popularly known as the UFO.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 specialists from the United States, Russia and Latin
America are scheduled to join the event.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the forum will be based on the conviction that
the increasing number of people who have witnessed some kind of
phenomenon related to UFOs, or that can be described as UFOs, is
enough evidence to give it official acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
In June 24, 1947, an American businessman reported he saw a
flying "saucer-shaped" object. It was the first time the world
heard about UFOs.
</P>
<P>
Since then, civil and military pilots reportedly have claimed
to have seen such "aircraft."
</P>
<P>
The date of the first UFO report, 50 years ago, will be
commemorated at the forum in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exporters for Further Devaluation of Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua)-- Indian exporters have time and
again urged the government to devaluate the country's currency
rupee for more exports.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the 30-40 percent depreciation in South-East Asian
currencies, what we have got is nothing. The so-called 5-6 percent
depreciation in the Indian rupee against the greenback is not
enough," said H.R.Malik, regional director of Council for Leather
Exports.
</P>
<P>
India's exporter community is not satisfied with the current
downslide in the rupee value vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. It wants
more depreciation. It is probable that it wants the rupee to
stabilize at the 40-41 level per U.S. dollar by the end of this
week.
</P>
<P>
"Although South-East Asian currencies have undergone
devaluation by as much as 40 percent, the Indian rupee should
settle at least at 40 rupees per U.S. dollar," said Kuldeep Singh
Chadda, western regional director of Engineering Export Promotion
Council.
</P>
<P>
The rupee came tantalizing close to 40.00 against the U.S.
dollar in early trading Tuesday but recovered on reports of the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) coming out with a package of measures
to prevent further fall of the rupee, which has slid sharply in
the past few days due to political crisis in the country and
corporate demand of U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Buy New Fighters With Most of Air Force Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy will spend 2.6 trillion lire
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) or 60 percent of the airforce budget
for 1997 to buy EFA-Eurofighter 2000, the air force chief of staff
said today.
</P>
<P>
Marlo Arpino said the purchase of the new fighters will affect
daily training and will thus drastically reduce the combat
effectiveness of the air force.
</P>
<P>
He did not say how many Eurofighters his country will buy.
</P>
<P>
To save enough money for this big purchase, some joint military
exercises have to be suspended, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Build Major Irrigation Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to build two major
irrigation facilities in North Western province to solve the
region's water supply problem, officials in the Irrigation and
Power Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is planning to build a reservoir, the biggest so
far to be constructed in the province, on the Deduru Oya River to
irrigate 6,800 hectares of rice land.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir is to be located about one kilometer up stream
from the Ridibendi Ella Dam on the same river. The project is
expected to inundate nearly 1,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the project will, once completed, facilitate
irrigation of 4,800 hectares of rice land while the second stage
will provide irrigation to another 2,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The second major project is to build a 20-kilometer-long canal
to divert the water of the Maha Oya River, which divides the
Western province and the North Western province, to the Deduru Oya
Basin in the North Western province.
</P>
<P>
As the Maha Oya River has a perennial supply of water, the
diversion will help provide year-round irrigation to the basin
region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The project costs about 600 million rupees (10 million U.S.
dollars), they added.

<P>
SANTIAGO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the
American countries gathered here today to discuss ways to achieve
steady development of the regional economies in a globalized world.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day forum, the participants from 34 countries will
analyze recent economic crises, macro economic stability, and
modernization and integration of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said the Asian markets'
crisis has exerted a smaller impact on the Americas than the
Mexican crisis in 1994 did .
</P>
<P>
Aninat said the regional resistance to an international crisis
was due to the establishment of sensible and cautious fiscal and
currency policies.
</P>
<P>
He said the average inflation rate in the region will be a
one-digit figure for 1997 and foreign currency exchanges will
remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Conclusions drawn at the forum will be analyzed at the coming
summit of the Americas which is to be held in Santiago in April,
1998.

<HEADLINE> Utility Rates in Ukraine to Go up Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers
plans to raise funds needed for constructing nuclear power plants
by increasing the utility rates next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measure, the general public, along with the
industry, agriculture and transport sectors, will have to pay 4.5
percent more for electricity from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
While the last price hike by the government occurred in August
1996, the new hike would increase the cost for 10 kilowatt-hour of
electricity to about 0.86 hryvna (about 0.46 U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Alexy Sheberstov said the extra funds from the
price increase would go into a special account to complete the
construction of the Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
The two plants are to compensate for power output lost after
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is completely shut down in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit by the price hike is likely to be average
consumers, since most of them are already behind in their utility
bills, as they have not received their salaries for several months.
</P>
<P>
Electricity and heating arrears have reportedly grown by 4.9
percent since early November and now reach 3.4 billion hryvnas
(about 1.82 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businesses Urge More Deregulation by Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- American businesses in Thailand
have urged the country to further deregulate and curb corruption
in its efforts to lure more foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand recommended that
the Thai government attracts more investments in high-tech
industries and services to regain the country's economic growth
momentum.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Tuesday and available today, the
chamber said, "Thailand, no longer able to rely on inexpensive
skilled labor as the lure for foreign investors, must change its
business climate to attract investments in the more value-added
industries."
</P>
<P>
Among the chamber's recommendations, made to protect American
businesses from Thailand's economic crisis, are scrapping the
alien business law; removing all restrictions on foreign ownership
of assets, including real estate; allowing unrestricted foreign
participation in the service sector; lifting value-added tax on
raw materials; stopping the practices of "under-the-table"
payments; relaxing regulations on visas and work permits;
simplifying customs procedures and eliminating corruption.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that lifting all discriminatory barriers to
foreign ownership of financial assets will accelerate the process
of recapitalizing not only in the service sector but also in other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recommendations, Thai Deputy Prime Minister
in Charge of Economic Matters Supachai Panitchpakdi admitted that
the Alien Business Law, imposed in 1972 to protect Thai investors,
does not promote competition and that the country has to
deregulate to comply with World Trade Organization agreements.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Alien Business Law may be replaced by other
laws giving foreigners "100 percent freedom" to do business in
Thailand.

<P>
BRASILIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will launch an
education program for peasants next year, Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso said today.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly broadcast, Cardoso said the plan will bring
training to 200,000 rural families of the country.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso hoped that with the help of the 14,000 university
teachers involved in the program, all Brazilian peasants would
learn to read and write, and be skilled in elementary arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
Only knowledge and literacy were passports for a better life,
he said. With these, peasants would have more opportunities to use
modern techniques of cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be carried out by the Ministries of Education,
Agrarian Reform and universities.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 32.77 million illiterate people in Brazil live in
rural areas, and account for 20 percent of the country's total
population.

<HEADLINE> Reno: No Independent Counsel to Probe Clinton, Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno today rejected seeking an independent counsel to investigate
telephone fund raising by President Bill Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
"I have determined there are no reasonable grounds to believe
that further investigation is warranted of allegations that the
president violated federal law by making fund-raising telephone
calls from the White House," Reno said in papers filed with a
special three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, no independent counsel needs to be appointed," Reno
said in the document.
</P>
<P>
Investigation found that Clinton made telephone calls from the
White House relating to potential fund-raising solicitations on
only three occasions, she said. These calls were made from the
private residential portion of the White House and thus were
outside the scope of the law at issue.
</P>
<P>
Reno said, the evidence that Gore may have violated (the law)
is "insufficient to warrant further investigation."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said later in the day that Reno followed the proper
process in deciding not to appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate campaign fund raising by him and Gore.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general made her decision based on a careful
review of the law and the facts and that's as it should be,"
Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Budget Deficit in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The documents showed that the government may not be able to
post a budget surplus in 1998 as it hopes but may instead incur a
4.29 billion peso (126 million U.S. dollars) shortfall.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time since 1994 that the national
government will suffer a budget shortfall, which happens when cash
expenditures exceed revenues.
</P>
<P>
The expected budget deficit for 1998 was agreed upon recently
by the government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as
part of the fiscal program for 1998.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team has just concluded its review of the country's
economic performance for the first three quarters of 1997. A
meeting between the team and the Philippines' economic officials
found that the country may suffer a deficit in 1998 due to an
expected economic slow-down.
</P>
<P>
The government originally set a budget surplus target of 13
billion pesos (492 million dollars) for 1998, but last month
revised it down to only 7 billion pesos (205 million dollars)
considering the adverse impact of a region-wide financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But economists said there's still a chance the government may
manage a budget surplus next year if its tax reform law yields a
significant sum of net revenue and if state-owned assets such as
the National Power Corp. are privatized.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been in perennial budget deficit since the
early 1970s. It managed to bring this to an end only in 1994 when
the government posted a surplus of 16.3 billion pesos (617 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government was able to sustain the surplus in the next two
years -- 11.1 billion pesos (421 million dollars) in 1995 and 6.3
billion pesos (239 million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, the government hoped to obtain seven to 13 billion
pesos in budget surplus. But the hope is shaky as the government's
cash position for the first 10 months of the year is in the red to
the tune of 2.3 billion pesos (69.7 million dollars).

On the issue of European construction, the two sides expressed

</P>

Aznar indicated he was concerned that the expansion might lead
to an extensive distribution of an EU special fund that has been

half of the fund.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that the EU should be open to all the
countries seeking for its membership in order to ward off "unfair"

against the military and the police is only a ploy to support its
political wing the National Democratic Front (NDF) in peace
negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia was quoted as saying the government is working for
the implementation of an extended ceasefire until Christmas in
order to provide a conducive atmosphere for resuming peace talks
with the NDF.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the peace talks in the Netherlands, where
many NDF leaders are living in exile, was tentatively scheduled on
December 8.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said he had been assured by NDF leader Jose Sison
over telephone last Saturday that the two hostages will be
released safely and be turned over to the house speaker.
</P>
<P>
The military and the national police have agreed to temporarily
halt operations against the NPA in northern Philippines to
facilitate the release of the two captives.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, an alliance of leftists created in late 1960s, has
fought the government for more than three decades. The NDF's
insurgency peaked during the mid-1980s with its military arm, the
NPA, boasting a membership of 25,000.
</P>
<P>
Military estimates placed the current membership of the NPA at
about 8,000. The NPA is still active in some parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will not be among the
first batch to sign the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines,
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman told a news briefing that Ukraine rejected
the signing because the destruction of anti-personnel weapons
needed a large amount of money and Ukraine could not afford the
financial burden.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not rule out a possible signing in the future.
</P>
<P>
A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in
Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are
expected to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, signatories will be required to destroy their
reserves of land mines within four years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Ukraine stopped manufacturing mines and had
suspended mine exports since 1995.

<HEADLINE> German Banks Offer Light on Nazi Gold Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's two largest commercial
banks, the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank, said today they
would help clarify allegations that they had held some of the
Jewish gold robbed by German Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in reaction to a German television
report on Monday that part of about two tons of gold German Nazis
grabbed from eastern European Jews between 1942 and 1945 had been
transferred to the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the ARD television network, the conclusion was
drawn from microfilm found in Vienna last week, which included
some photocopies of original documents and files of the Nazi
central bank, the Reichsbank.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Reichsbank had melted the robbed gold into
bullion and sold about 650 kilogrammes to the Deutsche Bank and
about 313 kilogrammes to the Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two German banks said they had no knowledge of the dealing
and would be willing to clarify the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in seeking a clarification," a Deutsche Bank
spokesman said in Frankfurt.

MADRID, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Atletico Madrid said on Tuesday
that its Brizilian midfielder Juninho would not be released for
Brazil's friendly with South Africa and the King Fahd tournament
in Saudi Arabia, according to local news reports.

front against the demands of the Brazilian squad.

<P>
As World Cup holders, Brazil were exempt from qualifying rounds
and are dependent upon friendly games for match practice.

However the King Fahd tournament is official, and so the games
played are not seen as friendlies.

Juninho had made no comment on the decision.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Continues to Weaken Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency of
rupiah continued to weaken Tuesday in the inter-bank spot market,
recording in a position of 3,815/35 against the U.S. dollar,
dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's closing position represented a decline of 100
points compared with Monday's closing of 3,715/30.
</P>
<P>
A weakening of regional (Southeast Asian) currencies appeared
to be the main factor behind the slump in the Indonesian
currency's value against the greenback, said the dealers.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency was under such pressure that its value
against the U.S. dollar slid into a position of 3.842 compared to
early trading when the market opened with the rupiah's value still
at 3,743/53 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, along with other Southeast Asian countries, has been
hit badly by the monetary crisis since early July. The value of
rupiah has dropped by more than 40 percent against the U.S. dollar
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has taken many measures to overcome
the monetary crisis. Indonesia received a long-term assistance of
23 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
at the end the October.

HAVANA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the United States today
started their 8th round of talks on immigration in Havana.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban delegation was headed by Ricardo Alarcon, president
of the National Assembly of the People's Power, and the U.S. by
Undersecretary of State John Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Alarcon told reporters that some Cubans were
still trying to go to the United States illegally, violating the
treaties signed by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. intention to broadcast a TV program from
Miami to Cuba, which did not tally with the accord on a joint
solution to the broadcasting between the two nations signed in
1987. The Cuban official described the action as provocative.
</P>
<P>
The United States is taking strict measures to prevent Cubans
from traveling there, Alarcon said, most of the Cubans who wish to
go to the United States just want to visit their relatives and not
to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Cuban and U.S. officials will analyze
migratory agreements signed by the two countries in September 1994
and May 1995.

<HEADLINE> Sinopec to Get 50 Million Dollars in Syndicated Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China Petrochemical Corp
(Sinopec) received here Tuesday international syndicated loans
involving 50 million U.S. dollars, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The money will fund technical innovations on the refining
equipment of Sinopec's subsidiaries located in coastal areas,
which are engaged in processing imported oil.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions signing the agreement on the
syndicated loans are Nippon Life Insurance Co., Sumitomo Bank and
Yamaguchi Bank.
</P>
<P>
The loans are arranged on a favorable interest rate with a
tenure of eight years and a grace period of four year. The
favorable terms are comparable to those offered by foreign banks
to State-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The successful arrangement of the loan marks a new level in the
development of cooperation between Sinopec and the international
financial community, said Wang Jiming, vice-president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Sinopec has raised 8.36 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds for a number of its petrochemical
projects, including foreign governmental and commercial loans,
export credit and international rent.

<P>
WASHINGDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Allen Johnson and Marion
Jones, the only two double gold medalists at this year's world
outdoor championships, were named as the winners of the 1997 Jesse
Owens Award.
</P>
<P>
The Owens Award is presented annually by USA Track and Field to
the United States' top male and female performers. The
announcement came on the opening day of USATF's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Jones will formally receive their awards at a
banquet Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Johnson proved himself the world's best 110-meter hurdler for
the third straight year by winning the world championship at
Athens in 12.93 seconds, the year's fastest time. He also won gold
at the 1996 Olympics and at the 1995 worlds.
</P>
<P>
He earned a second gold at Athens by running a leg on the
1,600-meter relay in a preliminary round after Michael Johnson and
Butch Reynolds were injured.
</P>
<P>
Johnson received 1,962 votes ahead of Maurice Greene, the
100-meter world champion, 1,902 points. World discus champion John
Godina was third. Three-time Owens winner Michael Johnson finished
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Jones won the 100 and long jump at the USA Championships, then
took gold at Athens in the 100 and the 400 relay. She had 1997
world-best times of 10.76 in the 100 and 21.76 in the 200, as well
as an American season best of 22 feet, 7 inches, in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
In the voting, Jones received 2,409 points, 644 more than
runner-up Jearl Miles-Clark, the 400 bronze medalist at the
worlds. Regina Jacobs, the 1,500 silver medalist at Athens, was
third.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicine Enters US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), one of the world's strictest inspectors of
foodstuff and medicinal products, has granted "entry visas" to 21
Chinese herbal medicines, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Another 19 traditional Chinese medicines are currently in the
process of applying for import permits from the FDA, said an
official with the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Medicines approved by the FDA are more likely to be accepted by
a number of other countries such as Canada, Mexico and Egypt,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The medicines allowed to enter the US market include tonics and
tablets to prevent and treat illnesses like colds, stomach-ache,
stroke and diarrhea. Some can help people's immune systems against
diseases such as cancer.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine indicates
that about 600 million US dollars worth of traditional Chinese
medicine is exported each year. More than 70 percent of this is in
the form of raw medicinal herbs rather than finished products.
</P>
<P>
Most exports of traditional Chinese medicines go to Japan,
southeast Asian countries, and Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
the lack of an international standard, poor packaging and vague
instructions are major obstacles preventing Chinese herbal
medicines entering the world market, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Cancels Yellow Cards For Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2, (Xinhua) -- FIFA, the world soccer
governing body, Tuesday ruled that players will not carry yellow
cards from the World Cup qualification into next year's finals in
France.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's World Cup organising committee made this decision at
the World Cup draw ceremony held at Marseille, which decided the
eight seeded teams.
</P>
<P>
FIFA added that amnesty will not apply to red card offenders
in the finals whether they were directly sent off the field or
for two yellows.
</P>
<P>
The organising committee will still decide on the punishment
upon the Ukrainian international Sergei Nagorniak who was charged
with doping.
</P>
<P>
The doping of the international, who has been suspended by the
Ukraine Football Federation, was found out after the October 29
match between Croatia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
FIFA meanwhile decided to award every football federation of
the 32 qualifiers 500,000 U.S. dollars and each team can get
714,000 U.S. dollars for every match.
</P>
<P>
The world soccer body conveyed the hope again that the host
France can remove all fences surrounding its 10 pitches for the
soccer premiere competition.
</P>
<P>
Of the ten venues for the competition, only Nantes' Le
Beaujoire and St Etienne's Geoffroy Guichard stadiums still have
fences and the authorities are yet to show their willingness to
wipe out the fences.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the repetition of the fan violence in the World Cup
playoff between England and Italy, the body hoped that tickets to
the fans through the unofficial channel should be strictly
controlled.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Edge Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The steady but cautious growth
of the U.S. economy is set to continue beyond the holiday shopping
season, according to a private report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a key gauge of future
economic activity, rose 0.2 percent in October, the sixth straight
monthly gain, according to The Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators rose to 104.6 last month, matching analysts'
expectations. It had 0.2 percent gain of September and edged up a
revised 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The leading index is designed to forecast economic activity six
to nine months in advance.
</P>
<P>
The index has increased for six straight months, a sign
economic growth faces no imminent halt, despite economic turmoil
in Asia that has led to volatility on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Over the six months through October, the index increased 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a private research group, said seven of
the 10 leading indicators rose in October, with the most
significant coming in the lengthening factory work week and money
supply. The most significant decline in September was in the
difference between short- and medium-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
For the holiday season sales, few economists expect sales to
fall as personal incomes continue their steady climb.

WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will
not change his original plan to visit India and Pakistan next year
despite possible changes of leadership in both countries, the
White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president often travels to countries which are undergoing
changes of leadership," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
"I'm not aware of any change in the president's plans to travel
next year."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States hopes the visit would be "fruitful
and productive from the viewpoint of engaging with the leadership
of both countries."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, India's government fell when Inder Kumar Gujral's
14-party United Front Coalition broke apart. And there will be an
election. And in Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
President Farooq Ahmed Leghari are not on good terms.
</P>
<P>
The White House has not specified the timing of the trip, that
could leave room for events in both countries to cool.

WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno Tuesday decided not to seek an independent counsel to
investigate fund-raising phone calls by President Bill Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Reno decided that there exist no reasonable
grounds under the law to warrant further investigation by an
outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Reno followed the advice of Justice Department prosecutors on
the task force investigating alleged campaign finance violations.
</P>
<P>
She turned down the recommendation of FBI Director Louis Freeh,
who had been trying to persuade her to go forward with
investigation by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Gore had admitted making more than 40 phone calls asking for
campaign donations from the White House. Clinton said he did not
remember, but had not ruled out making such calls between 1994 and
1996.

<HEADLINE> UK Business People Are Serious about Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The British business people "are
serious about China and about building a constructive and dynamic
economic partnership with China," said a senior cabinet minister
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Beckett, President of the Board of Trade, made these
remarks while she was speaking to several hundred business people
from all over Britain.
</P>
<P>
Beckett said that Britain is the largest European investor in
China and that is something for which Britain must take some
credit.
</P>
<P>
Beckett stressed, even though exports to China have gone up by
over 20 per cent this year at a time when its trade with most
other Asia Pacific markets has remained broadly static, there is
still so much more that Britain could do.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her forthcoming visit to China, Beckett said, it
is an important visit for two main reasons:
</P>
<P>
First, it will be the first high-level trade focused visit to
China since the Labor Government took office in May.
</P>
<P>
Second, it will be the first visit of this kind to China since
the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong at the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the impact of the financial tubulence in the Asia
Pacific and the way China is dealing with it, Beckett said, "China
has so far managed to weather these storms."
</P>
<P>
"It has also demonstrated its economic maturity in the way in
which it did not interfere directly in Hong Kong when the markets
there were so volatile," she added.
</P>
<P>
On China's economic reform achievements, Beckett said, China
has over the last two years confounded many economic pundits who
predicted that its levels of growth were not sustainable and that
it was bound to suffer a hard economic landing.
</P>
<P>
It is now commonly agreed, Beckett said, within the first two
decades of the next century China could well become the largest
economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
She said, "It is therefore a market which not only none of us
should ignore but to which we should pay ever closer and more
focused attention."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advises Halt of War of Words over Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- the United States on Tuesday
called on Israel and the Palestinians to stop war of words about
unilateral takeovers on the West Bank and deal with the
territory's future at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the war of words
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ad Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was neither constructive nor helpful to Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Arafat said he would declare a Palestinian state in
1999 if Israel fails to meet a May 1999 deadline for a final
agreement. And an adviser to Netanyahu reacted on Monday that the
Israeli leader would "feel free" to annex the West Bank if Arafat
unilaterally declares statehood there and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the two sides should not discuss the status of the
territories until they start so-called "final status" talks.
</P>
<P>
"None of this rhetoric is very helpful to the peace process. We
believe that issues reserved for permanent status, such as the
question of sovereignty and borders, need to be addressed in the
permanent status negotiations, which we are trying very hard to
reach," he told reporters at a regular briefing.

</P>
<P>
Butler, who heads the UNSCOM in charge of destroying Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, had originally planned to fly to
Iraq in early November on a regular two-month visit. But the
trip was canceled after Iraq on October 29 ordered to ban
Americans from the weapons inspection teams working for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi move led to the withdrawal of all staff of the
weapon inspection teams, resulting in a three-week standoff
between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Butler is expected to discuss with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz and other officials a range of issues,
including UN teams' access to sensitive sites that Iraq has
banned.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Zambian President Reshuffles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today announced a surprising reshuffle concerning
Vice-president Brigade General Godfrey Miyanda and defense
minister as well as the country's heads of armed forces.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiluba's reshuffle arrangements, which is the
first since he was reelected in 1996, Miyanda was demoted to be
education minister and former defense minister Benjamin Mwila
became energy minister.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also dismissed army commander Nobby Shimbeye from
office and ordered air force commander Ronald Shinkapwasha to
resign.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in the State House today, Chiluba
justified his decision as "necessary" to "reinforce and
rejuvenate" the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambian observers believed that the move is an
immediate consequence of the abortive military coup, which took
place on October 28 in order to overthrow the Chiluba government.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that Miyanda, Mwila, Shimbeye and Shinkapwasha
did not perform well during the four-hour coup. After the coup
was reported, Miyanda, who was then in England to attend the
summit meeting of the Commonwealth members, did not strongly
condemn the coup attempt and said something that was inconsistent
with Chiluba's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the coup's failure showed that his
government is in firm control of the country and the confidence
of domestic and foreign investors in Zambia's political stability
can not be damaged. While Miyanda said that it will take a long
time for the investors to resume investment in the poor country.
</P>
<P>
As for the army leaders, they should be blamed for the
military coup. They neither prevented it from taking place nor
played an effective role in cracking down the coupists as Major
General Solomon Mumbi did, who was the deputy army commander and
promoted to replace Shimbeye.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there are lingering rumors to the effect that the
Zambian military supported Angola's former opposition UNITA (the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) by
airlifting arms to them. This allegation has made the Chiluba
government embarrassed and deteriorated the relations between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The other reason, according to the observers here, to push
Chiluba for the shake-up is the escalating party strife. As time
has passed, the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD)
members have been struggling clandestinely for the candidature of
the presidential election in 2001 when Chiluba's second term
expires.
</P>
<P>
In the face of political impasse with the country's opposition
party and growing quarrels in the ruling MMD, Chiluba has to
choose to protect the partisan interests at the expense of some
of his disobedient colleagues in order to strengthen the party's
unity and ensure its ruling position after 2001.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba's move is characterized remarkably in two
aspects. Although most of the ministerial portfolios have been
affected in the shake-up, none of the bureaucrats have been
dismissed. On the other hand, Chiluba treated the demoted ranks
softly by giving them other junior or unimportant posts.
</P>
<P>
This kind of "soft treatment" is widely believed as a smart
tactic to prevent unexpected turmoils in the country.
</P>
<P>
In any event, Chiluba is determined by the "necessary" move to
redress the serious social and political problems encountered by
his MMD government. It will undoubtedly have meaningful impact on
the country's political progress as well as economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> NATO Members Agree on New Command Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana today claimed that the Western military alliance has agreed
on its new command structure after two major disputes were ironed
out via mutual agreements.
</P>
<P>
Solana described as "historic" the agreement which was approved
by all the 16 allies including France and Spain though both are
still outside the NATO integrated military command.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new command structure will be militarily
effective and functional and considerably streamlined.
</P>
<P>
NATO plans to reduce its regional headquarters from 65 to 20
and make regional headquarters more international by manning
regional headquarters with up to 50 percent of officers from
countries other than the host country.
</P>
<P>
"It will fully support enlargement and greater involvement by
partners and will be more cost-effective. It will also support the
European Security and Defense Identity," said Solana. He added
that the alliance will start working on the implementation of the
new command structure.
</P>
<P>
Regional disputes have been bottlenecking NATO's long-planned
internal adaptation.
</P>
<P>
Just prior to the year-end meeting of NATO defense ministers,
Greece and Turkey reached agreement on the eastern Aegean command
issue while Britain and Spain agreed on the Gibraltar command.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief hailed the agreement between Greece and Turkey
as a historic breakthrough overcoming differences that go back
almost 40 years. "It will make NATO more effective in the eastern
Aegean, a region of key strategic significance for all allies," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that the agreement between Britain and Spain has a
direct bearing on the new command structure and that Spain is
intended to re-join the integrated command structure in the very
near future.
</P>
<P>
Like France, Spain pulled out of the NATO integrated command
due to a row with Britain over Gibraltar. It has since been
demanding that the regional command headquarters be moved to
Madrid in exchange for softening its approach toward Gibraltar, a
military installation still held by the Britons.
</P>
<P>
Though France made it well known at the unofficial meeting of
NATO defense ministers at Maastricht in early October this year
that it will remain outside the NATO integrated command, it
expressed its intention at the Brussels meeting today that it
will continue to be involved in the work on the internal
adaptation of the alliance military structure.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Says Visit to Mexico Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that his visit to Mexico was a success and
achieved desired results.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Televisa, Mexico's largest television
station, Jiang said the visit, which was a success, has achieved
the objectives of deepening understanding, enhancing friendship,
looking forward to the future and developing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Mexico Monday for a four-day state visit, the
first ever made by a Chinese head of state.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Televisa that he and his Mexican counterpart,
Ernesto Zedillo, had an in-depth exchange of views and reached an
extensive consensus on bilateral relationship and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
"President Zedillo and I are old friends, and this is our fifth
meeting. Our talks have yielded positive results. Tomorrow, I will
meet people from Mexico's political and business sectors. Through
the visit, I have learned more about Mexico, the Latin American
country with a civilization of long standing," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about China's application for the membership of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Jiang said China is always ready to
join the world trade group. As an international trade
organization, the WTO should enjoy universal participation, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that without China, the world's largest developing
country and a major exporter, the WTO will be incomplete.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that China must be accepted by the WTO as a
developing country.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the president said, China is making efforts
to meet the minimum requirements set by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
As for the current financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, Jiang
said that a worldwide financial crisis is not a sudden
incident. Mexico was hit by the peso crisis in 1994-95, he added,
but the Mexican government handled the crisis properly and
solved it successfully.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China's economy has maintained a sustained and
stable growth in recent years. Financial market is emerging in
China but still at the primary stage.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong's financial market, Jiang said he is full of
confidence that it will have a bright future because it enjoys a
sound legal and management system.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, the Chinese government resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong. A stable economy on the mainland of
China would help maintain a stable financial market in Hong Kong,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Taiwan issue, Jiang stressed that Taiwan is
an integral part of the Chinese territory. The Chinese government
has always adopted a consistent policy of peaceful reunification
and one country, two systems.
</P>
<P>
He added that his eight-point-proposal on the Taiwan question
issued in 1995 remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government always welcomes the Taiwan authorities
coming back to the policy of one China and peaceful reunification,
so as to realize the reunification of the motherland through
political dialog, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Should not Hinder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran stressed today that to
reduce the emission of greenhouse gases worldwide should in no way
hinder the pace of progress of developing countries, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Various measures to curb the emission of greenhouse gases,
notably carbon dioxide, should not deprive the developing
countries of their right to development, said Iran's Vice
President and Head of the Environmental Protection Organization
Masoumeh Ebtekar.
</P>
<P>
She was leaving for Kyoto, Japan to attend a conference on
greenhouse effect and global warming.
</P>
<P>
She said the emission of greenhouse gases by developing
countries is much lower than that by developed countries, which
have been demanded and are obliged to make greater efforts in
curbing global warming caused by greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
She said that Iran, along with other developing countries,
should form a definite stance on the deadline to determine the
types of greenhouse gases that are posing threats to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the progress made by developing countries is
of great value and a key factor in protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Iran takes into account environmental factors in formulating
its development programs, and Iran exploits its resources in the
most appropriate way, Ebtekar said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Iran as a developing country would announce its
policy on the issue of greenhouse effect at the Kyoto conference.
</P>
<P>
Top environmental experts and officials from 180 countries and
regions attend the conference which started on Monday and would
last till December 11. It is the third such meeting focusing on
climatic changes and their effect on world environment.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Pays Short Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa paid a short visit to Saudi Arabia today to deliver a
letter from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to King Fahd Bin
Abdel Aziz dealing with strains in Egyptian-Qatari relations.
</P>
<P>
The letter came in reply to King Fahd's message to Mubarak
conveyed by Saudi Minister of State Abdel Aziz al-Khuwaiter
earlier today on the situation in the Arab and Gulf arenas,
particularly the growing tension between Egypt and Qatar,
according to reports by Kuwait News Agency from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
A row was kicked up between Egypt and Qatar over Qatari
charges that Egypt had plotted the 1996 coup attempt trying to
overthrow the ruler of the Gulf state, but Egypt refused the
charges and demanded an explanation. Qatar opened trial last
Wednesday of 110 people charged with the coup attempt which added
fuel to the row.
</P>
<P>
Sources believe the letter was related to mediation efforts
by Riyadh to mend fences between Cairo and Doha.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Riyadh, Moussa also met the Saudi Crown
Prince and deputy Prime Minister Prince Abdallah IBn Abdul-Aziz.
Political sources were quoted as saying that Moussa expressed his
country's points of view on the current icy Egyptian-Qatari
relations and asserted that Cairo does not want to escalate the
crisis and is keen to maintain relations with Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Doha said the Amir of Qatar Sheikh
Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani would head to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
Wednesday for a similar short visit during which he is expected
to hold talks with King Fahd on means of settling the disputes.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Warships Sent to S. Leone Water, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Three Nigerian warships are on
their way to the coast of Sierra Leone one day after the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) threatened to tighten
blockade on that country on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement today, the military junta in Freetown
said that the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG based in Liberia has
decided to send naval vessels to the territorial waters of Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Up to last night, the vessels were 70 nautical miles off the
Sierra Leonean coast, the statement said, quoted by the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone has been under economic sanctions and embargo
imposed by west African countries and the United Nations not long
after the coup ousted the civilian government of president Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the military junta has signed a peace accord and
agreed to step down by April next year, agreement has not yet
been reached as to whether the armed forces of Sierra Leone
should be disarmed, among other important issues.
</P>
<P>
As last week's talks between west African countries and the
junta on the implementation of the peace plan went in deadlock,
ECOMOG force commander Major-general Victor Malu has vowed to
increase military pressure on the junta to bring it back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG has begun a phased pullout of its troops
from Liberia where the force disarmed all warring factions and
ensured the post-war election last July.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether the soldiers back from Liberia will be
transferred to Sierra Leone to join in the enforcement of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, reacting to the news of the arrival of Nigerian
warships, a manager in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone,
described the whole thing as blackmail.
</P>
<P>
The economic community of west African states has lost its
sense of direction on the Sierra Leone peace process, he said,
adding that it is up to the people of Sierra Leone to judge the
sitution.

<P>
ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed
satisfaction over the agreement reached in Brussels on the new
structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Athens' satisfaction came from the agreement that there will be
no discussion at the present time on matters related to the
operation of NATO's new units, but only about their formation,
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
German General Klaus Naumann, head of NATO's military
committee, announced in Brussels Monday night that Greece and
Turkey, both NATO members, had reached an agreement on a
decades-old dispute concerning the use of air space over the
Aegean Sea. He also said that the agreement included all military
aspects of the alliance's new command structure.
</P>
<P>
Reppas emphasized that Greece will be able to exercise its
sovereign rights within the framework of the new structure and has
the power to safeguard them.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis today described the
agreement on NATO's new structure as "a positive development."
</P>
<P>
The agreement did not pertain to air space over the Aegean Sea,
he said in Paris, adding that his country agreed with the new
structure because it facilitated cooperation between the

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Yet to Response to Israel's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) said here today
that the Palestinians have not yet formulated their response to
Israeli Cabinet decision on a conditional troops' withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in
Jerusalem, Abbas told reporters that the PNA is waiting for
Israeli government's clear decision on the actual scope of further
pull-back.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel's four-member ministerial team, which is
authorized to draw up the requisite maps and timetable for the
implementation of the cabinet's decision, would reach a conclusion
as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet endorsed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
proposal last Sunday that Israel implement further redeployment
on condition that PNA fulfills its commitments appended to the
Hebron accord signed by two sides last January.
</P>
<P>
PNA had mixed reactions to the Israeli decision. Several
Palestinian officials charged that the plan is "a continuation of
the Israeli government's attempt to evade the agreement on further
redeployment."
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman, Marwan Kanafani said, "the decision to
redeploy is encouraging, but some of the terms mentioned cause us
to be skeptical to the (Israeli) government's sincerity in
implementing the redeployment."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat charged that the PNA
had not received any official statement from the Israeli
government and would comment only when such a statement was
received.

UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official

U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Yasushi

Mane, reportedly kidnapped by terrorists, died in Dushanbe,
capital of Tajikistan, on November 30 with wounds sustained in an

Meanwhile, the statement said, another group of two members
joined the attack and hit the radar pad, killing and wounding
Israeli soldiers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Institute Set up to Help Cyprus' EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Institute of
Cyprus, an institute aimed at helping the preparation for Cyprus'
accession to the European Union (EU), opened today.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the Nicosia-based institute, visiting EU External
Relations Commissioner Hans Van den Broek, said that the opening
of the institute comes at a crucial moment of EU-Cyprus
relations, when accession negotiations for EU membership will
shortly start.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner, who is completing today his two-day visit
to the island, said the institute will "have a unique and
strategic mission to accomplish in the coming months to
contribute to the preparation of the Cypriot society in view of
the accession to the EU."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides said that the
European Institute of Cyprus is an "achievement for all those
involved, as well as an important step for our country in its
effort to become an active member of the EU."
</P>
<P>
The newly-established institute will give the Cypriot public
an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the EU and its
development, history, institutions and functions.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide raw material for researchers,
journalists and officials about the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said Cyprus must intensify its harmonization
efforts and finalize its internal institutional and economic
preparation for accession.
</P>
<P>
"We must do whatever is in our power, to achieve, by the time
of accession, a negotiated solution to the Cyprus problem, even
if the achievement of such a solution cannot be considered as a
precondition for accession," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister said the institute will
participate in efforts to convince the Turkish Cypriots that
"the EU represents our common future."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted in 1990 its application to the EU for full
membership. The EU decided in March 1995 that it will begin
accession talks with Cyprus early next year.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit to Assess UN Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A summit of the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) will be held early next year to
assess the implementation of the UN sanctions against the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here today by SADC Executive Secretary Kaire
Mbuende who started his visit to Mozambique on Monday. But he did
not specify the venue and date of the forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
The SADC official said that the heads of state in the region
will discuss how to turn the UN resolution on sanctions against
the opposition UNITA in Angola into reality at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SADC fully supports the UN sanctions against
the UNITA imposed from November this year.
</P>
<P>
Much stricter sanctions should be imposed on the UNITA to
force it fully implement the Lusaka peace protocol signed in 1994
for final peace in Angola, Mbuende stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that political situation in Angola is the only
worrying one among SADC member states and this issue should be
resolved as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> UK Shares Keep on Rising on Wall Street, Asian Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Tuesday, with London and Frankfurt extending Monday's
gains to finish firmer while Paris closing slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
British shares had languished for most of the day before
surging ahead in late trading, with the FTSE 100 index ending 55.8
points higher at 4,977.6.
</P>
<P>
The late spurt came as the Dow reversed initial weakness to
trade 20 points up when London market closed. Meanwhile, Asian
markets' steadiness after recent turbulence also supported the
market.
</P>
<P>
But the latest Bank of England monetary policy committee
meeting, due to end on Thursday, and Friday's release of US
non-farm payroll figures, both injected a note of caution.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt lost almost all its early gains
after reaching a high of 4,111.62 to end just 4.91 points higher
at 4,072.96.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking trimmed prices and gains were capped by the
slight softening in the dollar overnight.
</P>
<P>
However, the CAC-40 index closed down 5.39 points at 2,913.09.
Dealers said that share prices drifted lower as the market
consolidated on the back of a weaker dollar following Monday's
sharp gains.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince to Head Delegation for OIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced today that Crown
Prince Hassan Ibn Talal will head a delegation to attend the
summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) due to be
held next week in Iranian capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will include Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali,
Speaker of the Senate Zeid Rifai and several cabinet ministers,
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe
told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh will leave
for Tehran Friday to participate the meeting of foreign ministers
before the summit, Mutawe said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that during the summit Jordan will take part in the
discussions of the issues of Jerusalem and Palestine, situations
in Bosnia, crisis in Afghanistan and cooperation in Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
The ties between Jordan and Iran soured during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq War for Jordan's support for Iraq. They have been
improved in recent years and the volume of bilateral trade reached
30.5 million Jordanian dinars (about 43 million U.S. dollars) last
year.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: United Nations Urged to Reinvigorate Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The time has come for
the United Nations to reinvigorate the stalled Middle East peace
process since the United States is reluctant to persuade the
Israeli Government to fulfill its obligations, the General
Assembly has been told as it began its consideration of the
question of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, Chairman of Palestinian Observer Delegation,
said the peace process had reached an impasse due to the Israeli
Government's provocative acts. On the issue of Jerusalem, Israel
was challenging the international community and rejecting the
implementation of the United Nations resolutions. The blockade of
the occupied Palestinian territories prevented entry and departure
of people, food and materials and increased unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the United States was not an effective
player. Although it was the main sponsor of the peace process, it
was reluctant to persuade the Israeli Government to fulfill its
obligations. Rather than play a vital role, the United States
hesitated, giving Israel time to confiscate more land, build more
settlements and intensify their blockade.
</P>
<P>
He said the time had come for the United Nations, which has a
history of addressing other international issues, to preserve
the peace process. For the United Nations to be effective, the
requirements for peace and security must be respected by all
member states.
</P>
<P>
Makarim Wibisono of Indonesia said it was appalling that
Israeli authorities were perpetuating policies that could only
bring disastrous consequences. The expansion of settlements in
and around Jabal Abu Ghneim was foremost among those policies
and was compounded by other "untenable actions", including the
demolition of properties, closures and the denial of residency
rights to Palestinians to live in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said such acts had dealt a serious blow to the peace
process and inflamed passions throughout the occupied
territories and around the world. The Israeli Government could
not hide behind the "flimsy pretext" of security consideration
to justify its actions against the entire people, nor could it
rationalize intimidation, repression and persecution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that peace and security were intertwined and could
not be based on the usurpation of the basic rights of the
Palestinian people. Israel must be urged to fulfill legal
commitments with consistency and fairness.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said the United Nations and its agencies had a
central role to play in alleviating the plight of the
Palestinian people and assisting in nation-building.
</P>
<P>
Abdelkader Mesdoua of Algeria said the serious impasse facing
the Middle East peace process was due primarily to the
intransigent position of the current Israeli Government. Israel had
tried to undermine the peace process by refusing to withdraw from
Palestinian territories, continuing its attempts of settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said the United Nations responsibility for
Palestine remained as long as the cause of the Palestinian people
remained.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Jassim Samhan Al-Nuatt of United Arab Emirates said
the United Nations resolutions, the Madrid and other agreements,
and efforts by states and international organizations had met
with expansion and repression carried out by Israel in the
occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community, specially the United
Nations must pressure Israel to yield to legality which required
the dismantling of settlements and the opening or reopening of
the Gaza airport and port, the freeing of all Palestinian people
and the redeployment of Israeli forces.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Sons Drop Libel Case Against Saudi Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's two sons have agreed to drop a lawsuit against six
journalists of a Saudi daily, one of the largest in the Arab world
and a sister newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency reported that Gamal Mubarak held a
"cordial" meeting senior officials of the London-based Asharq
al-Awsat and Al-Jadida on Sunday and decided to withdraw the court
case in which the six journalists have been found guilty of
libeling.
</P>
<P>
The daily, owned by the Saudi royal family, agreed to reopen
its office in Cairo which was closed during the case.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Mubarak's two sons said the
Saudis presented an apology and expressed great regret for "the
gross mistake" made by the two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached agreement "in consideration of the close
and cordial relations between the people and governments of Egypt
and Saudi Arabia," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Asharq al-Awsat ran a promotion for a forthcoming story in
Al-Jadida on allegations that Alaa and Gamal, Mubarak's two sons,
used their father's position to further business dealings. This,
the statement said, did great harm to the brothers by subjecting
them to "unfounded and untrue actions" and "biased and false
rumors."
</P>
<P>
However, the damaging story never came out. The publishers said
they destroyed all 120,000 issues of Al-Jadida hours before it hit
newsstands and later ran a full-page apology. They also fired two
of the accused journalists.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the brothers sued six journalists from the daily
and weekly, and in mid-September a Cairo court sentenced in
absentia five, including the two Saudi publishers and
editor-in-chief of Asharq Al-Awsat, to one year in prison with
hard labor for libeling.
</P>
<P>
The sixth, an Egyptian, attended the trial and got six months
in prison. The journalists appealed.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
left here today for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, hours after President
Mubarak received a message from King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
It is yet unknown whether Moussa's lightning visit has
something to do with the development of the libeling case.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Wins Bid to Host 1998 Interpol Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has won the bid to host the
International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) Conference
next year, a chance to give a face-lift of its security, the
Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based criminal police group is aimed at developing a
worldwide network to prevent and fight crimes with the joint
effort of its 188 member states.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by Interpol's Cairo office today said that
the international group approved Egypt's hosting of the event in
"appreciation of its strong stance against any criminal acts."
</P>
<P>
"It also proves the genuine stability enjoyed by Egypt despite
rare acts perpetrated by a small minority," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was awarded the opportunity after beating rivals of
Australia, South Korea and Greece which had all submitted their
offers to be the host.
</P>
<P>
The Interpol conference is to deal with a number of topics
including the organization's new strategy for the coming century,
development of fight against criminal gangs, and stepping up
confrontation with international terrorism and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time for Egypt to host meetings of the
Interpol, which was set up in Vienna, Austria, in 1923 with only
seven member states.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, stricken by a new wave of Islamic militant insurgency
and attacks this year, has launched an all-out campaign to fight
terrorism and overhaul security.

<HEADLINE> Two Cypriot Communities Urged to Cooperate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner of the
European Union (EU) for External Relations Hans Van den Broek
today urged the two communities of Cyprus to cooperate in the
issue of accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here at the end of his
visit to the island, Van den Broek said that the two communities
will have to work out a formula regarding the participation the
Turkish Cypriots in the talks, which he said can facilitate
political solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner, arriving here Monday, discussed separately
with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash ways of ensuring both communities are represented in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island, submitted in 1990 its
application for full membership to the EU, which decided in March
1995 to start talks with Cyprus early next year.
</P>
<P>
But EU's decision was rejected by Denktash, who walked out of
talks with Clerides last August and demanded the EU freeze the
plan.
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about Cyprus becoming a member of the EU, then
the benefits, the rights and the obligations should apply to both
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it will be desirable and useful for the two communities
to take advantage of the accession talks "to create more
understanding".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
took over the northern third of the island following a failed
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ties between the European Union and Turkey,
Van den Broek described it as "an important partner" of the EU.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is still premature for the EU to accept
Turkey as a member.
</P>
<P>
"But we have at the same time given the very clear intention
to work together with them, to dialogue with them to enhance the
process toward their integration into the EU," he added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- France today presented a
comprehensive military equipment package proposal to South
Africa, including favourable interest rate, long-term payment and
extensive technology exchange.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador Tristan D'Albis told a press conference on

proposal were specifically adapted to South African needs and
entailed cooperation agreements.

helicopters, South African Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils
said in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Some Western countries, including Britain, Germany and Spain
have been trying to sell packages of weapons to the South African

<HEADLINE> S. Africa in Bid to Normalize Defense Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad will go to the United States on
Wednesday to try to normalize military relations with Washington
by solving the Armscor case, the Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Armscor, South africa's state-owned arms producer, pleaded
guilty in February this year to U.S. charges of arms smuggling in
apartheid years, and paid criminal fines totaling 12.5 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States accused Armscor of selling weapons to Middle
East containing U.S. hi-technology. But Armscor denied the
charges, saying that the technology was further advanced by
itself before the sales.
</P>
<P>
The dispute became an impediment to defense cooperation
between Washington and Pretoria, both of which are eager to
expand their weapons market share in Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
A settlement was agreed on between the two sides during South
African President Nelson Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki's
visits to Washington last year.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that Armscor pleaded guilty and paid fines which
will be returned to South Africa as U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
Pahad and his delegation will hold talks with U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs, Thomas
McNamara, the South African Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the case would "pave the way for the rapid
normalization of defense trade relations between our two
countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A defense committee has been established as part of the South
Africa-U.S. Binational Commission, the statement said, and the
South African government is in the process of finalizing a
compliance program in terms of an agreement between the two
countries concerning cooperation on defense trade controls, which
was signed in Pretoria on January 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Pahad is also expected to meet senior State Department
officials to make preparations for the upcoming visit to South
Africa by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to visit South Africa from December 12
to 14 as part of her African tour.
